I would like to thank GTA for their hard work in ensuring this was a success for the partners who attended. The calibre of clients whom attended each roadshow in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong were first class and ensured true value for our investment in this roadshow.\u201d Summing up this week\u2019s roadshow, Dale added, \u201cThis roadshow is one of the many ways in which we add value and support to our supplier partners in showcasing their products to our global network.
