Travelport Merchandising Suite Why the industry needed a better solution. The growth and popularity of regional and low cost airlines meant travel agents needed easier ways to compare and book this content. Since many non-traditional airlines didn\u2019t file fares through industry or Airline Tariff Publishing Company (ATPCO) standards, travel buyers had to go to websites and other sources outside their agency point of sale. This meant more time per transaction and each different workflow impacted back-office processing. Travelport knew change was needed. Travelport connected travel agencies have told us* that to sell effectively they need to be able to remain in one booking flow, so they can compare schedules and fares from every type of airline on a single screen. Travelport Aggregated Shopping delivers. \u201cThe Travelport Merchandising Suite offers us the flexibility to connect to the GDS channel and enables us to distribute our low fares to even more travelers as we continue to expand our offering.\u201d Tony Fernandes, AirAsia Group CEO Travelport Aggregated Shopping.

Why the industry needed a better solution. Industry reports tell us revenues from airline ancillary sales were expected to reach $59.2 billion globally in 20151 - up 121% since 2010. While 60% of airline seat sales came through indirect channels, like Travelport\u2019s Travel Commerce Platform, 87% of ancillary revenues were coming from the airlines\u2019 own websites. This imbalance needed to be addressed if our customers were to maximize the revenue from every seat sold. But without a system that allowed airlines to connect, promote and manage their ancillaries, the potential to grow sales in the travel agency channel was limited. How Travelport is redefining airline growth. In a Travelport research conducted amongst travel agency owners and managers globally in 20141, 77% of respondents indicated that they would be more interested in selling Travelport connected travel agencies have told us* that being able to compare and offer unbundled ancillaries like paid seats, extra bags, Wi-Fi and lounge access in one consolidated itinerary gives customers the confidence that the agent has found them the best possible fare.

Differentiate your airline and create new revenue opportunities Why the industry needed a better solution. The traditional GDS model was proving too inflexible for airlines with multi- channel retail and marketing strategies to achieve the differentiation they needed to sell effectively through intermediaries such as travel agencies. For most carriers, this indirect distribution represented a big percentage of their revenues and Travelport predicted the industry was falling behind the sales capabilities of airlines\u2019 own websites.
