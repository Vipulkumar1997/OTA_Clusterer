A little more high class than Cititel, but obviously, more expensive. $120 vs $80.\n                                    \n                                    Have same access to great shopping facilities, good food stales around, and pretty central and not a long distance to other major shopping areas.\n                                    \n                                    Only downside is taxi may be hard to find if you want to go out late at night.  It's a good idea to grab the number of a good Blue Taxi driver who works around the area, or use UBER / Grab to catch a ride</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Joseph</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Australia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-128436\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/the-gardens-a-st-giles-signature-hotel-residences-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"The Gardens - A St Giles Signature Hotel &amp; Residences Kuala Lumpur\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/128/128436/128436_15062610310030917576.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/the-gardens-a-st-giles-signature-hotel-residences-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">The Gardens - A St Giles Signature Hotel &amp; Residences Kuala Lumpur</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.3 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 7380 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Stayed 2 nights with Gardens Residence and the stay was good. \n                                    Total 6 of us including a 4 yo child.\n                                    Ordered an extra bed which we put it at the master bedroom.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> \n                                    The bed side space is just nice to accommodate the extra bed and not really that easy to put down the extra bed. \n                                    The master bathroom was very spacious and comes with a bathtub. If anti-slip mat are provided in the bathroom, a bonus point as we requested 2 anti-slip mats at around 9pm and it took quite a long while for us to receive them.\n                                    Living room is good but the tv channels are not well received as compared to the rooms and this is something to be improved on. \n                                    The staff are friendly. \n                                    We did not ordered breakfast as the residences are connected to the Gardens Mall and Mid Valley Mall.

Was told by front desk employees this roach problems is a recurring situation but management decided not to do anything about it. Finally was given 2 rooms with connecting door and also discover baby roach and when ask the hotel employee to kill roach was told she also afraid of roach! When asked for housekeeping service was told housekeeping does not operate after midnight. Upon check out almost did not discover the extra charges that was wrongly billed.  Will  not recommend this hotel</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Carol</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, United States</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-276357\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/furama-hotel-bukit-bintang/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Furama Hotel Bukit Bintang\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/276/276357/276357_14032009240018778001.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/furama-hotel-bukit-bintang/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Furama Hotel Bukit Bintang</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.8 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 17301 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Pros: 1. room clean; 2. aircond &amp; hot shower working well; 3. wifi good &amp; very stable; 4. staff with good manner; 5.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> lounge food &amp; environment is good; 6. breakfast taste good; 7. location consider good.\n                                    \n                                    Cons: 1. Check in process very slow. Need to wait for 20 mins when there is only 1 guest in front of me. Should open more counter if you noticed that many guests are paying at the counter; 2. lounge air cond at the dining area is hot. There is only cookies available during day time. Though food is good during cocktail session, you should add 1/2 snacks during day time. 3. Though the breakfast taste really good, the selection is limited. If stay more than 2 nights, it will be quite boring with the breakfast choice. 4. There was strong cigarette smell at my room corridor on the second day. You had specifically put up a notice to state that this is non-smoking hotel, you should make sure it is being strictly adhere to. The cleaning staff is there when the cigarette smell still exist. But she act like nothing happen rather than report to the respective team to find out who smoke and take necessary action.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Chun</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-72006\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/traders-hotel-by-shangri-la/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Traders Hotel by Shangri-La\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/720/72006/72006_17052409360053182844.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/traders-hotel-by-shangri-la/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Traders Hotel by Shangri-La</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.9 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 9377 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>The 1st thing that caught our eye as we entered the room was the majestic view of the twin towers right in front of our eyes!

Tracy checked us in when we came slightly early around 12+pm. With our room nt ready til 2pm, we waited at the lobby couches w our baby. We were surprised when Tracy came to us few minutes later informing that another room is ready for us and decided to alocate it to us since we had a baby w us. We were quite certain she forgot about us since more guests were beginning to crowd the front desk. Nice touch Tracy!\n                                    \n                                    Room was nice and shower facilities n water pressure was superb! Everything was working well except for small thing like the kettle. Tv channels were reasonably clear. Room and the AC felt clean enough.\n                                    \n                                    Improvement could be made to the babycot we requested. I found old biscuit crumbs under the mattress. And the cot was not working properly even after i requested for another one. The base could not be adjusted to higher height due to faulty or missing parts. Eventually ended up not using it. You should be aware that hygiene is priority for babies. And a lower base means having to bend down more to pick up the baby. Expected much better in this aspect.\n                                    \n                                    Overall would still recommend this place and room to others and would come back again!

From hotel car park quite a distance to walk to lobby as in another building with a linked walkway but carrying heavy luggage walking the staircase up and down.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p>.hhmmm...noticed there have Valet parking lot at the basement of hotel building. 2. Upon arrival at lobby, the front desk was congested with heavy load evening check-in. ( around 3 counters), a lady receptionist who just walked out from front office alerted and very attentive by immediately open another check in counter at my line. Firstly, she unable to find my booking provided name with I.D card, according to her reservation was closed on that day. Anyhow, i gave her the Agoda confirmation email of booking number and room details. Without further delay, she check me in and brief the rest of info as the routine procedure. (wifi login, breakfast...etc) when got into the room, later only found out that my room was upgraded from Superior to Deluxe.3. Room -  Clean and quiet room with the basic facilities that meet 4-star standard plus ironing facilities and cd/dvd player. Comfort bed, good selection of international tv channel. WiFi connection a bit slow at night (barely connect) but speedy in the morning. No bathtub but shower with good water pressure, no water hose attached next to toilet bowl may be old structure of hotel building. Food - Good varieties of buffet dinner, A la carte for Combo set RM38nett not bad too, portion served just nice for a person. but was recommended the Chinese restaurant food not bad. Buffet breakfast meet the basic 3~4 star standard for Asean not Asian countries coz no Japanese or Korean in buffet line. Bakery choices are fair enough for the Western but not the cheeses and no dessert (mini tart or petit) so the finishing normally will be the fruits. Location -  easy access to KLCC, Pavilion. Nearest place to chill out - Hard Rock Cafe just next to hotel. Overall a pleasant stay in Concorde Kuala Lumpur, recommended for business or leisure in KL</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Chong</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-69246\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/the-boulevard-a-st-giles-hotel-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"The Boulevard - A St Giles Hotel Kuala Lumpur\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/692/69246/69246_15100113300036574166.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/the-boulevard-a-st-giles-hotel-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">The Boulevard - A St Giles Hotel Kuala Lumpur</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.9 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 6130 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>It was my second visit to stay at Studio.

I was having a very bad cough with thick phlegm whilst in S'pore. Upon seeing my condition, he suggested that he will offer me warm lemon honey water. I stayed there for four days and three nights with my sister. Last day when my sister went down earlier for breakfast. Your kind staff, Mr Vasu was asking my sister how is my cough. Later I went down and was impressed of his memory of remembering our names. My last day he offered me warm honey lemon water. Sad to say that breakfast at 9th floor was no standard. I preferred to go up to Executive lounge and served by your smiling, courteous staff, Mr Vasu.\n                                    \n                                    I salute his caring and mannerism.

I was in hurry because of my flight and the other thing is that  they hold 300 deposit, so they take the money they want regardless my agreement. \n                                    \n                                    Shame on the management and there hotel. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Abdulaziz</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Saudi Arabia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-47790\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/berjaya-times-square-hotel-kuala-lumpur_2/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Berjaya Times Square Hotel, Kuala Lumpur\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/477/47790/47790_17081321160055361622.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/berjaya-times-square-hotel-kuala-lumpur_2/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Berjaya Times Square Hotel, Kuala Lumpur</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.9 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 6282 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>I booked this hotel expecting 5* service and facilities.

He was not checked in until about 440pm.  We were given a room in East wing. The room facilities were below par. When I arrived past 11pm, I realised the phone was not working properly- I was too tired to walk so far away to the West Wing concierge to complain. The towels were not sufficient - only 2 bath towels!! No face towels, no towels to dry the basin tops. No hand towels. The shower head was erratic. This is worse than some of the 2* hotels I have stayed in. I feel cheated as I have paid a premium price for 5* value. I could have booked the same type of room through Agoda at less than half the price.  Last month I used this hotel and I was happy with it. I told the duty manager at check out and she told me some rooms in East wing also belong to hotel. In other words, there is no guarantee of 5*value for 5* price. That is a gamble I do not wish to take with Berjaya Hotel ever again. This is the last time I would use this hotel. There are so many other 5* hotel nearby this beautiful location.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Mei</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-407556\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/the-majestic-hotel-kuala-lumpur-autograph-collection/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Exterior\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/407556/-1/4920e7774d2e5a3d28f9f7015a26669a.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/the-majestic-hotel-kuala-lumpur-autograph-collection/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur, Autograph Collection</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.9 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 2750 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Love the place.

Although the hotel is not in the centre of the city, they have shuttle buses going to sentral-easy if you are taking the KLIA express train to and fro the hotel, to MidValley Mall which is one of the largest shopping mall in the country and Starhill which is an upmarket mall near the centre of the city. Aside from this there are few site seeing places within walking distance of the hotel. The only thing is the a la carte meals in the hotel are extremely pricy-a plate of char Kway Yeow at RM $ 60 /$70 (can't remember the exact price). However the dinner buffet at Contango is only $115 or so... hence actually I can't quite understand the huge price dfrence. I didn't opt for breakfast so can't comment on that. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Anna</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-44599\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/parkroyal-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Exterior\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/445/44599/44599_15102316250037123694.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/parkroyal-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">PARKROYAL Kuala Lumpur</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.2 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 6665 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Stayed over for a night with my family.

Front desk: these are the first person to face hotel clients yet they barely made the cut in making the best impression with their conversational skills and they generally lack in attentiveness. Went to lower end and boutique hotels that have friendlier and better front desk services. From my personal experience; we, unfortunately, had to make a very late check in on a Saturday night so I may have caused inconveniences to the front desk POC. For some reason, it took longer than usual for the person to get the booking sorted out so when we casually asked \"hey may i know why is this taking quite a while?\", the receptionist curtly replied \"I just came over to the front desk\" and continued working.\n                                    2. Breakfast: the spread is somewhat decent; the first reason why I chose this place is primarily because I have read many positive reviews on this online. I have bigger issues with how they were managing the crowd and the level of attentiveness they have as a five-star establishment. I'm not sure if this was due to a major under-staff situation or the crowd management system just weren't efficient enough to handle the massive family crowds, but there was quite a hold-up with a queue and the receptionists seemed to be ticking off a messy sheet to count for attendance and gave a lukewarm response that doesn't give us any confirmation when asked whether we are ready to be seated. When asked again, the receptionist simply just gave us a look until we heard someone from afar calling us which then motioned us with a hand gesture to usher us to a table that they have just managed to clean. They should also start providing chairs for those in need (parents with kids, elderlies, pregnant ladies) at the counter </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Sue</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-10426\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/shangri-la-hotel-kuala-lumpur_3/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Shangri-La Hotel Kuala Lumpur\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/104/10426/10426_15102011430036993574.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/shangri-la-hotel-kuala-lumpur_3/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Shangri-La Hotel Kuala Lumpur</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.9 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 3836 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>We were very satisfied with everything with the exception of the Chinese restaurant, where the service was lousy and we had to wait for a simple \"stirfried chicken dish\" for 45 minutes.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> During this waiting period, more than 12 of the personell circulated the table without doing anything not even when we asked about our food.

The bed was so comfortable!  Otherwise it's a simple room with air con, tv, very small bathroom (but all that is needed for a shower),  restaurant downstairs or food in the KLIA2 mall.  Only complaint is the shower wasn't particularly clean... don't think the wall tiles had been cleaned in a long time,  stains that I hope were just shampoo or  soap caked on. Couldn't hear any planes but the sound of people talking in the corridors all night did carry through into the room which was a bit inconsiderate and annoying. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">TERESA</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Australia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-6961\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/hilton-kuala-lumpur-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/696/6961/6961_16090811240046228378.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/hilton-kuala-lumpur-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.6 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 2634 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Its Hilton!

The room sizes are generally big with exceptions of maybe a few on the middle floors (I think).  I stayed here a number of times since January 2017 and got to experience different types of rooms and views.  The room layout provides you a great sense of privacy with a \"hallway\" style entrance the sleeping area.  The sleeping area comes complete with a movable study/dining table that you can move about and I always moved it close to the window for view and light.  There is also a chaise-lounge by the window with plush pillows that you can laze in for a nice afternoon nap. The bed is also comfortable. the pillow that provide for you is seldom great but you can call \"magic\" for a change of pillow to suit your requirements. \n                                    \n                                    The shower and toilet and area is one of THE most generous and luxurious that I have come to experience in a hotel. The star of this area would be the deep and long, white marble clad bath tub!

The room is quite spacious, working desk area and the \u201cbed room\u201d are separated by the shower room. Love it as the shower area and toilet are separated by a glass, so the toilet bowl and floor won\u2019t get wet easily when we take bath. Shampoo + shower gel, shower cap, towel and hair dryer are provided. Toothpaste and tooth brush are provided upon request. We requested for a King size bed, it is quite comfy and pillow are soft enough for us. \n                                    \n                                    Service: My washroom toilet got stuck on the 2nd day morning and I requested them to send someone up to fix it and they came up within 10mins and fix it for me.

Comforter with blood stain and on the floor (suspected the housekeeping staff injured himself during housekeeping, but he should changed a new comforter without his blood stain. He didnt take away the used towels on the floor, and only left one towel for us. \n                                    3. The safe box is not functioning.

Hotel is walking distance from a simple shopping mall. Just next to the hotel.\n                                    2. There is swimming pool and gym room at the same floor.\n                                    3. The hotel manager is kind when we raised the room problem during housekeeping to her and she immediately ask her staff to go and check our room. Plus , she let us to check out late for free after she knew that me and my baby need to wait for my husband to come back from his meeting.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">YEK</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-10417\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/sunway-resort-hotel-spa/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Sunway Resort Hotel &amp; Spa\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/104/10417/10417_14022516390018456393.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/sunway-resort-hotel-spa/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Sunway Resort Hotel &amp; Spa</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.4 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 3942 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>First thought I have when we checked in to our room, is that it's very old. And room is very small. \n                                    \n                                    We had been upgraded from premium park view room to a club room (also park view), as there is a mandatory power shut down on the day we checked in (Malaysia Boleh!).</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> So all guests were arranged to stay one night at the Hotel Pyramid next door (without having to move our luggage). But the moving here and there actually affects our sleep and made us more tired than we should be. The hotel kinda made this up by upgrading us to a Club room (without the use of the club lounge). But except the room is on a higher floor, really can't tell what's so special about the Club room. It's small. If fits 2 super single beds, and some basic furniture and that's all the space it has. Nothing to shout about and I would have preferred to continue to stay at the Hotel Pyramid (not given the option also) since it's just newly refurbished, at least the bed and toilet are new.\n                                    \n                                    Not only the furniture in the room is old, the facilities are also old, like the swimming pool. It's strange that swimming pool is almost always empty for the 3 days we were there. The quietest swimming pool we have seen so far. Could it be that there is the Sunway Lagoon next door or the pool is not attractive?\n                                    \n                                    The staff are worth giving 2 thumbs up. Service is good throughout - bell service, front door, front desk and breakfast buffet service staff. \n                                    \n                                    Buffet breakfast is good, with a wide variety of food and all look and taste pretty decent. \n                                    \n                                    Out of the 3 hotels, this is the most expensive hotels. But I felt it's really not worth the money. If you have to choose one, choose the other 2 which have been just gone through a major renovation recently. All 3 have easy access to the Sumway Pyramid shopping centre and Sunway Lagoon. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Yau</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-548821\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/wolo-bukit-bintang-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Wolo Bukit Bintang Hotel\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/548/548821/548821_17060514060053473062.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/wolo-bukit-bintang-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Wolo Bukit Bintang Hotel</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-3 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.2 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 4929 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Far Too Expensive for an Awful Room\n                                    \n                                    We stayed here after friends recommended and paid slightly more to get a room with a window.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> We were checked-in early as there were rooms available so hats off to the Front Desk team and this is their only saving grace, other than the obvious location.\n                                    \n                                    The concierge was on the 2nd or 3rd level but only 2 of the 3 lifts were working so the wait was longer than usual. There was a nice cigar room and it didnt reek of stale cigar smoke so that was good.\n                                    \n                                    We were given room 506 and was quite shocked to see the state and layout of the room. The window that was marketed and profited was a gimmicky tiny see through glass panel that barely lights up the room. In front of the window and taking up space in the room was a (about) 1m in diamater black painted pillar blocking half the window.\n                                    \n                                    The layout of the room was horrible. The bed was wall to wall so the person who sleeps inside needs to climb over the other, if s/he needs to go to the bathroom. This layout does not have much thought put into it. A traveller photo submitted by Virginia F on Tripadvisor shows this exact room.\n                                    \n                                    The toilet doors were sliding but the bottom sliders were off the tracks so they were just floating and hanging from the top. The shower screens were spotty and could have been cleaner.\n                                    \n                                    The aircon cannot be regulated.\n                                    \n                                    The coasters had stains.

There were a few stains on the towels and sheets just because they were old rather than dirty. The bathroom is a fabulous size with a double sink that my friend and I loved. Sadly, the floor had painted tiles which were now scuffed and stained and the shower room had some mould growth. \n                                    \n                                    There was a mixture of choices at breakfast time (Asian, Western, fruits, porridge etc), but if you like eggs in the morning the choice is limited. Boiled eggs as part of nasi lemak and scrambled on one of the days during 4night stay. I would have thought an egg station would be more popular than a pancake station... Breakfast staff might seat you at a table without cutlery etc, and not think anything of it. I did wonder sometimes. \n                                    \n                                    The room was a bit of a let down from the pictures, but overall it was a comfortable room, everything worked, the location is great, the pool is a good size and clean, wifi was good throughout. The front of house staff were helpful when needed and really friendly. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Kim</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, United Kingdom</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-10424\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/grand-millennium-kuala-lumpur-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Grand Millennium Kuala Lumpur Hotel\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/104/10424/10424_15061809140029853096.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/grand-millennium-kuala-lumpur-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Grand Millennium Kuala Lumpur Hotel</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.3 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 4853 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Last minute decision to drive to KL.

are rarely critical when it comes to hotel service but this particular hotel just had too many negative issues.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p>\n                                    Firstly, when we checked into the hotel at about 230pm we were told by the front office staff that we could only have 2 single beds rather than a double bed. I had already booked for a double room well in advance but was told that if we wanted a double bed we will have to wait for another hour or two.  I have never experienced such a problem before with other hotels and i couldn't afford my wife to wait because she was pregnant and feeling tired. We eventually decided to take the 2 single beds.\n                                    \n                                    Later that night around 1120pm i called room service to order 2 extra bottles of mineral water and it took 3 more additional calls to remind them before the bottles arrived after midnight at 1220am. Me and my wife were already so tired but were kept waiting for the bottles of water.\n                                    \n                                    The next morning we decided to order breakfast through room service. Fortunately there was not much delay for the food to arrive. After our meal we left the tray of plates and cutlery outside our room door and left the hotel. We returned in the evening to find the tray still there. At night when we left the hotel again for dinner we decided to inform the front office staff that the tray had not been collected. The staff said they will call housekeeping to clear it immediately. We were shocked when we returned late at night around 1230am to find the tray still outside our room. The tray was eventually cleared only the next morning.\n                                    \n                                    Another scary incident was when i was alone taking a shower at night when my wife went out with her sister. The lights in the entire room switched off while i was in the shower. It was so pitch dark and i could barely make my way to the front door just wrapped in my towel. Upon opening the front door the lights came back on. I thought it was a power trip but it happened again around 5 minutes later in the shower and after opening the main door</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Sudhir</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Singapore</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-186028\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/sunway-pyramid-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Sunway Pyramid Hotel\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/186/186028/186028_14071115480020239325.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/sunway-pyramid-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Sunway Pyramid Hotel</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-45 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 5757 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>We stayed at Sunway Pyramid Hotel more than 3 years ago and had a pleasant time back then, that's why we thought of going back.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> However, our experience this time is far from pleasant, even though the hotel has had recent renovation. \n                                    Apart from the great location and the lovely staff at the Buffet Breakfast, we were disappointed because of:\n                                    We booked 2 adjoining rooms for 3 nights as 4 of us traveling together. The aircon in our initial Room 10161 &amp; 10162 had a malfunction as temp. couldn't be adjusted, but the guy who was sent to fix it on our first evening was so unprofessional - Not only he set the temperature to 27C all night, he made a remark that he'd fix it at Check-out, which was rude &amp; inconsiderate, as this was our first night &amp; it's not ok to cook us in a 27C hot room! Despite our complain that same evening, none of the staff offered us another room with working aircon, till the next day when another staff came to see himself that our room was no different from a sauna! </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Shinta</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Australia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-443122\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/royale-chulan-damansara/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Royale Chulan Damansara\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/443/443122/443122_15070709430031779934.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/royale-chulan-damansara/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Royale Chulan Damansara</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.1 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 3602 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Rude female receptionist on night shift when check in with family.

Her male co-worker was nice and gave us the extra room card. The previous rude female receptionist was beside him so when we walked away she probably thought we couldnt hear but she accused us and complained to her co-worker and muttered negative things about us. And she accused that we were like thieves because she thought we asked for 3rd room card. But we did not turn back because she was already rude before when we checked in when we didnt give her any attitude. Maybe she has personal issues in life that happened but she took out on her customers. Who else has she been rude to? Im sure we were not the only one. She said she would give 2 room cards but only gave one so when we found out, went down and asked her co worker for the room card, he gave but she was pissed off like we were thieves n other accusations as if we were asking for 3 room cards. The girl had attitude problems. Her nametag did not say she was a trainee, only her name so i assumed she is working there as a proper receptionist, not a trainee. My family and I have stayed at this hotel for years and we have always a good impression on this hotel, and we even recommended our friends. However, based on this experience and other issues we had in this hotel, it has led a sour taste in our mouth.\n                                    I will not highlight the other issues because it is certainly the management problems. If the management is effective and good, then the staff will be trained good.  But i will highlight this because it was dangerous: on the early morning that my family and i (females) were checking out, getting reading to go out, waaaay before the check out time, we have unlocked the door. The housekeeping did not knock at all and HE opened the door quietly to check if we have checked out. It was a good thing the door was bolted because my </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Angela</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-686956\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/le-apple-boutique-hotel-klcc/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Le Apple Boutique Hotel KLCC\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/686/686956/686956_15062612130030941024.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/le-apple-boutique-hotel-klcc/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Le Apple Boutique Hotel KLCC</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-3 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 3629 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>We picked this hotel because it is the nearest to KLCC train station, a mere 5 min (or less) through the mall next door.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> Excellent location.\n                                    \n                                    This hotel also received great review and rating. We felt confident with the brand. \n                                    \n                                    But. The impression changed as soon as we arrived.\n                                    1. Car park is extreamly narrow and parking bay is tiny\n                                    2. No lift from car park to hotel foyer. Luckily it was just few tens flights of stairs. But surely inconvenient if you carry a large suitcase\n                                    3. Ground floor is public area. Another lift ride to level 1 to reception\n                                    4. Reception floor is extreamly DARK! It might be part of the design to impress guests but it surely not us and the few others guests who frowned when they step out the lift\n                                    5. The only slightly well lit area is at the reception counter and lift landing area at guest room floors\n                                    6. Corridor leading from lift to room is VERY, VERY DARK! \n                                    7. Room is dusty at certain area. Areas which are visible to naked eyes i.e. counter top, window panel\n                                    8. Room is brighter than corridoor and reception but still not well lit like other hotel/hostel we've stayed before\n                                    \n                                    In summary. We felt uncomfortable. We did not appreciate the design and the overall feeling this hotel trying to create -- DARK! We were disappointed with our choice and decided to check out despite paying 2 nights (with no refund). \n                                     \n                                    It is a pity because the hotel had the best location. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Cheng</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-7930\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/hotel-royal-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Hotel Royal Kuala Lumpur\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/793/7930/7930_16092113010046720541.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/hotel-royal-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Hotel Royal Kuala Lumpur</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.4 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 6238 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>1.

including shopping around Sunway Pyramid and entering Sunway Lagoon Theme Park.\n                                    Despite being surrounded by the happening Sunway Pyramid and Sunway Lagoon Theme Park, it is very quiet at night and good sleep/rest is guaranteed.\n                                    On top of that, it is also very convenient for travelers who intended to travel around Petaling Jaya/Subang Jaya areas, by driving/taxi/ubers.\n                                    \n                                    Staffs are very responsive and helpful to our requests.\n                                    Facilities wise, there is a swimming pool at level 8. Despite it is an infinity style pool, the view was not one of the stunning one. Thus, we have skipped it. We also noted there is a gym at the same level.\n                                    Breakfast buffets provides a good variety of food while the taste are good as well. (Try their Nasi Lemak and rendang chicken, they are definitely one of the best)\n                                    Price wise, it is slightly cheaper than Sunway Pyramid Hotel but definitely not a budget one. Would suggest the management actually further revised down the price in order to attract more travelers. \n                                    \n                                    Overall, it was a pleasant stay at Sunway Clio Hotel for us. Would recommend to friends who have budget for the accommodations. Travelers who are unable to get a room at Sunway Pyramid Hotel can also consider this.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Giin</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Singapore</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-774007\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/fraser-residence-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Fraser Residence Kuala Lumpur\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/774/774007/774007_15082410120034884312.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/fraser-residence-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Fraser Residence Kuala Lumpur</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.4 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 1782 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>I can not relay just how disappointing our stay at this hotel was.

Check in at 3.30pm, we had booked the more expensive 1 bed exec room. I had emailed 2 days prior requesting a high floor with a view. They only had a room on the 7th floor, which was basically an office room, with a great big glass walled room inside. It felt like an office space and totally unacceptable for a toddler. They told us the next day we could move to a high floor, but we could not stay in that room. Returning to the desk, we were told another room was being cleaned and we could move there after an hour.\n                                    2. We had a late lunch in their cafe on the 5th to wait for our room. The food was terrible, poor quality and one dish took 45 mins to come. It was cold anyway (Nasi Lamak) which it shouldnt have been. Terrible.\n                                    3. Returning 2 hrs later we were told our room still not ready, please 'rest' in our current room.\n                                    We had a toddler that we wanted to settle down and we decided to go to the pool as we were just wasting time. Finally we got into the new room, on the same floor, overlooked a graveyard and by other buildings, so was very dark, with a very dusty/dirty floor.\n                                    4. We tried to move the next morning, told we could and packed up the room. WHen I phoned to double check was told we needed to wait till after 10am as there was only smoking rooms. Infuriated, we cancelled the move as we had plans with our toddler and werent prepared to wait 2 hours.\n                                    5. We had terrible WIFI, after this for 2 days I rang to question, long story short there was no router in our room. After a further 2 phone calls and 24 hrs later to service, the last one ending up aggressive, a router was put in our room. \n                                    6. As the room was dirty we called on two separate occasions for the floor to be cleaned. I think it was done just once on a very basic level, for</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Keith</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, United Kingdom</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-63306\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/pacific-regency-hotel-suites/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Pacific Regency Hotel Suites\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/633/63306/63306_14041110070019044558.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/pacific-regency-hotel-suites/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Pacific Regency Hotel Suites</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 10064 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>pros\n                                    1. The facilities are quite good.\n                                    \n                                    Cons\n                                    1. The check in time was too long. I visited this hotel during Hari Raya, while checking in, the staff asked me to wait and he will call me by name, I did expect the crowd, so,I was willing to wait.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> After waiting for 20 minutes, I approached the staff and he answered me he had a lots of rooms need to check in, but he registered my room for me less than 5 minutes after I approached him.\n                                    2. The location is far from all the train services even the grabcar service is also hard to get. the only advantage in booking this hotel is near KL tower and the view is good. \n                                    3. When I requested to make up the room, I realised the tissue paper was finished and didnt  replenish, so, i called up the counter, they told me  the tissue paper was running out, and they replace me two roll toilet papers instead. Also, the used towel was not changed to the new towel. \n                                    4. The restaurant was closed during the Hari Raya. I feel this is unacceptable. Due to the location, it is hard for us to look for the food and  there is no any food available. \n                                    5. The television connection and hair dryer are very lousy. \n                                    6. The parking fee is expensive and too many lifts to use in different level, is too confusing. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n

Quiet and peaceful stay. It's a quick gateaway for the city folks. Bicycle rides are available for the guests (if you're lucky enough to get one).</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> It's fun to tour around the hotel and enjoy the sea breeze.\n                                    2. Good enough resort and room concept. \n                                    3. Check-In/Out time, buggy service experiences were decent.\n                                    \n                                    Cons:\n                                    1. Major disappointment for the breakfast and dinner. Cleanliness is awful. There are ALOT of flies at the dining area. Spent half of my time chasing away the flies away from my food. It kinds of spoil my mood to enjoy my meal there. Choices for buffet breakfast and dinner are also very limited and overpriced. For a buffet dinner, they only serve ice water and nothing else.\n                                    \n                                    2. As for the room, please expect some friendly visitors during your stay such as lizards and bugs. That was expected however the major disappointment would be the air conditioning which was not cold enough and you could not control the temperature. Spent most of my time in the shower to cool myself down. The room can be pretty dusty with some dead bugs laying around.\n                                    \n                                    3. For the facilities, I have only tried the bicycle rides. I did enjoy the rides but it was really difficult to get a bicycle during the peak time. Most of the bicycles which I managed to get were in the verge of breaking down.\n                                    \n                                    Summary:\n                                    This would be my first and last trip to this hotel. The poor maintenance and cleanliness of this place/facilities are the turn offs for me. It's such a waste as this place has a really cool concept but the maintenance are not up to par with what is stated for a 4/5 star hotel.  </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Karen</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-65162\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/cyberview-resort-spa/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Cyberview Resort &amp; Spa\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/651/65162/65162_15091509210036000092.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/cyberview-resort-spa/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Cyberview Resort &amp; Spa</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 1485 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>The location is ideal.

The funniest thing is the spa, jacuzzi and sauna room don't provide any towel.  We had to use the 2 swim towels for either spa or swimming pool.  Only 2 swim towels provided in the room we stayed but you have to bring it to the pool and bring back to the hotel room after each use. My suggestion is, better don't provide any spa at all, shower rooms only have 2, you have to line up to take a bath. Please raise the hotel tariff to buy more towels, it's such a bad experience.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">wai</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-5833\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/philea-mines-beach-resort/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Philea Mines Beach Resort\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/583/5833/5833_14031109330018634586.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/philea-mines-beach-resort/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Philea Mines Beach Resort</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">6.8 Good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 1843 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>First the front office people not helpful at all.

Double standard here. \n                                    The toilet flushing system could not stop after we flushed it and thus cause the water running the whole night.\n                                    There were not much varieties on the breakfast spread and coffee doesnt taste like coffee at all. Its pathetic to serve that kind of coffee for a good rating hotel. \n                                    \n                                    Would avoid this hotel the next time. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Noorwati</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Singapore</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-564731\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/seri-bayu-resort-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Seri Bayu Resort Hotel\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/564/564731/564731_14012215540018125834.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/seri-bayu-resort-hotel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Seri Bayu Resort Hotel</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-3 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">6.8 Good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 418 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Seri Bayu is fine in terms of accommodation. We were quite happy with the studio we had. It was large, comfortable, and very cool with two fans and air-conditioning.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> The bathroom was large with decent water pressure and the hot water supply did not run out at night. The room doors do need some WD40 very badly though, the creaking was loud and we could hear that the door of the neighbouring unit had the same problem. Btw, at prices starting at RM179 all-in on Agoda and RM190 via the hotel website, it would be good to have some basic cable TV channels - even INJOI would suffice. Local channels do get a bit tedious after a while. Lastly, while there is a children's pool on the premises, the hotel is NOT beach front, nor does it have any views of the beach. It's a 2-storey walk-up that actually faces a local housing estate. In order to access the beach, guests need to walk out of the compound, and go round the corner. It's just a 2-minute walk, however - so if you're ok with that, then you have nothing to worry about. :)     </p>\n                                                        </div>\n

it was a serves apartment, but definitely not Airbnb, however, I got \"Airbnb\" room via booking at Agooda.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> When we arrived, the receptionist took us to a mail box to collect the key, instead passing the key to me at reception. 2, Booked a suite with 2 rooms &amp; 2 washrooms, actually we only got 1.5 washroom. No shower at 1 washroom, we 4 have to line up for shower. 3, 2 rooms but one room's door was a glass automatic slide door, it didn't function at all, one of us was locked up because the slide glass door suddenly shut down &amp; didn't work. We called the receptionist for help, he only said we have to contact the landlord, he couldn't send anyone to help. Finally we have to turn off the main electricity power box, and opened the glass door to let our friend get out of the room. 4. I have paid extra for an additional bed, but end up we only got a 3-folded matt, not a folded bed. 5, Clean bed sheet is very important for every guest, but our bed sheet was dirty &amp; with many stains. The location is convenience and the swimming pool with nice view, but I rather to have a proper clean hotel room instead of this. We were so disappointed for this room &amp; we even cant complained because reception said they don't in charge of room cleaning &amp; anything. Never never will come back again..........</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Ken</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Hong Kong</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-186016\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/simms-boutique-hotel-bukit-bintang/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Simms Boutique Hotel Bukit Bintang\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/186/186016/186016_14052316040019550944.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/simms-boutique-hotel-bukit-bintang/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Simms Boutique Hotel Bukit Bintang</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-2 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">6.9 Good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 3425 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>When I made the booking, everything went smooth until the night my wife and kid arrived at the hotel.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> The night my wife and kid arrived at the hotel, they said the room was fully occupied.

It is really ridiculous!! And then they tried to transfer to the second hotel, the registration went good, but then the horror came from the room, my kid crying because she wasn't able to sleep due to the dirty room and minimum of light, it will obviously make any kid under 4 yo will scare to sleep.\n                                    \n                                    And these not only happened to my wife and kid, there was another guests that had same problem as ours.

Shower gels and towel are provided, and the usage of in-house slippers make the rooms cleanliness easier to manage. There's a need for padlock usage (available at $10 per lock) since shoes and luggage compartments require them. Otherwise bring your own. Breakfast is basic, but good enough for no frill traveler. The lounge is nice and kinda boutique style. All in all, a very nice concept hotel. I'll definitely be back for my next visit to KL.\n                                    \n                                    A special kudos to the hotel staff named Francis (from Ghana). The hotel seem hugely understaffed with just a guy practically everywhere, 24 hours taking care of everything! He didn't seem to even get back home during my 2 nights stay. I see him in the wee morning, at the front desk processing check ins, at the lounge preparing and cleaning stuff, in between the rooms cleaning up after folks checked out, and even late night responsibly tending to every patron. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Thiam</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-1323842\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/travelogue-guest-house/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Room plan\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/132/1323842/1323842_16092613410046913067.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/travelogue-guest-house/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Travelogue Guest House</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-2 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.2 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 273 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Stayed in Deluxe room for 2 nights as I saw the review comments Excellent. First disappointment there is no toilet inside room.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> Its only on sharing which wasn't mentioned in Agoda while booking. When asked at reception he said hes not responsible. The room boy suddenly enters room though I locked from inside. When asked why no answer given. So always need to carry my personal belongings when going out\n                                    Below listed are the cons\n                                    1. Site mentioned 30sqm room but it was only 8sqm\n                                    2. No private washroom\n                                    3. No wardrobe\n                                    4. No refregirator\n                                    5. No compliments like tea / coffee / water / brushing / soap kit inside room\n                                    6. Wifi is totally bad. Seldom connects from room\n                                    7. Heater may or may not work at the common bath room\n                                    8. No lift\n                                    9. No security\n                                    Only pro is the location nothing else. If you are backpacker then shall choose as dormitory but not to be considered as Hotel.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Karthick</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, India</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-738638\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/pods-the-backpackers-home-cafe/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"PODs The Backpackers Home &amp; Cafe\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/738/738638/738638_15082115370034788214.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/pods-the-backpackers-home-cafe/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">PODs The Backpackers Home &amp; Cafe</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-2 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.8 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 734 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>I needed an overnight bed in KL due to my airline changing the flight times.\n                                    So I booked The pods,as I needed to be near to Kl Sentral for my bus from/to the airport.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p>\n                                    I was in a 16 bed dorm on 3rd floor,bed was comfortable enough-there are 2 toilets&amp;3 showers for the entire floor for the use of approx 30 guests but I can say I did not have to wait at all.\n                                    The breakfast was toast&amp;jam-plus a green paste which I was led to believe is peanut butter.

As stated in our previous review this hostel is great: the location, the amenities, the breakfast, the vibe, the polite American gentleman who checked us in\u2026 But after moving from the dorm to a private double room one factor greatly diminished our pleasant stay.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> BED BUGS. Having worked in a hostel before I would never make this a public comment unless I was 110% sure, but after waking up with tracks of itchy bites all over my body and then actually finding live bugs crawling on the wall there was no mistaking who the culprit was. There were also the remains of squished ones on the walls so I\u2019m sure we\u2019re not the first customers to notice. This is the first time after 9 months travelling in SEA that we encounter this problem and we felt like we should leave an honest review.\n                                    I again reiterate that this was not the case in the dorm and for sure it isn\u2019t in all the rooms. Apart from this our stay was perfect, just have a check around your room before settling in.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Danilo</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Brazil</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-1179398\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/sojourn-guest-house/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Sojourn Guest House\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/117/1179398/1179398_16031814190040881150.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/sojourn-guest-house/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Sojourn Guest House</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-3 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.5 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 60 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>The staff. \n                                    \n                                    One of the staff at the reception counter was rather rude. The foreigner staff (i think he's a Bangladeshi) was nice too me but he seems to be having a hard time finding my reservation since i paid the room under Agoda.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> \n                                    \n                                    Later, the 'senior' staff, a chinese lady took over and from that moment on, I felt soooo humiliated.  The look on her face was like, \"Got money meyh? Owh.. No wonder la, using Agoda got cheaper price one\"\n                                    \n                                    She even scolded the staff for not being able to find my reservation, when she also can't find one. And thinking that maybe I couldn't understand Mandarin, she spoke to someone on the phone (which i think maybe some superior) and badmouthing me. I may not be fluent in her language but I can understand 80% of her conversation.\n                                    \n                                    Then after a 'few' confirmation on ID, finally I was able to check in. I've never ever stand in front of the hotel's check in counter that long in my life. She doesn't even bother to ask me to have a seat first while she sort the problem. Only the guy took initiative and offer me some tea.\n                                    \n                                    It seems that they have a problem with online booking and making it looks like our fault since we booked online. I saw their normal hotel rate on the counter top and I must say that it was wayyyyy expensive compares to what I got from Agoda. I guess that explained why she was not satisfied with me.\n                                    \n                                    Please note that I'm giving 1 star for everything, to make a pitch on this. In real, everything from value for money, location, cleanliness and facilities was great except for the one staff.\n                                    \n                                    Please also be informed that the hotel will be taking a minimum of RM150 for room deposit when you check in.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Fateha</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-289969\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/check-mate-guest-house/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Check Mate Guest House\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/289/289969/289969_14063002190020083270.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/check-mate-guest-house/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Check Mate Guest House</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-1 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">6 Review score</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 335 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Stayed in this hotel for the second time.

I accept the fact that for the reasonable price of the room, everything seems fine to me but not for the pillows. It stink and i hardly sleep well at night where i have to cover it with a towel to overcome the smell. I do hope that the hotel management will improve the room hygiene and maybe consider some repainting on the wall of the room as there are many stain on it.  </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Owen</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-2094209\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/188-suites-garden-studio-by-jne/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"188 Suites @ Garden Studio By JNE\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/209/2094209/2094209_17040711080052181131.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/188-suites-garden-studio-by-jne/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">188 Suites @ Garden Studio By JNE</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-3 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.8 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 36 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>The room is not a hotel, it is a private residence located in a hotel.

We had wifi on phone so it wasn't an issue. The location is great, walking distance to Petronis and several shopping and eating venues. next door is a coffee shop with good food and coffee..A convenience store is also located next door. The room coordinator is very organized and even though we didn't see her, she made getting settled in very convenient using chat app. The room is upscale condo quality with premium furniture, fixtures and appliances in kitchen area. Overall a great experience, and we will definitely stay there next visit.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">James</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, United States</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-567698\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/le-village-china-town/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Guest Room\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/567/567698/567698_15052415340027739676.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/le-village-china-town/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Le Village China Town</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-1 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">6.2 Good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 428 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Le Village is a wonderful place for budget travelers.

You really feel that Locky (who is running this place) likes to help his guests and takes care of them. I arrived late but even though he was so welcoming and gave me many interesting information about Kuala Lumpur and the area around it.\n                                    The rooms are basic and nice. You can get towels and a blanket if you ask (and you get your laundry done for a short money). There is a cosy communal living room with chilled music tunes (and a computer you can use). They have book exchange and couple of games as well. You get free drinking water, coffee/tea and you can use the fridge. My favourite spot in this guesthouse is the huge rooftop with its many plants and the rooftopkitchen. The view over the heart of chinatown is authem (and the sunset can be too)! I met so many amazing people and had great talks here. Thank you very much for your hospitality! </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Rebecca</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Germany</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-1119524\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/revopackers/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Revopackers\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/111/1119524/1119524_16031600530040789252.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/revopackers/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Revopackers</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-2 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.2 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 303 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Firstly, the location is great! Hotel near Imbi station, you can go to KL centre station and from there, go everywhere by monorail, express, train, bus.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p>.. But on the first day we came, it was quite difficult to find the hotel. You should drop off at Imbi station and walking about 200 meter to the hotel, ask the people at the station the way you go.\n                                    Second, the staff are very nice and friendly. They made us felt satisfied when change the room has window based on my booking. You must deposit 20RG and they'll get back when you check out.\n                                    The room is small but clean and comfortable, breakfast jus basic, only toast with jam and hot milk-coffee, tea. Dont ask more with the best price and best place in Kuala Lumpur.\n                                    Hotel with model design and draw in the wall really attractive. If we come back Kuala Lumpur, Revopakers is the best choice with us</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">HONG</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Vietnam</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-241337\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/babylon-guest-house/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Babylon Guest House\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/241/241337/241337_121013191013095.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/babylon-guest-house/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Babylon Guest House</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-1 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">6.1 Good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 509 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>I have booked 3 nights in this guest house and I really looking forward to my stay here as I will be going to the K-Festival 2014 in Pavillion.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p>\n                                    It took me a while to find and locate this guesthouse. The staff was really friendly.\n                                    When I checked in to my room, it was kinda small and no window.  The shower was good and to be honest, I'm not that happy with the bed sheet. It doesn't look comfortable.\n                                    My first night stay in this guesthouse was not that pleasant.  My friend keep on complaining that every time she's about to fall asleep, she would smell tobacco smoke in the room. Plus, I was \"disturbed\" by something ( and I hate to say it, I think it's a ghost!)  Since my visit was during the beginning of The Hungry Ghost Festival I believe it's one of the contributing factor to the supernatural phenomenon that happened in my room that night.   I checked out the next day and just burned my 2 night stay. I was really upset at that time and didn't even think about asking for refund. But now I regret it.\n                                    For travelers out there, whether you want to believe me or not, please don't go out traveling during the Hungry Ghost month. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Amanda</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-335422\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/suzie-s-guesthouse-kl/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Suzie's Guesthouse KL\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/335/335422/335422_14062009330019942129.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/suzie-s-guesthouse-kl/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Suzie's Guesthouse KL</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-1 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.1 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 708 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>The staff were helpful and happy to look after our excess bags while we went out of KL for a few days and returned.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p>\n                                    The shower and toilets are clean and good.

Pasar Seni railway station is 2 minutes walk away, as is the stop for the free city bus to get you other places around KL city. If you walk through Pasar Seni station across the pedestrian overpasses to (old) KL station and across the other side then you are at the parks - Butterfyl Park, Bird Park, Botanical Gardens... with no need to be finding your way along busy arterial roads.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Phillip</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Australia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-276148\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/the-bodhi-lodge/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"The Bodhi Lodge\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/276/276148/276148_15070610520031709869.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/the-bodhi-lodge/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">The Bodhi Lodge</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-1 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.3 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 775 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>I booked this hotel for a weekend getaway with best friends. We were looking for a simple place to sleep within the KL Sentral area and we chose The Bodhi Lodge based on the good reviews.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p>\n                                    \n                                    A few days before our arrival, Gigi (the owner, I guess?) emailed me the map and directions to get to The Bodhi Lodge which turned out to be really helpful. It's located around 8 minutes walk from Bangsar LRT station. It was a bit confusing to find the place at first but then I used Google map and found it quite easily. \n                                    \n                                    Me and my friends booked the quad room and we were placed in their new building, just behind their first building. The place was really clean and not noisy at all although we were really close to the main road of Bangsar. They provided water dispenser, fridge, and hair dryer in the common area. Two shared bathrooms, one of them was a bit too small for a bathroom I guess. \n                                    \n                                    The quad room was ok. We had two bunkbeds which made quite a lot of sounds when someone moves. The air conditioner was a bit hot. They provided lockers in the room, an electric socket for each bed and also a pillow and blanket. \n                                    \n                                    All in all, we were satisfied with the price we paid. The location was great, especially when you want to travel with public transportation or need to go to the airport in the morning from KL Sentral. Facilities were ok, sufficient for basic needs. I think this place is suitable for young couples or groups who just need a place to sleep at night. Not really recommend it for family with young children or old parents. Will definitely come back for a short stay with friends.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div

The bathrooms are shared, but that wasn't a problem at all and they were always clean. The internet worked really well downstairs and the breakfast was very basic, but it does the job. The staff was really helpful. After  we checked out, we left our luggage in a room cause we had a night flight. When we returned to pick it up, we asked the reception guy if we could take a shower before leaving and he said yes and he did even lend us two clean towels!!!!!\n                                    \n                                    I absolutely recommend this hostel!. Ask for a lower room as it has four floors and taking up all your luggage is not fun at all. \n                                    </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Paulina</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Chile</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-557879\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/marquee-guest-houzz/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Marquee Guest Houzz\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/557/557879/557879_14011208340018052749.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/marquee-guest-houzz/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Marquee Guest Houzz</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-1 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 477 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Pros\n                                    -

Drinking lots of water is important if you're travelling. Don't want to fall sick at a bad time.\n                                    - Have multiple bathrooms, at least 7 and more I guess. So, you don't have to worry about waiting in a long queue early in the morning when you needed to use the bathroom.\n                                    - Not sure if they forgotten to ask for room deposit or there really isn't a deposit needed. I love that. \n                                    \n                                    Cons\n                                    - The floor is rather, thin I might say? You can hear people's footsteps outside your room when they walk pass. In my case, I don't mind that much and still get my proper sleep, and who evens want to walk around pass midnight. Request for the rooms at upper floor, might be quieter than downstairs.\n                                    - The air-con might be noisy too, but it didn't bother me much at night. If it does irritate you, just get an earplug and go through the night.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Foo</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-400397\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/orange-pekoe-guesthouse/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Orange Pekoe Guesthouse\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/400/400397/400397_14090815250021944460.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/orange-pekoe-guesthouse/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Orange Pekoe Guesthouse</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-1 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.1 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 363 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>My girlfriend and I stayed at Orange Pekoe for 2 nights.

The staff was quite hospitable and friendly, and helps with getting an adapter in a pleasant manner.\n                                    \n                                    However, on the second night of our stay, we returned to a room without any electricity- no AC, no hot water, no lights, just the stuffing air of KL. The staff explained that there's been some sort of power out for the neighborhood, but all around us the power was on Except our building. When asked if we can have a flashlight to pack (we have an early flight next morning), the staff only shrugged, saying they have candles if we want. In the end we laid in the dark till 5, in a suffocating room with generators humming loudly outside the room. The next morning the staff offered no apology, no explanation, no nothing, as if the whole incident never occurred. It was extremely disappointing to be treated like this, feeling like simply because we're getting a room on the cheap, we can expect no hospitality or care when shit hit the fan.\n                                    \n                                    Overall not a bad room if you don't want to spend much, but you can do so much better for just a little more.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Ji</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Taiwan</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-686592\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/travel-hub-hightstreet/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Travel Hub Hightstreet\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/686/686592/686592_16052617360042764934.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/travel-hub-hightstreet/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Travel Hub Hightstreet</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-1 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.3 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 129 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>The location is very perfect for those who like night markets because it is right next to Petaling Jaya Night Market.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> It is also very accessible from the train station. Just a 5min walk to Pasar Seni Station then one station away from KL Sentral. Very easy to go places. Stayed for 3 nights in a mixed dorm. The bed only had one pillow, but the bed was comfortable enough. The bunk bed is kinda shaky. There are unfortunately no personal lamps, so it\u2019s kind of a hassle to turn on the room light when you have roommates already/still sleeping. There aren\u2019t room keys for guests, so you can\u2019t lock your room. But I guess it\u2019s okay because there\u2019s CCTV in the hallway. If you\u2019re the paranoid kind, just maximise the locker provided to you for your valuables. 2nd day I was there, the showers in our building were broken, so we had to use the one in the lobby. The breakfast was standard toast and jam with coffee and tea at The Attic Bar. No complaints, but the coffee got warm quickly. I think preparing your own coffee in the kitchenette is better. The walls are thin, so guests who are still rowdy at around 1am when the bar upstairs close can be easily heard. Facilities are okay, and the overall ambience is very cozy and homey, minus the noise upstairs. But that\u2019s what you get for booking a hostel with a bar. The staff is very friendly, and the auntie at the reception allowed me to hang around the lobby and use the facilities even after I checked out because my flight was late night. Overall, it\u2019s a nice place for budget travellers, especially if you like meeting new people. If you like more quiet places in the hostel, the kitchenette and the lobby are good choices. There\u2019s also a fridge where you can store your takeaway food, and the water is ice cold. I like that guests are expected to clean after themselves because it comes with the whole travel experience. I\u2019d come back, but maybe opt for a private room instead.

The rest of the day I was out for my 3 days business. Food were easy to find since it is next to Melawati Food Court area and in front of night market area. Taxi and bus just in walking distance and the nearest train station is at Wangsa Maju or Sri Rampai. However, I would like to suggest, it would be nice if the hotel can prepare 2 blankets although it was a queen bed. I do not feel comfortable sharing a blanket with my friend. Overall, this hotel is recommended to backpackers, budget traveller, or non-executive business stay.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n

Dim lightings and wooden furnishings made up the cosy atmosphere. What accentuated the place even further was the smile and greeting from the staff (although, their lime green and sunshine yellow uniform were a stark contrast to the look of the place). I stayed in the three-bedded Male dormitory which consisted of three beds and a cupboard with three doors, each containing a safety deposit box. The room was small, making it a little squeezy. Otherwise, the mattresses, pillows and duvet were comfortable.\n                                    \n                                    For RM 40 (SGD 13) a night, this hostel is a definite value for money. The area is also well-situated, with nearby bars and food places. A 5 minute walk brings you to the heart of Bukit Bintang.\n                                    </p>\n                                                        </div>\n

the evening, one of the room doesnt feel cold so we called up the stuff,he tried to set the aircon as it's still the same so we are given another room to change. really appreciate that. for our 4 nights stay at nana's inn, i would say it is value for money. we dont really mind the scenery from the room as we are mostly out and the room are just used for sleeping. there is a stall nearby that sells good delicious ramly burger where we go every night for our supper. the hotel is only bout 10-15mins walk from bukit bintang. short time taken if you walk from fahrenheit and straight ahead will be the hotel. me and my friends are totally satisfied with our stay and service given. anyways,breakfast served are breads,biscuits and hot drinks. we dont mind that as we prefer to have breakfast outside. great accomodation, great company &amp; great area. we had a good stay in kl.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n

pay more $50 for my little daughter who only 3 years old.I refused.I told him,according to AGODA show on his guesthouse,Triple room,stay for free if using existing bedding if the kids under 8 years old.I have paid a bed for my husband.So we no need to pay anymore.He was quite unhappy.If you can't afford this,you can ask agoda change this policy.The second day,I asked if we have to change room or not in the morning,becasue the Triple room has be occupied by other customer when I book in agoda.He told me can stay in the same room.But when we came back,he again told me to pay them $50 for triple room.I refused again.I told him I can stay as we booked at agoda.He told us to change room and said the girl has told me before,but I can not understand English.In fact,the girl speaking nothing with me.Though my English is poor,know this simple English is not difficult,by the way,you foreigner can speak a very well Chinese??? So at last,we took our luggage from upstairs to downstairs.But things not finish.This night,I booked two bed for my husband and son, a double room without windows.When we put all of the luggage to the room and start to sleep.My husband and son to their dormitory.Unfortunately things happen,my 10 old years son told me,his bed has occupied and there were only one bed left.He can't share so small bed with his father.So I again told the clerk,I have paid 2 beds,why only 1 left.At last,he asked us to still stay in the triple room.After we carry all of our luggage upstairs.It almost 1 AM. </p>\n

Towels were cheap and only two provided- when using the pool you are not allowed pool towels because you are staying at the AIR B n B not the actual hotel so they won't give you any pool towels.\n                                    \n                                    3. Pillows on couch were also with stains.\n                                    \n                                    4. The hotel staff refuse to help you because you are not actually staying at the hotel.\n                                    \n                                    5. When using the pool the security guard told my mother to get undressed as what she was wearing was not a swimsuit according to his standard and pointed to someone in a bikini. My mother is 54 and was wearing a full coverage bathing suite.\n                                    \n                                    6. The location is not near ANYTHING. There is no restaurant at the hotel, a small cafe with disgusting over priced food.\n                                    \n                                    7. When asked the concierge for a taxi on the meter we would get a taxi not on the meter as one of them told us that the concierge takes a percentage.\n                                    \n                                    8. The only good thing about this hotel was the unique pool, but it was closed 60% of the time because of the rain so only got to use it once and when we did we were discriminated against.\n                                    \n                                    9. There is no air conditioning in the hallways as this hotel was initially built to be apartments. The lift is also slow as ever\n                                    \n                                    10.

Pam and Lilly were managers for the suite we stayed in and the KL Tower was literally in front of us as we stepped out of the balcony.\n                                    \n                                    Pam was very helpful and knowledgeable! She made herself available via text/calls throughout our stay. We had many questions for her as it was our first time in Kuala Lumpur, yet she answered all of our Q's (and much more!) with enthusiasm. \n                                    \n                                    The suite was very clean, had 3 beds and towels were provided for each guest. In this particular suite we had a safe, hair dryer, tea/coffee, washer/dryer, utensils, etc. I mean all the essentials needed to be at home away from home. \n                                    \n                                    This is where it gets interesting. Our final night we decided to stay an additional night, however all the suites were booked that Pam/Lilly were managing. We were referred to another suite manager, her name was Pie (this was not her real name but name that was provided to us. She went by couple different name. Another name was \"Lowena\"). She was heavy weight of Filipina or Tongan decent. Her demeanor was very dry and rude. She offered us a suite to stay in for 200RM (we paid less for the suite with Pam). The room had a horrible view, one king bed &amp; one \"sofa\" bed- which were 2 cushions that you lay on the floor (it was 3 of us). No extra towels or sheets/blankets were provided for the 3rd person. The TV didn't work either. As we requested sheets/towels, Pie claimed that she will deliver it to us later because she was busy with another guest. How do they expect us to check-in to a suite with major essentials missing?\n                                    \n                                    As we wanted to head out for lunch, we asked Pie for the keys to the suite &amp; 3 key cards for each person (each guest is required to have their own key card, otherwise s</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Sahresh</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, United States</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-567904\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/new-town-suites/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"New Town Suites\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/567/567904/567904_15122011480038636177.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/new-town-suites/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">New Town Suites</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-35 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 218 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Ronnie, the hotel manager was efficient with our check-in &amp; out.

Hotel New Town has a few rooms in Sunway Pyramid Hotel which is available for guests to book. The amenities in the room are very basic, hot/cold shower with bathtub, ironing board, electric kettle etc We wanted to use the safe box but it was not in working condition and nothing could be done about it. So we had to bring along our passports &amp; extra cash along when we leave the room. The furniture in the room is rather jaded too; the curtains were tattered &amp; the kitchen equipments were rather dusty too. It is not a room where we could expect to relax in for long  as it has a dusty kind of feeling. So we actually spent more time out and only came back to sleep.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div

                                              <p>I saw many complain for the check-in and deposit RM500. However, it is not a problem for us. We was driving from JB.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> We called the staff once we clear the Sungai Besi Toll and was requested to make a call again when we reach the apartment. \n                                    \n                                    Did make a call when we reach and very quickly the staff come to look for us after 5 minutes. Was bringing us to the car park and also the apartment. Whole progress took only less than 15 minutes. \n                                    \n                                    Its consider fast and the room is clean + spacious. Deposit RM500 was given during check-in. However, they also very easily return us RM500 when we check-out. Did not check the apartment very detail. Just hand in the deposit to us. So, i think RM500 also not a big problem for us.\n                                    \n                                    Was walking to jalan alor around 3am  to have the supper. Its very near and very happening. \n                                    \n                                    Very easily to get the apartment by driving through the SMART tunnel. We saw the Hang Tuah LRT while we are swimming on the level 5. Its should be a walking distance even though we did not take LRT.\n                                    \n                                    Highly recommend this apartment. This is our first stay and i believe we will be keep staying next time.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">XIN</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-1061007\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/dpulze-suite/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Interior\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/106/1061007/1061007_15092517030036388270.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/dpulze-suite/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Dpulze Suite</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-35 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.7 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 425 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>I was shocked and horrified when I first walked into the Dpulze Suite room. It was in every way the complete opposite of the provided photos: a dirty, dimly lit room that looked more like a prison cell.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> With flickering fluorescent lighting, dirty walls and a kitchen that looked as if it had never been cleaned, I was absolutely horrified. I'm far from a clean freak, but I had to spend over an hour scrubbing the room just to feel like I wasn't going to catch something.\n                                    \n                                    The bathroom was poorly built, complete with the cheapest possible showerhead the developers could find. Entering the bedroom to finally go to sleep, I was met with the smallest, most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on. The sheets were gray, smelt damp, and make my skin itch. All of this along with the fan, which could either be set to full speed or off, kept me awake until 4:00AM, despite the fact that I had an 8:30AM meeting.\n                                    \n                                    The bath towel was stained, small and hideous. I had to buy some washing powder (as none was provided) to was the towels before I dared to use them.\n                                    \n                                    If you are considering staying at Dpulze Suite, be warned: it is nothing like what's pictured.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Marc</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Australia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-1095076\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/summer-suites-bernice/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Summer Suites Bernice\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/109/1095076/1095076_15100713280036694146.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/summer-suites-bernice/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Summer Suites Bernice</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">9.1 Exceptional</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 315 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Okay, admittedly, it took me 30 minutes to find the building, I guess it was partly my fault because I relied too much on Google Maps.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> I typed \"Summer Suites Bernice\" and it pointed to me a different direction. The trick apparently is from Agoda (or any other booking website), you click \"directions\" and it will provide you a more accurate picture of the area. Also, better if you look for MERCU SUMMER SUITES which is the name of the building. \n                                    \n                                    Anyway, while I was a little bit pissed, the moment I met JAHA and saw how friendly he is and apologetic, the anger started to subside. And it evaporated completely when I saw the room!!! Imagine staying at the 28th floor of a condominium which is strategically located in an area that is very close to the city center. The view of course is amazing, I remember taking a peek at my room window and saw the KL tower! While you cannot see the Petronas Tower from the room (it is being blocked by another tall structure), it will take you less than 10 minutes by foot to the towers and the Kuala Lumpur City Center.\n                                    \n                                    Aside from the glorious view, Summer Suites Bernice has all the amenities - drinking water (both cold and hot and room temp), plates and mugs and utensils, fridge, even iron and hair dryer! Definitely an upgrade from the usual hostel! They maintain it very well so five stars as well for cleanliness.\n                                    \n                                    The dorm type also gives you an opportunity to meet and interact with people, as a solo traveler that is one major perk! Others might find it annoying to share a room with strangers, but I absolutely loved it - I even ended up hanging out with one of my room mates!\n                                    \n                                    The building is located in a safe area so I didn't mind going home at 2 or 4 in the morning after partying at Bukit Bintang.

Wonderful view of KL, comfortable couch, beds and pillow. The aircon, fan and wifi worked very well. The bathroom contained a shower, bath and sink, and in a separate room there was the toilet, bidet and sink. The room was a little dated, and some minor repair work is needed for tiles in the bathroom. The kitchen tap dripped, which we could hear from the bedroom. The lighting in the room was a bit weird as there was no major light in the bedroom. There was also a strange smell in the bathroom, which would probably be solved by running the taps.\n                                    The location, right above a mall, is extremely convenient and a recognisable landmark for taxi/grab drivers.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Amanda</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Australia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-2238857\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/the-suitel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"The Suitel\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/223/2238857/2238857_17051116050052914235.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/the-suitel/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">The Suitel</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-3 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.6 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 40 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>The appartment had 3 rooms (2 upstairs rooms upstairs with one common Bathroom attached to both &amp; 1  very small room down stairs.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> The bathroom downstairs was not attached to the room but just accross the corridor.).

A small issue in the toilet was immediately attended to by the maintenance staff. convenient store was available on the ground floor.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Harshini</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Sri Lanka</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-569953\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/golden-triangle-suites-by-mondo/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Golden Triangle Suites by Mondo\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/569/569953/569953_17062716040054095158.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/golden-triangle-suites-by-mondo/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Golden Triangle Suites by Mondo</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.1 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 382 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Pros :\n                                    1.

NO REPLY! Called them the next morning (on my check in day) and they insisted that NO EARLY CHECK-IN is allowed! We were there an hour earlier, they told us that they will arrange for us to check in but it turns out that WE WERE THERE FOR AN HOUR WAITING FOR NOTHING! NO EARLY CHECK IN IS POSSIBLE EVENTHOUGH I HAVE REQUESTED FOR SO MANY TIMES, EVENTHOUGH I AM WILLING TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA CHARGES!\n                                    \n                                    2. They gave us the wrong room! Booked two one-bedroom suite but they ended up giving us only one one-bedroom suite and one normal bedroom as TOO many people checked in at the same time (everyone at 3pm) so the management got confused. We left after checking in, bumped into them at the lobby and asked them to switch the room for us. Two hours later, when we were back in the condo, to our surprise, our room was NOT changed!!! Called them and they asked us to change it by OURSELVES! HOW RIDICULOUS IS THIS? They offered to switch room with the other customer who mistakenly got our room without even cleaning it! HOW CAN YOU ASKED SOMEONE TO GO INTO A ROOM THAT HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER CUSTOMER WITHOUT ANY HOUSEKEEPING BEFOREHAND?!\n                                    \n                                    3. We requested for two single beds in one of our suite beforehand but was not informed that they are not available until we asked during check in.\n                                    \n                                    All in all, the management needs to improve their service! </p>\n                                                        </div>\n

presidential penthouse suite that came with the balcony with a view overlooking the KL tower.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div

staying at the penthouse very much, with most of the facilities in working order. We would have preferred to have a dish towel to dry the dishes after it is washed and perhaps a mop to help with keeping the bathrooms dry. Additional towels would have been great to have to dry off after getting out of the jacuzzi. Note that the tiles leading up to the balcony are quite slippery when wet.\n                                    \n                                    It was quite disturbing to find the electric kettle filled with slime/mold at the bottom thus rendering it unfit for use. \n                                    \n                                    There was a slight confusion during check in where I was given the wrong room despite me very clearly mentioning my full name upon check in. The staff was initially adamant that no mistake was done and it was I who made the wrong booking. It was only after I showed him a private message I left on facebook with the management that he was willing to double check and apologise for having made a mistake. No harm done but as an aside would recommend the management to perhaps make the names of the units less confusing for guest and staff alike.\n                                    \n                                    FYI parking is RM10 per entry.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Mei</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-983636\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/placin-crown-regency-kl/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Placin @ Crown Regency KL\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/983/983636/983636_15071513170032342745.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/placin-crown-regency-kl/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Placin @ Crown Regency KL</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.3 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 115 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Ok, I booked this as an Agoda mystery 4 star hotel, so my review will be a little coloured by the fact that this is a serviced apartment - even though it is in the Crown Regency Hotel.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p>  The positives - it's large, airy and very convenient.  You have access to the pool, a well-equipped gym and the other services offered by the Crown Regency.  So, if you're purchasing as a serviced apartment (rather than a mystery hotel) these things are all great.\n                                    The negatives: cleanliness! Ok, so the property was cleaned but the mattress in the main bedroom had multiple blood stains and yellow stains and no mattress protector - so the stains showed through the very thin sheets.  The sheets themselves (while undoubtedly cleaned) had multiple ingrained stains all over them and were very poor quality.  The main bathroom really stank and the master ensuite was not much better.  We left exhaust fans on and sprayed deodoriser but the smell would not budge.  The dryer and washing machine filters required cleaning (and servicing according to the dryer readout).  \n                                    You do not have access to the front reception facilities (you need to make a time to meet someone at the property for check in and chec out) and you are only provided with 1 key to your room.  This means that for a group of three we had nowhere to leave a key and had to juggle times to 'meet up' so we could all get back into the room after our different travels for the day.\n                                    \n                                    Lastly, until I booked I was unaware I had to provide a 500MR CASH deposit on the property.   I've got no issue with room deposits but would have expected this to be undertaken by a Credit Card hold - rather than leaving me with 500MR on the last morning of my journey.\n                                    \n                                    In summary, great location and size, good wifi, a good serviced apartment but NOT a four star hotel (as advertised by Agoda) and standards of cleanliness and linen were poor.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Sharon</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Australia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-564506\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/s-suites-the-scott-garden/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"S Suites @ The Scott Garden\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/564/564506/564506_17010812430050194524.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/s-suites-the-scott-garden/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">S Suites @ The Scott Garden</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.9 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 150 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Similar to air bnb, NOT a service apartment.

Good to note the no. to call. I had a hard time getting a stable network to download the PDF from my email. 3) Only towels, shampoo and soap are provided. Snacks or water in the home are chargeable.  Though it mentions hair dryer and tv... it was not working.... tv was basically like watching pixels or **** 4) Walls are so thin i could hear the neighbours early in the morning and late at night.\n                                    If you are looking for places to drink, this accommodation will fit you. otherwise beside tesco, nothing much is around. Will not stay again. Rather pay a bit more to get way better experience. </p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Shin</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Singapore</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-984197\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/the-best-klcc-view-regalia-residences/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"The Best KLCC View @ Regalia Residences\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/984/984197/984197_15081008540033944936.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/the-best-klcc-view-regalia-residences/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">The Best KLCC View @ Regalia Residences</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-45 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.6 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 132 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>some issue about the securities guard over there, they even could not understand \"english or bahasa malaysia\" because they are foreigner and the parking system really make me mad, they does not issue a access card to guest and every time we go in and out, we need to go at the lobby (lvl 4) to register our car plate number over and over again~ after register they just give us the simple manila card with printing (visitor parking)~ after park in and we need to go out, they take back the card and when i come back, they not allowed me to park in again! and they ask us go registered the car plate number again at the lobby and we need to go to the lobby again! is really annoying~ they already gave my car record why i have to register again! and get scold by the securities guard (masuk keluar masuk keluar!) really make me sad~\n                                      </p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p></p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">jia</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-984566\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/regalia-residence-holiday-home/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Regalia Residence @ Holiday Home\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/984/984566/984566_15072318590032907487.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/regalia-residence-holiday-home/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Regalia Residence @ Holiday Home</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-35 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.1 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 156 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>If you are gonna go there by foot, you need to go through a very steep stairs with all your baggages.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> You need to hire a taxi if you want to be dropped at the front of the hotel. The staff, mostly indians, are really lazy and are not willing to help. They wont help you get a cab, and are not even willing to help us contact the home owner of the unit we are renting. They just said sorry and that is it. It seems like they do not care about their guests. The hotel and the facilities itself is nice but i would rather have a modest hotel with very helpful staff. Especially since most of the people there cannot speak good english. Their english is really really bad. It is not tourist friendly. I suggest you take the suncity hotel, which is also near the area.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Leo</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Philippines</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-1620626\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/pine-cone-the-platinum-suites-klcc/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Pine Cone @ The Platinum Suites KLCC\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/162/1620626/1620626_16122016130049815984.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/pine-cone-the-platinum-suites-klcc/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Pine Cone @ The Platinum Suites KLCC</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-5 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.5 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 41 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Firstly, after we made the booking via Agoda, the staff Ai Nee contacted me via email for the special requirements confirmation yet the reply from her is stopped halfway and the conversation was not complete.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p>\n                                    On the day of check in, i was told to pay security deposit RM600 but unfortunately due to i was not being informed earlier, i have not much cash with me just around RM150 that time. I trying to bargain with the PIC Alex that my friend is OTW and he can make full payment upon his arrival. I was being rejected and he even replied me that even the access card itself is more expensive than what i have on hand. This is definitely offending me to the max. Furthermore he says that the deposit requirements is stated on Agoda website, too bad I couldn't find it and he says will come back to me with proof but he also failed it! Upon check out also late with bad attitude too. This is worse experience i ever had with Agoda booking. Hope Agoda will look into this problem and revert me.

The shopping centre doesn't open until 10 so if you want to eat breakfast you need to go elsewhere. We travelled with friends and we were given different floors,  we were not told that we could only access our own floor. I hsd no wifi in the room and no phone made it difficult to communicate, I tried stairwell, but they have no inside handles. We ended up swapping spare cards. \n                                    \n                                    Please note: be careful walking on the streets, I have been very complacent and unfortunately after catching monorail to Bukit Nanas and walking to Petronas around Midday an unregistered motorbike drove on the inside of footpath and reached out and grabbed at my dress, I think he tried to grab my necklace, but in doing so he broke the strap of my dress and luckily my necklace was still intact. My kids were shaken up. We reported to a passing police car.

additional cupboard with a latch to lock. remember to bring locks if you are travelling, they sell locks too. do note that this is a hostel and not a hotel so you can't expect hotel level service. but cleanliness and all those are really sufficient.\n                                    \n                                    the main reception is at 25th storey, u can see the sign when u come out of the lift. really cozy place to chill. there's a desktop for you to use as well. \n                                    \n                                    if you can't find the hostel, find Furama Hotel. it is right beside. tell the taxi driver to go there if you dont know the address. the hostel is located in the building \"TARAGON\" which is like an apartment with residence in it. security is not too bad, just tell them u're gg Ohana hostel or smth they'll let you in as u need the hostel key to enter/exit your own door and the door of the building.\n                                    \n                                    overall, its a relatively new hostel exceeds my expectations. there's swimming and gym facilities for use as well. </p>\n

feel it was misrepresented as there was no phone and therefore no option for room service, laundry, etc. as stated in the Agoda.com ad.  I had a wonderful time and recommend these suites to all because the aforementioned was acceptable to me for the price I paid and the view and facilities I had access too.  However, if you enjoy Lobby service, (I had to enter through the East tower and walk through the mall with my luggage to the West tower), access to a phone and other hotel staples, be aware of what you are getting.  If you don't care about those things then the location view and access to all hotel facilities is definitely worth the money!</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Crystal</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, United States</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-962035\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/ran-pacific-serviced-suites-apartments/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Ran Pacific Serviced Suites &amp; Apartments\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/962/962035/962035_15071508290032315360.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/ran-pacific-serviced-suites-apartments/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Ran Pacific Serviced Suites &amp; Apartments</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.4 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 118 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Before i saying the goods, i would like to say DiGi users are experienced with a very weak telecommunication services.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> This is because when we arrived the lobby, we had called more than 10times to Mr. Yeasin to come down and lead us to the room but failed due to DiGi have a poor connection at there.

So, it is acceptable as the building was 5 yo or above (if i not mistaken is completed in 2011). \n                                    \n                                    Second, i would like say a million thanks to Mr. Yeasin as he is very kind and helpful, although sometimes we having some communication problems but he is still trying his best to help us to solve the problems. Example, we check-in at 2pm, after he brought us to the room, and we put our luggage and we left without closing all the air-con (i know it is not Eco-friendly, but the air-con is really not cold when we just open). We came back at 10pm, all the air-con in the rooms are still the same, only have wind but not cold at all, only the living room is function as usual. We called him at 10pm something and he came and check for us very patiently. After he also have no idea on what happening on the air-con, he call the technician to check for us. We really appreciate for what he did for us.\n                                    \n                                    Third, before we depart to Kuala Lumpur, i had called him for several times to ask about the location, hotel policy and so on as they are different management with Swiss-Garden Residence. He gave me a lot of information which are very useful. Example, he taught us how to come to the residence by using monorail from KL Sentral and so on.\n                                    \n                                    Conclusion, i would like to said it is a very excellent services. Mr. Yeasin is a very helpful, kindness and patient guy who will</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Chin</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Malaysia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-1032316\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/summer-suites-studios/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Summer Suites Studios\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/103/1032316/1032316_15091001260035833438.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/summer-suites-studios/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Summer Suites Studios</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-4 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.4 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 125 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>Spent 5 days at the accommodation.

Placed our booking a few days prior to our stay in KL. It is advisable to contact the owner prior to your arrival to avoid any delays or setbacks. As for us, everything was already prepared in the room including toilet amenities, kitchenware, utensils ready for usage.\n                                    \n                                    Location wise, its a great choice as it located within minutes of KLCC and Bukit Bintang, with public transport bus stop and monorail station) within walking distance. I highly recommend anyone to consider Summer Suites as a place to stay while in KL. Excellent accommodation, excellent service, excellent value. Will surely consider staying at the place again.

It was clean and comfortable.\n                                    The apartment complex is a little strange, it has a Tesco underneath it which is great, however there are a lot of empty retail spaces and there are a lot of bars, pubs. It did feel a little seedy in the evenings. It's a bit of a concrete jungle in there. Not a lot of soul.\n                                    \n                                    The process of 'self check-in' is a bit confusing. You have to find the right mailbox in building A and then you discover what apartment number you have, it may be in another block. So you then need to get to the other block. If you have a taxi/driver and lots of luggage make sure they wait for you to determine what block you are in. They may need to drive you further.\n                                    It would be handy having more than one key (card), we were only given one. Also, the 500 MYR deposit was odd (it needed to be cash).\n                                    All in all this place is great if you are travelling as a family and want to stay under the one roof. It's very affordable and convenient. The staff were very responsive and did provide detailed instructions with directions and check-in/check-out procedures.</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Shanti</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Australia</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                        <div class=\"item \" data-selenium=\"carousel-rowset\">\n                            <div>\n                                <!-- item -->\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-1134512\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/betty-roux-at-soho-suites-klcc/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Betty Roux at Soho Suites KLCC\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/113/1134512/1134512_15111214410037685294.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/betty-roux-at-soho-suites-klcc/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Betty Roux at Soho Suites KLCC</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-3 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">8.8 Excellent</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 196 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>We were a group of 6, travelling with older people.

WIFI avail. Con's: No reception desk - a person will greet you ask for deposit and bring you to your room. The rooms are old, poorly lighted, does not have proper toiletries. Bedding are OLD - you will be lucky to find a comfortable bed in your room choosing to book this Service apt. The\n                                    towels are chlorine stained. There are no proper kitchen utensils. The entire apt is filled with crocroach. Check out time is 12noon sharp and a person will be at your apt unit for the refund of deposit - late and there is chargers. There is only ONE key card - nobody will help you, not the tons of security officers in the building should you lose your card or forget your card. There is NO Towels provided for the swimming pool if you are a guest at this service apt, you can however bribe RM2 for a few towels from the counter. We were out for the morning returning in the afternoon to realized there were ppl in our unit, the housekeeping trolley was park at our door. When my wife entered, the 3 personals in normal attire were enjoying their lunch. Not until she picked her mobile to call me that these ppl realize they were not suppose to be in our room having their lunch and started packing their lunch and hastily cleared up the toilets as they had left it wet. We call the person in charge and he was very forthcoming in sharing expletives used to scold his workers and apologize for their mistakes.The account that our family had to go thru such hassle in and out of this building and each and every single security staffs are foreigners really does not justify their own ppl can simply walk into a guest room and enjoy their lunch without the slightly remorse on privacy issues. This kind of 3rd party bookings should be entirely removed from Agoda!</p>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"trigger show-more-trigger\">\n                                                            <a class=\"anchor\" data-active=\"Show less\" data-idle=\"Show more\" title=\"\">Show more<i class=\"ficon ficon-desktop-ic-black-down\"></i></a>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-name\">\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-name\">Andy</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"property-review-country\">, Singapore</span>\n                                                </div>\n                                            </div>\n                                        </div>\n                                </div>\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-4\">\n                                    \n                                        <div class=\"hotel-card hotel-card-549017\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card\">\n                                            <figure data-selenium=\"hotel-card-image\">\n                                                <a href=\"/sunbow-service-suites-at-times-square-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">\n                                                    <img class=\"property-img\" alt=\"Guest Room\" src=\"//pix10.agoda.net/hotelImages/549017/-1/f2858d27d6c6ba80e856414015285cc5.jpg?s=312x235&amp;ar=16x9\">\n                                                </a>\n                                            </figure>\n                                            <div class=\"property-details\">\n                                                <div class=\"property-top-details clearfix\">\n                                                    <div class=\"row\">\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-left col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-name\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-name\"><a href=\"/sunbow-service-suites-at-times-square-kuala-lumpur/hotel/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Sunbow Service Suites at Times Square Kuala Lumpur</a></div>\n                                                            <div class=\"ficon ficon-10 ficon-star-3 orange-yellow\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-rating\"></div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                        <div class=\"property-details-right col-xs-6\">\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-score\">7.8 Very good</div>\n                                                            <div class=\"property-review-number\">\n                                                                <div data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-count\">Based on 68 reviews</div>\n                                                            </div>\n                                                        </div>\n                                                    </div>\n                                                </div>           \n                                                <hr>\n                                                <div class=\"property-review-snippet\" data-selenium=\"hotel-card-property-review-more\">\n                                                    <p>the check in is a horror. we had hard time locating the \"lobby\" . only to find out that theer is none.</p>\n                                    \n                                                    <div class=\"show-more-component toggle-pane\">\n                                                        <div class=\"data\">\n                                                            <p> the apartments shares a common lobby with all other BTS suites, which is not accessible to outsiders.\n                                    We need to call the hotel to find out how to get to the \u2018hotel\u2019.

Gross.\n                                    They do provide towels and toiletries x 4 sets.

The unit was very nice. There were two extra mattress given as well as extra pillows. However, it was like treasure hunt as we need to search for everything by ourselves. We couldn't find the hair dryer as it was inside the drawer of tv consul. I called the owner and she said everything regarding the unit facilities are managed by Ms Diana (and in the end Ms Diana solved the problem). \n                                    During the two nights stay, it was great. The water pressure was strong, kitchenware are provided, towels and shampoo are provided, you can do the laundry (if you don't mind removing whatever left inside the washing machine). The building is in walking distance to Bukit Bintang area by air-conditioned pedestrian bridge (the bridge connects Pavilion KL and KLCC). Everything was fine until check out.\n                                    I called the owner for check out and she said just leave the keys in the unit. My car was parked at the parking and access card is needed to exit the building. Fearing not be able to leave the car park, i asked the owner how to exit the carpark without access card and she said it's ok there won't be problem. And yes, I can't exit the carpark thanks to the owner. First i asked  the security guard to let me pass and he refused. I called the owner again and she told me \"my customers always check out like this they don't have any problem also\". Kinda pissed at that time, I just asked her to solve the problem as I was rushing. Then, i passed the phone to the security (not knowing what she told him) yet i still can't pass. Called her twice after that, each time she hung up my phone after I asked her to solve. Then, I went to the lobby, asked for help from the management. Noticing my anger, she did not say anything and went to get the guard (she might just want to ask him to let me pass).

the capital of Malaysia and the country's cultural and economic center. Most visitors to the city arrive through Kuala Lumpur International Airport, but the low cost carrier terminal known as Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 is also a popular entry point for those flying with regional carriers. For those traveling through the city on their way somewhere else, there are plenty of hotels near both airports. However, if staying in Kuala Lumpur, there is plenty of accommodation in the city center as well. <br><br>Kuala Lumpur is a very modern city with an efficient and inexpensive public transportation system comprised of  trains and light rail. The <a href=\"//www.agoda.com/hotels-near-petronas-towers/attractions/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">Petronas Towers</a> are one of the most famous attractions in the city. The connecting bridge between the towers provides spectacular views of the city and taking tours to the sky bridge is a popular activity for tourists. Kuala Lumpur Tower also provides an observation deck featuring 360-degree unobstructed views of the city. <br><br>The 'Golden Triangle' section of the city comprises several large malls as shopping is a major attraction in Kuala Lumpur. The main shopping streets are Jalan Bukit Bintang, Jalan Sultan Ismail, and Jalan Imbi. <br><br>The city's <a href=\"//www.agoda.com/hotels-near-china-town/attractions/kuala-lumpur-my.html\">China Town</a> neighborhood provides a great opportunity to indulge in Chinese and Indian food as the restaurants  are inexpensive, authentic, and plentiful. A modern city with a diverse and interesting population, Kuala Lumpur is definitely a place that must be explored.<br><br>There\u2019s much more to see and learn about Kuala Lumpur, and the interactive map is a great way to continue uncovering all the important landmarks and attractions of this vibrant city. \n    </div>\n</div>\n    </div>\n</section>\n\n<div

This trip has the same feeling as last time. but I noticed the place is in need of a renovation. Wall paper is pealing off, and toilet feels a little darker, etc... Friendly and helpful staff is always available. In my annual trips to Malaysia, I have been staying at the Boulevard, which is the opposite end of the mid valley shopping center. A little more high class than Cititel, but obviously, more expensive. $120 vs $80. Have same access to great shopping facilities, good food stales around, and pretty central and not a long distance to other major shopping areas. Only downside is taxi may be hard to find if you want to go out late at night. It's a good idea to grab the number of a good Blue Taxi driver who works around the area, or use UBER / Grab to catch a ride Show more Joseph , Australia The Gardens - A St Giles Signature Hotel & Residences Kuala Lumpur 8.3 Excellent Based on 7380 reviews Stayed 2 nights with Gardens Residence and the stay was good. Total 6 of us including a 4 yo child. Ordered an extra bed which we put it at the master bedroom. The bed side space is just nice to accommodate the extra bed and not really that easy to put down the extra bed. The master bathroom was very spacious and comes with a bathtub. If anti-slip mat are provided in the bathroom, a bonus point as we requested 2 anti-slip mats at around 9pm and it took quite a long while for us to receive them. Living room is good but the tv channels are not well received as compared to the rooms and this is something to be improved on. The staff are friendly. We did not ordered breakfast as the residences are connected to the Gardens Mall and Mid Valley Mall. Most eateries/ restaurants open at 7am on weekdays and 9am on weekends. Location was great as groceries supermarket at the mall are within few minutes of walk too. Overall, a nice stay with Gardens residences! Show more Kok , Singapore One World Hotel 8.4 Excellent Based on 5443 reviews Book a junior suit and had excellent service at the check in at 19th floor (separate check in for suite) was given a suite on the 22nd floor and upon check in at suite was blown away by decor of suite. After shower discover a big cockroach In the room. Use the VIP service to get someone to kill it and they use roach spray to solve the situation. Decided to change room as it smell of insecticide spray. Try the next room and discover a raw sewage smell , was given another room that was not made up yet! Was told by front desk employees this roach problems is a recurring situation but management decided not to do anything about it. Finally was given 2 rooms with connecting door and also discover baby roach and when ask the hotel employee to kill roach was told she also afraid of roach! When asked for housekeeping service was told housekeeping does not operate after midnight. Upon check out almost did not discover the extra charges that was wrongly billed. Will not recommend this hotel Show more Carol , United States Furama Hotel Bukit Bintang 7.8 Very good Based on 17301 reviews Pros: 1. room clean; 2. aircond & hot shower working well; 3. wifi good & very stable; 4. staff with good manner; 5. lounge food & environment is good; 6. breakfast taste good; 7. location consider good. Cons: 1. Check in process very slow. Need to wait for 20 mins when there is only 1 guest in front of me. Should open more counter if you noticed that many guests are paying at the counter; 2. lounge air cond at the dining area is hot. There is only cookies available during day time. Though food is good during cocktail session, you should add 1/2 snacks during day time. 3. Though the breakfast taste really good, the selection is limited. If stay more than 2 nights, it will be quite boring with the breakfast choice. 4. There was strong cigarette smell at my room corridor on the second day. You had specifically put up a notice to state that this is non-smoking hotel, you should make sure it is being strictly adhere to. The cleaning staff is there when the cigarette smell still exist. But she act like nothing happen rather than report to the respective team to find out who smoke and take necessary action. Show more Chun , Malaysia Traders Hotel by Shangri-La 8.9 Excellent Based on 9377 reviews The 1st thing that caught our eye as we entered the room was the majestic view of the twin towers right in front of our eyes! Seemed close enough to touch. Generally pleased with front desk staff who were able to see to my requests. Tracy checked us in when we came slightly early around 12+pm. With our room nt ready til 2pm, we waited at the lobby couches w our baby. We were surprised when Tracy came to us few minutes later informing that another room is ready for us and decided to alocate it to us since we had a baby w us. We were quite certain she forgot about us since more guests were beginning to crowd the front desk. Nice touch Tracy! Room was nice and shower facilities n water pressure was superb! Everything was working well except for small thing like the kettle. Tv channels were reasonably clear. Room and the AC felt clean enough. Improvement could be made to the babycot we requested. I found old biscuit crumbs under the mattress. And the cot was not working properly even after i requested for another one. The base could not be adjusted to higher height due to faulty or missing parts. Eventually ended up not using it. You should be aware that hygiene is priority for babies. And a lower base means having to bend down more to pick up the baby. Expected much better in this aspect. Overall would still recommend this place and room to others and would come back again! Thank you. Show more Benny , Singapore Concorde Hotel Kuala Lumpur 8.2 Excellent Based on 7925 reviews Booked few hours before check in. 1. From hotel car park quite a distance to walk to lobby as in another building with a linked walkway but carrying heavy luggage walking the staircase up and down. .hhmmm...noticed there have Valet parking lot at the basement of hotel building. 2. Upon arrival at lobby, the front desk was congested with heavy load evening check-in. ( around 3 counters), a lady receptionist who just walked out from front office alerted and very attentive by immediately open another check in counter at my line. Firstly, she unable to find my booking provided name with I.D card, according to her reservation was closed on that day. Anyhow, i gave her the Agoda confirmation email of booking number and room details. Without further delay, she check me in and brief the rest of info as the routine procedure. (wifi login, breakfast...etc) when got into the room, later only found out that my room was upgraded from Superior to Deluxe.3. Room - Clean and quiet room with the basic facilities that meet 4-star standard plus ironing facilities and cd/dvd player. Comfort bed, good selection of international tv channel. WiFi connection a bit slow at night (barely connect) but speedy in the morning. No bathtub but shower with good water pressure, no water hose attached next to toilet bowl may be old structure of hotel building. Food - Good varieties of buffet dinner, A la carte for Combo set RM38nett not bad too, portion served just nice for a person. but was recommended the Chinese restaurant food not bad. Buffet breakfast meet the basic 3~4 star standard for Asean not Asian countries coz no Japanese or Korean in buffet line. Bakery choices are fair enough for the Western but not the cheeses and no dessert (mini tart or petit) so the finishing normally will be the fruits. Location - easy access to KLCC, Pavilion. Nearest place to chill out - Hard Rock Cafe just next to hotel. Overall a pleasant stay in Concorde Kuala Lumpur, recommended for business or leisure in KL Show more Chong , Malaysia The Boulevard - A St Giles Hotel Kuala Lumpur 7.9 Very good Based on 6130 reviews It was my second visit to stay at Studio. My thumbs up for praising one of your male staff, Mr Vasu at Executive Lounge whereby we went in for breakfast. He was indeed cheerful, helpful and warm person. I was having a very bad cough with thick phlegm whilst in S'pore. Upon seeing my condition, he suggested that he will offer me warm lemon honey water. I stayed there for four days and three nights with my sister. Last day when my sister went down earlier for breakfast. Your kind staff, Mr Vasu was asking my sister how is my cough. Later I went down and was impressed of his memory of remembering our names. My last day he offered me warm honey lemon water. Sad to say that breakfast at 9th floor was no standard. I preferred to go up to Executive lounge and served by your smiling, courteous staff, Mr Vasu. I salute his caring and mannerism. It was indeed a warm environment and caring staff and I would indeed certainly recommend my friend, business associates & etc Show more Lum , Singapore Dorsett Kuala Lumpur 7.9 Very good Based on 4931 reviews The location is great because it is near to Bukit Bintang area. However, the Hotel doesn't deserve to be 5-star hotel. The cleanliness is not great, and it is noticeable that they are inconsiderate about it. Another issue I faced is that when I checked out, I was surprised with additional tax that should be paid even though my reservation was inclusive of all taxes and fees. I tried to explain to the manager, but he doesn't care about my satisfaction, and he insisted that I should pay. I was in hurry because of my flight and the other thing is that they hold 300 deposit, so they take the money they want regardless my agreement. Shame on the management and there hotel. Show more Abdulaziz , Saudi Arabia Berjaya Times Square Hotel, Kuala Lumpur 7.9 Very good Based on 6282 reviews I booked this hotel expecting 5* service and facilities. I was late and my son attempted to check in at 3pm. He was told to wait as the room was not avilable yet. He was not checked in until about 440pm. We were given a room in East wing. The room facilities were below par. When I arrived past 11pm, I realised the phone was not working properly- I was too tired to walk so far away to the West Wing concierge to complain. The towels were not sufficient - only 2 bath towels!! No face towels, no towels to dry the basin tops. No hand towels. The shower head was erratic. This is worse than some of the 2* hotels I have stayed in. I feel cheated as I have paid a premium price for 5* value. I could have booked the same type of room through Agoda at less than half the price. Last month I used this hotel and I was happy with it. I told the duty manager at check out and she told me some rooms in East wing also belong to hotel. In other words, there is no guarantee of 5*value for 5* price. That is a gamble I do not wish to take with Berjaya Hotel ever again. This is the last time I would use this hotel. There are so many other 5* hotel nearby this beautiful location. Show more Mei , Malaysia The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur, Autograph Collection 8.9 Excellent Based on 2750 reviews Love the place. The staff were friendly and they try their best to assist though sometimes there are miscommunications but their sincerity wins over the mistakes. I really like their spa as well... housed in a separate building nearer to the Majestic Wing. Although the hotel is not in the centre of the city, they have shuttle buses going to sentral-easy if you are taking the KLIA express train to and fro the hotel, to MidValley Mall which is one of the largest shopping mall in the country and Starhill which is an upmarket mall near the centre of the city. Aside from this there are few site seeing places within walking distance of the hotel. The only thing is the a la carte meals in the hotel are extremely pricy-a plate of char Kway Yeow at RM $ 60 /$70 (can't remember the exact price). However the dinner buffet at Contango is only $115 or so... hence actually I can't quite understand the huge price dfrence. I didn't opt for breakfast so can't comment on that. Show more Anna , Malaysia PARKROYAL Kuala Lumpur 8.2 Excellent Based on 6665 reviews Stayed over for a night with my family. If you want a simple clean room that comes with a very strategic location with a spread for breakfast, this will be good for your choice. Not advisable if you are paying for the services; nothing felt like a five-star service level. 1. Front desk: these are the first person to face hotel clients yet they barely made the cut in making the best impression with their conversational skills and they generally lack in attentiveness. Went to lower end and boutique hotels that have friendlier and better front desk services. From my personal experience; we, unfortunately, had to make a very late check in on a Saturday night so I may have caused inconveniences to the front desk POC. For some reason, it took longer than usual for the person to get the booking sorted out so when we casually asked \"hey may i know why is this taking quite a while?\", the receptionist curtly replied \"I just came over to the front desk\" and continued working. 2. Breakfast: the spread is somewhat decent; the first reason why I chose this place is primarily because I have read many positive reviews on this online. I have bigger issues with how they were managing the crowd and the level of attentiveness they have as a five-star establishment. I'm not sure if this was due to a major under-staff situation or the crowd management system just weren't efficient enough to handle the massive family crowds, but there was quite a hold-up with a queue and the receptionists seemed to be ticking off a messy sheet to count for attendance and gave a lukewarm response that doesn't give us any confirmation when asked whether we are ready to be seated. When asked again, the receptionist simply just gave us a look until we heard someone from afar calling us which then motioned us with a hand gesture to usher us to a table that they have just managed to clean. They should also start providing chairs for those in need (parents with kids, elderlies, pregnant ladies) at the counter Show more Sue , Malaysia Shangri-La Hotel Kuala Lumpur 8.9 Excellent Based on 3836 reviews We were very satisfied with everything with the exception of the Chinese restaurant, where the service was lousy and we had to wait for a simple \"stirfried chicken dish\" for 45 minutes. During this waiting period, more than 12 of the personell circulated the table without doing anything not even when we asked about our food. The second complaint was the obliviation of cleaning glasses in the bathroom during the stay. All other parts of our stay was excellent with top marks for the lounge and all personell there.

Variety of foods offer.l during breakfast, lunch & dinner. Improvement need to look into: 1. No newspaper provided to the club suites.during my 4days staying there. 2. Housekeeping.not being properly done. The bathrobe provided only 1 unit during my first day check.in. 3. The trashbin in toilet should have the close lid since the kids below 5 years old maybe still using diapers and no close lid may derive a smelly area in toilet. 4. Providing the fragrance items to the bedroom or guest room area in club suite room. The fragrance smell nice at your lift area at level 34. Should be install at club suite room too ro even to other rooms. 5.

Follow the directions given by the hotel, the car park lift has different numbering of the levels to the terminal which is a little confusing but just go to level 3 in the lift as per directions. The bed was so comfortable! Otherwise it's a simple room with air con, tv, very small bathroom (but all that is needed for a shower), restaurant downstairs or food in the KLIA2 mall. Only complaint is the shower wasn't particularly clean... don't think the wall tiles had been cleaned in a long time, stains that I hope were just shampoo or soap caked on. Couldn't hear any planes but the sound of people talking in the corridors all night did carry through into the room which was a bit inconsiderate and annoying. Show more TERESA , Australia Hilton Kuala Lumpur Hotel 8.6 Excellent Based on 2634 reviews Its Hilton! I have stayed in Hilton branded hotels in some other countries and I can say the rooms and services are immaculate. I can really rely on their performance that my room won't be disappointing and it shall be up to what I would hope to get - all the time! KL Hilton has one of the nicest rooms in terms of layout, decoration and facility. The room sizes are generally big with exceptions of maybe a few on the middle floors (I think). I stayed here a number of times since January 2017 and got to experience different types of rooms and views. The room layout provides you a great sense of privacy with a \"hallway\" style entrance the sleeping area. The sleeping area comes complete with a movable study/dining table that you can move about and I always moved it close to the window for view and light. There is also a chaise-lounge by the window with plush pillows that you can laze in for a nice afternoon nap. The bed is also comfortable. the pillow that provide for you is seldom great but you can call \"magic\" for a change of pillow to suit your requirements. The shower and toilet and area is one of THE most generous and luxurious that I have come to experience in a hotel. The star of this area would be the deep and long, white marble clad bath tub! Superb! I love staying in this particular Hilton hotel and to date is my favorite among the other Hilton hotels!

The hotel itself is connected to Empire Shopping Mall which is quite convenient as you can get food and shopping easily without driving out. Parking is free if you are hotel guest, just give your parking ticket to the front desk staff they will help you to waive off the parking fee. Check in: Just have to show front desk staff the hotel voucher and IC, no need to pay any deposit. Room: We stay in Premier Essential Room for 2 nights. The room is quite spacious, working desk area and the \u201cbed room\u201d are separated by the shower room. Love it as the shower area and toilet are separated by a glass, so the toilet bowl and floor won\u2019t get wet easily when we take bath. Shampoo + shower gel, shower cap, towel and hair dryer are provided. Toothpaste and tooth brush are provided upon request. We requested for a King size bed, it is quite comfy and pillow are soft enough for us. Service: My washroom toilet got stuck on the 2nd day morning and I requested them to send someone up to fix it and they came up within 10mins and fix it for me. Front desk, concierge and housekeeping staff are quite friendly. Nothing much to complain. Show more Kah , Malaysia The Everly Putrajaya Hotel 8.2 Excellent Based on 6501 reviews 1. The hot shower water pressure is always low. sometimes even no water at all but no problem with cold shower. Plus the water temperature for the hot shower is not consistent. Be careful don't hurt yourself. 2. Room cleaning after housekeeping is not up to the standard of a four star hotel. Comforter with blood stain and on the floor (suspected the housekeeping staff injured himself during housekeeping, but he should changed a new comforter without his blood stain. He didnt take away the used towels on the floor, and only left one towel for us. 3. The safe box is not functioning. We have to bring everything with us when we were out from room. 4.Nobody serving at the swimming pool area. There are out of towels but we cant find someone to ask for a towel. And written there, must wear swimsuits to swim in the pool. However, i noticed many people just wear their normal ourfit because there is no guard to stop them. 5. Breakfast standard is only a 3 star hotel standard. However, the good sides are: 1. Hotel is walking distance from a simple shopping mall. Just next to the hotel. 2. There is swimming pool and gym room at the same floor. 3. The hotel manager is kind when we raised the room problem during housekeeping to her and she immediately ask her staff to go and check our room. Plus , she let us to check out late for free after she knew that me and my baby need to wait for my husband to come back from his meeting. Show more YEK , Malaysia Sunway Resort Hotel & Spa 8.4 Excellent Based on 3942 reviews First thought I have when we checked in to our room, is that it's very old. And room is very small. We had been upgraded from premium park view room to a club room (also park view), as there is a mandatory power shut down on the day we checked in (Malaysia Boleh!). So all guests were arranged to stay one night at the Hotel Pyramid next door (without having to move our luggage). But the moving here and there actually affects our sleep and made us more tired than we should be. The hotel kinda made this up by upgrading us to a Club room (without the use of the club lounge). But except the room is on a higher floor, really can't tell what's so special about the Club room. It's small. If fits 2 super single beds, and some basic furniture and that's all the space it has. Nothing to shout about and I would have preferred to continue to stay at the Hotel Pyramid (not given the option also) since it's just newly refurbished, at least the bed and toilet are new. Not only the furniture in the room is old, the facilities are also old, like the swimming pool. It's strange that swimming pool is almost always empty for the 3 days we were there. The quietest swimming pool we have seen so far. Could it be that there is the Sunway Lagoon next door or the pool is not attractive? The staff are worth giving 2 thumbs up. Service is good throughout - bell service, front door, front desk and breakfast buffet service staff. Buffet breakfast is good, with a wide variety of food and all look and taste pretty decent. Out of the 3 hotels, this is the most expensive hotels. But I felt it's really not worth the money. If you have to choose one, choose the other 2 which have been just gone through a major renovation recently. All 3 have easy access to the Sumway Pyramid shopping centre and Sunway Lagoon. Show more Yau , Malaysia Wolo Bukit Bintang Hotel 8.2 Excellent Based on 4929 reviews Far Too Expensive for an Awful Room We stayed here after friends recommended and paid slightly more to get a room with a window. We were checked-in early as there were rooms available so hats off to the Front Desk team and this is their only saving grace, other than the obvious location. The concierge was on the 2nd or 3rd level but only 2 of the 3 lifts were working so the wait was longer than usual. There was a nice cigar room and it didnt reek of stale cigar smoke so that was good. We were given room 506 and was quite shocked to see the state and layout of the room. The window that was marketed and profited was a gimmicky tiny see through glass panel that barely lights up the room. In front of the window and taking up space in the room was a (about) 1m in diamater black painted pillar blocking half the window. The layout of the room was horrible. The bed was wall to wall so the person who sleeps inside needs to climb over the other, if s/he needs to go to the bathroom. This layout does not have much thought put into it. A traveller photo submitted by Virginia F on Tripadvisor shows this exact room. The toilet doors were sliding but the bottom sliders were off the tracks so they were just floating and hanging from the top. The shower screens were spotty and could have been cleaner. The aircon cannot be regulated. The coasters had stains. Didnt even bother with the kettle. Wifi always kicked one of us out so had to get Front Desk to assist. The room can be noisy at night too from the traffic, horns blaring etc. I'd rather get a hotel further from Bukit Bintang and take a cab than stay at Wolo again. Unfortunately to Wolo Hotel, we say \"We'll Only Stay Once!\" Show more Muhd , Singapore Hotel Istana Kuala Lumpur City Center 8.2 Excellent Based on 5897 reviews The lobby, concierge and reception staff are welcoming and efficient. Be aware that the lobby and restaurant can be uncomfortably chilly, which can be a shock when you come in hot from outside. It is a beautiful entrance space with fresh flower displays! Makes you feel special. The beds are comfortable, but the room and bathroom are in need of refurbishment. There were a few stains on the towels and sheets just because they were old rather than dirty. The bathroom is a fabulous size with a double sink that my friend and I loved. Sadly, the floor had painted tiles which were now scuffed and stained and the shower room had some mould growth. There was a mixture of choices at breakfast time (Asian, Western, fruits, porridge etc), but if you like eggs in the morning the choice is limited. Boiled eggs as part of nasi lemak and scrambled on one of the days during 4night stay. I would have thought an egg station would be more popular than a pancake station... Breakfast staff might seat you at a table without cutlery etc, and not think anything of it. I did wonder sometimes. The room was a bit of a let down from the pictures, but overall it was a comfortable room, everything worked, the location is great, the pool is a good size and clean, wifi was good throughout. The front of house staff were helpful when needed and really friendly.

Out shopping the whole time and did not visit the rest of the restaurants. We will find time to visit the Chinese restaurant on our next visit.

That's was fine if they mention clearly in their website and others corporate website because for certain hotel they do share car park with others hotel or shopping mall.

I was really shocked by the answer....any hotel still under housekeeping after 7pm??? I explained to the lady i really need good rest by now because i need to join marathon on next day. She told me the best she can offer me is wait for 30 minutes or change to smaller room with no view... I reject their offer because i already pay for the room with view why i should accept smaller room no view with same charges. After 40 min, finally room is ready for check in...

Firstly, when we checked into the hotel at about 230pm we were told by the front office staff that we could only have 2 single beds rather than a double bed. I had already booked for a double room well in advance but was told that if we wanted a double bed we will have to wait for another hour or two. I have never experienced such a problem before with other hotels and i couldn't afford my wife to wait because she was pregnant and feeling tired. We eventually decided to take the 2 single beds. Later that night around 1120pm i called room service to order 2 extra bottles of mineral water and it took 3 more additional calls to remind them before the bottles arrived after midnight at 1220am. Me and my wife were already so tired but were kept waiting for the bottles of water. The next morning we decided to order breakfast through room service. Fortunately there was not much delay for the food to arrive. After our meal we left the tray of plates and cutlery outside our room door and left the hotel. We returned in the evening to find the tray still there. At night when we left the hotel again for dinner we decided to inform the front office staff that the tray had not been collected. The staff said they will call housekeeping to clear it immediately. We were shocked when we returned late at night around 1230am to find the tray still outside our room. The tray was eventually cleared only the next morning. Another scary incident was when i was alone taking a shower at night when my wife went out with her sister. The lights in the entire room switched off while i was in the shower. It was so pitch dark and i could barely make my way to the front door just wrapped in my towel. Upon opening the front door the lights came back on. I thought it was a power trip but it happened again around 5 minutes later in the shower and after opening the main door Show more Sudhir , Singapore Sunway Pyramid Hotel 8 Very good Based on 5757 reviews We stayed at Sunway Pyramid Hotel more than 3 years ago and had a pleasant time back then, that's why we thought of going back. However, our experience this time is far from pleasant, even though the hotel has had recent renovation. Apart from the great location and the lovely staff at the Buffet Breakfast, we were disappointed because of: We booked 2 adjoining rooms for 3 nights as 4 of us traveling together. The aircon in our initial Room 10161 & 10162 had a malfunction as temp. couldn't be adjusted, but the guy who was sent to fix it on our first evening was so unprofessional - Not only he set the temperature to 27C all night, he made a remark that he'd fix it at Check-out, which was rude & inconsiderate, as this was our first night & it's not ok to cook us in a 27C hot room! Despite our complain that same evening, none of the staff offered us another room with working aircon, till the next day when another staff came to see himself that our room was no different from a sauna!

Gave only one room card when she said she would give two. Had to come down to lobby again when realised she only gave one. Her male co-worker was nice and gave us the extra room card. The previous rude female receptionist was beside him so when we walked away she probably thought we couldnt hear but she accused us and complained to her co-worker and muttered negative things about us. And she accused that we were like thieves because she thought we asked for 3rd room card. But we did not turn back because she was already rude before when we checked in when we didnt give her any attitude. Maybe she has personal issues in life that happened but she took out on her customers. Who else has she been rude to? Im sure we were not the only one. She said she would give 2 room cards but only gave one so when we found out, went down and asked her co worker for the room card, he gave but she was pissed off like we were thieves n other accusations as if we were asking for 3 room cards. The girl had attitude problems. Her nametag did not say she was a trainee, only her name so i assumed she is working there as a proper receptionist, not a trainee. My family and I have stayed at this hotel for years and we have always a good impression on this hotel, and we even recommended our friends. However, based on this experience and other issues we had in this hotel, it has led a sour taste in our mouth. I will not highlight the other issues because it is certainly the management problems. If the management is effective and good, then the staff will be trained good. But i will highlight this because it was dangerous: on the early morning that my family and i (females) were checking out, getting reading to go out, waaaay before the check out time, we have unlocked the door.

Excellent location. This hotel also received great review and rating. We felt confident with the brand. But. The impression changed as soon as we arrived. 1. Car park is extreamly narrow and parking bay is tiny 2. No lift from car park to hotel foyer. Luckily it was just few tens flights of stairs. But surely inconvenient if you carry a large suitcase 3. Ground floor is public area. Another lift ride to level 1 to reception 4. Reception floor is extreamly DARK! It might be part of the design to impress guests but it surely not us and the few others guests who frowned when they step out the lift 5. The only slightly well lit area is at the reception counter and lift landing area at guest room floors 6. Corridor leading from lift to room is VERY, VERY DARK! 7. Room is dusty at certain area. Areas which are visible to naked eyes i.e. counter top, window panel 8. Room is brighter than corridoor and reception but still not well lit like other hotel/hostel we've stayed before In summary. We felt uncomfortable. We did not appreciate the design and the overall feeling this hotel trying to create -- DARK!

So I came back to lobby and ask to switch the room with the one that has a door connection next door and the staff nicely switched my rooms. Sadly, the fridge on both rooms didn't work at all. 2.

Connected to Sunway Pyramid and Sunway Lagoon Theme Park making it one of the best choices if the travel itinerary including shopping around Sunway Pyramid and entering Sunway Lagoon Theme Park. Despite being surrounded by the happening Sunway Pyramid and Sunway Lagoon Theme Park, it is very quiet at night and good sleep/rest is guaranteed. On top of that, it is also very convenient for travelers who intended to travel around Petaling Jaya/Subang Jaya areas, by driving/taxi/ubers. Staffs are very responsive and helpful to our requests. Facilities wise, there is a swimming pool at level 8. Despite it is an infinity style pool, the view was not one of the stunning one. Thus, we have skipped it. We also noted there is a gym at the same level. Breakfast buffets provides a good variety of food while the taste are good as well. (Try their Nasi Lemak and rendang chicken, they are definitely one of the best) Price wise, it is slightly cheaper than Sunway Pyramid Hotel but definitely not a budget one. Would suggest the management actually further revised down the price in order to attract more travelers. Overall, it was a pleasant stay at Sunway Clio Hotel for us. Would recommend to friends who have budget for the accommodations. Travelers who are unable to get a room at Sunway Pyramid Hotel can also consider this.

It began from checkin and continued throughout our stay. On a plus note, for kids the facilities of pool and play area are excellent - but this is the ONLY positive. 1. Check in at 3.30pm, we had booked the more expensive 1 bed exec room. I had emailed 2 days prior requesting a high floor with a view. They only had a room on the 7th floor, which was basically an office room, with a great big glass walled room inside. It felt like an office space and totally unacceptable for a toddler. They told us the next day we could move to a high floor, but we could not stay in that room. Returning to the desk, we were told another room was being cleaned and we could move there after an hour. 2. We had a late lunch in their cafe on the 5th to wait for our room. The food was terrible, poor quality and one dish took 45 mins to come. It was cold anyway (Nasi Lamak) which it shouldnt have been. Terrible. 3. Returning 2 hrs later we were told our room still not ready, please 'rest' in our current room. We had a toddler that we wanted to settle down and we decided to go to the pool as we were just wasting time. Finally we got into the new room, on the same floor, overlooked a graveyard and by other buildings, so was very dark, with a very dusty/dirty floor. 4. We tried to move the next morning, told we could and packed up the room. WHen I phoned to double check was told we needed to wait till after 10am as there was only smoking rooms. Infuriated, we cancelled the move as we had plans with our toddler and werent prepared to wait 2 hours. 5. We had terrible WIFI, after this for 2 days I rang to question, long story short there was no router in our room. After a further 2 phone calls and 24 hrs later to service, the last one ending up aggressive, a router was put in our room. 6.

Cons 1. The check in time was too long. I visited this hotel during Hari Raya, while checking in, the staff asked me to wait and he will call me by name, I did expect the crowd, so,I was willing to wait. After waiting for 20 minutes, I approached the staff and he answered me he had a lots of rooms need to check in, but he registered my room for me less than 5 minutes after I approached him. 2. The location is far from all the train services even the grabcar service is also hard to get. the only advantage in booking this hotel is near KL tower and the view is good. 3. When I requested to make up the room, I realised the tissue paper was finished and didnt replenish, so, i called up the counter, they told me the tissue paper was running out, and they replace me two roll toilet papers instead. Also, the used towel was not changed to the new towel. 4. The restaurant was closed during the Hari Raya. I feel this is unacceptable. Due to the location, it is hard for us to look for the food and there is no any food available. 5. The television connection and hair dryer are very lousy. 6. The parking fee is expensive and too many lifts to use in different level, is too confusing. Show more Sin , Malaysia AVANI Sepang Goldcoast Resort 7.2 Very good Based on 5466 reviews Pros: 1. Quiet and peaceful stay. It's a quick gateaway for the city folks. Bicycle rides are available for the guests (if you're lucky enough to get one). It's fun to tour around the hotel and enjoy the sea breeze. 2. Good enough resort and room concept. 3. Check-In/Out time, buggy service experiences were decent. Cons: 1. Major disappointment for the breakfast and dinner. Cleanliness is awful. There are ALOT of flies at the dining area. Spent half of my time chasing away the flies away from my food. It kinds of spoil my mood to enjoy my meal there. Choices for buffet breakfast and dinner are also very limited and overpriced. For a buffet dinner, they only serve ice water and nothing else. 2. As for the room, please expect some friendly visitors during your stay such as lizards and bugs. That was expected however the major disappointment would be the air conditioning which was not cold enough and you could not control the temperature. Spent most of my time in the shower to cool myself down. The room can be pretty dusty with some dead bugs laying around. 3. For the facilities, I have only tried the bicycle rides. I did enjoy the rides but it was really difficult to get a bicycle during the peak time. Most of the bicycles which I managed to get were in the verge of breaking down. Summary: This would be my first and last trip to this hotel. The poor maintenance and cleanliness of this place/facilities are the turn offs for me. It's such a waste as this place has a really cool concept but the maintenance are not up to par with what is stated for a 4/5 star hotel.

The funniest thing is the spa, jacuzzi and sauna room don't provide any towel. We had to use the 2 swim towels for either spa or swimming pool. Only 2 swim towels provided in the room we stayed but you have to bring it to the pool and bring back to the hotel room after each use. My suggestion is, better don't provide any spa at all, shower rooms only have 2, you have to line up to take a bath. Please raise the hotel tariff to buy more towels, it's such a bad experience.

I chatted with the man to get some info if he had requested for early check in, but he said he did not. Double standard here. The toilet flushing system could not stop after we flushed it and thus cause the water running the whole night.

We were quite happy with the studio we had. It was large, comfortable, and very cool with two fans and air-conditioning. The bathroom was large with decent water pressure and the hot water supply did not run out at night. The room doors do need some WD40 very badly though, the creaking was loud and we could hear that the door of the neighbouring unit had the same problem. Btw, at prices starting at RM179 all-in on Agoda and RM190 via the hotel website, it would be good to have some basic cable TV channels - even INJOI would suffice. Local channels do get a bit tedious after a while. Lastly, while there is a children's pool on the premises, the hotel is NOT beach front, nor does it have any views of the beach. It's a 2-storey walk-up that actually faces a local housing estate. In order to access the beach, guests need to walk out of the compound, and go round the corner. It's just a 2-minute walk, however - so if you're ok with that, then you have nothing to worry about. :) Show more PAULA , Malaysia Lacomme Country Resort 5.6 Review score Based on 94 reviews Room is spacious But.. too spacious takes forever for air conditioning with 1hp to cool the room No basic amenities ie keetle, tea/coffee Bathroom too smelly even they put quite a number of mothballs Not suitable for family with children, karaoke just in front of your room, too loud until past midnight There is a pool, but bubbles everywhere and the water seems not clean My 1st and last visit to this resort. .

No shower at 1 washroom, we 4 have to line up for shower. 3, 2 rooms but one room's door was a glass automatic slide door, it didn't function at all, one of us was locked up because the slide glass door suddenly shut down & didn't work. We called the receptionist for help, he only said we have to contact the landlord, he couldn't send anyone to help. Finally we have to turn off the main electricity power box, and opened the glass door to let our friend get out of the room. 4. I have paid extra for an additional bed, but end up we only got a 3-folded matt, not a folded bed. 5, Clean bed sheet is very important for every guest, but our bed sheet was dirty & with many stains. The location is convenience and the swimming pool with nice view, but I rather to have a proper clean hotel room instead of this. We were so disappointed for this room & we even cant complained because reception said they don't in charge of room cleaning & anything. Never never will come back again.......... Show more Ken , Hong Kong Simms Boutique Hotel Bukit Bintang 6.9 Good Based on 3425 reviews When I made the booking, everything went smooth until the night my wife and kid arrived at the hotel. The night my wife and kid arrived at the hotel, they said the room was fully occupied. How this could happened? When I made the booking, I told them by note that my wife will have a late check-in as the flight will be landed at 9PM. At first the hotel is trying to accommodate this problem by transferring them to another hotel, but then the problem continues as the first hotel keep asking to hold my wife passport while staying on that hotel, what kind of policy is that? It is really ridiculous!! And then they tried to transfer to the second hotel, the registration went good, but then the horror came from the room, my kid crying because she wasn't able to sleep due to the dirty room and minimum of light, it will obviously make any kid under 4 yo will scare to sleep. And these not only happened to my wife and kid, there was another guests that had same problem as ours. A very terrible experience happened with this hotel, A VERY BAD booking management is going on this hotel. Please be careful when you book on this hotel, make sure you won't experiencing of what we just had. Show more Bambang , Indonesia The Bed KLCC 9.2 Exceptional Based on 187 reviews A niche concept of having a bed space just for sleep, most suitable for business or solo traveler. The hotel is new. The bed is comfortable and clean. Shower gels and towel are provided, and the usage of in-house slippers make the rooms cleanliness easier to manage. There's a need for padlock usage (available at $10 per lock) since shoes and luggage compartments require them. Otherwise bring your own. Breakfast is basic, but good enough for no frill traveler. The lounge is nice and kinda boutique style. All in all, a very nice concept hotel. I'll definitely be back for my next visit to KL. A special kudos to the hotel staff named Francis (from Ghana). The hotel seem hugely understaffed with just a guy practically everywhere, 24 hours taking care of everything! He didn't seem to even get back home during my 2 nights stay. I see him in the wee morning, at the front desk processing check ins, at the lounge preparing and cleaning stuff, in between the rooms cleaning up after folks checked out, and even late night responsibly tending to every patron.

First disappointment there is no toilet inside room. Its only on sharing which wasn't mentioned in Agoda while booking. When asked at reception he said hes not responsible. The room boy suddenly enters room though I locked from inside. When asked why no answer given. So always need to carry my personal belongings when going out Below listed are the cons 1. Site mentioned 30sqm room but it was only 8sqm 2. No private washroom 3. No wardrobe 4. No refregirator 5. No compliments like tea / coffee / water / brushing / soap kit inside room 6. Wifi is totally bad. Seldom connects from room 7. Heater may or may not work at the common bath room 8. No lift 9. No security Only pro is the location nothing else. If you are backpacker then shall choose as dormitory but not to be considered as Hotel. Show more Karthick , India PODs The Backpackers Home & Cafe 7.8 Very good Based on 734 reviews I needed an overnight bed in KL due to my airline changing the flight times. So I booked The pods,as I needed to be near to Kl Sentral for my bus from/to the airport. I was in a 16 bed dorm on 3rd floor,bed was comfortable enough-there are 2 toilets&3 showers for the entire floor for the use of approx 30 guests but I can say I did not have to wait at all. The breakfast was toast&jam-plus a green paste which I was led to believe is peanut butter. Coffee/tea also available. WiFi service was good too. Some guests choose to use there laptops/phones at all hours of the night in the dorm causing noise but that is not the fault of The Pods but purely the inconsiderate guests. Show more david , United Kingdom Vortex KLCC By Aloha 8.1 Excellent Based on 9 reviews Hotel Royal Palm Lodge 6.7 Good Based on 265 reviews upon arrival, the staff recognized that I was only passing through for the single night. I was asked to pay a deposit of approximately half the cost of the room. I'm fine with that. What I didn't appreciate was when I checked out early in the morning to catch a plane, I asked for my deposit and the staff looked blankly at me as he couldn't find the receipt. After telling him the amount, he then rummaged through the drawers looking the the money. He then opened his wallet and found a few small notes in which he paid me half of my deposit, due to not finding enough to cover in full. He then stated that there was a building tax and my remaining deposit was needed to cover the cost. As I was in a hurry for the plane, I just accepted the outright theft, but jokingly said I wanted a receipt to claim the building tax at the airport to which I got a blank stare. I told them I will never stay here again and will be explaining the situation in my review. I don't care about the money, it was the way in which the staff dealt with the situation of misplacing deposit that I don't like. Show more Daniel , Australia The Travel Hub Guesthouse 7.4 Very good Based on 825 reviews This review is for a 2 night stay in room 307 (Double Room). As stated in our previous review this hostel is great: the location, the amenities, the breakfast, the vibe, the polite American gentleman who checked us in\u2026 But after moving from the dorm to a private double room one factor greatly diminished our pleasant stay. BED BUGS. Having worked in a hostel before I would never make this a public comment unless I was 110% sure, but after waking up with tracks of itchy bites all over my body and then actually finding live bugs crawling on the wall there was no mistaking who the culprit was. There were also the remains of squished ones on the walls so I\u2019m sure we\u2019re not the first customers to notice. This is the first time after 9 months travelling in SEA that we encounter this problem and we felt like we should leave an honest review. I again reiterate that this was not the case in the dorm and for sure it isn\u2019t in all the rooms. Apart from this our stay was perfect, just have a check around your room before settling in. Show more Danilo , Brazil Sojourn Guest House 8.5 Excellent Based on 60 reviews The staff. One of the staff at the reception counter was rather rude. The foreigner staff (i think he's a Bangladeshi) was nice too me but he seems to be having a hard time finding my reservation since i paid the room under Agoda. Later, the 'senior' staff, a chinese lady took over and from that moment on, I felt soooo humiliated. The look on her face was like, \"Got money meyh? Owh.. No wonder la, using Agoda got cheaper price one\" She even scolded the staff for not being able to find my reservation, when she also can't find one. And thinking that maybe I couldn't understand Mandarin, she spoke to someone on the phone (which i think maybe some superior) and badmouthing me. I may not be fluent in her language but I can understand 80% of her conversation. Then after a 'few' confirmation on ID, finally I was able to check in. I've never ever stand in front of the hotel's check in counter that long in my life. She doesn't even bother to ask me to have a seat first while she sort the problem. Only the guy took initiative and offer me some tea. It seems that they have a problem with online booking and making it looks like our fault since we booked online. I saw their normal hotel rate on the counter top and I must say that it was wayyyyy expensive compares to what I got from Agoda. I guess that explained why she was not satisfied with me. Please note that I'm giving 1 star for everything, to make a pitch on this. In real, everything from value for money, location, cleanliness and facilities was great except for the one staff. Please also be informed that the hotel will be taking a minimum of RM150 for room deposit when you check in. Show more Fateha , Malaysia Check Mate Guest House 6 Review score Based on 335 reviews Stayed in this hotel for the second time. Decided to stay here again for this trip because of the good location where nice food and shopping malls is just minutes of walk away. Unfortunately for this trip, my stay wasn't as comfortable as compared to the previous. I accept the fact that for the reasonable price of the room, everything seems fine to me but not for the pillows. It stink and i hardly sleep well at night where i have to cover it with a towel to overcome the smell. I do hope that the hotel management will improve the room hygiene and maybe consider some repainting on the wall of the room as there are many stain on it.

The advantage is a great room for a lower price. The disadvantage is no wifi or cable tv in the room. We had wifi on phone so it wasn't an issue. The location is great, walking distance to Petronis and several shopping and eating venues. next door is a coffee shop with good food and coffee..A convenience store is also located next door. The room coordinator is very organized and even though we didn't see her, she made getting settled in very convenient using chat app. The room is upscale condo quality with premium furniture, fixtures and appliances in kitchen area.

Show more James , United States Le Village China Town 6.2 Good Based on 428 reviews Le Village is a wonderful place for budget travelers. Its cheap, you get good service and you are staying in an amazing location (for sightseeing, culture, food and nightlife). I love the easy going atmosphere! You really feel that Locky (who is running this place) likes to help his guests and takes care of them. I arrived late but even though he was so welcoming and gave me many interesting information about Kuala Lumpur and the area around it. The rooms are basic and nice. You can get towels and a blanket if you ask (and you get your laundry done for a short money). There is a cosy communal living room with chilled music tunes (and a computer you can use). They have book exchange and couple of games as well. You get free drinking water, coffee/tea and you can use the fridge. My favourite spot in this guesthouse is the huge rooftop with its many plants and the rooftopkitchen. The view over the heart of chinatown is authem (and the sunset can be too)! I met so many amazing people and had great talks here. Thank you very much for your hospitality! Show more Rebecca , Germany Revopackers 8.2 Excellent Based on 303 reviews Firstly, the location is great! Hotel near Imbi station, you can go to KL centre station and from there, go everywhere by monorail, express, train, bus. .. But on the first day we came, it was quite difficult to find the hotel. You should drop off at Imbi station and walking about 200 meter to the hotel, ask the people at the station the way you go. Second, the staff are very nice and friendly. They made us felt satisfied when change the room has window based on my booking. You must deposit 20RG and they'll get back when you check out. The room is small but clean and comfortable, breakfast jus basic, only toast with jam and hot milk-coffee, tea. Dont ask more with the best price and best place in Kuala Lumpur. Hotel with model design and draw in the wall really attractive.

It took me a while to find and locate this guesthouse. The staff was really friendly. When I checked in to my room, it was kinda small and no window. The shower was good and to be honest, I'm not that happy with the bed sheet. It doesn't look comfortable. My first night stay in this guesthouse was not that pleasant. My friend keep on complaining that every time she's about to fall asleep, she would smell tobacco smoke in the room. Plus, I was \"disturbed\" by something ( and I hate to say it, I think it's a ghost!) Since my visit was during the beginning of The Hungry Ghost Festival I believe it's one of the contributing factor to the supernatural phenomenon that happened in my room that night. I checked out the next day and just burned my 2 night stay. I was really upset at that time and didn't even think about asking for refund. But now I regret it. For travelers out there, whether you want to believe me or not, please don't go out traveling during the Hungry Ghost month. Show more Amanda , Malaysia Suzie's Guesthouse KL 8.1 Excellent Based on 708 reviews The staff were helpful and happy to look after our excess bags while we went out of KL for a few days and returned. The shower and toilets are clean and good. Room simple but functional including AC. Coffee is available all day and bread/toast/butter/jam for breakfast. The location was very handy - Chinatown is right there, Central Market just 2-3 minutes walk. Pasar Seni railway station is 2 minutes walk away, as is the stop for the free city bus to get you other places around KL city. If you walk through Pasar Seni station across the pedestrian overpasses to (old) KL station and across the other side then you are at the parks - Butterfyl Park, Bird Park, Botanical Gardens... with no need to be finding your way along busy arterial roads. Show more Phillip , Australia The Bodhi Lodge 8.3 Excellent Based on 775 reviews I booked this hotel for a weekend getaway with best friends. We were looking for a simple place to sleep within the KL Sentral area and we chose The Bodhi Lodge based on the good reviews. A few days before our arrival, Gigi (the owner, I guess?) emailed me the map and directions to get to The Bodhi Lodge which turned out to be really helpful. It's located around 8 minutes walk from Bangsar LRT station. It was a bit confusing to find the place at first but then I used Google map and found it quite easily. Me and my friends booked the quad room and we were placed in their new building, just behind their first building. The place was really clean and not noisy at all although we were really close to the main road of Bangsar. They provided water dispenser, fridge, and hair dryer in the common area. Two shared bathrooms, one of them was a bit too small for a bathroom I guess. The quad room was ok. We had two bunkbeds which made quite a lot of sounds when someone moves. The air conditioner was a bit hot. They provided lockers in the room, an electric socket for each bed and also a pillow and blanket. All in all, we were satisfied with the price we paid. The location was great, especially when you want to travel with public transportation or need to go to the airport in the morning from KL Sentral. Facilities were ok, sufficient for basic needs. I think this place is suitable for young couples or groups who just need a place to sleep at night. Not really recommend it for family with young children or old parents. Will definitely come back for a short stay with friends.

The room wasn't too big and it didn't have window, but it was ok. The room was spotless clean and it was cleaned everyday if you let them know you wanted it to be cleaned. The bathrooms are shared, but that wasn't a problem at all and they were always clean. The internet worked really well downstairs and the breakfast was very basic, but it does the job. The staff was really helpful. After we checked out, we left our luggage in a room cause we had a night flight. When we returned to pick it up, we asked the reception guy if we could take a shower before leaving and he said yes and he did even lend us two clean towels!!!!! I absolutely recommend this hostel!. Ask for a lower room as it has four floors and taking up all your luggage is not fun at all.

So, you don't have to worry about waiting in a long queue early in the morning when you needed to use the bathroom. - Not sure if they forgotten to ask for room deposit or there really isn't a deposit needed. I love that. Cons - The floor is rather, thin I might say? You can hear people's footsteps outside your room when they walk pass. In my case, I don't mind that much and still get my proper sleep, and who evens want to walk around pass midnight. Request for the rooms at upper floor, might be quieter than downstairs. - The air-con might be noisy too, but it didn't bother me much at night. If it does irritate you, just get an earplug and go through the night. Show more Foo , Malaysia Orange Pekoe Guesthouse 8.1 Excellent Based on 363 reviews My girlfriend and I stayed at Orange Pekoe for 2 nights. The room was spacious and sparsely but tastefully furnished. The bathroom was quite small and simple and there was only 2 power sockets in the room, both used up with lamps (the room can be qui're dim without them), so there's some difficulty if you need to charge your phone/ iPad/ camera/ NB in the room. The staff was quite hospitable and friendly, and helps with getting an adapter in a pleasant manner. However, on the second night of our stay, we returned to a room without any electricity- no AC, no hot water, no lights, just the stuffing air of KL. The staff explained that there's been some sort of power out for the neighborhood, but all around us the power was on Except our building. When asked if we can have a flashlight to pack (we have an early flight next morning), the staff only shrugged, saying they have candles if we want. In the end we laid in the dark till 5, in a suffocating room with generators humming loudly outside the room. The next morning the staff offered no apology, no explanation, no nothing, as if the whole incident never occurred. It was extremely disappointing to be treated like this, feeling like simply because we're getting a room on the cheap, we can expect no hospitality or care when shit hit the fan. Overall not a bad room if you don't want to spend much, but you can do so much better for just a little more. Show more Ji , Taiwan Travel Hub Hightstreet 8.3 Excellent Based on 129 reviews The location is very perfect for those who like night markets because it is right next to Petaling Jaya Night Market. It is also very accessible from the train station. Just a 5min walk to Pasar Seni Station then one station away from KL Sentral. Very easy to go places. Stayed for 3 nights in a mixed dorm. The bed only had one pillow, but the bed was comfortable enough. The bunk bed is kinda shaky. There are unfortunately no personal lamps, so it\u2019s kind of a hassle to turn on the room light when you have roommates already/still sleeping. There aren\u2019t room keys for guests, so you can\u2019t lock your room. But I guess it\u2019s okay because there\u2019s CCTV in the hallway. If you\u2019re the paranoid kind, just maximise the locker provided to you for your valuables. 2nd day I was there, the showers in our building were broken, so we had to use the one in the lobby. The breakfast was standard toast and jam with coffee and tea at The Attic Bar. No complaints, but the coffee got warm quickly. I think preparing your own coffee in the kitchenette is better. The walls are thin, so guests who are still rowdy at around 1am when the bar upstairs close can be easily heard. Facilities are okay, and the overall ambience is very cozy and homey, minus the noise upstairs. But that\u2019s what you get for booking a hostel with a bar. The staff is very friendly, and the auntie at the reception allowed me to hang around the lobby and use the facilities even after I checked out because my flight was late night. Overall, it\u2019s a nice place for budget travellers, especially if you like meeting new people. If you like more quiet places in the hostel, the kitchenette and the lobby are good choices. There\u2019s also a fridge where you can store your takeaway food, and the water is ice cold. I like that guests are expected to clean after themselves because it comes with the whole travel experience. I\u2019d come back, but maybe opt for a private room instead.

With a large bathroom, a queen size bed, plus a TV, and of course an air conditioner, it just good for me since I only stay for shower, rest and sleep. The hotel prepare two bath towels, 3 mini bar soap and iron can be requested at the reception desk. The rest of the day I was out for my 3 days business. Food were easy to find since it is next to Melawati Food Court area and in front of night market area. Taxi and bus just in walking distance and the nearest train station is at Wangsa Maju or Sri Rampai. However, I would like to suggest, it would be nice if the hotel can prepare 2 blankets although it was a queen bed. I do not feel comfortable sharing a blanket with my friend. Overall, this hotel is recommended to backpackers, budget traveller, or non-executive business stay.

When I first stepped into the premises, I was swept away by its interior and the decor that adorned the place. Dim lightings and wooden furnishings made up the cosy atmosphere. What accentuated the place even further was the smile and greeting from the staff (although, their lime green and sunshine yellow uniform were a stark contrast to the look of the place). I stayed in the three-bedded Male dormitory which consisted of three beds and a cupboard with three doors, each containing a safety deposit box. The room was small, making it a little squeezy. Otherwise, the mattresses, pillows and duvet were comfortable. For RM 40 (SGD 13) a night, this hostel is a definite value for money. The area is also well-situated, with nearby bars and food places.

So at last,we took our luggage from upstairs to downstairs.But things not finish.This night,I booked two bed for my husband and son, a double room without windows.When we put all of the luggage to the room and start to sleep.My husband and son to their dormitory.Unfortunately things happen,my 10 old years son told me,his bed has occupied and there were only one bed left.He can't share so small bed with his father.So I again told the clerk,I have paid 2 beds,why only 1 left.At last,he asked us to still stay in the triple room.After we carry all of our luggage upstairs.It almost 1 AM.

It is located in a Hotel which has NOTHING to do with Garden Studio. All the issues we had encountered: 1. Bed sheets had stains all over them 2. Towels were cheap and only two provided- when using the pool you are not allowed pool towels because you are staying at the AIR B n B not the actual hotel so they won't give you any pool towels. 3. Pillows on couch were also with stains. 4. The hotel staff refuse to help you because you are not actually staying at the hotel. 5. When using the pool the security guard told my mother to get undressed as what she was wearing was not a swimsuit according to his standard and pointed to someone in a bikini. My mother is 54 and was wearing a full coverage bathing suite. 6. The location is not near ANYTHING. There is no restaurant at the hotel, a small cafe with disgusting over priced food. 7. When asked the concierge for a taxi on the meter we would get a taxi not on the meter as one of them told us that the concierge takes a percentage. 8. The only good thing about this hotel was the unique pool, but it was closed 60% of the time because of the rain so only got to use it once and when we did we were discriminated against. 9. There is no air conditioning in the hallways as this hotel was initially built to be apartments. The lift is also slow as ever 10. Our key stopped working on the second day had to contact our \"agent\" who dropped us another key and some extra towels. DO NOT BOOK HERE, NOT WORTH IT WHATSOEVER! Show more Maxine , Australia Vacation Home @ Mercu Summer Suite 21 8.7 Excellent Based on 185 reviews IMPORTANT! Lengthy but it's important to consider the below info if you decide to stay at Mercu. This review is split into two since we had 2 separate bookings (one booking for 3 nights and another booking for 1 night at different suites). Our first 3 nights were absolutely amazing! Pam and Lilly were managers for the suite we stayed in and the KL Tower was literally in front of us as we stepped out of the balcony. Pam was very helpful and knowledgeable! She made herself available via text/calls throughout our stay. We had many questions for her as it was our first time in Kuala Lumpur, yet she answered all of our Q's (and much more!) with enthusiasm. The suite was very clean, had 3 beds and towels were provided for each guest. In this particular suite we had a safe, hair dryer, tea/coffee, washer/dryer, utensils, etc. I mean all the essentials needed to be at home away from home. This is where it gets interesting. Our final night we decided to stay an additional night, however all the suites were booked that Pam/Lilly were managing. We were referred to another suite manager, her name was Pie (this was not her real name but name that was provided to us. She went by couple different name. Another name was \"Lowena\"). She was heavy weight of Filipina or Tongan decent. Her demeanor was very dry and rude. She offered us a suite to stay in for 200RM (we paid less for the suite with Pam). The room had a horrible view, one king bed & one \"sofa\" bed- which were 2 cushions that you lay on the floor (it was 3 of us). No extra towels or sheets/blankets were provided for the 3rd person. The TV didn't work either. As we requested sheets/towels, Pie claimed that she will deliver it to us later because she was busy with another guest. How do they expect us to check-in to a suite with major essentials missing? As we wanted to head out for lunch, we asked Pie for the keys to the suite & 3 key cards for each person (each guest is required to have their own key card, otherwise s Show more Sahresh , United States New Town Suites 8 Very good Based on 218 reviews Ronnie, the hotel manager was efficient with our check-in & out. He replied instantly to our queries via WA. The room we got was a junior suite which is located at Sunway pyramid Hotel Tower East. Hotel New Town has a few rooms in Sunway Pyramid Hotel which is available for guests to book. The amenities in the room are very basic, hot/cold shower with bathtub, ironing board, electric kettle etc We wanted to use the safe box but it was not in working condition and nothing could be done about it. So we had to bring along our passports & extra cash along when we leave the room. The furniture in the room is rather jaded too; the curtains were tattered & the kitchen equipments were rather dusty too. It is not a room where we could expect to relax in for long as it has a dusty kind of feeling. So we actually spent more time out and only came back to sleep. Show more Tinawati , Singapore Excellent Service Suite at Times Square - Kuala Lumpur 6.1 Good Based on 405 reviews the service apartments they had is some of the most horrible i've seen and this was a 2 bedroom suite. 1. toilets has duct tape holding it together. 2. there were cockroaches in the kitchen. 3. there was no hot water in the shower and no water pressure. 4. all the furniture has stains on them. 5. some of the walls had bare concrete finish. 6. the beds were hard and only had 2 very thin pillows 7. the non smoking suite smelled like someone has been smoking in it. 8. the bedsheets had stains on it. 9. the units are so old, rundown and not even the same condition as the photos. 10. the air conditioning in the master bedroom wasn't blowing cold air. 11. after we got into the room the hotel attendant knocked on our door and asked if they can asked for the extra set of towels because they ran out of towels for other guests. 12. the chair in the vanity mirror was broken you can't sit on it. 13. the lights in the bathroom wasn't working. 14. the units was dusty and dirty. 15. there was no soap or shampoo in the bathrooms 16. all the water drains in the bathrooms rooms were rusted. stay away! stay away! stay away!! Show more Joseph , United States Placin at Casa Residency 7.8 Very good Based on 520 reviews I saw many complain for the check-in and deposit RM500. However, it is not a problem for us. We was driving from JB. We called the staff once we clear the Sungai Besi Toll and was requested to make a call again when we reach the apartment. Did make a call when we reach and very quickly the staff come to look for us after 5 minutes. Was bringing us to the car park and also the apartment. Whole progress took only less than 15 minutes. Its consider fast and the room is clean + spacious. Deposit RM500 was given during check-in. However, they also very easily return us RM500 when we check-out. Did not check the apartment very detail. Just hand in the deposit to us. So, i think RM500 also not a big problem for us. Was walking to jalan alor around 3am to have the supper. Its very near and very happening. Very easily to get the apartment by driving through the SMART tunnel. We saw the Hang Tuah LRT while we are swimming on the level 5. Its should be a walking distance even though we did not take LRT. Highly recommend this apartment. This is our first stay and i believe we will be keep staying next time. Show more XIN , Malaysia Dpulze Suite 7.7 Very good Based on 425 reviews I was shocked and horrified when I first walked into the Dpulze Suite room. It was in every way the complete opposite of the provided photos: a dirty, dimly lit room that looked more like a prison cell. With flickering fluorescent lighting, dirty walls and a kitchen that looked as if it had never been cleaned, I was absolutely horrified. I'm far from a clean freak, but I had to spend over an hour scrubbing the room just to feel like I wasn't going to catch something. The bathroom was poorly built, complete with the cheapest possible showerhead the developers could find. Entering the bedroom to finally go to sleep, I was met with the smallest, most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept on. The sheets were gray, smelt damp, and make my skin itch. All of this along with the fan, which could either be set to full speed or off, kept me awake until 4:00AM, despite the fact that I had an 8:30AM meeting. The bath towel was stained, small and hideous. I had to buy some washing powder (as none was provided) to was the towels before I dared to use them. If you are considering staying at Dpulze Suite, be warned: it is nothing like what's pictured. Show more Marc , Australia Summer Suites Bernice 9.1 Exceptional Based on 315 reviews Okay, admittedly, it took me 30 minutes to find the building, I guess it was partly my fault because I relied too much on Google Maps. I typed \"Summer Suites Bernice\" and it pointed to me a different direction. The trick apparently is from Agoda (or any other booking website), you click \"directions\" and it will provide you a more accurate picture of the area. Also, better if you look for MERCU SUMMER SUITES which is the name of the building. Anyway, while I was a little bit pissed, the moment I met JAHA and saw how friendly he is and apologetic, the anger started to subside. And it evaporated completely when I saw the room!!! Imagine staying at the 28th floor of a condominium which is strategically located in an area that is very close to the city center. The view of course is amazing, I remember taking a peek at my room window and saw the KL tower! While you cannot see the Petronas Tower from the room (it is being blocked by another tall structure), it will take you less than 10 minutes by foot to the towers and the Kuala Lumpur City Center. Aside from the glorious view, Summer Suites Bernice has all the amenities - drinking water (both cold and hot and room temp), plates and mugs and utensils, fridge, even iron and hair dryer! Definitely an upgrade from the usual hostel! They maintain it very well so five stars as well for cleanliness. The dorm type also gives you an opportunity to meet and interact with people, as a solo traveler that is one major perk! Others might find it annoying to share a room with strangers, but I absolutely loved it - I even ended up hanging out with one of my room mates! The building is located in a safe area so I didn't mind going home at 2 or 4 in the morning after partying at Bukit Bintang. Haha. If ever I go back to KL, for sure I will stay again at Summer Suites Bernice - the best hostel in KL! Show more Maecel , Philippines Times Service Suites at Times Square 7.9 Very good Based on 899 reviews I would stay here again! Great location! Staff were helpful and accommodating. The pool was fantastic, really big with wading pools at either end. It was a large apartment for two friends travelling together. Wonderful view of KL, comfortable couch, beds and pillow. The aircon, fan and wifi worked very well. The bathroom contained a shower, bath and sink, and in a separate room there was the toilet, bidet and sink. The room was a little dated, and some minor repair work is needed for tiles in the bathroom. The kitchen tap dripped, which we could hear from the bedroom. The lighting in the room was a bit weird as there was no major light in the bedroom. There was also a strange smell in the bathroom, which would probably be solved by running the taps. The location, right above a mall, is extremely convenient and a recognisable landmark for taxi/grab drivers.

The bathroom downstairs was not attached to the room but just accross the corridor.). The sitting dinning and pantry section was spacious & lovely view of the city and hills in the horizon. It was equipped with cooking facilities, washing machine & large TV. Eventhough the appartment catered to 6 persons the cutlery & crockery was provided only for 4 persons. Good if additional cooking utencils & serving dishes could be provided as well cleaning cloth & a mop. Most probably the staff would have provided them or cleaned the appartment had I asked them. When I requested for a iron it was provided very promptly. A small issue in the toilet was immediately attended to by the maintenance staff. convenient store was available on the ground floor.

I have requested to check in early the day before. Called them and they told me that there will be extra charges for early check in and asked me to email them the time for my check in so that they can tell me the extra rate they are charging. NO REPLY! Called them the next morning (on my check in day) and they insisted that NO EARLY CHECK-IN is allowed! We were there an hour earlier, they told us that they will arrange for us to check in but it turns out that WE WERE THERE FOR AN HOUR WAITING FOR NOTHING! NO EARLY CHECK IN IS POSSIBLE EVENTHOUGH I HAVE REQUESTED FOR SO MANY TIMES, EVENTHOUGH I AM WILLING TO PAY FOR THE EXTRA CHARGES! 2. They gave us the wrong room! Booked two one-bedroom suite but they ended up giving us only one one-bedroom suite and one normal bedroom as TOO many people checked in at the same time (everyone at 3pm) so the management got confused. We left after checking in, bumped into them at the lobby and asked them to switch the room for us. Two hours later, when we were back in the condo, to our surprise, our room was NOT changed!!! Called them and they asked us to change it by OURSELVES! HOW RIDICULOUS IS THIS? They offered to switch room with the other customer who mistakenly got our room without even cleaning it! HOW CAN YOU ASKED SOMEONE TO GO INTO A ROOM THAT HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER CUSTOMER WITHOUT ANY HOUSEKEEPING BEFOREHAND?! 3. We requested for two single beds in one of our suite beforehand but was not informed that they are not available until we asked during check in. All in all, the management needs to improve their service! Show more Poh , Malaysia Private Studio Size Unit Suite at Sunway Resort Suite (Pyramid Tower) 7.4 Very good Based on 33 reviews The Penthouse KLCC 7.1 Very good Based on 26 reviews We booked the presidential penthouse suite that came with the balcony with a view overlooking the KL tower. We enjoyed staying at the penthouse very much, with most of the facilities in working order. We would have preferred to have a dish towel to dry the dishes after it is washed and perhaps a mop to help with keeping the bathrooms dry. Additional towels would have been great to have to dry off after getting out of the jacuzzi. Note that the tiles leading up to the balcony are quite slippery when wet. It was quite disturbing to find the electric kettle filled with slime/mold at the bottom thus rendering it unfit for use. There was a slight confusion during check in where I was given the wrong room despite me very clearly mentioning my full name upon check in. The staff was initially adamant that no mistake was done and it was I who made the wrong booking. It was only after I showed him a private message I left on facebook with the management that he was willing to double check and apologise for having made a mistake. No harm done but as an aside would recommend the management to perhaps make the names of the units less confusing for guest and staff alike. FYI parking is RM10 per entry. Show more Mei , Malaysia Placin @ Crown Regency KL 8.3 Excellent Based on 115 reviews Ok, I booked this as an Agoda mystery 4 star hotel, so my review will be a little coloured by the fact that this is a serviced apartment - even though it is in the Crown Regency Hotel. The positives - it's large, airy and very convenient. You have access to the pool, a well-equipped gym and the other services offered by the Crown Regency. So, if you're purchasing as a serviced apartment (rather than a mystery hotel) these things are all great. The negatives: cleanliness! Ok, so the property was cleaned but the mattress in the main bedroom had multiple blood stains and yellow stains and no mattress protector - so the stains showed through the very thin sheets. The sheets themselves (while undoubtedly cleaned) had multiple ingrained stains all over them and were very poor quality. The main bathroom really stank and the master ensuite was not much better. We left exhaust fans on and sprayed deodoriser but the smell would not budge. The dryer and washing machine filters required cleaning (and servicing according to the dryer readout). You do not have access to the front reception facilities (you need to make a time to meet someone at the property for check in and chec out) and you are only provided with 1 key to your room. This means that for a group of three we had nowhere to leave a key and had to juggle times to 'meet up' so we could all get back into the room after our different travels for the day. Lastly, until I booked I was unaware I had to provide a 500MR CASH deposit on the property. I've got no issue with room deposits but would have expected this to be undertaken by a Credit Card hold - rather than leaving me with 500MR on the last morning of my journey. In summary, great location and size, good wifi, a good serviced apartment but NOT a four star hotel (as advertised by Agoda) and standards of cleanliness and linen were poor.

I had a hard time getting a stable network to download the PDF from my email. 3) Only towels, shampoo and soap are provided. Snacks or water in the home are chargeable. Though it mentions hair dryer and tv... it was not working.... tv was basically like watching pixels or **** 4) Walls are so thin i could hear the neighbours early in the morning and late at night.

You need to hire a taxi if you want to be dropped at the front of the hotel. The staff, mostly indians, are really lazy and are not willing to help. They wont help you get a cab, and are not even willing to help us contact the home owner of the unit we are renting. They just said sorry and that is it. It seems like they do not care about their guests. The hotel and the facilities itself is nice but i would rather have a modest hotel with very helpful staff. Especially since most of the people there cannot speak good english. Their english is really really bad. It is not tourist friendly. I suggest you take the suncity hotel, which is also near the area.

On the day of check in, i was told to pay security deposit RM600 but unfortunately due to i was not being informed earlier, i have not much cash with me just around RM150 that time. I trying to bargain with the PIC Alex that my friend is OTW and he can make full payment upon his arrival. I was being rejected and he even replied me that even the access card itself is more expensive than what i have on hand. This is definitely offending me to the max. Furthermore he says that the deposit requirements is stated on Agoda website, too bad I couldn't find it and he says will come back to me with proof but he also failed it!

The view was beautiful I must say! I sent a MSG to hotel via Agoda advising on time of arrival so our check in would be smooth. It was smooth and check out was good, they allowed us to leave our baggage in their office as we had a late flight. The shopping centre doesn't open until 10 so if you want to eat breakfast you need to go elsewhere. We travelled with friends and we were given different floors, we were not told that we could only access our own floor.

However, I feel it was misrepresented as there was no phone and therefore no option for room service, laundry, etc. as stated in the Agoda.com ad. I had a wonderful time and recommend these suites to all because the aforementioned was acceptable to me for the price I paid and the view and facilities I had access too. However, if you enjoy Lobby service, (I had to enter through the East tower and walk through the mall with my luggage to the West tower), access to a phone and other hotel staples, be aware of what you are getting. If you don't care about those things then the location view and access to all hotel facilities is definitely worth the money! Show more Crystal , United States Ran Pacific Serviced Suites & Apartments 7.4 Very good Based on 118 reviews Before i saying the goods, i would like to say DiGi users are experienced with a very weak telecommunication services. This is because when we arrived the lobby, we had called more than 10times to Mr. Yeasin to come down and lead us to the room but failed due to DiGi have a poor connection at there. Luckily, they provided us free WiFi, the WiFi connection is very strong. I am very satisfied on it. Back to the topic, when we walked into the room, the room look okay, but from the room decoration, we can know that, they did not try their best in maintenance the room to make it look more nice but it is just a very minor part. So, it is acceptable as the building was 5 yo or above (if i not mistaken is completed in 2011). Second, i would like say a million thanks to Mr. Yeasin as he is very kind and helpful, although sometimes we having some communication problems but he is still trying his best to help us to solve the problems. Example, we check-in at 2pm, after he brought us to the room, and we put our luggage and we left without closing all the air-con (i know it is not Eco-friendly, but the air-con is really not cold when we just open). We came back at 10pm, all the air-con in the rooms are still the same, only have wind but not cold at all, only the living room is function as usual. We called him at 10pm something and he came and check for us very patiently. After he also have no idea on what happening on the air-con, he call the technician to check for us. We really appreciate for what he did for us. Third, before we depart to Kuala Lumpur, i had called him for several times to ask about the location, hotel policy and so on as they are different management with Swiss-Garden Residence. He gave me a lot of information which are very useful. Example, he taught us how to come to the residence by using monorail from KL Sentral and so on.

Seriously impressed with the room. Very spacious studio and the cleanliness is top notch. Complimentary WIFI is seriously fast. Placed our booking a few days prior to our stay in KL. It is advisable to contact the owner prior to your arrival to avoid any delays or setbacks. As for us, everything was already prepared in the room including toilet amenities, kitchenware, utensils ready for usage. Location wise, its a great choice as it located within minutes of KLCC and Bukit Bintang, with public transport bus stop and monorail station) within walking distance.

The washing machine was handy and it was great having a kitchenette. The shower had good pressure and the temperature was great. It was clean and comfortable. The apartment complex is a little strange, it has a Tesco underneath it which is great, however there are a lot of empty retail spaces and there are a lot of bars, pubs. It did feel a little seedy in the evenings. It's a bit of a concrete jungle in there. Not a lot of soul. The process of 'self check-in' is a bit confusing. You have to find the right mailbox in building A and then you discover what apartment number you have, it may be in another block. So you then need to get to the other block. If you have a taxi/driver and lots of luggage make sure they wait for you to determine what block you are in. They may need to drive you further. It would be handy having more than one key (card), we were only given one. Also, the 500 MYR deposit was odd (it needed to be cash). All in all this place is great if you are travelling as a family and want to stay under the one roof. It's very affordable and convenient.

There is NO Towels provided for the swimming pool if you are a guest at this service apt, you can however bribe RM2 for a few towels from the counter.

When my wife entered, the 3 personals in normal attire were enjoying their lunch. Not until she picked her mobile to call me that these ppl realize they were not suppose to be in our room having their lunch and started packing their lunch and hastily cleared up the toilets as they had left it wet. We call the person in charge and he was very forthcoming in sharing expletives used to scold his workers and apologize for their mistakes.The account that our family had to go thru such hassle in and out of this building and each and every single security staffs are foreigners really does not justify their own ppl can simply walk into a guest room and enjoy their lunch without the slightly remorse on privacy issues.

We need to call the hotel to find out how to get to the \u2018hotel\u2019. The staff then told us the hotel is located elsewhere not at BTS but the room that we booked in at the BTS Suite location. The staff then need to walk over to help us with the check in. The lobby has several lifts however the wait time for the lifts are quite horrible. Long wait and it is stuffy. At first when we were shown the room, we are happy about the size and overall brightness and cleaniness. But the toilet ceiling was leaking when we returned to the room at night. We do not know what water were those. Gross. They do provide towels and toiletries x 4 sets. For the price of SGD88 for a apartment at BTS for 4 pax, I think we cannot ask for more. Show more Angeline , Singapore KL Homez @ SOHO Suites KLCC 7.7 Very good Based on 103 reviews I had the worst experience here. Before checking in, the owner asked me to contact Ms Diana for check in procedure. After checking in and getting the card from Ms Diana we went to the unit at 27th floor. The unit was very nice. There were two extra mattress given as well as extra pillows. However, it was like treasure hunt as we need to search for everything by ourselves. We couldn't find the hair dryer as it was inside the drawer of tv consul. I called the owner and she said everything regarding the unit facilities are managed by Ms Diana (and in the end Ms Diana solved the problem). During the two nights stay, it was great. The water pressure was strong, kitchenware are provided, towels and shampoo are provided, you can do the laundry (if you don't mind removing whatever left inside the washing machine). The building is in walking distance to Bukit Bintang area by air-conditioned pedestrian bridge (the bridge connects Pavilion KL and KLCC). Everything was fine until check out. I called the owner for check out and she said just leave the keys in the unit. My car was parked at the parking and access card is needed to exit the building. Fearing not be able to leave the car park, i asked the owner how to exit the carpark without access card and she said it's ok there won't be problem. And yes, I can't exit the carpark thanks to the owner. First i asked the security guard to let me pass and he refused. I called the owner again and she told me \"my customers always check out like this they don't have any problem also\". Kinda pissed at that time, I just asked her to solve the problem as I was rushing. Then, i passed the phone to the security (not knowing what she told him) yet i still can't pass. Called her twice after that, each time she hung up my phone after I asked her to solve. Then, I went to the lobby, asked for help from the management. Noticing my anger, she did not say anything and went to get the guard (she might just want to ask him to let me pass). A wh Show more SHING , Malaysia Summer Suites Ashraf @ KLCC 7.5 Very good Based on 59 reviews I wish that they would give two access cards with time limit and not one card. Every time I go out, had to drop our key and request again upon entrance on which the security had to ask a lot of questions. Super annoying! But the TV settings - we don't know how to operate it! Had to settle with local TV stuff. :( Charges does not include parking. Whole day parking is RM15 and overnight charge is RM30. If you park outside DBKL will give you a RM100 traffic fine! Security wise - the room does not have a security latch so if you stay alone, it will be scary. Bathroom smells like urine... There is a shower cream and shampoo but... it looks like a bottle used by everyone else - so, ewwwwwwwww. Good thing: Wifi was super fast. There's a washer & dryer in the room. So, awesome if you stayed in for a few days.

Most visitors to the city arrive through Kuala Lumpur International Airport, but the low cost carrier terminal known as Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2 is also a popular entry point for those flying with regional carriers. For those traveling through the city on their way somewhere else, there are plenty of hotels near both airports. However, if staying in Kuala Lumpur, there is plenty of accommodation in the city center as well. Kuala Lumpur is a very modern city with an efficient and inexpensive public transportation system comprised of trains and light rail. The Petronas Towers are one of the most famous attractions in the city. The connecting bridge between the towers provides spectacular views of the city and taking tours to the sky bridge is a popular activity for tourists. Kuala Lumpur Tower also provides an observation deck featuring 360-degree unobstructed views of the city. The 'Golden Triangle' section of the city comprises several large malls as shopping is a major attraction in Kuala Lumpur. The main shopping streets are Jalan Bukit Bintang, Jalan Sultan Ismail, and Jalan Imbi. The city's China Town neighborhood provides a great opportunity to indulge in Chinese and Indian food as the restaurants are inexpensive, authentic, and plentiful. A modern city with a diverse and interesting population, Kuala Lumpur is definitely a place that must be explored. There\u2019s much more to see and learn about Kuala Lumpur, and the interactive map is a great way to continue uncovering all the important landmarks and attractions of this vibrant city.
