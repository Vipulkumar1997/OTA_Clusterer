with attention to language.<br />\r\n- next to a rating in numbers, also consists of at least 20 characters.<br />\r\n- is a good representation of the stay.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>We will not

Organisation Jobs Affiliates Register hotel Press Releases Privacy Disclaimer Other question? If you are unable to find an answer here, please email info@hotels.nl Home FAQ Frequently Asked Questions Questions about the hotel The rates on Hotels.nl are per room per night. This varies per hotel and per room type. This is clearly stated on the website. The check-in and check-out times vary per hotel and are clearly stated on our website. If you intend to arrive late or very early, we request you indicate this in the comments field on the booking form. In general, there are options which usually come at an additional charge. For instance, this depends on the age of the children and can vary per hotel. Specific details are clearly stated on the hotel page under the heading 'Children'. A double room has one double bed. A twin room has twin beds (two single beds). This varies per hotel. You can see whether this is allowed under the heading \"additional information\" on the hotel page. Please note that a surcharge usually applies. Information regarding costs can be obtained through Hotels.nl or directly at the hotel. If you enter your destination and your arrival and departure dates, or you select the option 'do not know exactly when' and then click 'search', you'll see a list of available hotels. You can then select the option 'pets allowed' through the search filters on the lefthand side. If you're looking for a hotel with a particular facility, then enter your arrival and departure dates, or select 'Im not sure when'. Next click on 'Search' and you'll get a list of all the available hotels. You can adjust your search by using the filters on the left-hand side of your screen to select the facilities you're looking for. You can enter any questions in the comments field on the booking form when making your booking. The hotel will then respond as soon as possible. Once you have made a booking you can also ask the hotel a question by using the link and PIN code you'll have received after completing your booking. If you have any further queries please contact our Service & Support Department. You will find the hotel's full contact details in your booking confirmation; including the address and telephone number etc. Change your booking You can change your booking via My Booking. You can make changes by logging in with your booking number and the corresponding PIN code supplied by Hotels.nl.

Please note: the service charges, if applicable, are non-refundable and must always be paid regardless of whether the booking is used or cancelled. When you cancel your booking, you will receive an email confirmation. You will also immediately see a cancellation notice in My Booking. A booking is only cancelled once you have received notice of cancellation. Please note: the service charges, if applicable, are non-refundable and must always be paid regardless of whether the booking is used or cancelled. Cancellation policies vary per hotel.

If you enter your destination, number of persons and arrival and departure dates, you'll see a list of available hotels for that period. You can also search for a hotel if you do not have a specific date yet. To do so, please use the 'Do not know exactly when' option on the homepage. You can also search for hotels under a certain theme. The best way is to use the search option on our homepage www.hotels.nl. If you enter your destination, the number of persons and your arrival and departure dates, the database will then create a list of available hotels for this period. This list also includes prices. You'll find a map at the top of each hotel page. If you click on it, you'll see a map with the hotel's exact location. The address is also stated directly below each hotel name on our website. If you wish to search for a hotel that has a particular facility, you can enter your destination, the number of persons and the arrival and departure dates (or tick the box 'Not sure when'). If you click 'Search' you'll get a list of all available hotels. You can adjust your search by using the filters on the lefthand side of your screen. Here you can select the option: 'Disabled rooms'. This is certainly possible. You can contact our Service & Support Department. They will take down your details and preferences and will contact you within 24 hours to discuss the possibilities. Book a hotel When you see a hotel you would like to book, simply click on the hotel name, select a room type and you can immediately book the hotel by clicking on 'Book now'. Once you have entered your details and confirmed your booking, you will receive a booking number, after which we will send you a confirmation email. Unfortunately, this is not possible. You can book several rooms of one room type in one booking, but it is not possible to book two different room types in one booking, you will need to make two separate bookings. City tax varies per place; it's usually a fixed sum per person per night, or a percentage of the room price. City tax is not always included in the room price. The amount, and whether this is included in the room price or whether there will be any extra costs, is clearly stated next to the room type. Yes Yes, guests with a Dutch bank account can use iDEAL to make a booking. If a hotel allows this type of booking, you will see the iDEAL option on the booking form. Most hotels offer two or three guarantee methods (credit card / deadline / iDEAL). In order to provide you with a better service, we charge a service fee for specific deals. The service charge covers a small percentage of the costs that Hotels.nl makes to arrange exclusive deals with the hotels at very attractive rates. While making your booking, you can pay the service charge straight away by making use of iDEAL. If you prefer, however, you can also pay the service charge after completing your booking by means of a manual bank transfer. The amount can be transferred to Hotels.nl BV, IBAN: NL38RABO0162282117, BIC: RABONL2U. Please also add 'SK' (short for service charge in Dutch) followed by your booking number. Make sure to add the correct booking number, so that we can properly process your payment. Guarantee your booking with a credit card No. Hotels.nl will not charge your credit card. The hotel requires these details to be able to charge your credit card in the event of a 'no show' or a late cancellation of your booking. There are also room types that can be booked at a low rate on Hotels.nl, where your credit card will be charged immediately on arrival. This is clearly stated on the website; next to the room types in question. Please note that Hotels.nl will not charge your credit card, payments are made through the hotel. Yes it is. Your credit card details are encrypted and protected against disclosure to third parties. Yes. It usually isn't a problem if you wish to pay in cash or by debit card; you can specify this at the hotel. Hotels in the three, four or five star category always offer the option of paying by debit card.

This is clearly stated on the website next to the room type in question. It is possible to book a hotel room without a credit card, but not at all hotels. You can call our Reservations Department to help you find a hotel that can be booked without a credit card. You can contact us on +31 (0)50 -317 55 10. Our Reservations Department is open Monday through Friday from 09:00 until 17:00. This may have to do with the expiry date of your credit card.

Our Reservations Department is open Monday through Friday from 09:00 until 17:00 (CET). Yes, that's possible. Some hotels do perform an authorization check on a credit card to check if it's valid. This means that the hotel will reserve an amount on your account as a guarantee for the booking. This amount may range between the cost of the first night and the total cost of your booking. The hotel may take this precaution in the event you do not cancel your booking (a 'no show') or a late cancellation. The amount reserved will be released again after one or two weeks. However, there are special room types on our website that can be booked at a low price but have a condition that the credit card is charged immediately after the booking is completed, or upon arrival at the hotel. This is clearly stated on the website next to the room type in question. Questions about Hotels.nl If your browser is set to accept cookies then Hotels.nl will store cookies on your computer.

Guidelines for Reviews All guests who have made a booking via Hotels.nl will receive an email from Hotels.nl after staying in their chosen hotel with the opportunity to review the hotel and their stay. Besides tips and the pros and cons, guests can allocate a score in five categories (hotel score) and guests can indicate whether they would recommend the hotel to other guests (recommendation percentage). A maximum of 1 review can be written per booking. The hotel score is calculated as follows: It concerns a moving average of all reviews from the last 365 days (reviews older than a year are also shown). Only if the number of reviews from the last 365 days amount to 5 or more, do we believe the number to be sufficiently representative and will we place this score online. The recommendation percentage for a hotel is calculated as follows: The number of questions answered 'yes' is divided by the total number of questions answered and then multiplied by 100 (in order to arrive at a percentage). We believe that only a score of 80% or higher is worth a thumbs up. We check each review manually before placing it on our website. In doing so, we pay attention to the following points: We like to see that a review: - is substantiated by opinions and facts - is clearly written with attention to language. - next to a rating in numbers, also consists of at least 20 characters. - is a good representation of the stay. We will not place your review if: - insulting language is used. - a language other than Dutch, German or English is used. - contact information such as a telephone number, addresses and/or websites are mentioned. - fluctuating information such as prices are mentioned. - other hotel booking organisations are mentioned. - the content is too sketchy, for an example a review with empty words.", "content_length": "56596", "created": "2017-11-27T11:17:12.633Z", "digest": "Hotels.nl - No hidden fees and up to 60% off at more than 2,000 hotels in the Netherlands and Belgium.", "doc_id": "389dd4eb4ebf4de99c23357059064ffe", "expires": "2017-12-27T11:10:13.623Z", "favorite_count": 0, "filetype": "html", "has_cache": "true", "host": "www.hotels.nl", "important_content": "Customer service", "label": [], "mimetype": "text/html", "parent_id": "https:%2F%2Fwww.hotels.nl%2Findexen.html;role=Rguest", "role": ["Rguest"], "segment": "20171127111006", "site": "www.hotels.nl/service/faq/", "thumbnail": "https://media.hotels.nl/website/version:0.0.1/banners/icon.jpg", "timestamp": "2017-11-27T11:17:12.633Z", "title": "FAQ", "url": "https://www.hotels.nl/service/faq/", "virtual_host": []}
