The initiative is an extension of GTA\u2019s global initiative to help specific markets generate more business worldwide, and follows similar launches in Hong Kong and Singapore. GTA will work closely with travel agents to promote Dubai as a tourist destination, especially in Asia Pacific. Together with participating hotels in Dubai, GTA will launch the \u2018Only in Dubai\u2019 Strategic Partnership Program which will help tour agents promote exclusive deals to promote hotel stays in Dubai exceeding 3 nights. According to statistics issued by Dubai\u2019s Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM), the top ten source markets for Dubai in 2014 were Saudi Arabia at the top, UK at 3rd, and USA, Iran, Oman, Kuwait, Russia and Germany. India and China were placed 2nd and 7th respectively. Overall guest nights booked for Dubai hotels and hotel apartment establishments also increased by 7.4% in 2014 with the average length of stay increased from 3.78 days to 3.84 days. Cyndi Ng, Head of Market Development and Partnerships for Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa says: \u201cDubai is an important destination for GTA with demand globally, and the figures from Dubai Tourism reflect robust growth for visitors staying overnight. At GTA, we see the opportunity for further business growth which we hope to achieve with the support of our extensive agent networks. Following successful launches in other markets, GTA hopes that we can help our partner hotels in Dubai to attract more tourists, by showcasing the exciting and unique attractions that can be found only in Dubai. Through this partnership program, our travel agents are provided with the correct tools and knowledge to inspire holidaymakers from Asia Pacific to consider Dubai as an alternative holiday destination, particularly because it is just a short flight away.\u201d Known for its world-class recreational facilities and iconic tourism spots, Dubai is a holiday destination that offers unique experiences including skiing down the largest ski slope in the Middle East at the Mall of Emirates, skydiving above a man-made island, or swimming with sharks in a shopping mall. Only in Dubai, visitors can visit the world\u2019s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa tower at 828 metres, or spend an entire day at The Dubai Mall, home to 1,200 shops, 150 restaurants, an indoor theme park; an ice rink; a 155-million-year-old dinosaur skeleton; a huge indoor waterfall; a luxury hotel; a choreographed fountain; and a giant aquarium and underwater zoo, featuring sharks, stingrays, penguins and many more exotic animals. Visitors can visit the Dubai Creek, a saltwater estuary which is the original site where the Bani Yas tribe settled in the 19th century, where Dubai's historic economic activities like pearl diving and fishing once took place. Now home to the Dubai Museum, and alleyways of the gold, spice and textile souks in Deira, one popular activity for tourists includes a ride across the water at Dubai Creek on a traditional abra (Water Taxis). Other interesting activities includes spending an afternoon wadi and dune bashing, going on an overnight desert safari, or watching camels race at the Dubai Camel Racecourse.
