We act as intermediaries between accommodation providers and site users to provide an accommodation reservation service for hotels, hostels, bed & breakfasts, apartments and rural guest houses. Our service is based on the information given to us by the accommodation providers. We make every effort to ensure that the information provided on this website is accurate. EnGrande accepts no responsibility whatsoever for the accuracy of information provided by third parties, nor interruptions in services of any kind.<br />\n<br />\nThe mentioned websites, their contents and infrastructure used to provide said information, belongs exclusively to EnGrande. The user hereby agrees to use this website for personal ends which do not include the direct or indirect personal financial gain of the user. The user also agrees to use this website in a lawful manner and in no way which is prohibited by these conditions and the law.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<h4>Privacy</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>For more information please see the following section: \"II. Privacy Policy\" (below).</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<h4>Credit card guarantee</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>Our collaborating establishments require the user\u2019s credit card details in order to secure the reservation. This information is supplied directly to the establishment where the reservation has been made*.<br />\n<br />\nWhen making a reservation, the client directly accepts an agreement with the establishment chosen. EnGrande will directly charge the client\u2019s credit card a prepayment which corresponds to a part of or the total cost of the reservation. This online payment is made in EUROS (other currencies may be shown for your information only and may vary according to the exchange rates). When this has been completed, it means that the reservation has been confirmed and the establishment availability will be blocked for the dates of your reservation. The remaining amount of the total charge will be paid in local currency directly upon your arrival at the establishment (unless otherwise indicated). You can book for up to 20 people at a single establishment and for a maximum of 31 nights.<br />\n<br />\n*We have 'Secure Sockets Layer' (SSL) software from DigiCert which guarantees encryption of credit card data sent via the Internet, preventing third party access to this information. This software ensures that every transaction is 100% secure.</p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Pre-authorisations</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Some hotels have a policy to carry out pre-authorisations of the credit card to confirm the reservation. They may do it before the client\u2019s date of arrival in order to check that the card is still valid and to verify that there is enough credit to cover the cost of the reservation. If the card is not valid or does not have enough credit to cover the amount due to be paid on arrival, we urge the client to get in contact with the accommodation and provide details of a valid card. If there is an error during the pre-authorisation process, the hotel may cancel the reservation. It is therefore very important that the client makes sure the credit card used during the reservation process is valid and has enough credit until the day of arrival to avoid the reservation being cancelled. Should the hotel cancel the booking, please note that the cancellation policy of your reservation will apply.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>*BudgetPartner non-refundable rate conditions</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The establishment will charge the full remaining balance in local currency at any time after booking. If the credit card used to make the booking is invalid or has insufficient funds, the hotelier will cancel the reservation, and the amount paid online will not be refunded.<br />\n<br />\n*A BudgetPartner establishment is an establishment that has been directly contracted by EnGrande and is indicated with the BudgetPartner logo.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>PayPal payment conditions</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The customer must make sure that the billing agreement with us remains active until the check-out date has passed, to avoid the cancellation of their reservation. Should the reservation be cancelled, please note that the cancellation policy of your reservation will apply.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Fully prepaid rate conditions</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>The customer will be charged the total amount by credit card at the time of making the online reservation. This amount will be always charged in EUROS (other currencies may be shown for your information only and may vary according to the current exchange rate). Please note that if you pay in other currencies you may be charged transaction fees by your bank.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<h4>Cancellations and no-show policy</h4>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>BudgetPartner* establishments</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>*A BudgetPartner is an establishment that has been directly contracted by EnGrande and is indicated with the BudgetPartner logo.<br />\n<br />\nPlease be aware that all accommodation applies its own specific cancellation policies, details of which are shown during the booking process on the web page and also on the confirmation email.<br />\n<br />\nYou can cancel your reservation (as long as it is done within the time limit specified by the accommodation's cancellation policy as stated in the confirmation email) in one of the following ways:<br />\n<br />\nEither send a message to +34 647950766 via WhatsApp (available Monday to Friday from 9am to 6pm, Spain time), send an email to reservations@budgetplaces.com, or, if you have an account, sign in, click on \u2018My reservations\u2019, then select and cancel the reservation. If you don\u2019t have an account, go to \u2018Find your reservation\u2019, enter your email address and reservation number, then click the \u2018Cancel Reservation\u2019 button to start the cancellation process. You will subsequently receive an automatically generated email with a link to confirm and finalise your cancellation (please make sure you also check your spam folder). Please check your reservation confirmation email, which details the applicable cancellation policy, for further information.<br />\n<br />\nCancellation will entail a penalty fee equivalent to the amount paid online to reserve the stay, which corresponds to between 10% and 25% of the total cost of the stay at the accommodation. In the case of partial cancellation, the penalty fee shall be reduced proportionally.<br />\n<br />\nIf the reservation is cancelled by notifying us before 12:00 midday (local time at destination) on the day specified in the cancellations policy indicated during the reservation process and in the reservation confirmation, the client will receive a discount offer equivalent to the penalty fee, to use towards the online payment of future reservations operated by EnGrande. The discount offer shall be valid for a period of 6 months and can be used for BudgetPartner establishments only. Please note that we must charge a minimum of 0.30\u20ac for each reservation. EnGrande reserves the right to not award the client the discount at its own discretion.<br />\n<br />\nIf the reservation is cancelled by notifying us after 12:00 midday (local time at destination) on the day specified in the cancellations policy indicated during the reservation process and in the reservation confirmation, or if the client simply does not show up at the accommodation (no-show), without having contacted us within the cancellation period specified by the accommodation in the reservation confirmation, the accommodation will charge a penalty fee in accordance with its cancellation conditions. When the online payment has been made through a bank transfer (SEPA) or PayPal, the penalty fee will be charged by budgetplaces.com. The amount paid online will not be reimbursed and the client shall not benefit from the discount offer. Should the client decide upon arrival not to use their reservation, or to only make use of part of it, the accommodation owner has the right to be compensated according to his own policy. In both cases, the amount paid online will not be refunded.<br />\n<br />\nEnGrande acts in good faith as an intermediary in contracting your reservation, which is then confirmed by the accommodation provider. The accommodation provider is ultimately responsible for providing the accommodation, and it is the sole responsibility of the accommodation provider to respond to any incident with regards to the final provision of accommodation. EnGrande, in reciprocity with the user in the clause titled \"Cancellation and No-Show Policy\", assumes responsibility only of the amount paid online to reserve the stay. If and when fault or negligence is found on EnGrande\u2019s part as an intermediary in the provision of information, EnGrande will be liable only up to a maximum amount of the money pre-paid online by the customer.<br />\n<br />\nBy paying the Cancellation Fee Protection, if for any reason you need to cancel your reservation within the time limit specified during the booking process and also on the confirmation email, we will refund the amount you paid online; otherwise the same amount will be credited to your account at budgetplaces.com. (If you don\u2019t have an account, please create one in order to be able to use your credit towards future reservations.) Cancellation after the time limit or no-shows will still incur the fees listed by the establishment, the amount you initially paid online will not be refunded and you will not benefit from the discount. Cancellation Fee Protection is not refundable and does not cover credit you used towards the reservation.<br />\n<br />\nIf a non-refundable reservation is cancelled, the amount paid online will not be refunded, you will not benefit from the discount and you will be charged 100% of the remaining balance by the hotelier (if this was not already charged when the reservation was made).</p>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Other accommodation providers</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Please be aware that all establishments apply their own specific cancellation policies, details of which are shown during the booking process on the web page and also in the confirmation email.<br />\n<br />\nYou can cancel your reservation as long as it is done within the time limit specified by the establishment\u2019s cancellation policy as stated in the confirmation email.<br />\n<br />\nPlease note that fully prepaid reservations can only be cancelled by the customer through the confirmation email.  If you do not receive this email, please contact reservations@budgetplaces.com. By clicking the \u201cSee reservation\u201d button in the confirmation email, you will open your reservation page to confirm the cancellation. You will then receive confirmation of the cancellation by email.<br />\n<br />\nPlease note that the amount paid online will be refunded fully, partially or will not be refunded according to the hotel\u2019s cancellation conditions. <br />\n<br />\nWe remind you that for fully prepaid reservations charges and refunds are always made in EUROS (other currencies may be shown  for your information only and may vary according to the current exchange rate).</p>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<h4>Consumer obligation</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>In order to deal with any complaint, the consumer or user is informed of their obligation to present a complaint form in the service provider\u2019s name or by any other written means which states any breach of contract experienced in-situ, as soon as possible and within a maximum period of 48 hours from the date of arrival, both to the service provider (establishment reserved) in question and to EnGrande. If the consumer fails to communicate their complaint in the period of time and by the method stated, they must be able to prove the alleged breach of contract according to the established general proof criteria, and any damage caused by or made worse by their failure to communicate will be the consumer\u2019s responsibility.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<h4>Reservation changes</h4>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>BudgetPartner establishments</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>If the client wishes to make changes to their reservation, they can either send a message with their reservation number to +34 607605910 using our WhatsApp service (available Monday to Friday from 9am to 6pm, Spain time), or send an email to reservations@budgetplaces.com using the same email address provided when they made the reservation. This must be done within the deadline indicated during the reservation process and in the confirmation email, specifying the required changes. Changes to a reservation will always be made subject to current availability, prices, conditions and any active special offers or discounts. If the amount to be paid online for the modified reservation is less than the original prepayment, as penalty fee the difference will be given as a discount to use towards future reservations on our website. By paying the Cancellation Fee Protection, this difference will be refunded. Should the amount to be paid online for the modified reservation be more than the original prepayment, you will be charged the difference. We inform you that, once the time limit stated in the reservation confirmation email has passed, we cannot accept requests for changes to the reservation and the part paid online will not be reimbursed.<br />\n<br />\nReservation changes which involve reducing the number of people or nights in the original reservation shall be understood as a partial cancellation and, as a consequence, the Cancellation and No-Show Policy (clause 4.1) shall be applicable proportionally.<br />\n<br />\nChanges are not possible with non-refundable reservations.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<h4>Other accommodation providers</h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>Reservation changes are not allowed when reserving establishments from other accommodation providers.</p>\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t<h4>Liability disclaimer</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>EnGrande acts as a mediator (or) intermediary in the contracting of the services offered on its web pages.

We act as intermediaries between accommodation providers and site users to provide an accommodation reservation service for hotels, hostels, bed & breakfasts, apartments and rural guest houses. Our service is based on the information given to us by the accommodation providers. We make every effort to ensure that the information provided on this website is accurate. EnGrande accepts no responsibility whatsoever for the accuracy of information provided by third parties, nor interruptions in services of any kind. The mentioned websites, their contents and infrastructure used to provide said information, belongs exclusively to EnGrande. The user hereby agrees to use this website for personal ends which do not include the direct or indirect personal financial gain of the user. The user also agrees to use this website in a lawful manner and in no way which is prohibited by these conditions and the law. Privacy For more information please see the following section: \"II. Privacy Policy\" (below). Credit card guarantee Our collaborating establishments require the user\u2019s credit card details in order to secure the reservation. This information is supplied directly to the establishment where the reservation has been made*. When making a reservation, the client directly accepts an agreement with the establishment chosen. EnGrande will directly charge the client\u2019s credit card a prepayment which corresponds to a part of or the total cost of the reservation. This online payment is made in EUROS (other currencies may be shown for your information only and may vary according to the exchange rates). When this has been completed, it means that the reservation has been confirmed and the establishment availability will be blocked for the dates of your reservation. The remaining amount of the total charge will be paid in local currency directly upon your arrival at the establishment (unless otherwise indicated). You can book for up to 20 people at a single establishment and for a maximum of 31 nights. *We have 'Secure Sockets Layer' (SSL) software from DigiCert which guarantees encryption of credit card data sent via the Internet, preventing third party access to this information. This software ensures that every transaction is 100% secure. Pre-authorisations Some hotels have a policy to carry out pre-authorisations of the credit card to confirm the reservation. They may do it before the client\u2019s date of arrival in order to check that the card is still valid and to verify that there is enough credit to cover the cost of the reservation. If the card is not valid or does not have enough credit to cover the amount due to be paid on arrival, we urge the client to get in contact with the accommodation and provide details of a valid card. If there is an error during the pre-authorisation process, the hotel may cancel the reservation. It is therefore very important that the client makes sure the credit card used during the reservation process is valid and has enough credit until the day of arrival to avoid the reservation being cancelled. Should the hotel cancel the booking, please note that the cancellation policy of your reservation will apply. *BudgetPartner non-refundable rate conditions The establishment will charge the full remaining balance in local currency at any time after booking. If the credit card used to make the booking is invalid or has insufficient funds, the hotelier will cancel the reservation, and the amount paid online will not be refunded. *A BudgetPartner establishment is an establishment that has been directly contracted by EnGrande and is indicated with the BudgetPartner logo. PayPal payment conditions The customer must make sure that the billing agreement with us remains active until the check-out date has passed, to avoid the cancellation of their reservation. Should the reservation be cancelled, please note that the cancellation policy of your reservation will apply. Fully prepaid rate conditions The customer will be charged the total amount by credit card at the time of making the online reservation. This amount will be always charged in EUROS (other currencies may be shown for your information only and may vary according to the current exchange rate). Please note that if you pay in other currencies you may be charged transaction fees by your bank. Cancellations and no-show policy BudgetPartner* establishments *A BudgetPartner is an establishment that has been directly contracted by EnGrande and is indicated with the BudgetPartner logo. Please be aware that all accommodation applies its own specific cancellation policies, details of which are shown during the booking process on the web page and also on the confirmation email. You can cancel your reservation (as long as it is done within the time limit specified by the accommodation's cancellation policy as stated in the confirmation email) in one of the following ways: Either send a message to +34 647950766 via WhatsApp (available Monday to Friday from 9am to 6pm, Spain time), send an email to reservations@budgetplaces.com, or, if you have an account, sign in, click on \u2018My reservations\u2019, then select and cancel the reservation. If you don\u2019t have an account, go to \u2018Find your reservation\u2019, enter your email address and reservation number, then click the \u2018Cancel Reservation\u2019 button to start the cancellation process. You will subsequently receive an automatically generated email with a link to confirm and finalise your cancellation (please make sure you also check your spam folder). Please check your reservation confirmation email, which details the applicable cancellation policy, for further information. Cancellation will entail a penalty fee equivalent to the amount paid online to reserve the stay, which corresponds to between 10% and 25% of the total cost of the stay at the accommodation. In the case of partial cancellation, the penalty fee shall be reduced proportionally. If the reservation is cancelled by notifying us before 12:00 midday (local time at destination) on the day specified in the cancellations policy indicated during the reservation process and in the reservation confirmation, the client will receive a discount offer equivalent to the penalty fee, to use towards the online payment of future reservations operated by EnGrande. The discount offer shall be valid for a period of 6 months and can be used for BudgetPartner establishments only. Please note that we must charge a minimum of 0.30\u20ac for each reservation. EnGrande reserves the right to not award the client the discount at its own discretion. If the reservation is cancelled by notifying us after 12:00 midday (local time at destination) on the day specified in the cancellations policy indicated during the reservation process and in the reservation confirmation, or if the client simply does not show up at the accommodation (no-show), without having contacted us within the cancellation period specified by the accommodation in the reservation confirmation, the accommodation will charge a penalty fee in accordance with its cancellation conditions. When the online payment has been made through a bank transfer (SEPA) or PayPal, the penalty fee will be charged by budgetplaces.com. The amount paid online will not be reimbursed and the client shall not benefit from the discount offer. Should the client decide upon arrival not to use their reservation, or to only make use of part of it, the accommodation owner has the right to be compensated according to his own policy. In both cases, the amount paid online will not be refunded. EnGrande acts in good faith as an intermediary in contracting your reservation, which is then confirmed by the accommodation provider. The accommodation provider is ultimately responsible for providing the accommodation, and it is the sole responsibility of the accommodation provider to respond to any incident with regards to the final provision of accommodation. EnGrande, in reciprocity with the user in the clause titled \"Cancellation and No-Show Policy\", assumes responsibility only of the amount paid online to reserve the stay. If and when fault or negligence is found on EnGrande\u2019s part as an intermediary in the provision of information, EnGrande will be liable only up to a maximum amount of the money pre-paid online by the customer. By paying the Cancellation Fee Protection, if for any reason you need to cancel your reservation within the time limit specified during the booking process and also on the confirmation email, we will refund the amount you paid online; otherwise the same amount will be credited to your account at budgetplaces.com. (If you don\u2019t have an account, please create one in order to be able to use your credit towards future reservations.) Cancellation after the time limit or no-shows will still incur the fees listed by the establishment, the amount you initially paid online will not be refunded and you will not benefit from the discount. Cancellation Fee Protection is not refundable and does not cover credit you used towards the reservation. If a non-refundable reservation is cancelled, the amount paid online will not be refunded, you will not benefit from the discount and you will be charged 100% of the remaining balance by the hotelier (if this was not already charged when the reservation was made). Other accommodation providers Please be aware that all establishments apply their own specific cancellation policies, details of which are shown during the booking process on the web page and also in the confirmation email. You can cancel your reservation as long as it is done within the time limit specified by the establishment\u2019s cancellation policy as stated in the confirmation email. Please note that fully prepaid reservations can only be cancelled by the customer through the confirmation email. If you do not receive this email, please contact reservations@budgetplaces.com. By clicking the \u201cSee reservation\u201d button in the confirmation email, you will open your reservation page to confirm the cancellation. You will then receive confirmation of the cancellation by email. Please note that the amount paid online will be refunded fully, partially or will not be refunded according to the hotel\u2019s cancellation conditions. We remind you that for fully prepaid reservations charges and refunds are always made in EUROS (other currencies may be shown for your information only and may vary according to the current exchange rate). Consumer obligation In order to deal with any complaint, the consumer or user is informed of their obligation to present a complaint form in the service provider\u2019s name or by any other written means which states any breach of contract experienced in-situ, as soon as possible and within a maximum period of 48 hours from the date of arrival, both to the service provider (establishment reserved) in question and to EnGrande. If the consumer fails to communicate their complaint in the period of time and by the method stated, they must be able to prove the alleged breach of contract according to the established general proof criteria, and any damage caused by or made worse by their failure to communicate will be the consumer\u2019s responsibility. Reservation changes BudgetPartner establishments If the client wishes to make changes to their reservation, they can either send a message with their reservation number to +34 607605910 using our WhatsApp service (available Monday to Friday from 9am to 6pm, Spain time), or send an email to reservations@budgetplaces.com using the same email address provided when they made the reservation. This must be done within the deadline indicated during the reservation process and in the confirmation email, specifying the required changes. Changes to a reservation will always be made subject to current availability, prices, conditions and any active special offers or discounts. If the amount to be paid online for the modified reservation is less than the original prepayment, as penalty fee the difference will be given as a discount to use towards future reservations on our website. By paying the Cancellation Fee Protection, this difference will be refunded. Should the amount to be paid online for the modified reservation be more than the original prepayment, you will be charged the difference. We inform you that, once the time limit stated in the reservation confirmation email has passed, we cannot accept requests for changes to the reservation and the part paid online will not be reimbursed. Reservation changes which involve reducing the number of people or nights in the original reservation shall be understood as a partial cancellation and, as a consequence, the Cancellation and No-Show Policy (clause 4.1) shall be applicable proportionally. Changes are not possible with non-refundable reservations. Other accommodation providers Reservation changes are not allowed when reserving establishments from other accommodation providers.
