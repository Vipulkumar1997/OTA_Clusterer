Sandy beaches are extending over 40 km in the vicinity of the picturesque seaside resorts of <a href=\"/viareggio-hotels\" title=\"Hotels in Viareggio\">Viareggio</a> and elegant Forte dei Marmi. In the hinterland the white marble mountains of the Apuan Alps are gleaming. Many families come from everywhere to spend their holidays here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sandy beaches &amp; tourist center:</strong> The long beaches slope gently into the sea and are therefore ideal for children. A very popular destination is the former fishing village <a href=\"/marina-di-massa-hotels\" title=\"Hotels in Marina di Massa\">Marina di Massa</a> with its lively harbour. The more urban Viareggio, also known for its carnival and the neighboring villages Marina di Pietrasanta and Cinquale are all very family-oriented and ideal if you are traveling with kids. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Celebrity flair &amp; luxury beach resorts:</strong> The noble <a href=\"/forte-dei-marmi-hotels\" title=\"Hotels in Forte dei Marmi\">Forte dei Marmi</a> attracts everybody who is anybody. And it has been that way for more than 100 years. Luckily big and impersonal hotel complexes are nowhere to be found, instead elegant villas and luxury hotels line up along the promenade - the chic and unique atmosphere is unparalleled. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Sightseeing &amp; the marble town:</strong> The historic Pietrasanta - just a few kilometres from Forte Dei Marmi - is definitely worth a visit. It is located at the foot of the Apuan Alps and attracts visitors with the church of Saint Augustine and the cathedral of St. Martin which was already built in the 14. Century. Further north lies Carrara, which is famous for its marble quarries. Interested visitors can drop by the marble museum or go for a hike in the surrounding mountains.</p>\n\n<h1>Chianti: Wine, rolling hills &amp; medieval fortresses</h1>\n\n<p>You love good wine? Enjoy the wonderful rural Chianti region with its lush countryside of rolling hills, pretty villages, old castles and vineyards. The region is ideal for hiking and can be discovered by foot following the famous wine route \"Strada Chiantigiana\" or the castle road, that will lead hikers from one impressive castle to the next.</p>\n\n<p><strong>San Gimignano:</strong> The medieval town is probably one of the most visited places in Tuscany. But it is indeed worth a visit. San Gimignano impresses with the imposing tower houses that have once been built by Patrician families to demonstrate their power and wealth. Visitors can also admire some masterpieces of Italian art from the 14th and 15th century. Last but not least the charming hill-top town is also a place to be for foodies and wine connoisseurs. A suitable place to stay is the wonderful <a href=\"/hotel/hotel-la-collegiata\" title=\"Hotel La Collegiata\">Hotel La Collegiata</a> which used to be a Capuchin monastery. Today it is romantic and stylish 4 star hotel that guarantees a memorable vacation.</p>\n\n<h1>Maremma &amp; Etruscan Coast: Culture, Nature &amp; Originality</h1>\n\n<p>Pretty seaside resorts, pine forests and a luxurious marina along the lively Etruscan coast, a unique natural reserve in the heart of the country, villages untouched by mass tourism, archaeological excavation sites - travelers who want to experience culture and nature off the beaten path will love the Maremma region.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sandy beaches &amp; tourist center:</strong> The wide sandy and pebble beaches around the holiday resorts San Vincenzo or Marina di Bibbona are very popular in high season. Families with children prefer the beaches in Cecina Mare where the little ones can frolic in the shallow waters and pine forests offer protection from the sun. If you want to stay in style we recommend you book your stay at the <a href=\"/hotel/gallia-palace-hotel\" title=\"Gallia Palace Hotel\">Gallia Palace Hotel</a> in Punta Ala. This 5 star beach hotel will seriously charm you with its 60\u2019s architecture, elegant interior design and beautiful private beach. South of the exclusive marina Punta Ala with its sophisticated promenade and away from the hustle and bustle you\u2019ll find the seaside town Follonica and the fishing village Castiglione and its medieval fortress.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pristine natural reserve:</strong> Nowhere else has the old Mediterranean landscape been preserved as well as in the Maremma. In the Maremma Nature Park, also known as Uccellina Park, hikers can follow signposted trails, watch wild horses and Maremmano bulls and go for a swim at one of the secluded beaches.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Medieval villages &amp; archaeology:</strong> Only a few kilometers from the coast you will find medieval villages, mostly situated on hills, like Campiglia Marittima or Bolgheri. The provincial capital <a href=\"/grosseto-hotels\" title=\"Hotels in Grosseto\">Grosseto</a>, which is also the center of the region, is surrounded by walls from the time of the Medici. The city\u2019s archaeological museum is one of the most important in Italy with regard to the Etruscan era. Around ten kilometers from Grosseto the archaeological excavations of Roselle (the \"Etruscan Pompeii\") with Etruscan and medieval town residues are located- a must see for archaeologically interested visitors. Also worth a visit is Populonia - the town exhibits remarkable Etruscan remains including up to 3000 years old tomb monuments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Diving &amp; hiking:</strong> The Peninsula of Piombino with its unique rock formations is an ideal area for diving. In the port of Barrati interested travelers can book boat trips to remote bays or rent a boat themselves.

It is this landscape of rolling hills that people think of when they imagine Tuscany. However, this particular scenery is limited to the Val d\u2019Orcia region and has been declared Unesco World Heritage as an example of well-managed Renaissance agricultural landscapes. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Architecture &amp; culture:</strong> Montalcino with its narrow alleys and the impressive fortress is a popular place to visit and particularly well known for its famous wine, the Brunello di Montalcino. Situated nearby is the Abbey of Sant\u2019Antimo, a very beautiful Benedictine monastery from the 12th century. Pienza, situated between Montepulciano and Montalcino is an architectural masterpiece and therfore also a must see. The former village has been rebuilt entirely by Pope Pius II as an ideal Renaissance town and is the first example of urban planning. The historic city centre has remained almost unchanged since the 15th century - around the Piazza Pio II several highlights can be visited: the Cathedral, the town hall, the Bishop\u2019s palace and the Palazzo Piccolomini (former residence of the Pope).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gourmet food:</strong> <a href=\"/pienza-hotels\" title=\"Hotels in Pienza\">Pienza</a> is also a culinary shopping paradise. Along the Corso Rosselino foodies and epicureans can buy every delicacy the region has to offer: dried mushrooms, olive oil and \u201cpecorino senese\u201d the local sheep\u2019s milk cheese, to name just a few.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thermal baths:</strong> The region is blessed with a fair amount of hot springs.

Lively harbour towns, idyllic mountain villages and a rich and diverse underwater world - Elba is the ideal island for relaxing, hiking and diving.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tourist centre &amp; mountain villages:</strong> Those arriving by ferry first see the island\u2019s capital <a href=\"/hotels-portoferraio\" title=\"Hotels in Portoferraio\">Portoferraio</a> with the bustling new town and the historic old town. In addition to the busy and touristy seaside resorts, like Marina di Campo and Porto Azzurro, Elba also offers idyllic mountain villages - Marciana Alta, Rio nell\u2019Elba and Capoliveri situated high above the sea on Monte Calamita.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bays &amp; beaches:</strong> Due to 2 kilometres of sandy beach, an expansive range of sportive activities and culinary possibilities Marina di Campo in the south is one of the most frequented places on the island. The nearby bay of Galenzana however offers some tranquility away from the hustle and bustle. Further great beaches are located between Porto Azzurro and Rio Marina in the east, and opposite the harbour of Portoferraio in the north. Golfo della Biadola, north-east of Procchio, holds the title as the island\u2019s most beautiful beach.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hiking &amp; Diving:</strong> Elba is ideal for hikers and has many marked trails by which you can traverse the granite massif of Monte Capanne among others. Mount Capanne, Elba\u2019s highest peak (1018 m above the Mediterranean Sea), covers a large region in the west of the island and offers many hiking routes through a beautiful landscape. In the sea around Elba divers find a rich Mediterranean fauna - for example in the depths of Capo di Stella and Capo Fanzo.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shopping &amp; tourist attractions:</strong> On the markets in Rio Marina, Marina di Campo or Porto Azzurro you will find a large selection of local products like Elban honey, olive oil and herbs. Merchants also offer jewellery made from minerals found on the island as well as fine ceramics and pottery.

Toskana \u00a9 Hotel La Tabaccaia Tuscany: Most important regions and cities at a glance Versilia Tuscany: sandy beaches, upscale beach resorts & families The Tuscan coast can become quite busy in the summer months. Sandy beaches are extending over 40 km in the vicinity of the picturesque seaside resorts of Viareggio and elegant Forte dei Marmi. In the hinterland the white marble mountains of the Apuan Alps are gleaming. Many families come from everywhere to spend their holidays here. Sandy beaches & tourist center: The long beaches slope gently into the sea and are therefore ideal for children. A very popular destination is the former fishing village Marina di Massa with its lively harbour. The more urban Viareggio, also known for its carnival and the neighboring villages Marina di Pietrasanta and Cinquale are all very family-oriented and ideal if you are traveling with kids. Celebrity flair & luxury beach resorts: The noble Forte dei Marmi attracts everybody who is anybody. And it has been that way for more than 100 years. Luckily big and impersonal hotel complexes are nowhere to be found, instead elegant villas and luxury hotels line up along the promenade - the chic and unique atmosphere is unparalleled.
