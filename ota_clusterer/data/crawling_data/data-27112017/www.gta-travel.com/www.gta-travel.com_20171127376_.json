M&ouml;venpick Hotels &amp; Resorts benefit from more markets, more customers and more bookings.</strong></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>GTA, one of the world&rsquo;s largest travel wholesalers, has renewed its global partnership with M&ouml;venpick Hotels & Resorts. With nearly 80 properties in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, M&ouml;venpick Hotels & Resorts offer great stays for all kinds of travellers and experiences. Of Swiss heritage, the group is passionate about delivering premium service and culinary enjoyment &ndash; all with a personal touch. Committed to sustainable environments, it has become the most Green Globe certified hotel company in the world.</p>\r\n<p>Properties are&nbsp;now live&nbsp;for retail and wholesale travel businesses to book on TravelCube, Travel Bound and GTA or via XML feed. The enhanced long term deal further extends the variety of accommodation and experiences that GTA sells in over 190&nbsp;countries.</p>\r\n<p>GTA&rsquo;s dynamic inventory approach to such partnerships strengthens its connections with hotel suppliers and those who sell travel. It gives travel sellers and their consumer clients access to a chain&rsquo;s full portfolio of properties at the best possible rates, including the &lsquo;long tail&rsquo; of accommodation in less familiar locations. With travellers increasingly seeking out newer destinations off the traditional tourism trails, GTA can help hotels tap the popularity of experiential tourism. In the last three years alone, deals with 75 chains have added more than 30,000 properties to the inventory that agents and tour operators can sell on.</p>\r\n<p>Martin Jones, GTA&rsquo;s Senior Vice President for Global Sourcing & Product Development, says: &ldquo;We are proud of the strength of our long-standing global partnership with M&ouml;venpick Hotels & Resorts and excited to further develop our fruitful relationship. The agreement is key to GTA&rsquo;s longevity and success and helps us offer an even wider range of accommodation options in rising and already strong destinations.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>M&ouml;venpick has more than 30 new properties planned or under construction, including Chiang Mai and Koh Samui (Thailand), Palawan (Philippines), Dubai (UAE), Sanya (Hainan Island, China) and Djerba (Tunisia), but those already available to book with GTA include:</p>\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://www.kuoniglobaltravelservices.com/images/movenpick_hotel_egerkingen_219x143_0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"393\" height=\"159\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"12\" /></p>\r\n<p>M&ouml;venpick Hotel Egerkingen:&nbsp;Situated in an elevated position with breath-taking, panoramic views over the beautiful countryside of Switzerland&rsquo;s west-central heartland, the 4-star hotel offers 137 modern, redesigned guest rooms.
