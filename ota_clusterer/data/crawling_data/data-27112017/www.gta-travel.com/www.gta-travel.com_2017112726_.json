To lock in a price and not have to pay a deposit is the biggest bonus when booking through TravelCube, along with knowing this price is fixed! Kay Franklin, Managing Director, Jetset Travel Moonee Ponds - Australia TravelCube is without doubt my favourite wholesaler. They empower me to take control of my business \u2013 almost always instant confirmation of product, no deposit required, fixed price, highly competitive rates, payment can be made in the one transaction, so much choice for hotels, tours, transfers globally. All professional craftsmen have their preferred tools of trade which help them to achieve best results and I consider TravelCube to be mine. Connie Dziwoki, Owner/Manager, JETSET MODBURY - Australia I like using GTA as the product range is huge, and the website is simple to navigate through. The links with the maps are a fantastic help when I have not been to a specific destination. Craig Henderson, Assistant Manager, Flight Centre Darlinghurst - Australia North America Our clients in the USA and Canada access content through the GTA branded wholesale booking site and Travel Bound branded retail booking site. GTA has been a strong partner of ours for over five years. The entire GTA team has worked closely with our organization providing exceptional product, service and support. We look forward to continuing and growing our relationship for many years to come. Loyalty Travel Agency \u2013 United States I often book in the GDS thinking I have gotten my client the best deal and special rates. Today I checked Travel Bound and found their rate was less, including taxes plus a commission to us. The GDS commission would have been less. Cancellation policies are similar to GDS and Travel Bound pays promptly. Travel Bound is a great option! Beatty Group International \u2013 United States I had clients flying during the last great 20-inch snowfall from NYC and through the Travel Bound site all changes were made and the service was 5-star! My client thought I hung the moon. Despite arrival changes, the car and driver were at the airport to greet my clients a world away. You have made me a star with my clients and I always try Travel Bound first. Pearsons Travel World \u2013 United States I had a complicated booking which needed amending, which I wasn't able to do online. Your agent stepped in and made the changes, made an additional booking and got everything confirmed perfectly. She was wonderful and I appreciated her help immensely.
