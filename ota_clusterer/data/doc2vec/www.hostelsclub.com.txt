lovehostels Have you been in a hostel recently If you have you know it is a great experience but you may have also noticed that in spite of this some people keep making fun of this kind of accommodation If on the other hand you have never been in a hostel it might be you who keep making jokes if so we recommend you keep reading The best things about hostels are without a doubt the sharing spirit the happiness and the international atmosphere Not just a simple overnight then but a real experience in true backpacker spirit At the same time however hostels do not have the best reputation and theya re the object of negative stereotypes some people claim they are dirty and ugly somebody complains about the lack of privacy or services some even go back to terrible tales or urban legends following in the footsteps of the Hostel horror movie by Eli Roth Times have changed and HostelsClub com wants to turn around the reputation of hostels This is how the LOVEHOSTELS idea was born it is a campaign to fight stereotypes and promote the hostel culture With this hashtag we will gather many different features we will post articles on our magazine in cooperation with the hostels themselves we will launch contests dedicated to this theme and more generally we will be present on social media The goal we have in mind is to give a positive change to the mentality about hostels Many people do not know that modern hostels easily rival hotels design decorations a wide range of services private rooms not only dorms private bathrooms spotless cleanliness and attention to security Many hostels really do not lack anything and you can also be sure you will have a great time in the freedom of the common spaces the lounge area the shared kitchen the bar the roof terrace the game room all perfect places to know new people and never get bored If you too love hostels and if you want to help us crash the stereotypes follow and share our hashtag LOVEHOSTELS To find out
