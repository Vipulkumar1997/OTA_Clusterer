were driven to the mainland by pirates and looters Today the islands are Venice s suburbs and home to artisans workshops and theatres There are also hiking trails and of course Lido Venice s beach Lively beach life Lido beach is just minutes by ferry from the center of Venice This is a journey that many Venetians and tourists like to undertake on weekends Those who prefer peace and quiet should rent a bike and cycle a little further south where the beaches are quieter and more secluded Church visit to San Giorgio Maggiore The fa ade of the church of San Giorgio Maggiore made of Istrian stone is worth a trip to the small homonymous island The altarpieces in the interior were painted by Tintoretto but more well known is Sebastiano Ricci s painting Madonna enthroned with Saints which casts a spell over the huge crowds it draws Glasshopping on Murano Knowledge about the art of glass blowing was so secret that as recently as years ago glassblowers who wanted to leave Murano Island with

Venice s theatre scene Housed in a building reminiscent of a piece of Swiss cheese an avant garde program runs during the winter months which is highly popular with local theatre lovers During the summer there are workshops on mask making or acting which are popular with both Venetians and tourists alike Venice good to know Best time to go During spring and in the fall Venice is at its most beautiful Not only is the weather the most pleasant of the two seasons of the year at this time but there are also fewer tourists in the city and so the tourist attractions are the least crowded during this time In addition during the hot summer months the channel begins to smell while flooding occurs in the colder months And of course during carnival season in early February the whole city turns into a mad rush and feast of masks clothes and music Morbid charm The countless waterways and canals are one of the landmarks of Venice However moisture from the abundance of water also causes the plaster to peel off of the houses In spite of its splendor Venice has a unique morbid charm the slowly increasing decay seems to indicate that the city like everything else is impermanent Pigeons Throughout the year hundreds of pigeons populate Venice s Piazza San Marco The birds have a special status in the city and are almost venerated by the locals The reason for this is historic in the th century the Doge Dandalo communicated the victory over Constantinople by means of a homing pigeon The bird flew more than kilometers Since then processions have taken place every year during which the city s doges set flocks of pigeons free However to prevent the huge and steadily growing pigeon population from getting out of control there has been a ban on feeding pigeons since Transport Due to its unique traffic structure you must either walk or travel by boat in Venice In order to transport goods or loads the Venetians use a special handcart built in such a way that the many steps and stairways of the city are no problem at all The famous gondolas are used almost entirely by tourists nowadays while locals prefer sailing with boats of all kinds Romantically en route Of course there s nothing like a gondola ride along the Canale Grande especially at night when the moorings and palazzos are lit up on the shore and the canal shines in all its splendor During the day there is a lot of traffic and motorboats especially ensure that you can have quite a rough ride on a gondola The importance of art Just the sheer amount of masterpieces in museums and churches makes it clear that art is very important in Venice Not only is Venice one of the most important venues for art biennials but the love of art goes back far in Venetian history In the middle of the fifteenth century the doge of the town began to promote artists Painters such as Giovanni Bellini and his pupil Titian helped Venice to become the most important city of the Italian Renaissance The Biennials Venice is home to three world famous biennials Lesser known are the Architecture Biennale and the Biennale di Venezia where every two years the cr me de la cr me of the art world meets Both events take place across

Lafferty October This is our second visit to the Esplendido hotel I visited with my mother who is years old We had beautiful rooms with terraces overlooking the port The staff were all so sweet and kind every single one of them If we needed something or if we had a problem it was usually sorted out immediately We enjoyed the breakfast and had a couple of lovely dinners in the Bistro at night If I have one criticism it is the lack of storage space for luggage in the room My mother also would like to have had better lighting in the bathroom and a walk in shower But these are minor Overall it was a fantastic week at the Esplendido and I am sure we will return Rebecca Mitchell September What an amazing hotel through from the facilities to our room and of course your amazing spa The hotel was spotless for the whole weekend your staff are so friendly from start to finish my husband left I ll camera on the plane and they couldn t do enough to try and get it back which we did in the end I deafly recommend this hotel I have already done so to a friend of mine Claire Mccreedy September a very well run hotel excellant staff a very good location a great number of the staff were there last year a very good indication that the hotel is well run and that they look after staff aswell as clients john jolleys June Excellent in all respects Staff very friendly and attentive The only small problem was lunch at poolside bar which was disappointing and well below the high standards we experienced during our stay Eric heyes June Fabulous location beautifully kept grounds and excellent levels of cleanliness over the entire complex Even the standard rooms are fitted to a high standard and offer very comfortable accommodation The gym and spa were equally impressive and the provision of two restaurantes for breakfast is a really good idea with one for adults only and another for families The only small critisism is that the double beds have two single duvets which we found a bit odd and the hot food at breakfast was only kept warm which was slightly worrying You can however order fresh omelettes or fried eggs etc and these are prepared to order Julia April We love this hotel had such a great stay last year we returned for more of the same Nothing is too much trouble for the wonderful staff and the views are to die for We will be back Yvonne Lafferty October Excellent customer focussed hotel in a fabulous location Both couples seeking a quiet holiday and families extremely well catered for Friendly staff and first class facilities I just can t speak highly enough of this hotel David Russell September I stayed with my year old mother last week We had a lovely time The most important thing to mention was the staff who were unfailingly kind and helpful For example my mother had trouble opening the bottles of mineral water in the mini bar in her room Staff ensure that these were opened for her every day of our stay We had standard garden rooms which were very comfortable and quiet My mother said she could have done with more space to put her rather large suitcase away She also wanted a separate shower as for her it was a bit difficult to climb in and out of the bath We might choose a different room for her next time but for me it was perfect Food at the hotel was also fantastic The breakfast was a delight with so much choice tables laden with fresh fruit breads pastries plus cooked food if you wanted it We had dinner at the hotel three times too always delicious and always so enjoyable to sit outside on a warm evening looking at the water and the stars Finally Mum and I both enjoyed a massage at the Spa I went back to the Spa every day after that to use the facilities there after a day of running and swimming I cannot recommend the Esplendido highly enough Marvellous Rebecca M September A stunning location and beautiful hotel Port Soller is a beautiful bay the mountains behind the town are stunning The quality of the beach is perhaps the only weakness of the area Michael August Very stylish fabulous sea view great service lovely food This hotel is fantastic Don t think that because it s stylish and boutique that it s

absolutely beautiful great design and just set out in a way to enable total relaxation The staff were fantastic and couldn t do enough to help and always provided a friendly courteous but efficient service Breakfast was wonderful great choice of food and so lovely to sit out the front and watch the world go by while enjoying a leisurely breakfast Great pools spa was also fantastic and always had it to myself Can t recommend highly enough if you want some relaxation in the sun with great service Elizabeth Hindmarsh June Overall a very nice stay staff attentive and friendly Early arrival and room not available but treated to a complimentary breakfast which was appreciate and room ready exactly as advised Excellent breakfasts overall Did not sample dinner in the hotel because very few vegetarian options offered Room sea view with terrace very pleasant although a little small for the price paid Cleaning of a high standard although minibar and coffee restock fairly random but resolved efficiently with a quick request D cor in the room different and nice some signs of wear and tear in some areas of the hotel terrace walls etc Spa area was I think undiscovered by most guest and an excellent typically private retreat Unfortunately last two nights disrupted by first noisy very late night early morning swimmers this was on the hotel s private beach so a little disappointed this was not resolve the second night by inconsiderate adjacent room playing loud music into the early hours with terrace doors open this was resolved quickly and professionally by a quick call to reception Overall the incidents did not spoil the holiday and I appreciate the hotel cannot be responsible for all aspects of their guest s behaviour but none the less slightly disappointing for a hotel in the upper price range There were a lot of children staying in the hotel and the concept of a separate dinning area works well although overall the children were considerably better behaved than the guests previously mentioned Peter Frost June A boutique hotel on the esplanade with lovely views over the bay Our room was on the small side but well equipped and with a huge sea view balcony The included breakfast was excellent with a good choice from a buffet plus cooked dishes The smallish pool is on the hillside at the rear of the hotel where there are a number of terraces with plenty of sunloungers and chairs again with great sea views The staff were friendly and helpful and they parked our car for us in the small parking area just off the road high up behind the hotel The only problem we had was not knowing that we were allowed to drive along the pedestrianised esplanade which also has tram tracks to the front of the hotel When we eventually realised we drove the wrong way and were stopped by the police Some more detailed instructions for driving to the hotel is a must Alan Penson June Fantastic I think this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in From the moment we checked in everything was amazing Thank you Lin June One of the best hotels I have stayed in The place is beautiful with many different areas to relax in For us without children it was a bonus to have a swimming pool for adults only We had everything we needed in the room including Nespresso machine snacks and drinks DVD player plus magazines newspapers CDs and DVDs to borrow in the library The breakfast was amazing in a room with a gorgeous view the spa area felt incredibly luxurious Service was very attentive and friendly I could happily stay locked up there for a couple of weeks every year Val May Had a wonderful Easter break here quite recently The weather was reasonably good for the time of year and started to get quite warm towards the end of the week The hotel is a real gem and certainly the best positioned in the resort The facilities are first class and if you can stretch to a terrace it is certainly worth it We didn t eat in the main restaurant other than for breakfast The contintental breakfast was excellent however if you re into a traditional full English you d be somewhat disappointed We did have room service for a late lunch after an over indulgent evening which was excellent the chicken caesar salad is highly recommended The staff were very helpful especially the evening wine waiter whose name now escapes me All in all a really relaxing holiday We would love to return in the summer months to enjoy the sea and the pool areas more fully Andrea Gorton May Lovely big room overlooking the harbour beautiful view best in the bay and our own private balcony with comfy sun loungers Very friendly helpful staff Fabulous breakfast separate dining room for those who are child free bliss Hotel situated at pedestrianised end of the port so very quiet
