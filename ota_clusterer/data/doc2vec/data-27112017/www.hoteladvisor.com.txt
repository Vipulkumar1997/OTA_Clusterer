rate Good Lovely quaint hotel reception staff very helpful soundproofing between rooms could be a bit better breakfast time understaffeed and as such food not replenished for guests Marija Yugoslavia Overall hotel rate Standard Most of thing were OK the food was excellent and the accomodation was good despite rooms are very little But it is clear My room was on the bed position because I just entered in the restaurant I was waited for hours to enter in the room because of some problems that they had with the water in the bathroom They do not have internet access Denise Australia Overall hotel rate Excellent Great position and really helpful and friendly staff Scott United States Overall hotel rate Excellent Our room was comforatable clean and had a nice view of the Votive church The location was quite convenient for sight seeing being only a block away from the Ring The room rate included a nice breakfast every morning which we enjoyed before heading our to sightsee David Romania Overall hotel rate Excellent The hotel was very beautiful we felt like in a palace The view was spectacular too From our window we could see the Votive Cathedral which it was great The food was very tasty and the dining room very cosy The personell was very kind and helpful The shower in the bathroom wasn t working properly and the bathroom was poorly lighted Marianne United States Overall hotel rate Excellent The staff were very helpful and friendly Breakfast was nice rooms very clean and pleasant Debra United States Overall hotel rate Excellent This was a wonderful and charming pension The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the location could not have been much better I will stay there again on my next visit to Vienna Canon and Mrs S Canada Overall hotel rate Excellent We were very warmly greeted and since we arrived early we were given the choice of two rooms in different parts of the pension choosing one which we found very comfortable with a pleasant street view The breakfasts were ample The large gilt framed paintings the panelling and period furniture in the lounge added to the pleasant atmosphere The location of the elevator up a flight of stairs made a little difficulty for me as a year old handling our luggage which was the real problem as it was the solid sided wheeled luggage that is very heavy when carried The structure itself no doubt makes the location of the elevator upstairs necessary The numbers of the floors were confusing The elevator was on the st floor in English reckoning d in some other places and the hotel was up two additional flights if my recollection is correct But when my wife pressed she was taken far beyond because the Hotel Pension Franz was on a different numbered floor I think but that was months ago However this only provided brief comic relief as I had to call up the stairwell rather loudly to direct her back down again This lengthy reply could be boiled down to the suggestion that a A sign posted on the ground floor whatever it is called might indicate Press for Pension Franz And b This information could also be posted in the elevator And if it turns out that these signs are already in place it will only indicate the mental confusion which sometimes afflicts arriving visitors Glenn United States Overall hotel rate Excellent We had a wonderful stay at the Franz Staff were extremely helpful and competent rooms were clean and location great The pub across the street occasionally got very loud but of course this is nothing that they at the hotel could control It seemed to be a special case and was only noisy during the particular football match Brett United States Overall hotel rate Good The location was unbeatable for the price Very nice atmosphere in the common areas Plenty of hot water in the showers Overall after trying to find anything in Vienna that was near affordable we settled on Hotel Pension Franz and were very happy with our experience Did I mention the wonderful location The room was tiny After getting our two suitcases in the room there was JUST enough space for my wife and me Could have used an elevator to our floor when checking in out Aside from that couldn t fault too much Christine United States Overall hotel rate Good Lovely old hotel with lots of charm Convenient location Very hot in small room Borrowed a fan from front desk david Australia Overall hotel rate Good nice and central to transport no door on bathroom pub across the road a bit loud but other than that would recommend Harry United States Overall hotel rate Standard Central location near a Metro station Curtains draperies did not cover the windows Many burned out light bulbs William United States Overall hotel rate Good conveniently located helpful staff nice breakfast selections noisy at night bathroom drain sluggish Eldar Azerbaijan Overall hotel rate Good Hotel has very good location The personnel is polite and friendly Hotel is old fasioned and needs some innovation Georgy United Kingdom Overall hotel rate Good Large rooms and windows classical appearence of the communal areas friendly staff nothing to note Jodi United States Overall hotel rate Excellent I really liked this hotel It was very close to sightseeing we walked everywhere but also close to the trams and on a quiet street The room was really lovely decorated with antique furniture and we had a great view of the Navity Chruch from our window The staff was helpful and friendly with directions and served a very nice breakfast Beatrice Canada Overall hotel rate Excellent Perfect location walking distance to Ring clean nice rooms breakfast very good The way the Motel is being decorated makes you feel like you step back in time which is one of the best experiences when it comes to Vienna Motel is in a building and there is no elevator right at the entrance and Motel has no parking you have to park at a public parking and they give you a ticket which gives you a discount but still very expensive X

Clean room and bathroom Excellent buffet breakfast Helpful and courteous staff Good value Monica New Zealand Overall hotel rate Excellent During both this stay and my previous one at this hotel I found the Reception staff very friendly and helpful with a good command of English useful as I speak very little German On this occasion they worked very hard to secure me a taxi to the airport when the police had cordoned off the central city because of a bomb scare The Drei Kronen offers excellent value for money at a central location in Vienna where most hotels are much more expensive Although the rooms are fairly basic in terms of amenities they are clean and well serviced Breakfast is wonderful Although the basic level of amenities is generally acceptable given the room price I wish they could install hair dryers Although one can be temporarily borrowed from Reception this is a real inconvenience All other European star hotels I ve stayed in over recent years provide them in the rooms
