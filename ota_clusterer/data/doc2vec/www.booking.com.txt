realize that when you are crossing the street you have to look RIGHT instead of left everything else falls into place I was pleasantly surprised of how easy it was to learn and use the underground Makes moving around central London much easier apriante Italy This city is always a gift anytime of the year for whatever This city is always a gift anytime of the year for whatever reason you go Efficient and beautiful Full of vibes difficult to be explained through words The only problem is that now London has become a construction site where ugly buildings are being raised from the ground in areas that have historic flavors This is something I really don t understand Victoria United States of America So much to see and do So much to see and do Public transportation is spot on easy to use and accessible any time day or night Most tourist spots easy to access on regular transportation lines Visit big spots early morning or late afternoon The London Pass gets you a lot for your money

Private Double Room Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device We felt very uncomfortable from the time we walked in The staff was nice but the atmosphere was uneasy There was no TV in the room no bath cloths to shower with we were not able to adjust the air heat because they had a locked box around the control panel no phone in the room to call down and request any For us to get in touch with someone we would have to go down flights of stairs outside walk across a courtyard that had the potential to be a nice area but was dirty then into the main house There was an old washer and dryer seating by the fence that was rusted It was just dirty If you are looking to be comfortable in all aspects THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LAY YOUR HEAD AT AM and be up and gone the next morning this might work for you but be very LEARY of the stairs leading up to your little room There s a great potential for you to fall and tumble down I didn t find those to be

Interrail style Leisure trip Solo traveler Private Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device One day breakfast was not available until promised This is a hostel with a few private rooms It is mostly frequented by young Europeans This gives it a Lonely Planet or Interrail atmosphere August Anonymous Philippines Reviews The staff are very accommodating Leisure trip Solo traveler Bed in

location Leisure trip Group Private Double Room Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device Place is old but then it adds quite a bit of character to it Stair to access our room is pretty steep I didn t mind but definitely not for those with bad knees I think the place has easily accessible rooms so I suggest calling the facility first before booking to make sure ground floor rooms are available Water pressure in second floor would drop significantly when someone from ground floor is taking a shower Great customer service allowed us to keep our parking spot for a few more hours after check out Probably one of best valued place considering accessibility Gated resonably price parking I ve seen some travelers who gave this place very bad reviews Hahaha They don t want to pay big bucks but are expecting a Ritz Carlton July David United Kingdom Reviews Great value Leisure trip Couple Bed in Bed Mixed Dormitory Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Bathrooms could do with an upgrade and a bit more clean Great value for money Close to lots of stuff to do and eat Fun staff and an almost homely feel to the place July Anonymous Spain review Very dirty Leisure trip Group Bed

sightseeing and partying July Shelby Canada review Would stay here again great price good location Leisure trip Solo traveler Bed in Bed Mixed Dormitory Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The hostel was fairly clean given that there were of us in a room The staff were friendly and the whole atmosphere of the place is very welcoming Met some great people staying here The light in our room stopped working after my first night and it was never fixed during my four night stay The hostel is in walking distance of the Quarter even though it s right in the edge and I had no trouble travelling by foot all day Ask the staff for recommendations for anything or check out the boards at the front desk for ideas on what to do each day And bring earplugs the hostel location is quiet but your roommates and maybe yourself will all be sleeping at different hours June Kitty United States of America Reviews Fun hostel on the edge of the French Quarter Leisure trip Couple Private Double

small move I asked to fix it and it was fixed but began to squeak loudly some greasing for bed joints would be helpful Local Wifi didn t work on my phone maybe its OS was little obsolete or something but in other places it was ok that was a trouble And I wish breakfast included something not sweet like eggs or cheese or beacon or better oysters I liked staying there a lot Nice staff location etc

French Quarter points of interest Nice house and nice atmosphere April Chris United Kingdom Reviews Great location friendly staff Leisure trip Couple Private Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a

in the middle of the night to find my door had come open It was really hard to lock the door when I was going out No soap or towels in the room which I found out as I was ready to get in the shower so just cleaned off as best I could They did send me on kind of wild goose chase at night in the dark I eventually figured things out on my own but never found the place recommended to go grab a sandwhich but no one s fault as it was at night a s time visit so I found a bar on Royal Street with good food and a nice place Location was good close to walk to Bourbon Street Nice people who worked there and nice to have the free Wi Fi Decent value as it was a very busy weekend and it is a hostel It was okay for the night I needed it so it worked out fine It was a few blocks away from Bourbon

the location Such a low nightly rate is unheard of in this area in San Diego Additionally the fact that the motel did not require a deposit from its guests was added bonus Hotel Aqua Mar Great location close to San Diego Airport but not a generic airport hotel The price was right so it s hard to complain about things that would be issues at a nicer more expensive property at the price it was just fine A motel with some age showing but certainly nicer than many roadside motels Hotel Iris Mission Valley San Diego Zoo SeaWorld We came to San Diego for a family reunion We had rooms at this hotel for family A very basic no frills motel The women at the front desk were very accommodating to try to group the rooms as close as possible Super Sea World Zoo Area For a motel its really nice inside You can find parking but the spaces are really tight The staff was really nice I stayed here bc I can t afford the hotel price and I just moved here So it was a temporary stay Maybe in the future they will allow us to do monthly stays Considering cost of living is so high in San Diego EZ Motel Old Town Considering this motel is right in the center of San Diego it s a great value for the

Solo traveler Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights The reception staff didnt know english Creates a problem for visitors like me who don t know Turkish Only staff at the hotel No lift I was lucky to be on ground floor The reception staff was very good and courteous and tried to help me in all possible ways Also offered me Turkish tea times November Waad Iraq Age group Reviews Fair Leisure trip Couple One Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device No elevator so u could imagine how difficult to take the bags to the fifth floor or take them down and if you stay for long periods it s difficult to get the stairs daily or at least ask for the first or second floors also the stairs are so narrow and sharp No parking area if you had car doesn t recommend its The heating system not working so its cold apartment only one air conditioner in the room work Its location near taqseem sq But its little far in comparison with other hotels and suites in the area its location at the end of the street with little down of hill and the street is narrow and scary at night There is balcony in the apartment but with bad views only building around you Low ceiling in the bed room may be because its in the fifth floor Friendly staff but not talk English so it s difficult to communicate with them clean apartment with semi full equipment in the apartment October Yusrina Yusup Malaysia Reviews Comfortable place to stay Leisure trip Group Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights The only drawback is the size of the bathroom It is small but I think everywhere in Istanbul is the same Comfortable place to stay The owner is awesome and accommodating He replies to my inquiry fast He also helps to carry our super duper heavy luggage to highest floor The place is just few meter from Taksim Square and lots of food nearby The room is super clean and they have everything we need Highly recommend September Lamia Saudi Arabia Reviews the apartment was clean and has all what I need Leisure trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights the wi fi was not that good it was slow and stopped many times I would appreciate more if the staff knows English the apartment was clean and has all what I need August Esam United Kingdom review Will come back again at this place Leisure trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device No washing machine Considerring taksimum suits are apartments a washing machine should be fitted as there is room in the kitchen under the cupboards location and staff were all helpful despite the limited English language However they tried their best to make us comfortable August Masroor Saudi Arabia Reviews A great place in the heart of Istanbul for families Leisure trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The taximum suites was a great place to stay especially because of its comfort and its great caring and conscientious staff Our family had comfortable stay there It was walking dinstance from taxim square Highly recommended for families August Dr United Kingdom review Excellent and comfortable Leisure trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The street the property on like many in Istanbul is steep if walking is an issue For us it was okay Spacious bedroom flat and clean It has AC in both bedrooms Has a good kitchen and hot water Safe and quiet property Good wifi and many shops close by Location is very close to Taqsim square and Istiklal street There is a modern car park close by Very friendly staff with one who can be contacted if you need to communicate in English June Mohamad Bashir United Arab Emirates Age group Reviews

Angeles has the same problems as most American cities rough highly congested streets poor public transportation and very poorly organized services like taxis As far as the transportation situation is concerned Uber and similar services are helping one hopes that the urban fathers don t strangle such improvements with rules and regulations kathleen United States of America We drove our car and thanks to gps getting around went well We drove our car and thanks to gps getting around went well Three day in Los Angeles isn t much time but we enjoyed everything we could fit into hours Universal studios was magical Loved it all mona United States of America Not impressed with LA hollywood area was disappointing Not impressed with LA hollywood area was disappointing looked old and alot of homeless We went to Santa Monica beach and that to was disappointing pier was super small and nothing really to do wont be going back There was a small bowling ally we had luch and the food and people were very nice Frank United States of America I like that there is something for everyone s interest I like that there is something for everyone s interest and taste in LA I always make stops at Phillipe s restaurant near Union station for their famous French dip sandwiches and the Gumbo Pot at the Farmer s market near the Grove for their Cajun food I find that you can just take the metro train and bus and it will take you anywhere you would like to go instead of dealing with local traffic by car I always take the Flyaway bus from and to LAX from Union station to get to the airport from downtown Hotels That Guests Love in Los Angeles Beverly Laurel Motor Hotel The medium scale hotel in LA not very nearby downtown but surrounding of the hotels has enough to offer The personal

surprise for food and meals A cut above at extremely competitive price given what it is catering for October Robyn Australia review Perfect place to stay for families with young kids Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Now this is getting picky the only thing I would say was that the lounge wasn t too comfy The unit was great with comfy beds and well equipped The staff were friendly helpful and it was close to shops within walking distance to restaurants and fast food You could buy well priced theme park tickets at the front desk which took the stress out buying online printing coupons etc etc October Sheryl New Zealand Reviews Enjoyed our family stay at Turtle Beach Resort Next time we will pre book shuttles or hire a car Leisure trip Family with young children rooms Stayed nights There was nothing at the Resort we didn t like We had problems with booking a shuttle to theme parks etc as the shuttles were fully booked We recommend shuttles are pre booked on check in or before arriving as public shuttles are expensive and can take hours to get back to where you are staying There is a bus stop outside the resort every minutes that will take you to Broadbeach and Pacific Fair shopping mall The facilities and staff were excellent Great for a family holiday October Gayle Australia review Enjoyed every moment at Turtle beach

gardens and BBQ areas Excellent resort for families Would happily stay again September Fiona Australia Reviews Family friendly lots of fun would stay again Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights The pool area next to the restaurant did not have enough folding chairs to sit around on My wife and I could never get a seat to sit down and watch our kids in the pool so what we did was sit at the restaurant and just get up now and again and peer over the fence to make sure they were ok We also found the beds a little hard in our room but after a few drinks it didn t really matter LOL The restaurant was great value for money and the staff there were very friendly and organized While you eat at the restaurant it s easy to keep a close watch on your kids as its well laid out The rooms are clean and have everything you need for a weeks stay September Family Australia Reviews Staff need to grow up and get some customer service training Leisure

Karen Australia Reviews We had a great time our year old wants to go back again Leisure trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Lighting in apartment could have done with a

baking dish we loved the splash park and the variety of pools for adults and kids and the garden surrounds BBQ s lounge and outdoor furniture comfortable and modern It was great having an onsite shop and bar cafe for those little things you forget August Steve New Zealand Reviews We had an excellent time and the kids really enjoyed themselves Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights We arrived on a Wednesday movie night and found the sound in the restaurant while we were having dinner way to loud Room was clean Bed was comfortable Pools and splash pad were great for the kids Resort facilities Gym Sauna Store Arcade Restaurant were great Room facilities were excellent Although the view from the room was the tops of the palms it added to the privacy August Dwayne New Zealand review We loved our stay at Turtle Beach Resort and would highly recommend it Leisure trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights The dining area was very welcoming and catered for different age groups well Being able to sit and relax in the dining area and watch the children at the Splashdown was a treat for both children and parents There was a very happy vibe around the place and very relaxing even with a young family Even the addition of a little convenience store was handy for those necessary supplies i e sunhat that was forgotten I was very grateful for the well supplied accommodation didn t want for anything August Amanda New Zealand Reviews Noisey dissappointing Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The noise levels were huge both from guests and grounsman Chainsaws and leaf blowers start up at am and carry on for hours Reception staff did not care On complaining about noise I was told they can start at am if they like No apology that was that Splash zone only for kids under yrs but more suited for older kids and water cold Couldnt sit out on our balcony as there was bird poo all over cushions Found the stairwell rail sticky and window ledgers were extremely dusty and dirty and one with a comweb that had been there awhile If you have a flamily with small children it would be suitable Wouldnt come back with my older children Wouldnt come back for a quiet holiday either Money better spent elsewhere The deck resturant was good but a little pricey August Diesel Australia review We will be back next year Leisure trip Family with young children One Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The bed was hard to sleep on and the dryer was broken There was plenty to do on the grounds and within walking distance so we didn t need to drive anywhere August Sharon Australia Reviews Great Service and Friendly Staff Resort was fantastic and in a great position Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Nothing It would ve been nice though to have a couple of extra pillows in the nd bedroom with the single beds as some people like myself need to have a high pillow or two pillows if there are low pillows like the one in my room were The food at the Cafe at the Resort was fantastic and the Service was great Resort was in the perfect position for having to go to the Convention Centre Facilities were great in the Unit All round a great place to stay August

thing Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device I didn t like how expensive it was for kids to go to the kids club and that

counter ignored me A smile or a goodmorning goes a long way Other then that it was awesome I liked the pool areas near the cafe Convienient for kids swimming and adults to chill at the cafe I liked the kids club for the kids The mini golf around the resort is awesome July Anita Australia review Family dream holiday destination Leisure trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Some of the pillows were a little uncomfortable but other than that could not fault another thing at Turtle Beach The pools splash zone were excellent the deck

Great they have movie showings for the kids July Mary Australia Reviews Beds were super comfy it was quiet at night and loads of Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights We weren t there long enough Next time we ll make it a couple of weeks Beds were super comfy it was quiet at night and loads of activities for children of all ages July Rebecca Australia review Great location great food fantastic place for the family Ensure you request a newer room Leisure trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights the first room was very old and really needs to be updated before it is rented out If a customer was shy and didn t want to complain you would have scored very badly and perhaps lost future business The second room was great but the blinds should be cleaned ASAP They had black marks and mould growing on them The food was so good great value for money the pool facilities were excellent and there were a lot of them the staff were lovely parking was good and secure Lots of things for a family to do and did I mention the yummy food July Benita Australia review Great family resort Leisure trip Family with young children Two

kitchen utensils saucepans etc for the nights we planned to cook dinner The facilities made it very easy for a young family to have an enjoyable holiday July Renee Australia review Turtle Beach Resort perfect for families on the Gold Coast Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights The stairs were a bit rough with a toddler but I m unsure how they could address that Also a lot of the water play facilites were just a little over the head literally of our two year old The kids water play facilites at Turtle Beach Resort are fantastic The onsite cafe was very convenient and the fact that we had an apartment with a well appointed kitchen etc was also very helpful The resort is just a short drive to Surfer s Paradise but buses and trams are also very convenient as is Pacific Fair shopping centre Fantastic for kids especially between the ages of July Julie Australia Age group Reviews The apartment was great Nice and clean Fantastic having a washing machine and dryer Leisure trip Couple Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights The staff at reception were not pleasant no smiles whatsoever The stairs Nobody to help us with luggage Having to pay for towels to use at pool and you do not get that back when you take the towels back to reception having to pay to play putt putt golf thru the garden It cost us nearly for nights accom and then the other costs I have mentioned We loved the bedroom apartment and bathrooms Just perfect for me and my husband the only down side was there is no lift and it was an enormous stress on me

children Superior One Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights the extra rollaway bed was very hard I would recommend taking your own mattress luckily we had an inflatable mattress with us nice room a home away from home great facilities for a family stay July John New Zealand Reviews Great Spot but just needs a little addtitional touch to make it stand out Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Felt that outdoor furniture on the front patio would have been an asset We had a ground floor road frontage unit Lovely area but no furniture What use was it to us The kitchen could have been better equipped with some simple additions salt and pepper dishwashing liquid plus a COFFEE PLUNGER We had to buy one for our few days stay A fairly basic item of kitchen equipment today Plus some ground coffee For a week long stay at the prices charge w a mid week room service should be carried out Finally provide a reasonable amount of soap powder for the laundry Liked facilities for children and ease of access plus secure parking July Saunders Australia Reviews Great facilites good location well set out apartment Business trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Only negative was the flights of stairs especially when lugging bags and groceries up to the apartment but I guess it was good excercise The facilties for

Two bathrooms Facilities exciting for the kids Shop convenient June Kelly New Zealand review Good for family with young kids Leisure trip Family with young children One Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights I had trouble sleeping in the bed as I found the pillows were too stiff and gave me a sore neck The shower tub is raised so my partner cm tall had to crouch to use it and the water pressure wasn t the greatest A bit far from the main tourist sites but plenty of buses Great pool with a spa The onsite restaurant makes a great breakfast which saved us the hassle in the morning The full kitchens give

nights Cyclone Debbie arrived for our last day at Turtle Beach apart from that weather it really was the best holiday we have had as a family Some of the swimming pools were very deep and we felt concerned at times that our kids might stray into areas they couldn t handle swimming wise very easily But this was able to be resolved by us sticking close by them in the pools The front desk were extremely helpful and answered all our questions when planning outings The kids aged and loved the water facilities at Turtle Beach and went swimming every day usually multiple times a day We felt they were the perfect ages to enjoy this facility We enjoyed the Deck restaurant and the movie theatre for something quiet to do after a busy day out and about Having the convenience store right there also made it easy if we needed something at short notice Self catering and the BBQs also meant the we could easily cater for our kids and eat at the times they needed to eat April sweetkyls Australia

children Family Two Bedroom Suite Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The cockroach in our room was unwanted The staffs reaction was surprisingly relaxed and unsurprised It wasn t quite the outcome we expected We were put far away from all the facilities and had to walk through a maze to find a pool and the restaurant We did asked to be moved but were told ever so graciously that it was probably a good thing we weren t to close Mind you we had children who could not go to the pool without an escort because they got lost going through a maze of corridors to get to the pool areas Can honestly say we won t be returning Most of the staff were very pleasant and helpful April Sydney Australia review Great accommodation and facilities for children Leisure trip Family with young

is not included in price Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device We werent aware that the kids club was an added cost for

The only thing I didn t like was the fact we didn t stay long enough Excellent family venue we will return someday Grounds are great staff were great and the pool facilities etc Rooms were well equipped with everything you need March Raewyn New Zealand review We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and loved the splash pool and Leisure trip Family with young children Special Offer Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Would have appreciated a lift for luggage and it seemed odd having to go via the car park to get to the pool We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and loved the splash pool and the family pool thank you March Donna New Zealand review The staff were magic the rooms were a great size the Leisure trip Family with young children Superior Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights We think this a great place for families with younger kids and under We did not spend much time at the resort during our stay as we went out exploring from pm everyday Had our kids been smaller our time at the resort would have been more and this would have been an ideal place We were a little disappointed that even though it was a self contained unit there was not a huge amount of basic tea coffee for the night stay we were there Not even a cup of Tea Coffee per person for the length of stay We feel it is not a huge expense to the resort to provide something that does not get sold in small amounts yet makes quite a big difference to your guests stay Even salt and pepper would have been a welcomed addition at a wee expense to the resort Also the bed squeaked rubbed every time we moved from the sheets and mattress protector rubbing against each other Very off putting A good selection of pillows would have been better too as they were all the same height and stiffness Hubby loved them Wifey and kids not so much The staff were magic the rooms were a great size the apartment was just what we needed The information of what was around GC and surroundings were super The resort was abuzz with people yet you had quiet time in the rooms too The pools were kept clean and tidy March Joeline Australia Reviews February Holiday Leisure trip Family with young children One Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Loud Music was playing within the resort hours after stipulated quiet time After midnight when pm noise should cease Tried to call after hours reception but no answer and the patrolling security seemed to miss it Also some more shade over the pools would have lead to more pool use Other than that we really enjoyed ourselves Great place for families Great amenities Great Service We will be back March Anna Australia review Fantastic place for kids Leisure trip Family with young children Two Bedroom Apartment Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The fact there is no lift and no sings to let you know in the car park when you first arrive Had a baby in pram a bit hard to move around with pram and all

people are looking right now Description Review All properties in San Francisco San Francisco was highly rated for sightseeing by guests from the United States San Francisco Travel Guide An Icon of Liberalism Home to one of America s icons the Golden Gate Bridge San Francisco is a liberal city where life is very much for the living Surrounded by water on sides the city s spread over steep hills that make for great photo ops And none better than the zig zag Lombard Street seen in many a film Even more famous are San Fran s iconic trolleys climbing the hills a little touristy but still worth a ride In the middle of the bay Alcatraz island is known for the notorious criminals once imprisoned there Even if you don t go inside the views of the bridge and city are unparalleled Nowhere is life in San Francisco more laid back than on the Pacific beaches Rent a bike and head out there passing through the huge Golden Gate Park before returning to sample some fresh seafood at Fisherman s Wharf Don t miss the clam chowder served in bread bowls Chinatown also has a great selection of mid range restaurants As you fly into San Francisco Airport look out for the exclusive homes lining the Bay Area Whether you want a more independent stay in apartments luxury San Francisco hotels or cheap hostels Booking com has something for everyone Be careful though you might just leave your heart here

young woman living on telegraph hill I left my heart in San Francisco On this trip due to lack of mobility I took meals across the street at the former cafe restaurant Maitre de wore blue jeans no tie In the s wait staff wore tuxes and guests well dressed Your room service excellent Also maid service Look forward to my return next week Mary M United States of America So many places to visit IN San Francisco many free or very So many places to visit IN San Francisco many free or very low cost Public transit is excellent even though prices have gone up again and there s always Uber who started here I heard Wear comfy shoes and in the fall bring a sweater jacket cuz it s fun outdoors in this city Angela United States of America Beautiful city and city tours Beautiful city and city tours I went to the Grotto restaurant and the Oyster Bar Co something like that near the market at the pier The customer service was phenomenal They truly made me feel comfortable Anonymous United States of America I love San Francisco there s so much to do I love San Francisco there s so much to do You can always find people out even in the late night There s so much to see and is a very diverse city You have food in every nationality so when your craving your food it s a few blocks away Theres so many great hikes and amazing views of the city I would have to say don t drive here the tickets and street parking is terrible erick United States of America Favorite spots were fishermans wharf tourist attraction Favorite spots were fishermans wharf tourist attraction pretty much the only good place for tourists Union square is not worth it since too much druggies and honestly no good stores only businesses empires LOTS of streets that smell like urine Not worth driving around in car Must use cable cars subway uber lyft to enjoy it Ate in some alright places was able to try the best pizza I ve ever had Prices for food in tourist areas are priced the same as football stadiums Areas where regular fast food and local food are reasonably priced exist Hotels That Guests Love in San Francisco Hotel Triton Location location location This was in the center of it all Union square is block away Cable cars to fisherman warf block away China town blocks away but not in chinatown It was really the best location for seeing all of San Francisco I would stay here again Aida Plaza Hotel It was one of the lesser expensive hotels in downtown San Francisco Taylor Hotel San Francisco The location was awesome right across the road from the best breakfast in town and had a little convenient store next door blocks from union square and all public transportation granted it is an OLD hotel but San Francisco is an old town The hotel could use some upgrades bed was hard and only hot water in the tub but all in all it was good and the staff was very helpful I would stay there again InterContinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco Overall I had a nice experience The room was nicely furnished the staff were prompt and attentive check out was easy and the location is right next to San Francisco s upscale shopping areas The embarcaderro center is pretty close and so is union square And all the riff riff from union square kind of keep their distance because the hotel is located atop of a very steep hill Cova Hotel The Cova Hotel was a very nice hotel in San Francisco It was clean with cozy beds a nice included free breakfast and a free shuttle to points of interest such as Union Square and Fisherman s Wharf It has a very nice roof top terrace with views of the city which was great for those of us who smoke Staff was so nice and helpful giving us directions suggestions of places to eat etc The parking for your car was on site and the cost reasonable in comparison to other

Streetervile Stayed at Hyatt Centric hotel in Streetervile Nice hotel close to Michigan Avenue Came down for the Magnificent Mile Lights Parade which was cold and crowded but fun Rain put damper on afternoon festivities Lots of restaurants and shopping to explore especially along Michigan Avenue During summer it is great to walk the Riverwalk or Millenium park Concerts and festivals frequent Grant park Great for a day or a long weekend Carmen United States of America Chicago is such a friendly city Chicago is such a friendly city Everyone was so helpful from the train and bus system to getting directions while walking They offer a free program through the tourism office called Chicago Greeter Our greeter tour was amazing It s on foot but he showed us art and architecture throughout the loop It was fun and informative We didn t get up high to see views of the city However we saw the bean Lincoln conservatory and zoo which was nice For Chicago deep dish we visited Lou Malnati s Highly recommend but be prepared to wait Overall Chicago was a great trip Michelle United States of America Love love the city Love love the city Can t wait to go back So much do and great food So many activities for everyone Loved the Field Musuem art institute the ledge Willis tower and navy pier rode the L Hotels That Guests Love in Chicago Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront Beautiful hotel overlooking the Chicago River and just a couple of blocks from both the Magnificent Mile and the historic Chicago Theatre The staff was very helpful and courteous Very nice room comfortable and spacious Overall an exceptional stay Chicago Parthenon Hostel It is mins walk to supermarket to the train to the airport very close to downtown Chicago we were able to visit Chicago on foot from the hotel without any other means of transport and walked mins when we arrived at Union station Could not have been better Also there is the use of a very good kitchen and the lounge is very good tv and conversation with other guests could not have been better Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown Clean updated rooms The free breakfast was awesome and the staff was very friendly and professional Close to Magnificent Mile One of the least expensive more decent looking hotels that I could find available for that weekend in the city because the cheaper options that I saw pics of online did not appear to look presentable I wouldn t mind staying here again the next time that I come to Chicago Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Downtown River North I loved the location I have never been to Chicago before and it was within walking distance of a bunch of restaurants bars the magnificent mile and the lake The staff was extremely helpful in getting us a ride to the airport in the morning Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile I stayed at this hotel for two nights for a girls weekend with ten people total I was able to check in early when I arrived which was a pleasant surprise The staff was so helpful getting all three rooms I booked on the same floor and in reasonable distance from each other The rooms were updated and clean It had great location to the Magnificent Mile and all the places we wanted to go in Chicago I felt it was a great place to stay for the price I paid and I would definitely stay here again Popular Hotels in Chicago Millennium Knickerbocker Chicago stars Very

the parks October Ann United Kingdom Reviews Overall excellent stay and perfect for a visit to the sequoia forest Leisure trip Group Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed nights It would

and friendly and the room was clean September Berna United States of America review Check in and out was very easy Leisure trip Family with young children Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Interior

location with good store and Mexican restaurant over the road Good sized room Reasonable breakfast Laundry facilities September Anonymous United States of America review If I had known we could have driven another minutes we could have stayed at a nicer hotel Leisure trip Couple King Room Non Smoking Stayed night It wasn t dirty but by no means can I say our room was really clean The tub needs to be replaced The decor was unattractive The room was right next to the stairs so we never felt like we had enough privacy to open the curtains There was a sign pricing out all the bedding and coffee machine I can t imagine anyone really wanting them There was plent of room for people September Laura United States of America Reviews Spacious room poor breakfast experience Leisure trip Couple King Suite with Sofa Bed Non Smoking Stayed night The breakfast area was understaffed with bland poor quality food King room was spacious with couch sitting area The room had a ceiling fan which provided

sequoia park entrance Kind staff September Alina United Kingdom Reviews The location is great if you want to get to the park quickly Leisure trip Couple Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Interior Corridor Non Smoking Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device Breakfast was poor for the amount we paid for our stay and cleanliness could be improved The location is great if you want to get to the park quickly and even go for a dip in the river Staff were really nice August S Switzerland Reviews A great starting point for day trips to the Sequoia Kings National Parks Leisure trip Family with young children Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Interior Corridor Non Smoking Stayed nights The Wifi though free reached only in the main building We had to hang out in the Lobby to access it Magnet key cards are a bit old and ours kept losing its coding had to be re coded Just keep it away from any other electronic devices or your cell phone and you re okay The breakfast was standard but coffee was available hours and each room had it s own coffee maker This came in handy when the Hotel coffee machine broke down during one day of our stay We paid more for Queen Suite including refrigerator This was useful for us to prepare lunch for our day trips keep drinks cold Our choice with booking com was limited looking for hotels near Sequoia National Park There are many other charming places nearby from Three Rivers up to the National Park But we were not unhappy with the choice we made The closeness of this hotel to Sequoia National Park minute drive to the entrance and the amenities available Wifi swimming pool laundry facilities with nearby places for dinner or grocery shopping made it a great choice for our several day stopover The hotel itself is easy to find within walking distance of a great Subway Sandwich shop a local grocery a post office not open before am and a local Pizza place We didn t try the Mexican restaurant We did use the laundry and it was clean easy to use The dryer took a bit long though Expect for washing minutes and or more if you want bone dry for drying hours August James United States of America Reviews Exterior was a little worn

device The air con was so loud it kept you awake The room was also quite noisy as it was by the parking lot and people were walking past the room and you could hear them walking on the ceiling above

HJL United Kingdom Reviews Good location for the park Leisure trip Couple King Room Non Smoking Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The walls are thin and the room was a bit jaded and well used Not many places to get good food it s mainly grills burgers pizzas Property is close to the Sequioa National Park entrance and is surrounded by lovely scenery The staff were very helpful and friendly We decided to extend our stay here and they managed to find us a room not the same room but everything was arranged and taken care of housekeeping even moved our luggage for us There is a pool and a self service laundry July Colin United Kingdom Reviews Nice comfortable hotel Few local facilities but good position for Parks Leisure trip Family with young children King Suite with Sofa Bed Non Smoking Stayed night Not close to local facilities Have to pick the right time for breakfast as it can get busy Very comfortable with great facilities and good breakfast Friendly helpful staff Had a relaxing feel to it July Silv Netherlands Reviews Nice and comfortable and clean but quite basic Leisure trip Family with young children Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Other guests were emptying the ice machine by filling their cool boxes and taking a disproportionate amount of breakfast things leaving staff unable to work up sufficient supplies for other guests Nice to cool down in the pool July Cindy United States of America Reviews It s a place to stay close to sequoia national park Leisure trip Group Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device We where told that because you booked through booking com we only have selected rooms for them which there was nothing extra like a fridge which we thought we would have We asked for one bit was told because we went through booking com we couldn t have one It was like we where being punished because we booked the room through booking com Also couldn t use the AAA discount Not sure if I will use booking com again Close to the park where we wanted to go July Anonymous Sweden Reviews Three Rivers stopover Leisure trip Family with young children Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device Expensive for a motel but choices were limited Beautiful and quiet location close to Sequoia park spacious and clean room coffee machine in room comfortable beds quiet aircon kind and friendly staff onsite parking nice pool and hot tub laundry facilities good breakfast included fantastic pizza place nearby July Sharleen Canada review Close access to Sequoia Natl Leisure trip Group King Room Non Smoking Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device Too expensive for what you received and the a c didn t work well Ants in the room and seal broken all around the door allowing in light Breakfast was good July Anonymous United States of America review Nice amenities Leisure trip Family with young children King Suite with Sofa Bed Non Smoking Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The sofa bed was unbelievably uncomfortable Only small and light children can tolerate that bed you re literally laying on the springs with a thin sheet thrown over it Nice pool and jacuzzi It also had a fitness center although I didn t go inside but I liked the fact that it was there Breakfast was included which is always nice the usual cereal eggs sausages donuts waffle iron and the coffee was pretty good July Patricia United States of America Reviews The waffles at breakfast and the proximity to the parks are Leisure trip Couple King Suite with Whirlpool Non Smoking Stayed nights The room was ugly everything was old fashioned including the AC The bed was hard and uncomfortable We got one of the most pricey rooms still kind of cheap but the room was still not very nice Not good value for your money There are not many choices for food in Three Rivers either Would recommend either staying in Fresno or Visalia for more hotel and restaurant choices and traveling a little more for the parks or doing a river front property in Three Rivers so you can get more value that way The waffles at breakfast and the proximity to the parks are the only redeeming qualities of the hotel It was clean and the staff were friendly July Kirsten United States of America review The breakfast had a nice variety of foods Leisure trip Group King Room Interior Corridor Non Smoking Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The ac in our room did not cool it down enough When I went to call the front desk the phone didn t work The young man came and fixed the phone and looked at the ac He then went to get us a fan but when he plugged it in it shorted out He said there were no more fans but did bring us one from the front desk It eventually cooled down in the room In addition to that the room was missing the pictures rom the wall which I found very odd The breakfast had a nice variety of foods The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly July Jennifer United States of America Reviews Very convenient to the parks Leisure trip Family with young children Queen

Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device It s practically our fault but we stayed at a hotel a day before we traveled to this one and the bed at this Comfort in was just awful it was unstable and felt like cardboard Our towels also had stains on them but we got what we paid for The staff was fine and the area was mainly quiet I saw some online complaints about bedbugs but I checked everything

forced to run around for a room at pm Enrique at the desk was rude and unhelpful and threatened to call to get us out of the property Really We were given one room which had a huge cockroach and was mosquito infested None of the plug points worked Nothing June Jane United States of America review Good location if you like a sauna to sleep in Leisure trip Solo traveler Queen Room with Two Queen

Two Queen Beds Interior Corridor Non Smoking Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The pool facilities were outstanding the location was perfect the ambience was quiet but lively we had a great experience But again the pool was FANTASTIC The highlight of the property June Norman United States of America Reviews Close to Sequoia Leisure trip Couple Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed nights The room is to put it nicely shopworn Chipped tiles in the bath worn carpet but no stains thank heaven and there are two empty spaces in the cabinetry where a refrigerator and microwave should be The breakfast is well stocked but so crowded that we just skipped it the morning we left in favor of a nice restaurant over in Exeter East meets West with great breakfast deals The Inn is just six miles from the Visitors entrance to Sequoia National Park The beds were comfortable June istacysweets United States of America Reviews Post th Anniversary trip to Sequoia Leisure trip Couple

Smoking Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device No ice available at either of the two machines and temp was over degrees during the day Staff could use some customer service training Bathtub slick May Sw Australia review Overpriced and Dated Rooms and Hotel Leisure trip Couple Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed night Had to pay extra for a tiny bar fridge At check in we were told this was a luxury upgrade What a joke considering much cheaper hotels we stayed at in California had large fridges included in the price Room decor from the s Breakfast was spartan full of sugar and food items not replaced when empty No food options for dinner When asked if we could have a glass to drink from in our room we were told No guests steal them Close to entrance of Sequoia National Park Smoke free hotel and rooms May Roberta Bertoni Netherlands Age group Reviews A little real garden would be an asset for the place Leisure trip Family with young children Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed nights The hotel is right on the main road the swimming pool was closed and there was no place to seat outside Three river is nowhere There are very few decent place to eat It is very convenient for the Sequoia park May Emily United States of America Reviews The breakfast was good and served from which was Business trip Group Queen Suite with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed nights The staff did not seem to be totally up on things The guy who checked us in seemed confused about where the rooms were told us our room was on the second floor in the front when it was on the first floor in the back The internet was not working in our room the first night and while we checked with staff twice it was not fixed until the second day and the owner was rather irritable when I asked her about it While working via lobby WiFi we overheard two other groups complaining about things they had been promised but didn t get like working Jacuzzi and again the owner was borderline rude in dealing with them Perhaps because it was shoulder season she was working with new staff and was frustrated and irritable because of that but that aspect was not very pleasant The breakfast was good and served from which was good for us since we had to get to work Rooms clean and comfortable May Marsha United States of America Reviews Decent location but not recommended Leisure trip Couple King Suite with Sofa Bed Non Smoking Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The area has very limited accommodations restaurants and shopping So you are a captive audience This hotel is very tired and the rooms are not as clean as they should be for the price Sequoia national park is only or miles from this hotel The staff is very friendly and efficient May Donald United States of America review Needs a little work Leisure trip Couple King Room Non Smoking Stayed nights Small ants in the washroom area When we arrived there was no lock on the window broken screen that let mosquitoes in until the maintenance man fixed both Helpful maintenance man replaced our damaged window screen and got us a length of PVC pipe to secure the window which had no lock on it Good bed breakfast washer dryer Inexpensive room May Thierry France Reviews Bon s jour Leisure trip Group Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed night The location at the gates of Sequoia Park The tables around the pool and in the garden Ideal to take the aperitif bought from stores located next door May Anonymous United States of America review Close to Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Leisure trip Couple Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device Some kind of insects like gnats only somewhat larger were inhabiting and dying in the room By morning many had died in the bathtub and on the bathroom floor There were also ants Close to Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Bed was comfortable May Alaric Canada Reviews An OK option if you need something close to Sequoia Park and Kings Canyon Leisure trip Couple King Room Non Smoking Stayed night This was a tired star motel with the location being its only redeeming feature Short walk to a small grocery store and a reasonable Mexican restaurant so at least we didn t starve Rooms reasonably clean no fridge horrible breakfast Location was good only a short drive to Sequoia park and King Canyon May Sophia South Africa Reviews Nice hotel Leisure trip Family with young children Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Interior Corridor Non Smoking Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Like so many hotels in this price bracket they use all disposable items in the rooms and breakfast room plastic wrapped plastic cups plastic wrapped paper cups plastic cutlery paper plates plastic butter portions etc When are hotels like this going to wake up to the environmental damage done by all this unnecessary waste The room was spacious and comfortable The pool was clean Breakfast was adequate The laundry facility was good There s a shop and vending machine if you need to buy snacks etc April Celine United States of America review the breakfast was decent and had a large choice of hot and Leisure trip Family with young children Queen Suite with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed nights the breakfast room was so packed that it was difficult to get a seat and fill the plate the breakfast was decent and had a large choice of hot and cold items such as waffles eggs sausages cereals toast muffins and a coffee and juice bar April Stephanie United Kingdom Reviews Lovely comfy beds clean rooms Leisure trip Couple Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Non Smoking Stayed night I think a bit better insulation around the door frame would have done worlds of good for noise You could see light and feel cold air rushing through between the door jam and the door at least mm gap We always travel with earplugs thankfully as there were lots of children running around outside our room and yelling staying in the room next to us at well past pm I know pm isn t particularly late but we were doing lots of hiking so trying to get to bed at a reasonable hour for our early start It was a reasonable location a bit on the pricey end but the bed was very comfortable which is a very important element in the whole stay The room was clean spacious and had all the basics even a mini fridge which we were not expecting There were restaurants and bars just a short walk away although there was no sidewalk or street lighting so after dark walking was not really a safe option The breakfast was nothing terribly grand but there were hot and cold options available and a good steady supply of coffee but God help you if you are gluten free the eggs were more than likely made from a powder so even they would probably not be suitable For a hiker with no dietary restrictions who wants a high carb breakfast though it is pretty perfect April Brenda United States of America review The room was comfortable and the view was great Leisure trip Family with young children Queen Room with Two Queen Beds Interior Corridor Non Smoking Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The pillow was not firm enough and the tv was small and the volume was ackward needed more treble Also the pool was not open The room was comfortable and the view was great April Vilmos France Reviews Very nice experience Leisure trip Couple King Room Non Smoking Stayed nights The manager was extremely nice helpful with a good sense of humour in complete agreement with their slogan Come as a guest leave as a

eventually ending up in Budapest Hungary The apartmet was comfortable great balcony clean quiet and fitted with all mod cons We found all accommodation in Croatia great value for money and this apartment was no different I just wish our stay had been longer June Rodrigo Ireland Reviews Exactly as advertised Leisure trip Family with older children Exactly as advertised The apartment was really well equipped and very close to the city center Eduard was really helpful in our stay he recommended good places where to go and where to eat We even had a phone to make reservations Too bad we missed our chance to use the pool and the gym which were available to us in the hotel next door The car rental office next door April Markus Austria Reviews The guy who rented the apartment was really very friendly Leisure trip Family with older children You have to go up floors the guys were so nice and offered their help bringing up our stuff As the tramway runs in front of the building you hear or feel it sometimes The guy who rented the apartment was really very friendly was waiting for us although we arrived very late The apartment itself is spacious well designed and equipped with everything you need The arrangement with the hotel beside concerning the parking is very good The location of the apartment is great walking distance min to the center or any tramway right off the door of the building April Srbislav Serbia review Eduard s place was a superb place to stay in Zagreb Leisure trip Solo traveler Eduard s place was a superb place to stay in Zagreb Communication was prompt and easy and the apartment is exactly as it looks in the photos Light airy and very comfortable All in all very happy April John United States of America review The management was really helpful to me Business trip Solo traveler The management was really helpful to me I was never in Zagreb before and they made my stay a pleasure I would definitely stay at this place again April Igor Italy review This apartment was great Business trip Solo traveler This apartment was great That s exactly what it looks like It s clean modern and an easy minute walk to Old Town with plenty of beautiful architecture along the way Don t feel like walking Well lucky for you this place is located right on the tram line which can take you all over the city It s literally right out the front door which at times can get a bit noisy but of the rest of your day is very peaceful and quiet Book it right now I certainly will Bellissimo appartamento come dalle foto molto pulito e ordinato Situato a minuti a piedi dal centro storico Esattamente davanti al portone di ingresso vi la fermata del tram che collega praticamente ogni parte della cit Questo a volte pu causare un p di rumore ma per la gran parte del tempo piuttosto tranquillo Certamente raccomandabile e da ripetere per cui prenotate adesso April Darijo Bosnia and Herzegovina Age group review I stayed there for one night Business trip Solo traveler I stayed there for one night Eduard was very frendly The apartment is amazing Parking is in the garage next to the building I consider it an advantage Everything is brand new and has the fancy style The place is quiet so i slept well I would advise it to everyone Boravio sam u stanu jednu no Eduard je ljubazan Parking se nalazi u garazi pored zgrade to je prednost u odnosu na druge Stan je nevjerojatno dobro ure en te ima onaj fancy mek Sve je kopletno novo Stan je tih iako je u samom centru grada spavao sam dobro Preporu ujem svakome April Anonymous Croatia review This apartment was fantastic Business trip Couple This apartment was fantastic It was perfectly located a mere minute walk from the heart of Zagreb s restaurant cafe and bar scene The place was spotless and in excellent condition exactly as in the pictures and tastefully decorated Comfortable beds an iPod dock and a pay mini bar were a big plus It was like staying in a boutique hotel Furthermore Eduard was a wonderful host who met us at the apartment and answered our many questions and gave us some good recommendations for places to go in the city There are also reviews without

Hotels That Guests Love in Chicago Holiday Jones Location is very convenient when you arrive to Chicago O Hare the place is about min away from the airport using CTA However the greatest asset of this place is very friendly and helpful personnel The property on its own is alright nothing maybe besides one or two things to dislike but do not expect it be on an average hotel level because it is a hostel The surrounding of this place seems friendly and safe plus there s plenty of pubs and coffee shops around to enjoy your trip Freehand Chicago I stayed in a shared room which was cozy and clean It was pretty cold in Chicago and the hostel provided extra blankets The bathroom was great the breakfast spectacular for a hostel And the staff very friendly I could visit all the tourist spots by foot and public transport is at the corner of the hostel which was great I loved the experience FieldHouse Jones This is not a hostel it s a hotel with strangers living in your room I mean they provide four FOUR towels for your convenience Each room has its own shower and toilet personal locker in the room The kitchen is unbelievable great furniture great fridge and freezer huge TV laundry air hockey ping pong table football They also have a great caf at the entrance The hostel is very close to Chicago station min walk Totally awesome Chicago Getaway Hostel It was a cheap solution to stay in the Chicago area Location was ok for public transportation to Downtown and there were some bars restaurants and shops around the hostel Chicago Parthenon Hostel Most of the people working there were incredibly nice and helpful The location was close to perfect When I was in Chicago it was the cheapest hostel with n okay rating recommendation for people who don t need a lot to get

Next page Showing November Denise United Kingdom Reviews The location was perfect for my requirements and my budget Solo traveler Double Room Stayed nights My room was cramped with one too many beds in there It was cold I get that this is an old building still the radiator was way too small for the room The ensuite smelled damp all the time Again an old building not originally designed as a hotel The room I was allocated could be considered noisy by some guests as it was ground floor on a corner and the hotel is situated on a busy road at a junction with traffic lights I didn t have breakfast at the hotel so can t comment on the food The location was perfect for my requirements and my budget while I was in London I spent very little time in the room except to sleep which I did manage very well despite the room being ground floor and on a corner November Nicola United Kingdom Reviews The staff were extremely helpfull and good value for money Leisure trip Group Twin Room Stayed nights After reading some reviews a little hesitate to stay but The Royal Eagle exceeded my expectations extremely helpful staff very clean and great location and would defiantly stay again Thank you November Michael United Kingdom Reviews Good value for London but single rooms very small consider twin or larger Business trip Solo traveler Single Room Stayed nights Single room very small Wardrobe very small but adequate for short stay No iron in room Window didn t seal completely so very cold air on bed end Fittings in bathroom modern but basin very small Great location close to Paddington Modern fittings in good condition shower fine November Stavros Cyprus Reviews What you pay is what you get Business trip Solo traveler Double Room Stayed nights Small but clean rooms Breakfast was available only by extra charge The hotel s location is perfect and very convenient to move around west end and the city Even it is highly appreciated the fact that with the express train you can reach the hotel in mins from the airport Free wi fi is available and accessible from the rooms too November Varaporn Thailand Reviews If you are looking for a budget hotel near Paddington station this hotel is a good choice for you Leisure trip Solo traveler Double Room Stayed nights Nothing much just there s not much space to put your big suitcase Location is excellent close to Heathrow airport express station and city centre easy to get public transportation There s a lift as well November Jane United Kingdom review Fabulous days Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Staff were really friendly We had booked a double room and was given a triple room on the corner View was lovely A little bit noisy from traffic but not a problem and something you would expect The bar prices were much the same as the pubs down the road Would stay here again November Omowunmi United Kingdom Reviews Nice experience will like to stay longer to obtain more info about the property Business trip Solo traveler Double Room Stayed night Hospitality reception and proximity to medium of transportation The information and photo obtained before coming into the facility was not sufficient compares what realities at the facility Need to do more in terms of positioning the facility on the internet for better accessibility and accuracy The facility gave provided more than presented November Badriya Oman Reviews It was a great holiday spent in Royal Eagle Hotel Leisure trip Couple Triple Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The room was a bit tight There was no a guy helps at taking the luggage to the rooms Usually in all hotels there was a guy helping at lifting the luggages The WiFi connection was fast restaurants were close the best thing was that the underground and the train station were minute walk from the hotel The receptionists were very helpful November Juanita Australia Reviews Close to train station and attractions Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device Bed too big for small room A double bed would give more space No airconditioning in room without windows Close to train station and attractions New bathroom eventhough very small November David United Kingdom Reviews it was clean fresh and warm Business trip Solo traveler Double Room Stayed night bedroom cramped and tricky to find room I was told it was an upgrade too the room contained an additional double bed and was clearly intended for families sink stopper was stuck on closed so bowl couldn t be emptied it was clean fresh and warm November Anonymous Belgium Age group Reviews Very good location friendly staff Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The room and bathroom was very very small Just to give you an idea the space around the bed was of around cm There was no available power socket to charge the phone Very good location friendly staff November Voyezlabas France review Good for a one night family stop over hopping off point before travel not for a lengthy vacation Business trip Family with young children Family Room Stayed night Room temperature was uncomfortably warm despite being mid October Heat couldn t be dissipated rapidly enough to ensure a comfortable night s sleep without opening a large window adjacent to a main traffic thoroughfare too noisy an option hence Hobson s choice Subjective of course Public rooms are reasonably appointed and in good condition Some corridors stairwells are pretty jaded giving a slightly down at heel feel The bedroom was very basic though reasonably decorated and in fair condition at this price point for London The hotel offers a true family room with proper beds for adults and children where most offer accommodation for adults children or shared fold down sofa beds for additional children This was the hotel s effective unique selling proposition November Motherb United Kingdom Age group review Great location Friendly staff Leisure trip Group Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device I stayed here with my daughter after we checked in we had to clamber over linen piled high and cleaning products to get to our room as the maid had dumped all the laundry and quilts right outside our room and right at the top of the stairs too We shared a double room the bed was two singles pushed together which was ok for us but I wouldn t have been happy if I was with my husband at all Don t advertise a double bed when it s two so singles pushed together not fair The beds were appalling Cheap substandard mattresses the springs poked through the mattress and it was dreadful and I didn t get an ounce of sleep both nights and it gave me terrible back ache They seriously need to invest in new mattresses They also offered a continental breakfast for when just across the road was a fabulous cafe offering breakfast for a no brainier really for us Quick check in friendly staff leave your bag for if you arrive early as we did Location excellent access to the tube and just a short lovely walk to Hyde park November Anonymous Ireland Reviews Overall a great hotel Leisure trip Family with young children Quadruple Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The second room we booked was at the front of hotel and it was hard to sleep with noise levels from traffic and sirens It was very small and cramped Great location staff were very friendly and helpful with directions Rooms and bathroom were clean albeit a bit small Beds were comfortable and noise levels were low as we were at the back November Chris United Kingdom Reviews Great value for money Leisure trip Family with young children Twin Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The tablet of soap was changed daily which I thought very wasteful Situated a min walk away from Paddington station Our twin room though small basic was cosy comfortable with daily maid service very friendly helpful staff Perfect for a few days shopping sightseeing in London Great value for money November Ej United Kingdom Reviews ok Leisure trip Family with young children Quadruple Room Stayed nights The family room was a bit dark on the ground floor as the windows were very small The beds also kept slipping away from the headboard wall as they weren t fixed on so couldn t sit up in bed comfortably made us giggle and the shower head kept wobbling about so made showers a little more tricky but we were happy just to use the room to sleep in and spent all day evening out and about anyway Nice and clean though Nice and clean Pleasant staff Good location Not bad price November Pj Ireland review Overall it was a very disappointing experience I most certainly will not be staying at this hotel Leisure trip Family with young children Quadruple Room Stayed nights As Above The room was very basic with very little room to maneuver the mattress had to be replaced upon arrival and the handrail from the top floor was not secure in place potentially very dangerous As a family of one been a baby in a push chair we were unable to access a single lift but rather had to use lifts every time owing to their miniature in size The hallways were dirty with the wall paper peeling off Overall it was a very disappointing experience I most certainly will not be staying at this hotel aging and I would not be promoting here as a family friendly hotel but rather the opposite November Ali Bahrain review The location was perfect as everything is near by and the Leisure trip Couple Twin Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device We faced an issue in the hotel as some of the residence annoyed us at late night by knocking the door and run away we faced the problem many times and we informed the receptionest about that matter unfortunately the problem has been continued until the last day The location was perfect as everything is near by and the street in active all over the day and night November Barbara United Kingdom Reviews I would recommend hotel as excellent value for money and great tube and mainline train access Leisure trip Group Twin Room Stayed night Nothing Exceptionally clean in all ways very hot water and good shower Allocated larger room from original booked twin bed even though only two of us so good space Basement room but not traffic noisy Recommend hotel as very good value November Helena Australia Reviews The hotel front looks good but the room was basic Leisure trip Solo traveler Single Room Stayed nights The hotel front has stairs but no ramp I had a large heavy suitcase and a carry on bag which I had to take up each step of the stairs The hotel was close to amenities such as convenience stores restaurants and Paddington tube station and train station which was good November Andr Germany Reviews Nice for a short trip like ours two full days but wouldn t visit again Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights A little noisy at times but okay overall Our room was tiny and the beds were very uncomfortable I have never seen short beds like these and our backs were aching after the second night Decoration and furniture is awful Also the breakfast was a mess unfortunately so we decided to visit a few of the numerous pubs nearby which in contrast are very recommendable The location is very nice The neighborhood is lovely and there many pubs caf s and bars in walking distance to the hotel Less than five minutes walking distance to Paddington Station and around minutes to Hyde Park Our room was clean and there weren t any problems with the staff Not extremely friendly but not rude either November Joe Ireland Reviews Worst hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere Leisure trip Family with young children Single Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Tiny room tiny bed no storage tiny bathroom that smelled because of stagnant water in drain that didn t work The bar in the hotel that wasn t open when you came back from dinner at even though we were residents The five minute walk to underground November Anonymous Singapore review Good location mins from Paddington train station Leisure trip Solo traveler Single Room Stayed nights Window could be noise proof otherwise its difficult to sleep Good location mins from Paddington train station Room facing the road is noisy because of moving traffic November Jochem Netherlands Reviews Good location small room and bed Leisure trip Group Double Room Stayed nights The room is really small and the layout is not ideal The bed is really small x and was to short for me The staff was nice but cool be more helpful For this price I would expect that breakfast is included Location is in the greater London area is good The hotel is clean and the staff is nice but cool be more proactive social The shower is small but comfortable October Anonymous Australia Reviews Second best Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device We stayed at hotel William across the road first night the night manager walked into the occupants of the second room after midnight saying he was after a electrical fault The room was that hot that chocolate melted in the room we slept in we had to have on fans to make it cool Never stayed there as apparently the rooms we had booked had electrical faults October Jan United Kingdom review Enjoyed my stay and had a great few days of my holiday Leisure trip Solo traveler Double Room Stayed nights Great location friendly staffs I can get pretty much I need around the are Great value for money and ver accessible transport to the West end I would definitely come back and stay here at Royal Eagle Hotel October Appleseedex Kuwait Age group Reviews the breakfast was a bit too bland Leisure trip Solo traveler Single Room Stayed nights the breakfast was a bit too bland I would recommend the hotel for its value of money which happens to be excellent regarding the fact that its in the heart of London and pretty close to the Hyde Park and the Paddington Underground Station is reached in minutes Not a luxury hotel but definitely does the job Just stay away from the breakfast October Franka Guernsey Reviews It s ok if is only a bed all you need and nothing else Family with young children Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Rooms are too tiny not groups family friendly They call upgrade from two to three guests giving you a couple of cms more gap between the beds in a different lay out tiny room and downsizing the bathroom They change bedding everyday but not always smell good There s no fridge minibar so is not family friendly at least not children that always need some fresh organic snack or juice Staff look stressed not friendly They charge for look after luggage after checkout no courtesy after business has finished I won t return They couldn t deal properly with a request and did not even attempt to amend their mistake I liked the location but is in between stations you need to walk a bit to any of them still good location close to everything Easy to get to anywhere October Anonymous United Kingdom Reviews Great location good value but some basic guest expectations aren t quite being met Leisure trip Solo traveler Single Room Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device My room was not ready for the pm check in The last of my towels were only brought to my room at pm delaying me getting ready for an event I was attending Bar was poorly stocked only brand of gin Returning guest Love the location value for money and lots of nearby facilities that make this a perfect place for being a tourist and visitor to London for leisure October Citybreaker United Kingdom Age group Reviews Good value for money for a central London hotel Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device In the rooms the floors are laminate wood and so you can hear every single step of the people above along with scraping of chairs and banging of luggage There s not much the hotel can do about that so you have to hope you have quiet neighbours Another strange thing I found was that I was asked for ID as I checked in being told it was hotel policy I didn t bring my driving licence with me in case I lost it and I would never bring my passport during a domestic city break I managed to get the receptionist to allow me to check in but there was nothing on the booking that said bring your ID Very strange for people who live in the UK I ve never been asked before The hotel is in a fantastic location within minutes of Hyde Park It s very clean and well maintained The staff are very helpful October Nicholas United Kingdom review It s just a straight road mins from Paddington Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights The bed weren t the comfiest it felt like there was a dip in the mattress It was practically two single beds pushed together The room isnt really sound proof and we could hear people that walk past out door even when we were on the th floor there were quite alot of guests walking through after midnight The bathroom was pretty clean however the shower door was very stiff to which we had to physically wrestle with it to get it closed so that water isnt sprayed everywhere Staff were very friendly however when I arrived I was questioned if I had a passport with me now I am of Asian descendant but I have been living in the UK for over years and as such I would not see the need to take my passport with me to London as I havent left the country After backwards and forwards of asking why i needed my passport they finally accepted my driving licence It s just a straight road mins from Paddington station and made it easy to get around around London Loved that it had a rainfall like shower head and the water pressure was good October Bridget United States of America Reviews I think for this price was too much money for the size room Couple Double Room Stayed nights Staff at this facility does not know how to follow instructions I told the employee at the check in times that my insulin needed to go in the refrigerator and he put it in the freezer It was hours later when I had discovered what he had done and could not take my medicine for that night since it was frozen solid Thankfully I googled it and it said that it would not hurt it Room elevators and hall ways were extremely small and very tight Almost did not have enough to put people and luggage in the elevators We did not eat there it was L for breakfast which for this small continental breakfast as best was too much money October Marco Italy Reviews About the hotel tiny rooms as expected in London but clean Solo traveler Double Room Stayed nights Landing in London at am I requested by email an early check in on arrival which was not allowed so I entered my room at pm That is acceptable Through booking com I emailed the request of the Genius Priority hours of free late check out No way I left my room at am That is less acceptable I also had to pay cash for storing in the hotel my piece of luggage and my coat each until late afternoon That is the first time it happened to me I invite booking com to check any questionable hotel policies like the pay for storing luggage that should be reported on the service facility section of the hotel Moreover booking com should not to boast any Genius advantages for his customers if those advantages are not actually granted by the hotels About the hotel tiny rooms as expected in London but clean and well maintained Try to avoid ground floor rooms because passers by can easily look inside October Naila United States of America Reviews Very crammed Leisure trip Group Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device I booked a double room for Room was very small and felt like a small closet Tween bed and a wardrobe took the majority of the room no place for suitcases or hooks to hang my coat or a bag had to walk along the walls to get to the bathroom I could hear every single conversation in the hallways This was a non smoking hotel I could smell smoke coming from rooms The only saving grace was the location and proximity to parks tube and Oxford circus I won t stay here in the future no offense Location October Anonymous United Kingdom review Great weekend with family hotel was in a great location for what we wanted to do Leisure trip Group Quadruple Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The hotel is not fully PCI Great location Room cleaned towels and bathroom toiletries replenished every day Good location for a bite to eat and drink too Even better you are a short walk away from Hyde Park October Anonymous Ireland review Not a pleasant stay Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Not a pleasant stay at this hotel Upon check in the staff was acting as if we were asking her for a big favour which she clearly didn t want to do Likewise lack of customer service when I rung the reception it was answered by the same person with a simple yes not like it suppose to be done reception how may I help you Also there was no information on how to reach the reception by phone in the room I had to try combinations before find it out it is by the way The mattress was just horrible and noisy it left springs marks on my partner s back on the first night later changed after request yet old and not a good one The position of the toilet seat is the most awkward I ve ever seen I am short and had my knees touching the wall The electric fan no air conditioning was broken and it was fixed inside my room with the door wide opened by the maintenance guy while my partner was in the shower Toilet s door was opened and he could hear that the shower was running The walls are too thin and we could listen loudly and clearly the conversations happening in the side rooms and in the corridor We were allocated on the th floor and even though frequently woken up all night long by loud police and ambulance cars with the sirens screening To open the window was another loud thing that we had to do The majority of the staff members that we have came across during our stay were giving us that judgement looking from head to toe and not that warm felling that we have encountered on other hotels There is a clear lack of customers service and focus The good part of this hotel is that it is located within a walking distance from Paddington Underground Station Hyde Park and it has few nice restaurants and coffee shops around Room was relatively clean though with few spots that needed attention nothing that would be a problem Yet the location is good and the room was clean we didn t have a pleasant experience at this hotel Therefore wouldn t recommend it as a likeable experience October Alicia Spain Reviews A great time with friends at the Royal Eagle Hotel in London Leisure trip Group Family Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device I liked it all It was pretty good The service was great with a nice staff and a comfortable room The area was quite busy during the day but very quiet at night with good services around including the tube station and very close to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park October Anonymous Russia Reviews Location is very convenient if you plan to travel from Business trip Solo traveler Double Room Stayed night I had a room on st floor which was located on separate staircase without lift not very convenient especially with bag It was quite noisy you can hear all moves on stairs and in neighbor room The double room with single occupancy i had was small so hardly people can move around Location is very convenient if you plan to travel from Padington station Underground is also nearby October Leslie Guam Reviews Unbelievably awesome Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Check in process was not smooth at all Check in time was pm was there at pm said we couldn t check in till check in time so went to eat for lunch came back after pm room was not yet ready till pm Then even with my passport I was given a hard time with my signature for payment Ofcourse we all change signature it may look different but overall it s still a rating I m s near so many restaurants and shops The Pagington station is just mind walk to get to you other destinations October Danielle Ireland review Good value for money but only good if like us you don t plan on spending much time in the room Leisure trip Group Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The room was very small The window didn t open Continental breakfast wasn t included The bed was comfortable The room was very clean and the shower was lovely October Anonymous Bahrain Reviews Never ever stay in this horrible hotel Leisure trip Solo traveler Triple Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device I demand full investigation into this incident the rat that was living in my daughter room before we arrived and not only jumped in her face but grapped her nose The rat that jumped into my daughter face and nose Its true they know it October Malcolm United Kingdom Reviews enjoyed it Leisure trip Solo traveler Single Room Stayed nights very limited

Melvin United Kingdom Reviews ideal location for the event we attended at a fair price would use again Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed night we thought that the breakfast for what we had was a little bit expensive for the choice available the room was comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities available October Anonymous United Kingdom Reviews Would not recommend Leisure trip Family with young children Family Room Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device We booked a family room for We were told upon arrival this wasn t available given a triple a double room not interlocking Not ideal for a family with young children not what we had booked paid for It was close to Hyde park which is why we booked the hotel October Anonymous India review There was no hot water for bath Family with young children Triple Room Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device There was no hot water for bath room was cold as heating system not working the staff tried to contact the manager for nearly hrs and there was no response Pathetic attitude but kudos to front desk staff she took us to the hotel across the road for our bath My son till that time has had his bath with cold water degree is children by UK standards and definitely for Indians October Anonymous United States of America Reviews It is an old hotel that has been somewhat modernized Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The elevator was one half floor below our room The bed was in the loft up a steep narrow flight of stairs Anyone with mobility issues needs to be sure to inform the hotel to be sure their access is okay It is an old hotel that has been somewhat modernized The location just three blocks from Paddington made access very easy October Anonymous Saudi Arabia Reviews not bad Leisure trip Family with young children Quadruple Room Stayed nights it was good but not what I expect the building is old and very expensive compared to another hotel the staff very friendly and they respond to my requests very very fast October Molly Australia Reviews Not the best stay Leisure trip Group Twin Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Rooms were tiny no room for a suitcase Beds rolled away when you sat on them gets really annoying Cannot sit in bed and read without the bed rolling away from the wall Very noisy all rooms have floating floors was kept awake till am and could hear everything the room above was doing Shower also had a bit of mould and all the grout in the bathroom tiles had come out this felt quite sharp underfoot Location was good bedding was clean and bed were comfortable October Anonymous Switzerland review The location of the hotel is great but if you re unlucky you might end up with a closet sized room Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The double room was so tiny we could hardly move around and we seriously struggled to find a space for our two luggages The bed was uncomfortable and way too short if you re m or taller But the most upsetting is that our friends who payed the exact same amount for a double room got one that was almost double the size of our room October Tugfan Turkey Reviews Was okay in general Leisure trip Group Twin Room Stayed nights In the early morning the sound caused by my room s door due to the suction happened when someone else was opening o rclosing the other passage door in front of our room I woke everyday early interruptedly Room number is B Nice location Good staff September Andrew United Kingdom Reviews Good location but tiny room Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights The room was small no space to leave suitcase without causing a hazard Disappointed breakfast wasn t included as had specified this Only continental offered at high price Went down the road for a full English at a fraction of the price The room was clean the en suite good with a lovely shower Location was good for Paddington station and Hyde park Kensington gardens September David United Kingdom review adequate if looking for cheap accommodation in London Business trip Couple Double Room Stayed night the breakfast was sparse and expensive for what was on offer walls between each room very thin could hear activity next door pillows on bed far too thick Wife and I both slept without headrest in the end Abundance of restaurants close by Near to tube station Room was clean September Suzanne France Reviews Would stay here again good value Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Would have liked the room bigger especially as my partner is tall Also a fridge would be a great addition Staff were lovely and friendly Good location Just mins walk to Paddington September Worldexplorer United Kingdom Reviews convenient location but small and dingy Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights the hallways were horrible so tight it was a mission to get to our room it s a weird building not quite safe in case of fire or something the bed was two beds put together instead of a double bed washroom was a bit tight but I guess those are things you can t exactly change location was great nice lobby staff were okay room and washroom were okay it is a London hotel so it s a bit tiny and dingy September Anonymous Ireland review Not the best place to stay Leisure trip Family with young children Family Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Room was very warm and only a little fan to get to sleep Furniture and bedding very dated as is mattress Floor is grubby and doesn t look like it was washed in a long time the Staff here are very rude and I witnessed this at the start of our stay and at the end when checking out Standing waiting to check in with three tired kids while Being egnored and then been told to wait until she is ready to check me in minutes later while not another person in the lobby and two people behind the desk is really poor customer service The staff have very bad manner about them on checking out on old lady asking was her taxi coming was shouted at by the girl working there I told you mam it will take ten minutes go wait outside poor old lady was shaking No need to talk like that to anyone I won t be recommending this place to anyone We ordered a taxi from the desk and got a parson in a car with a phone with Google maps to show him how to get to vicktoria station no meter just got told it was pound when we got there Lobby September Kristin Germany Reviews A rather unsatisfying stay Leisure trip Solo traveler Single Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device My room was extremely small My windows could not be closed properly so it was cold all the time My shower was broken My heater was broken It was loud in the house and I could barely sleep at times It was rather expensive for what you get in the end Staff couldn t speak English very well The location was to my satisfaction The Check in was easy September Anonymous Singapore review Minor issues but hopefully can be improved Leisure trip Travelers with friends Twin Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device No place to put worn or clean clothes in bathroom when taking a bath No hook no lines nor bar The steps at the entrance of the hotel are narrow and pose quite a challenge to bring the luggage in and out the hotel without another person s help Close to Paddington Station and Kensington Gardens September Mary United Kingdom review there was too much noise coming from the road outside Business trip Solo traveler Single Room Stayed night I had booked in time to let them know about my early arrival if there was a possibility to check in the hotel after hrs but I had to wait in the lobby the room was not ready After explaining myself that I had a business meeting after hrs I was directed to the toilet downstairs since I wanted to get dressed for the meeting I was not happy about that I sat waiting in the Lobby then approaching the reception again then one of the staff had to look for a room for me I was told in the morning that my booking did not include breakfast a bit disappointment I was not given an option at all I had to go out to buy breakfast September Deirdre Ireland Reviews Great location Leisure trip Family with young children Twin Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The staff were not very friendly We were in the attic room the walls were sloping I banged my head a few times Location was great a few minutes walk from Paddington Station September Russ United Kingdom review A rip off that could

charge us an extra There was NO hot water in the entire hotel from Sunday night until our check out at on Monday morning The Staff only gave a small refund based on a made up room rate of saying the previous evening r rate was This was not acceptable September The United Kingdom review Good location shame there was no hot water Lack of person in charge would put me staying again Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device No hot water Reception staff were very sorry but no solutions or alternatives and no manager and no one willing to take responsibility to deal with complaints When pushed reception said a manger was on route I waited and raised concerns and was given refund Situation could have been handled better in my opinion Phone in room did not work to contact reception my husband had to walk through breakfast room resturaunt to go to reception to complain about water Having attended festival nearby we looked forward to a relaxing morning and hot shower and we had neither With no one responsible for dealing with guests concerns and no manager on site I would not feel safe staying again in case of an emergency evacuation We were given a large room that included single beds and one double bed two showers and a bath we had only booked a double room but given this instead September Philip United Kingdom Reviews Great weekend spoilt by first poor room Leisure trip Group Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Must have been Smallest hotel room in Britain with a double bed crammed into the room which you had to climb over to get in or out bathroom very smelly after complaining in the morning they gave us a very nice room so all was redeemed except there was no hot water for washing or showering in the morning boiler broke down such a shame as the hotel I think would have had a much better review Location September Darren United Kingdom Reviews Basic hotel that serves a purpose Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Room was very compact shower leaked badly however this was fixed No hot water on the Monday morning cold shower before heading off home Bar very expensive and a really poor choice of drinks use the pub pride of paddington min walk away Staff were really helpful location is excellent September Natalie United Kingdom Reviews short and sorta sweet Leisure trip Group Twin Room Stayed night the beds would move at the slightest movement as the flooring was laminate and the beds were on wheels which made it very wobbly The room is really small for people so a bit cramped when trying to get ready we were on basement level We then went to the bar to get a drink and we were the only there however it took about mins to actually get a drink as there was no staff and when a member of staff did serve us we couldn t pay at the bar as it was by card payment so had to pay at the main reception and then pick our drinks back at the bar again The location of the hotel was really good and the staff were pleasant this hotel is fine if staying for the one night September Anonymous United Kingdom Reviews A bit like faulty towers Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The smell in bathroom awful when we complained we were told that maintenance men had painted it that morning it was not a paint smell There was also no ventelation in bathroom No hot water for showers Sunday night or Monday morning we had spent all of Sunday in an outdoor concert and wall we wanted was a hot shower to warm up

elderly could have had a nasty accident Staff were very pleasant September Carol Spain review Excellent location very clean hotel perfect for what we needed Leisure trip Family with young children

small on whole very good September Anne United Kingdom Reviews Mixed feelings Leisure trip Travelers with friends Twin Room Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device A little tatty and initial reception welcome poor The staff seemed to draw straws to decide who was going to serve us and not keen to do so Corridor wallpaper peeling in places and decor in the room very basic and not well finished Bathroom sink had large crack across it and the shower head needed a good clean to get rid of the limescale Shower door didn t close completely so minor flood after each shower Curtains and windows needed a wash as they were very grubby Well placed for Paddington and Hyde park areas Good choice of breakfast cafes on the doorstep if not eating at the hotel A room upgrade gave us a quad room rather than a twin so plenty of space with a lovely double height window Beds were comfy and clean and fairly quiet considering the location More noise from room above than outside September Anonymous United Kingdom review It was disappointing Leisure trip Couple rooms Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device No telephone some lights didn t work some staff were discourteous beds in a single room beds in a double room Bed was comfortable September Tessa United Kingdom review So convient for railway station and open top bus I felt as a single traveler that I was in a safe Leisure trip Solo traveler Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The bathroom was very small and had no slip mat It was impossible to walk around the bed as the room was small but well equipped The Hotel had ignored my request for a room on nd or rd floor but when I complained this was swiftly replaced from a noisy basement room to the rd floor I paid for a double for person and this was worth the small extra cost September Maxine United States of America review Great hotel and a great price Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The downside was that there was no air conditioning the rooms are rather small I think this is typical in Europe I guess I m spoiled American but it was okay because we were out the majority of the day Also you can hear everyone in the hallway and it wasn t ideal especially at AM The hotel was modern and very clean The staff was friendly and it is only blocks from the Paddington Underground There are plenty of cute restaurants in the area and convenience stores to get water and late night snacks September Alice millo Australia Reviews Great location and good value for money if you are staying for few days Leisure trip Couple Double Room Stayed nights Paying pounds for the luggage storage while waiting for my room to be ready is annoying and should be free of charge for the guests Also we had the worse sleep due to the noise outside Stuff is quite helpfull September David United States of America Reviews CONSIDERING ITS CENTRAL LOCATION THIS HOTEL WAS A GOOD VALUE OVERALL Leisure trip Family with young children Family Room Stayed nights CHARGE TO HOLD LUGGAGE FOR HR AFTER CHECK OUT WOULD HAVE LIKED A SECOND LESS EXPENSIVE BREAKFAST OPTION FOR FAMILY E G COFFEE AN ROLL THE ROOM

Leisure trip Family with young children Quadruple Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device People staying in the room beside us had very noisy children running around the corridors and shouting at midnight parents only did something when a member of staff asked them to be considerate to all the other guests at the hotel and asked them very politely to control their children Thumbs up to the staff at Royal Eagle Hotel Room was spacious and clean Staff were very approachable and friendly Breakfast was lovely August Anonymous Thailand Reviews I will probably not select the hotel next time Family with young children Triple Room Stayed nights One day there were not enough clean towels on the hotel so we did not have any bathing towels that day Bathroom floor had large cracks in the floor and the cold water shower tab was difficult to adjust as it jumped from almost closed to fully open error in the tab The shower head support on the wall was sitting rather loose The closure at the bottom of the bath tub did not close properly The easy access to Lancaster Gate underground station We never used Paddington underground station which is closer than Lancaster gate but required more changes between lines on the underground The walk to Lancaster Gate is also on more quiet roads with less traffic and nice housing around the road It is also possible to slip into Hyde park when at Lancaster Gate You may also go through the mews to Lancaster Gate August Dale Canada review Comfortable stay Leisure trip Group Triple Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device I would add for an night stay it would of been nice if our sheet we changed at least once Our sheets were never changed and clean cups etc we not exchanged It was good for what I needed A safe clean place to stay

the best of any hostel in the US in fact it puts some motels to shame Gateway Inn The owners of the property and the staff were really great and welcoming and I would stay again if I m in the area There is parking on site which is great The property isn t the newest but it is very clean and tidy and cannot be faulted The location of the property is over ten miles out of the centre of Chicago which is fine if you have a car but the drive in is quite hectic so if you want to see central Chicago this may not be the best place for you On balance this is a great little motel and we are pleased we found it Gateway Inn Our room was clean and quiet The motel has free parking which is rare in Chicago In addition the breakfast was included in the price which was good I recommend this property for people who want to save money in accommodation Gateway Inn Clean and spacious room To train station was minutes walk so we left the car at the motel and took the train to Chicago Ohio House Motel It s the best motel in Chicago Very easy to approach it from freeway It s very good that there is a free parking option Staff was very helpful and friendly Rooms were clean and well equipped Location is very good Can reach everything by walk You might also like these property types Budget Hotels Family Hotels Spa Hotels Romantic Hotels Design Hotels Holiday Inn Hotels Marriott Hotels Hilton Hotels

saloon is a good atmosphere for causal drinking and socializing Want some shopping I do not recommend phips mall its pricey but the and theater was very delightful As far as driving I was lost even with GPS a lot Christine United States of America I m an Atlanta native but I have not been to everything I m an Atlanta native but I have not been to everything nor do I know where everything is in Atlanta but it s worth it The southern hospitality the culture the vibes the music the people the scenery and the food is amazing Plus we get all four seasons here and not just hot or cold all year long I would definitely take Marta for places here because the traffic can get pretty hectic I recently ate at a restaurant called Barrelhouse and the food was pretty good and not too bad on the wallet either Hudson Grille is good and I love the Cheesecake Factory at Lenox Mall Sprinkles Cupcakes has this salted oatmeal cookie and it was fresh out the oven omg For thrills I like Andretti car racing and Six Flags but I would love to try sky diving at Sky Atlanta National Museum of American history King Center Georgia Aquarium World of Coca Cola are good places for families Hotels That

trip Couple Double Room with Bath Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device No parking and had to leave car on the street Room clean but dated Bathroom very dated very small and evidence of mould Noisy due to party but we were aware of this Also expensive for a night Four star in Newcastle only cost more Very close to venue for anniversary party so could walk Breakfast was very nice but not included in price October Anonymous United Kingdom review Good location if a little noisy Leisure trip Solo traveler Superior Double Room Stayed night Firstly the accommodation states on site parking There were two parking spaces one of which appeared to be taken up by a vehicle that did not belong to a visitor There is on street parking nearby but to advertise that the property has its own parking is stretching a point Secondly the room was not double glazed and as the hotel is on a main road it was noisy Thirdly having booked in and then returning to my room later I found that there was a leak from the room upstairs This was investigated and rectified but with no real sense of urgency or apology although I did eventually get an explanation the water was not cleaned up I wasn t offered an alternative room without an internal waterfall feature or any compensation for my belongings that were wet through Good location if a little noisy October Paul United Kingdom Reviews Cosy place in a lovely town Leisure trip Couple Double Room with Shower Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device The car parking area is very small so may not be an option we parked a few minutes away

filled Yorkshire Puddings are the specialty there was so much choice of fillings and huge portions too October Jeffrey United Kingdom Reviews Fantastic Hotel Business trip Solo traveler Double Room

January Maria United Kingdom Reviews Warn about loud music until am Business trip Solo traveler Double Room with Bath Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device II thought I had booked a hotel that had a bar and restaurant so was very surprised to arrive at a pub with rooms above I hoped for the best and assumed there would be good soundproofing between the bar and bedrooms but there was not This was a problem as the music played very loudly until am both nights and it was almost am before the party people had vacated the disco and finished yelling their goodbyes to each other under my single glazed window I had to be up early each morning and had booked night s stay so I could be refreshed and relaxed to attend the conference The music was so loud it was impossible to sleep leaving me so tired the whole experience was spoiled The staff at the Dalesway are friendly and the pub welcomes dogs The location is excellent and the room was fine with a comfortable bed Staff agreed to serve me at breakfast serving due to start at am I thought the arrangement was for both mornings but in the event it was only Saturday and I had to wait until the official start on Sunday The breakfast was well cooked but choice was restricted December Douglas United Kingdom Reviews Conveniently located good value for money hotel Leisure trip Couple Double Room with Shower Stayed night No parking could have been more of a problem if the weather had been worse Friendly staff and convenient location Good breakfast Would definitely stay there again if in the area December Nigel United

service and good value for money I was very about the hotel If I come back in future to the same town I will definitely back here October Joanne United Kingdom Reviews Good value hotel in central location Leisure trip Couple Double Room with Shower Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Carpet didn t look as if it had been hoovered since last guests as bits all over Shower very complicated and mouldy inside Nicely furnished room with comfy bed and decent pillows Good breakfast but being OFFERED cereal instead of it just saying on the menu that it was AVAILABLE would have been better No fruit juice on offer either October Clive United Kingdom Reviews Beautiful Ilkey spoiler Leisure trip Couple Twin with Bathroom Shower Stayed night The twin room was cramp tired looking and looked dark and unclean it smelt of dog The bathroom was tired looking and clean but the smell of the drainage was quite overwhelming The toilet flush actually sounded like the Isle of Man Ferry fog horn The beds was shabby with old bed linen which had pulls and snags in the duvet cover The sheets where winter white The bed mattress was stained and smelled old The electric socket by the bed became warm after the lamp was switched on for minutes we felt it was unsafe so only had the main electric light on We were unable to actually complain on the day as we were under time pressure because we were attending a wedding We left the wedding earlier than planned in order to leave the hotel and go home that night so strong was our concern about the room I was unable to actually speak with the Landlord that evening as he was unavailable Today I have spoken with the Landlord and have expressed my concerns He has in fact offered use a return trip to Ilkley at his expense but it is an area of the country we do not visit and so we have turned down his kind gesture He also assures me that he will personally look into our concerns The location October Kitty United Kingdom review Very

breakfast The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable for my one night stay I would have no hesitation booking a room at this lovely venue again September Linda United Kingdom review Good location v Poor location Leisure trip Family with young children rooms Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device Woken up by noise outside early morning because of the lack of double glazing which is no fault of the hotel sadly it is because of the location Good location for the day bad for night time No one available to book out in the morning although we were told it was because they allow for a lie in on a sunday We would stay again though Great location Clean September Tom United Kingdom Reviews Perfectly adequate for my minimal needs but the lack of breakfast was disappointing Business trip Solo traveler Double Room with Shower Stayed night Two main issues it is a pub with rooms and there is a strong smell of cooking oil on the stairs but didn t notice it in the room fortunately I didn t get my breakfast as the staff didn t turn up The bedroom was clean and the bed comfortable I had very little interaction with staff so can t really comment I couldn t use the Wi Fi because of a problem with my laptop so can t comment on facilities but there was working TV and coffee facilities in the room September Victoria United Kingdom Reviews Nice location and decent room shame about the noisy bar Leisure trip Couple Double Room with Bath Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device Unfortunately despite asking for a room away from the bar we couldn t have been closer to it I assume it s because they were otherwise full but it would have been nice to have been told We could hear every word of every song on the bar until am Plus the power was off briefly so we couldn t dry our wet clothes on the towel rack Bed was comfortable and good sized room and tv August Pamela United Kingdom Reviews Not value for money Leisure trip Couple Superior Double Room Stayed night The hotel was quite old and in need of TLC paintwork and wood rotting The bathroom and shower were in a poor state Breakfast was quite nice but no cereal or fruit juice just the bare essentials

service could have vaccuumed more and washed the cups Unclear guidance about parking Was good once explained where spaces were nearby but nowhere to stop by the hotel on arrival Large and airy room Easy chair and sofa Good view Best location for the town the Dales and Leeds by train Didn t have the breakfast or eat there because an excellent choice of caf s and restaurants nearby August Michelle

hell out of me Wasn t cleaning staff either Clean and good location November Kevin United Kingdom Reviews Excellent place to stay shame about the WiFi Leisure trip Solo traveler King Room with Balcony Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The hotel free WiFi was terrible poor on the ground floor and virtually non existent by floor There s plenty of choices for different types and styles of food November Anonymous Australia review The beds were comfortable Family with young children King and Single Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device No access to outdoors from floor level paying for parking on top of room and the access down to the parking our card didn t work and we had several different ones Bathroom not very usable for elderly as have to step over the bath to get to the shower Curtains fell down The beds were comfortable November Matthew Australia Reviews Budget hotel that is close to work with a great TV warm and quiet Business trip Solo traveler King Balcony Stayed nights Disappointed that there is no microwave nor toaster in the room which are useful when staying for more than one night and the cabinet drawers out of are empty so these can fit in the room Nothing outstanding about the hotel just basic Bathrooms are dated and need an update This was a repeat stay for me for business since was happy overall the first time and will stay again Bathrooms are clean and appreciate having a decent bath and shower and deep sink for shaving TV is great for watching movies and staying entertained LG Air conditioner is strong and keeps the room warm Bed is comfy and noise is not too bad and comes from the corridor only November Rachel Australia Reviews Comfortable clean well serviced rooms with comfy beds and bedding Leisure trip Group King Balcony Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Even in Tasmania brrr I like a good balcony to check out the view The balcony was cramped with the a c but could still fit two chairs out if wanted Staff were friendly and they credited the nightly room incidentals immediately when I checked out Plus they also upgraded us to a nd bedroom suite when the beds weren t split as requested when I booked yay November Thomas Australia review Bad hotel rude staff and bad food the bath room was not clean Leisure trip Solo traveler King Balcony Stayed night Submitted from a mobile device The staff very rude I got food poisoning from the room service there and the food was just over priced and was not good for money Nothing the bed was yuck November Vivien Australia Age group review Room was comfy Solo traveler King Balcony Stayed nights There was hair behind the toilet seat Hmm not a good look Someone missed wiping the area down Also Please include a shower cap in the bathroom with the soaps and shampoos Room was comfy The staff were very helpful and friendly Room service was quick November Keith Australia review Very nice Leisure trip Couple Executive King Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Not enough coat hangers no bath mate which the elderly need The bed was very comforble the out look was nice the dining area was very good the reception was very good and the service excellent November Agostina Australia review The room was always made up really nice and the bed was Business trip Solo traveler King Balcony Stayed nights The first time I ordered room service I got the wrong dinner and it was cold The waiter came back and took my plate and swapped it with someone else s in a different room Also breakfast wasn t included which for the price I paid I thought was not very good value at all At the end of my stay the woman at the counter was adamant I needed to cross the road to wait for my airport shuttle There was a shuttle waiting the hotel side of the road but the receptionist said it was not my bus In the end I went and asked the shuttle and it turned out it was the one I was waiting for When I informed the receptionist that she had given me wrong information she just shrugged her shoulders in a very rude and dismissive way The room was always made up really nice and the bed was comfy It was easy to book excursions through the reception November Jacqueline Australia Reviews Very disappointing Couple King Balcony Stayed night On arrival wastepaper basket not emptied only one washer for two people washbasin dirty net curtains not been cleaned for years view of messy rooftop November Debra Australia review Definitely the very comfortable bed was a winner Leisure trip Couple King Room with Balcony Stayed night We did try the air conditioner but didn t really need it but it made annoying noises so maybe it needs servicing Definitely the very comfortable bed was a winner Also the choice of high and low pillows and a top sheet was a very good idea as the room was just the right temperature to sleep with just a sheet on top We didn t need the air conditioner on at all as we had had the sliding door open for a while to let in some fresh air November Ruthandvern United States of America Reviews Wonderful stay Couple King Room with Balcony Stayed nights The highlight of this property is the location The Red Line Bus is just two blocks away we walked over The room was very comfortable and the reception desk was extremely helpful in suggesting places to see which we followed up on to our satisfaction October Robyn Australia review So glad the bed wasn t hard Leisure trip Couple King Room with Balcony Stayed nights So glad the bed wasn t hard The staff were all very helpful Would stay again Only real negative for us was the dinner menu would have been nice to have one plainer basic dish October Les Australia Reviews Close to the waterfront and shops Group King and Single Room Stayed nights I went to the service desk on four occasions and it was not manned I went to the bar and it was not manned and had to wait around No cutlery not even a teaspoon in the room The driveway is very steep and the position of the card readers is poorly positioned there is no way possible to hold a kg bike balance and place the card in the reader Our room was aged and needed a refurbishment I had a further issue with the booking which was my over sight in which they collected the money but there was no assistance and compromise in fact they wanted to charge me more than the advertised rate so no I would not recommend this facility it does not live upto the illusion created in the web site Close to the waterfront and shops October Roslyn Australia Reviews Value for money paid Leisure trip Group King Balcony Stayed nights It is in a noisy location street wise so I suggest requesting a room facing at the back away from the street and the rooms didn t have much soundproofing so corridors were noisy with guest noise particularly late at night and doors banging Embers Restaurant food was pretty good The staff were mostly pleasant the rooms were clean and adequate with tea and coffee Beds and bathroom were comfortable Whilst it is considered in town it is a bit of a climb up to Bathurst St from the waterfront There are a couple of Pubs and places to eat not too far away October Violet Australia Reviews Very pleasant and comfortable Leisure trip Group King Room with Balcony Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Having to pay for parking when i was residing in the motel The dining facilities Buffet Breakfast started am The rooms were very clean and staff were friendly October KeithHockly Australia Reviews Good value option for Hobart Leisure trip Couple King Balcony Stayed nights The only thing was that the carpet in our room could have done with a good steam clean We had a really comfortable stay at this hotel on the edge of the CBD in Hobart Although our room was a little dated it was very spacious and had a comfortable bed and a good bathroom We had everything we needed flat screen TV WiFi and tea coffee making facilities Parking for per night was a bonus October Alcidio Australia Age group Reviews Not the best Leisure trip Couple King Balcony Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Internet did not work in the room and gave us the wrong room with the single beds When requested a double bed Have to tell them the room was wrong Staff was friendly and helpful October Serena Australia Reviews Met Expectations Leisure trip Group King Room with Balcony Stayed nights Just a suggestion perhaps the floor number placed on wall directly opposite lifts on each floor will leave guests less confused and save time especially for children using the lifts The mattress was really comfy and was the best thing about the room especially having driven down for hours approx from Cradle Mountain we slept well couples in rooms The breakfast was excellent Staff accommodated our request for a hr late checkout October Sue Australia Reviews Pleasant Leisure trip Family with young children Family Suite Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Very uncomfortable beds Shower over bath bath was very high Breakfast buffet was not worth it not much food and what food there was was cold The friendly staff Beautiful dinner at Embers October Paul New Zealand Reviews Don t stay there if you want a good night s sleep Leisure trip Couple King and Single Room Stayed nights Acoustics Could hear every fart from the rooms above below and side Close to Hertz where we rented a car and could park overnight free of charge hotel charged for parking October Craig Australia Reviews Great spot with clean room and large bed Leisure trip Couple King Balcony Stayed nights Room was a standard room with huge bed Room was cleaned every day to a high standard Hotel is close to great restaurants and a minute walk to Hobart harbour October Mark New Zealand Reviews Building is looking a little tired and so looks overpriced Leisure trip Solo traveler King Balcony Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Property was noisy possibly from lifts moving

Submitted from a mobile device We paid a reasonable amount for our room but didn t like how breakfast was not included in that Breakfast was also very pricey for what it was Room was really clean and bed quite comfy Also great that we had aircon heater to adjust the temperature for our room September Gabrielle Australia review I really enjoyed my stay at the Gre Business trip Solo traveler King Room with Balcony Stayed nights I think the hotel rooms especially the bathrooms could do with an upgrade Providing a map of Hobart city streets would have been good The Central position of the hotel was important when selecting a place to stay It was within walking distance of the shopping centre and the Salamanca market place The meals were wholesome even though a little expensive I had evening meals in the restaurant It was great to have laundry facilities where one could do your own washing September Michael Australia Reviews The stay was not enjoyable and we could not wait to leave will not be recommending this hotel to an Leisure trip Couple King Balcony Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The bed in the room could have been more accessible from both sides of the bed the

filled by a shower nozzle if you had a spare mins or so September Gai Australia Reviews Very pleased would stay here again Business trip Group King and Single Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device The bar seem to run out of drinks whether alcoholic or soft Either we don t have that but it s a key ingredient for a cocktail you advertise or run out of soft drinks in happy hour The

yummy September Anonymous Australia review Good value for money Close to everything Would stay there again Leisure trip Group King and Single Room Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Bathroom small and basic One bedside lamp had a broken plug Electric sockets were hidden behind beds Bed comfy Had tea making facilities Location was good Within walking distance to market cafes places of interest The hotel shuttle bus picked us up outside airport and delivered us to hotel door September Helene Australia Reviews Disappointing Leisure trip Family with young children Family Suite Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device fire evacuations in days Forced to stand out in disgusting weather because a toaster and hairdryer were used Whilst they claim it s for safety their system is obviously way way too sensitive when no smoke even exists to set it off Very frustrating and inconvenient September John Australia Reviews Good location friendly staff good restaurant comfortable

September Geoff Australia Reviews found that overall the accomadation suited our needs for the short time we stayed Leisure trip Couple King Balcony Stayed night extractor fan to reduce condensation

meanwhile I had a double bill sitting on mine you know me the guest Good location and OK rooms with a fairly comfortable bed great access to the CBD and local amenities Embers restaurant was pretty good and service and food was of good standard August Anonymous Australia review Still a nice place to drop after a bad hotel in Launceston Leisure trip Couple King and Single Room Stayed nights A light breakfast toast and cereal should be included There should be a microwave or at least more plates and cutlery We only had one saucer cups teaspoons and no knife The mini bar is an irritating nuisance in a hotel Someone came to our door in the morning to check if we had used any of it There are plenty of shops around We didn t eat in the hotel August Anita Australia Reviews Quite warm and

were very helpful In all it was a very pleasant stay May Sue Australia Reviews Good Price for a Central Hotel Leisure trip Couple King Balcony Stayed nights Sorry to say the meal we had at the restaurant was extremely poor perhaps it was just what we selected which was wood fired pizza s I could not recommend them The Hotel is Near the Main Area of Hobart with Paid parking facilities The

Rob Australia review Great stay overall except the Family Room Leisure trip Family with young children Family Suite Stayed nights Submitted from a mobile device Family room with connecting rooms accomodates occupants have only ONE bathroom This was MAJOR INCONVENIENCE for us Public toilet downstairs was available to use but there should have been bathrooms if the rooms were meant to fit

Breakfast was great too Great location Close to places May Grant Mitchell Australia Reviews Overpriced needs maintenance their own bar closed by ten on a Saturday Leisure trip Couple King Room with Balcony Stayed night Bathroom needed a little maintenance wanted extra ten dollars for parking when we already paid a premium price paid for a room with a balcony balcony not big enough even for one chair enough room for one person to stand We came back to the motel to have a drink in their bar after going out for dinner but when we returned at ten the bar was already closed on a Saturday night barman said we could get drinks via room service only to find no pre packaged spirits were on offer only beer etc didn t enjoy this stay Room was nice enough May Lion Australia Reviews Enjoyable

Stayed nights I believe the look they are going for is like a shabby chic They pretty much nailed it but some things need to be fixed all the lightbulbs should be on Get a new ice machine and update the microwaves etc Having them in a closet isn t the best Our room had a window AC unit but it was covered by long drapes If we wanted the cold air we had to have our room exposed to the passers by Do a little painting and while the look inside the room was pretty cool the armoire was a bit musty inside and we didn t want to put anything inside It just needed some small touches a good weekend of scrubbing painting and some elbow grease to make this a top notch place to stay I apologize that of the photos are sideways I couldn t figure out how to straighten them I m sure it s user error If not then shame on you booking com The location was perfect Being able to sit on the porch and just watch the world go by was perfect Just sitting with the dogs at night when the town shuts down and the
