Float along the rivers or around the coast of a continent that blends spectacular scenery with beautifully preserved traditions and cultures There is no such thing as a typical cruise to Asia The continent is divided by many operators into the subsections of Southeast Asia and East Asia each diverse and thrilling Both regions promise a heady mixture of natural beauty and fascinating culture albeit with very different atmospheres Spend your days aboard an Asia cruise watching idyllic islands pass by or enjoy port days exploring stunning temples energetic cities or rural retreats Many Southeast Asia cruise itineraries mix the beautiful beaches of Phuket the manic energy of Hanoi and the sleek modern elegance of Singapore However the diversity of this part of the continent means you can find exactly the right kind of Asia cruise to suit your tastes That might mean partying in Bali or taking an organized shore excursion into a quiet Malaysian fishing village Choose a cruise to East Asia for a vacation that includes China Japan and Korea Disembark in Beijing to enter the Forbidden City or visit the Great Wall Pick an itinerary that travels via Kyoto to see some of Japan s most impressive Shinto monuments Try an East Asia cruise vacation along the Yangtze River leading through the towering scenery of the Three Gorges Although most Asia cruises start and end on the continent some East Asian journeys will travel as far as Los Angeles as a first or last port in longer itineraries The most comfortable time of year to cruise in Asia and the best Asia cruise deals will vary according to which part of Asia you are visiting Often cruise lines will avoid scheduling Southeast Asia cruises in the most uncomfortably humid months In East Asia the summer months of July and August can be very hot Such a wide array of destinations means that there is no set length for cruises in Asia Spend four days skimming around Japan or take to explore Phuket Halong Bay and Ho Chi Minh City Cruises to Asia can also entice you away from the most famous itineraries too with expedition cruises taking passengers into Borneo or along rivers through Myanmar Africa Alaska Arctic

of the greatest man made waterways in the world and pass through the heart of Central America s wildlife rich jungles The Panama Canal is a triumph of engineering that cuts through Central America providing a crucial link between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans It s easy to understand why most cruise enthusiasts have this stretch of water on their bucket lists Embark on a Panama Canal cruise from the Caribbean beaches of the east coast to the wild surf swelling beauty of the west traveling through dense adventure filled jungles along the way The portion of the cruise through the Panama Canal takes about hours including stops the vessel makes while waiting for the three locks to open Watch the locks in action as the water levels change to allow ships to pass through one of the great thrills of Panama Canal cruises Select from multiple ships offering journeys along this busy cruising thoroughfare Choose a major liner complete with entertainment venues and multiple dining options Alternatively travel on a smaller vessel for a more personal experience at the canal Decide what kind of Panama Canal cruise you want Some itineraries run as partial transits and turn around halfway through to make a round trip This option is easiest for people who want limited journeys shore excursions on the canal itself and arrival and departure from the same place The second Panama Canal cruise option is full transit which guides you the whole way through the canal navigating each set of locks This allows visits to both sides of Central America and offers a more varied cruise As well as the canal itself a cruise through Panama Canal offers opportunities to discover more of Central America Pull into port in Costa Rica for ecotourism excursions and adventurous explorations zip lining through jungle canopies Your itinerary may include a stop in Honduras or Belize where you can discover the world s second largest barrier reef Panama Canal cruise season runs from October to April Peak months are December and January Look for Panama Canal cruise deals as ships reposition between Alaska and Caribbean bases Full transit itineraries generally last days and go from one coast

weather cooperated as it was early November We my wife and I found the room beautifully appointed and very comfortable with a balcony overlooking the water The staff were extremely helpful and made every effort to accommodate our needs Enjoyed the infinity pool and the private beach which is accessible with the hotel shuttle The water in the ocean was actually warmer than the infinity pool The hotel s facilities at the beach include swimming pools a bar and food service We enjoyed our inclusive breakfast overlooking the infinity pool and grounds The hotel is a distance from Hamilton but the taxi service was readily available and on occasion we used the public transport bus at the property entrance We walked to the property entrance but I understand the hotel will also shuttle you Really enjoyed our stay A verified traveler from White Plains NY stayed at Rosewood Bermuda Posted days ago Reviews for Rosewood Bermuda Five night getaway from Boston out of Loved it Flight from Boston was one hour and forty minutes Grotto Bay Resort was less than minutes from the airport and to take a taxi over the bay The staff was extremely polite and helpful and very personable The wait staff and chefs were all exceptional in accommodating for our gluten free diets Ask for Liviu from Romania as your waiter He loves what he does and will make you feel as if you were his family We did the all inclusive for five nights and really enjoyed it The food and drink was outstanding The rooms were nice with meeting our expectations nothing too fancy The grounds were awesome We stayed in oceanfront deluxe and the views were really nice Swimming in th caves on site and Blue Hole which you can walk to were really awesome The beach and snorkeling were wonderful Tennis was great and Romar the Pro was really helpful The Gym had everything we needed Only one recommendation The hot tub was too small this wehad to wait to use it often because it only accommodated people at a time Definitely we

cities or on the edge of dramatic wildernesses in a spectacularly diverse and thrilling continent Although it may not be the first continent that you think of when imagining cruise destinations an Africa cruise offers vast exhilarating and varied experiences that rival any of the cruise world s top destinations It has beach covered island delights as stunning as the Caribbean cultural cities as inspirational as Europe and swaths of untouched nature that easily match Alaska or Canada Africa is intimidatingly large but Africa cruises allow you to experience several different sides to this consistently beautiful continent Visitors speak in hushed tones of an African spirit yet in truth each country has its own unique atmosphere Take an Africa cruise vacation down the Chobe River in Botswana to get close to thirsty lions and hungry crocodiles or lounge on the beaches of Dakar in Senegal to experience a relaxed west coast atmosphere South Africa offers surfing in Durban and wine in Cape Town while Madagascar promises dense jungles with lemurs Just as the landscape can range from deserts to vineyards in a short space of time so too are Africa cruise deals appealingly diverse Luxury lines offer all inclusive indulgence with spacious ocean view suites and local dining in gourmet onboard restaurants Alternatively take a family friendly Africa cruise between Zanzibar and Durban for wildlife watching opportunities Itineraries for cruises to Africa vary wildly too Given the distance between ports shorter day cheap cruises to Africa are likely to cover only a few destinations Allow yourself to travel for longer however and your cruise to Africa could last between and nights following the coast all the way from Cape Town to Lisbon Portugal Pick a region of Africa whether that s the idyllic Seychelles Islands or the dramatic dunes of Namibia then enjoy days spent skimming along the continent s breathtaking coastline Take an Africa cruise during its relatively long cruise season Travel between October and May to enjoy the many attractions of the African coast The Seychelles offer Africa cruise deals year round while Madagascar has July options if

beach on a small intimate vessel or a large facility packed liner Tropical temperatures gorgeous beaches and the chance to see several islands in one trip Caribbean cruises are dream vacations First pick a cruise type that suits your style and interests Travel on a compact upscale craft or on an enormous resort style ship equipped with swanky spas swimming pools movie theaters and more Take a cruise to the Caribbean to discover numerous new lands cultures and communities in a hassle free manner without having to take logistically challenging expensive flights or even repack A scattered archipelago of picturesque islands the Caribbean s geography seems tailor made for cruising On certain voyages passengers are able to disembark at a new port almost every day Spend an afternoon wandering among the pastel painted colonial buildings of Willemstad in Dutch Cura ao and the next morning swaying in a hammock on Aruba s blissful Eagle Beach For Caribbean cruise travelers yearning for more exclusive beach escapes some cruise lines even stop at their own private resorts Because of the proximity of the eastern islands to one another Caribbean cruise vacations in this region usually allow for more time on land than do the routes centered in the Western Caribbean The larger western islands such as Jamaica as well as mainland ports in Mexico and Belize tend to offer a wider range of family friendly activities and varied shore excursions Hike to rushing waterfalls in Jamaica scramble up Mayan pyramids in Cozumel and snorkel with friendly stingrays at Grand Cayman An increasing number of cruise lines are incorporating Cuban ports into their Caribbean itineraries too Cruises to the Caribbean typically leave from Florida and last for one or two weeks Alternative departure locations and voyage lengths ranging from about three nights to a month are available too Good value Caribbean cruise deals can be found in spring and fall Look for affordable repositioning

Ruby Princess Party in buzzing beach resorts trek to mysterious Mayan ruins and discover underwater worlds during cruises around this colorful country Most cruises to Mexico stop by the region that the cruise industry calls the Mexican Riviera so nicknamed for its colorful oceanfront towns and long stretches of golden glistening coastline Here in ports such as Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas spend days at the beach dipping into seas of translucent aquamarine The Atlantic coast on the opposite side of Mexico is equally appealing tempting visitors with party cities such as Cancun and the idyllic Caribbean island of Cozumel There are two ways to choose what kind of Mexico cruise you want You can pick by the ship options range from small luxury vessels to giant liners with constant entertainment for the whole family Alternatively pick a Mexico cruise based on the itinerary Both the Mexican Riviera and the Gulf of Mexico offer scuba diving charming coastal towns and miles of sandy beaches When you re relaxing on the deck of your cruise liner look into the crystal clear waters to spot the local wildlife The balmy oceans around Baja California are the breeding grounds for migratory gray whales Many shore excursions will take you even closer to these peaceful creatures You ll see much more than whales in Mexico Encounter shy lobsters brightly colored fish and playful dolphins Itineraries are split naturally by the two oceans To experience the Gulf of Mexico on the east coast join a cruise through the Caribbean and stop at Grand Cayman on your way to Costa Maya The Mexican Riviera is compact enough for short journeys with operators offering night cruises from San Diego that journey along Baja California A longer cruise to Mexico will give you more time in some of the best ports and may take you up into the Sea of Cortez too Mexico cruises offer year round delights Many visitors flock to the Caribbean side in winter to escape colder temperatures elsewhere August and September in the Mexican Riviera can be very hot offering some of the best Mexico cruise deals If the sun does beat too hard simply enjoy a cooling swim in the beautiful ocean Africa Alaska

night Cuba roundtrip from Fort Lauderdale Aboard the Veendam from person night Veendam Set sail to this picturesque Caribbean island famed for its striking colonial architecture magnificent powder soft beaches and fascinatingly diverse culture With miles upon scenic miles of white sand beaches beckoning Old World architecture and majestic mountain ranges Cuba is quickly becoming a popular vacation destination and one of the best ways to explore this vibrant Caribbean island is with a Cuba cruise Very little has changed in Cuba in comparison to neighboring Caribbean islands due in large part to an economic embargo that has lasted for more than half a century As a result passengers disembarking from a Cuba cruise will notice that some of the major cities such as Havana appear to be stuck in a time warp the colonial architecture though visually stunning are in need of repair while antique Fords Buicks and Pontiacs are easily spotted cruising the streets in clouds of smoke However these storied surroundings are what make Cuba such a fascinating place to visit On a Cuba cruise vacation passengers have the opportunity to venture out to far reaching islands and to explore a few cities in the span of several days Nearly all cruises to Cuba incorporate a port of call in Havana Cuba s capital In this captivating city passengers can stroll through the cobblestone streets of Old Havana and admire its colonial buildings tour a fully operational cigar factory or enjoy an evening out at one of the city s many live music venues Another city passengers often visit during their Cuba cruise is Santiago de Cuba the second largest city in Cuba after Havana Here passengers can tour historic rum distilleries explore the UNESCO recognized Baconao Biosphere Reserve or simply bask on the shores of one of the many beautiful beaches Cienfuegos is another port of call made by some cruise lines and in this charming waterfront city passengers can take an excursion to the stunning El Nicho Waterfall stroll through the swanky Punta Gorda neighborhood to take in the beautiful neoclassical buildings or spend some time in the turquoise waters snorkeling sailing or swimming Most cruises to Cuba incorporate a port stop in Havana either for a full day or overnight so passengers can partake in at least one full day shore excursion Typically these shorter Cuba cruises incorporate a port of call in either Mexico or the Caribbean as well For longer duration Cuba cruises passengers can opt for a partial Cuba circumnavigation cruise which make ports of call in Santiago de Cuba and Cienfuegos If passengers are keen on doing a full Cuba circumnavigation cruise these itineraries will sail to more remote ports of call such as La Isla de Juventud The best time to go on a Cuba cruise is from December to March when the weather is delightful and rain is sparse From May to October the temperature can reach unbearable levels but if you can withstand the heat and humidity try to book your Cuba cruise in July so you can be a part of the effervescent Carnival festival that occurs every year in Santiago de Cuba Africa Alaska Arctic Antarctic Asia Australia New Zealand Bahamas Bermuda

Bora Resort and Thalasso Spa An at least once in a lifetime experience out of We can t say enough wonderful things about our honeymoon experience at the Four Seasons Bora Bora The setting is idyllic the resort itself is beautiful and the staff are second to none truly bending over backwards to make our trip a delight before during and after our stay We love to travel and have never seen a place like this before It s almost not fair to other locations The lagoon is huge well protected from the ocean and has a very healthy reef to explore It s as good as it looks in the pictures and great for anyone who likes a great beach or to explore tropical waters The amazing staff are easy to reach via phone email or even chat via their app always responding quickly and positively The concierge team helped plan and book dining activities before our stay including off resort helped make changes during the trip for example helping make alternate plans when a tour was cancelled due to rain and even helped arrange things at a resort in Tahiti where we planned to spend a layover on our way home Any questions or issues during our stay were dealt with quickly and to our satisfaction delight Overall

but this was not a huge deal A verified traveler from Bermuda stayed at Henann Regency Resort Spa Posted hours ago Reviews for Henann Regency Resort Spa PERFECT REVIEW FOR A GREAT NEW HOTEL IN STATION out of I ve been coming to Boracay for years and have stayed all over the island and I am very happy to award IL Mare Sakura a perfect review based on six great nights I just spent there over the last week LOCATION is ideal It s in Station maybe a two or three minute walk to White Beach Also around the corner you ve got everything from Andok s and Jonah s Fruit Shake and Obama Grill to The Beach Bar and Club Paraw and Cocomangas etc Balabag Plaza too It s about a minute walk to D Mall or three minutes by trike Finally being just off the beach rather than right on it ensures peaceful sleeps PREMISES are charming The hotel is new and feels that way with a Japanese ambience throughout The quiet secluded pool is a nice getaway from the beach PRICE is right Excellent value which includes a delightful complimentary breakfast ROOMS are clean and spacious Mine was a deluxe suite with two big comfy beds a TV that had wicked channel selection a safe a modern bathroom with hot water good air conditioning a mini fridge with free water a strong wifi connection daily housekeeping etc STAFF is attentive and cheerful From the front desk to the management to the security to all other employees I was always made to feel like I was at home and always welcomed with a big smile I intend to return to Boracay next year and would stay again in a heartbeat In the meantime I will sincerely recommend

share the same promise of a wilderness largely untouched by humans These aren t the kind of places where shore excursions take you to shopping or beaches Here step into untamed nature where glaciers icebergs and mountains form landscapes of unearthly beauty When picking a liner for your Antarctica cruise remember that bigger is not necessarily better Vessels with over people are not allowed to land so if you want an on the ground experience choose a smaller craft with or fewer passengers The Arctic which isn t a continent and includes several different countries has no such regulations so you can experience it in ships of many sizes Shape your own unique Antarctica or Arctic cruises Where you land in Antarctica could vary according to the weather of that day Most Antarctica cruises leave from the southern tip of Argentina with some visiting the South Georgia Islands on the way Once you are on the continent observe penguins climb the volcano on Deception Island or kayak through the icebergs of Lemaire Channel nicknamed Kodak Gap The Arctic is a broad term describing everything north of the Arctic Circle Your Arctic cruise could drift through the melts around Norway Greenland or Canada Gaze up in awe at the northern lights a spectacular nocturnal display that is the highlight of most Arctic cruise vacations Places such as Wrangel Island in Russia and Longyearbyen in Svalbard Norway are great ports for spotting polar bears With so many fascinating sights you cannot hope to see them all with just one cruise to the Arctic Summer is the season for both Arctic and Antarctica cruise vacations although the appropriate months come at opposite times of year in the two hemispheres Itineraries in these far flung parts of the world can come with rough seas longer journeys and skin puckering temperatures When you arrive on your Arctic or Antarctica cruise enjoy unrivaled natural beauty as a fantastic reward for your efforts Africa Alaska Asia Australia New

Loved the heated pool outside the pool inside and a Lazy River and Hot Tub Can t wait to visit again A verified traveler stayed at Ocean Reef Resort Posted days ago Reviews for Ocean Reef Resort Good location fun water activities for kids out of This hotel has a waterpark in the bottom of each tower for kids which is great considering we went when the weather was colder during off season Originally booked an angle ocean view room however requested to move once we arrived We paid an upgrade fee to be ocean front but it was worth it since the angle view is really on the side of the building overlooking the parking lot Overall we had a good stay the room was a great set up and had lots of amenities even a washer dryer and dishwasher The breakfast was good and having a Starbucks in the lobby was great My real issue happened at check in I was traveling alone with my kids and Once checked in the desk staff told me to go to the activities desk for my welcome kit That lady proceeded to discuss all of the shows activities etc in the area and review what we might want to do during our four day stay in Myrtle Beach After discussing for minutes while my kids were hanging off me anxious to get to the pool we decided on a few things and she came up with a great discount for us Not so fast she then hit me with the fact I could have these prices if I went on a tour of some condos the next day What There had been NO mention of this at all whatsoever I m traveling ALONE with my two kids how can I go on a tour What a racket She then proceeded to tell me that perhaps I should visit the Myrtle Beach vacation center to see if they have any coupons then she dismissed me Wow A verified traveler from Maine stayed at Dunes Village Resort Posted days ago Reviews for Dunes

Puerto Vallarta with kids I ll be honest my family typically vacations on Mexico s Riviera Maya because of the plentiful flights from Denver to Cancun the upbeat shopping and dining scene in Playa del Carmen and its gorgeous white sand beaches and turquoise Caribbean Sea But to change it up a bit for our tropical vacation a couple years ago we headed to Mexico s west coast to get to know Puerto Vallarta While I still think the beaches on Mexico s Yucatan Peninsula are prettier with much softer sand I will say that our family trip to Puerto Vallarta didn t disappoint The beachfront downtown El Centro is easy to navigate on foot locals were friendly and welcoming especially to my young children old buildings and churches as well as cobblestone streets add to the city s historic charm and we found plenty of active things to do in and around the city which is our modus operandi for most if not all of our family vacations Visitors love to travel to Puerto Vallarta Mexico because of its

destination in the Caribbean Aruba is one of the Lesser Antilles Islands and is located about degrees north of the equator close to the Paraguana peninsula of Venezuela There are some truly beautiful hotels in Aruba making this a top destination in many travelers eyes The high season for travel to Aruba is between December and April while the low season for tourism is between April and December The weather is almost always nice with calm seas and sunny skies The best time to travel depends on what you are looking for in a vacation You can find Aruba hotel packages throughout the year but to get the best deals make your reservations early For Aruba hotel deals the months of June to August are the low point of the tourist season and they offer some great deals The low season will yield some of the lowest discount rates During the high season you can still find cheap hotel deals though doing so is a touch more difficult Especially during high season it s important to book rooms early to ensure you are finding the lowest prices especially on early bird specials Regardless of when you go Aruba is an exciting place for the entire family Unlike many Caribbean islands Aruba doesn t really have a hurricane or tropical storm season and between mid December and mid April the trade winds bring a steady breeze to the air The beach is always fun no matter what time you visit Children and adults alike will enjoy such attractions as the island s Butterfly Farm which will allows visitors to watch a caterpillar become a butterfly At the Aruba Donkey Sanctuary you can see and visit donkeys and if you arrive early enough you can even help feed the animals Some cheap hotel deals in Aruba may include discounts to these two family friendly attractions For music lovers try to plan your visit around the Soul Beach Music Festival held on Memorial Day weekend each year This festival often features top musicians and takes over the island for five days Festivities during this time start early and parties go on until late in the night Keep an ever vigilant eye out for a cheap Aruba hotel deal during this period If you want a real party however visit Aruba in January and February During this period is the six week non stop party known as Carnival Of course hotel rooms are most expensive during this time Some Aruba hotel deals during this time will include other special additions or bonuses Many Aruba hotels are resort style hotels Despite their high quality these hotels can often be a great value due to their all inclusive nature Read More More Hotels in Aruba

tourist season normally begins Low Season Fares often drop during low season which is either early or late in the cruise season such as May or September in Alaska or Europe Many choose to take a

crowds and enjoy more moderate temperatures than the summer months You ll also find less expensive sailings this time of year Note that early fall is hurricane season in the Caribbean Hawaii and Mexico however cruise lines can easily change course to avoid a storm Winter Exchange cold weather for some sun Winter is a popular time to cruise to the Bahamas Mexico and the Caribbean Spring Spring break cruises abound in the Bahamas and Mexico In addition spring is a great time to visit the Mediterranean For Alaska try late spring an affordable time to go as it s right before high season when prices go up Summer Alaska attracts a high concentration of travelers in the summer months but it s also a popular time to enjoy Europe s sights And don t forget the kids With school out for the summer this is a convenient time to get the whole family together especially in kid friendly beach destinations like the Caribbean or the Bahamas Show more How to Save With meals entertainment and lodging already included cruises are an excellent way to travel on a budget Here are some extra tips to help you save when you sail Wave Season No matter when you plan to sail consider making your cruise booking between January and March when cruise lines offer some of their best deals of the year Repositioning Cruises Another great way to save is when a ship is in process of relocating between seasons You can cruise for less and enjoy more days at sea Note that any airfare purchased won t be roundtrip as you will be flying into one destination and out of another Low Season If you re willing to chance unpredictable weather consider cruising when rates drop and you can easily score the sailing date and cabin of your choice Show more How to Choose Your Cabin All cabins are classified as inside oceanview balcony or suite Before booking consider the time you ll spend in your cabin If you want a spacious relaxing space you ll likely want to opt for a larger oceanview balcony or suite Plan to use it to just sleep and shower An inside cabin might appeal to you Inside cabins are the smallest cabins with no views but are a good option for budget travelers We do not recommend inside cabins for more than two guests Oceanview cabins have windows or portholes and are great for those who prefer natural light and more space while still being economical Balcony cabins are ideal for those who seek a private outdoor space attached to their own room where they can dine or just relax and take in the amazing views of destinations they visit Suites are generally the largest cabins onboard and offer the most exclusive amenities They have windows and usually larger balconies often with full dining tables Some cruise lines even have a hot tub on your balcony or two bedrooms Amenities vary from butler and concierge service to priority embarkation disembarkation dinner and spa reservations and more The majority of cabins accommodate at least two guests however many cabins sleep more often with pullman beds or sofa beds to accommodate families or groups Special large suites can accommodate as many as such as Royal Caribbean s Presidential Family Suite featuring bedrooms and a living room For a more economical family option we suggest connecting cabins Keep in mind cabins for or passengers and connecting cabins are limited and sell out quickly Specific occupancy details are listed on the cabin category page during the booking process Cabin Location Why do cabins with identical or similar descriptions vary in price Typically cabins located on higher decks and mid ship are the most expensive because they have more balcony space and expansive views and are easily accessible to outdoor public spaces and activities When choosing a cabin consider the following Motion sickness To avoid a queasy stomach choose a cabin mid ship on a lower level Proximity to public areas Do you want to be by public areas such as the pool entertainment areas or the kids clubs Consider your preferences and choose a cabin near or away from these areas Noise For a quieter location a cabin that is both above and below other cabins rather than above or below public areas like a basketball court or children s areas is a safe bet Also avoid cabins that are low and in close proximity to the engine or anchor Mobility Do you have mobility issues Choose a cabin near an elevator for convenience Privacy Do you want an exclusive feel to your cruise Some cruise lines have cabins in private spaces with special restaurants and lounges such as Norwegian Cruise Line s Haven and MSC Cruises Yacht Club concept Views If you want a view try a balcony or suite Forward facing balcony cabins or suites are located at the front of the ship allowing you the same views as the Captain Mid ship balcony cabins or suites are located along the sides of the ship and are the closest proximity to public areas and activities Aft balcony cabins or suites are at the very back of the ship They offer degree views of the ship s wake and the balconies are often larger in these cabins Show more Booking Your Cruise How do I know which cabin to book All passenger cabins are located above sea level and are classified as one of four categories Inside cabins are generally the smallest cabins onboard and have no views but are a good option if you are on a tight budget Oceanview cabins include windows or portholes and provide a view of ports visited Balcony cabins feature an ocean facing balcony that offers a space to relax that is all your own Suites are the largest cabins onboard They have windows and usually balconies and offer the most amenities often including exclusive butler or concierge service and other special amenities What is a Guaranteed Cabin Booking a Guaranteed Cabin

the cruise line Changing or Cancelling Your Cruise What if I need to cancel my cruise Most cruise lines allow you to cancel your cruise without a fee when done at least days before departure However any shorter notice will likely result in fees Cruise cancellation fees increase the closer to the departure date that a cancellation is made Consult the cruise line s rules and regulations during booking for their specific cancellation fees and policies You may also want to consider Cruise Travel Protection which can reimburse you for cancellation penalties in case of medical emergencies Should I purchase Cruise Travel Protection Whether or not to purchase Cruise Travel Protection is an individual decision However it is recommended that you purchase Cruise Travel Protection in case illness or injury keeps you from traveling If you need to cancel your trip because you your immediate family or your travel companion are too sick to travel you can get reimbursed for your original
