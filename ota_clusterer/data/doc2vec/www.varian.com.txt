Hospitals of Geneva Uses Calypso Guided Stereotactic Radiotherapy for Lung Cancer Treatment Doctors at the University Hospitals of Geneva HUG have begun to utilize the Calypso GPS for the body technology to enhance the accuracy of radiotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer A recent article in Le Temps a magazine serving French speaking residents of Switzerland offered details of the first Calypso guided treatment at HUG which took place in July of this year The patient a fifty year old woman received treatment for early stage lung cancer According to the article radiation oncologists are faced with the challenge of delivering as much ionizing radiation to the tumor as possible while finding ways to minimize the exposure of surrounding healthy tissues This is all the more important when the tumor is located near vital organs such as the heart or spinal cord Francesca Caparrotti a radiation oncologist who is responsible for the treatment of lung cancer at HUG is quoted as saying Calypso provides the clinical team with a continuous stream of information about the position of the tumor throughout a course of treatment the article explains The medical linear accelerator the machine that generates the radiation beam is stopped automatically any time the tumor shifts out of position To accomplish this HUG physicians inserted three tiny electromagnetic transponders into the patient s lung tumor by bronchoscopy Each of the three implants emits its own electromagnetic signal which is picked up by the Calypso system detector In this way the system detects the precise position of each transponder and therefore of the tumor continuously and in real time For patients pulmonary stereotactic radiotherapy is a new option for local treatment in addition to surgery says Benjamin Besse of the thoracic cancer unit at the Gustave Roussy Institute in Villejuif France where this type of treatment has been offered for two years Although effective surgical removal of a lung lobe or lung cannot always be offered to all patients especially if their respiratory condition is compromised the article asserts Under these conditions an alternative approach is welcome As to whether outcomes from the two approaches are equivalent Dr Besse says The side effects of stereotactic radiotherapy are usually modest But we still do not have any randomized studies comparing the two Compared to conventional stereotactic radiotherapy this GPS guided technique is more accurate and less risky which is always a plus for the quality of life of the patient adds Dr Caparrotti Original

Proton Therapy About Varian Careers Medical Affairs Investors Newsroom Oncology About Solutions Products Treatment Techniques Service Education Events Resources For Patients Solutions Radiosurgery Radiotherapy Proton Therapy Medical Oncology Brachytherapy Professional Services Radiotherapy SHARE Radiotherapy Radiotherapy also known as radiation therapy has two equally important goals to control the growth of the tumor and to do so while minimizing exposure to the surrounding normal healthy tissue Used typically as a curative treatment either alone or in conjunction with surgery and or chemotherapy the aim of radiation therapy has always been to eradicate a patient s cancer Radiotherapy uses high energy radiation usually x rays to damage cancer cells and treat tumors in the breast prostate head and neck lung and anywhere in the body where radiation treatment is indicated Advances in radiotherapy have been made in the past two decades as improvements in imaging modalities powerful computers and software and delivery systems have enabled technologies such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy IMRT Image Guided Radiotherapy IGRT Volumetric Arc Therapy VMAT and Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy SBRT to be used in routine clinical practice The high precision and power possible with Varian systems helps evolve radiotherapy and expand patient treatment options Varian radiotherapy systems help provide more paths to treatment and more paths to growth A wide array of imaging components including cone beam CT kV MV and fluoroscopy for high quality images of soft tissues boney anatomy or other markers for optimal patient positioning Rigorous precision with a variety of multileaf collimators Remote operations that provide advanced capabilities with a simple interface Real time tracking options for enhanced tumor targeting Treatment speed with RapidArc radiotherapy technology Such versatility is why Varian radiotherapy systems including the TrueBeam

extraction efficiency which translates into large dose rates Highly linear reproducible machine function Less power consumption ProBeam Superconducting Cyclotron The Varian ProBeam system features an isochronous cyclotron ISC with superconducting coils also termed a superconducting cyclotron Its energy capabilities allow for dose delivery to deep seated tumors offering the broadest energy treatment range available without the use of range shifters tumors at depths of cm Additional features of the ProBeam cyclotron include No warm up phase since it operates continuously for maximum efficiency A continuous beam A scalable beam intensity A pillbox design for easy access with an automatic lifting system of the upper iron yoke A compact internal ion source for reduced size and cost A compact footprint for reduced structural cost and improved serviceability No need for high power consumption and heat dissipation associated with room temperature electromagnets Proven performance Superconducting Cyclotron Functionality The superconducting magnet coils of the ISC provide high extraction efficiency low energy consumption excellent reliability and reduced overall operating costs Unlike some other accelerators the Varian ISC functions in a very linear predictable manner This enhances automation for the facility cyclotron tuning by an operator is not necessary The minimal need for intervention by an operator can lead to maximized clinical efficiency ISC Cyclotron Delivers IMPT Varian s ISC accelerator is compact in size with a high thermal stability It was the industry s first commercially available ISC with superconducting coils for medical use and it has been used since Its continuous and stable proton beam is able to deliver intensity modulated proton therapy IMPT in a shorter time and with a more conformal dose than passive scattering delivery though passive scattering is what most proton therapy centers use today Type of Proton Delivery Pencil Beam Scanning or Passive Scattering The type of proton therapy delivery is a critical consideration pencil beam scanning versus passive scattering Passive scattering is an earlier generation of proton therapy which is what most established proton centers use Today pencil beam scanning is a more precise form of proton therapy and it is the choice of the majority of new proton centers Though some centers with passive scattering technology are able to upgrade individual treatment rooms this can be a slow process with significant technology changes that may even interrupt a center s availability to treat patients Learn More Passive Scatter Using passive scattering the proton beam is widened and shaped to fit the tumor by placing scattering material in its path Some characteristics to consider about passive scattering It uses patient specific beam modifying devices to conform the dose Such tumor specific devices must be manufactured in house or sourced from suppliers Patients must wait to begin treatment until the devices are made The beam modifying devices become radioactive and must be stored for months after use requiring a dedicated storage area When the scattered proton beam contacts the scattering material or the beam modifying devices it produces neutrons secondary radiation It deposits unnecessary dose from proton radiation in healthy tissues proximal to the target When protons encounter scattering material and beam modifying devices they lose energy or the range available to treat the patient Less optimal dose conformance Though passive scattering may be preferred over traditional radiation therapy for some treatment protocols it cannot provide true intensity modulated proton therapy IMPT only pencil beam scanning can Pencil Beam Scanning vs Passive Scattering Technology Considerations Pencil Beam Scanning Passive Scattering Can provide true intensity modulated proton therapy IMPT Yes No Patient specific compensators and collimators required for every treatment Such devices can delay start of treatment since they must be custom made for each patient These devices may result in longer setup times per treatment The devices can add to overall cost of treatment Centers may need special procedures to lift and store these radioactive components No Yes Secondary radiation produced as protons encounter beam modifying devices Only if range shifters are needed Much greater secondary radiation since devices are used for all treatments Control of energy loss Controlled loss of energy when range shifters are used Uncontrolled energy loss due to use of beam modifying devices in all treatments Patient treatment time Treatment with radiation beam on may be as short as a couple of minutes Depending on the treatment plan radiation beam on time only a couple of minutes more setup time required for overall treatment per day due to compensators and collimators Treatment Field Size Larger field size than scattering Smaller field size than PBS Precision in dose delivery Dose delivered directly to the tumor with lower dose to surrounding tissue This is particularly important in pediatric cases or when the tumor is close to a critical

system focuses and shapes the beam while guiding it to the treatment room Varian s ProBeam beam transport system is designed specifically for pencil beam scanning ProBeam Beam Transport System A series of large bending and focusing magnets used with diagnostic measurement tools guides the proton therapy beam to the treatment room The system directs the magnets to deliver a precise beam size and it s capable of treating shallow tumors quickly without range shifters The properties of the beam directed at the patient remain independent from the gantry angle With its precise and stable beam optics the entire system ensures accurate beam positioning and shaping which produce a highly conformal dose ProBeam Energy Selection System The ProBeam Energy Selection System ESS is a proton beam modification system converting the fixed energy from the cyclotron to the desired treatment energy In this way the ESS aids in verifying optimal treatment precision The ESS is designed specifically for delivery of pencil beam scanning and the precision it offers The energy for each spot is prescribed in the treatment planning and the integrated ProBeam system delivers the prescribed dose per spot to the treatment area There is a dosimeter integrated into the nozzle that measures each spot before delivering the next to optimize dose rate and overall conformity ProBeam Degrader The degrader is a device for adjusting the energy of a proton beam from to MeV per the treatment plan The energy of the proton beam in turn matches the therapy penetration depth to the precise depth of a targeted

Treatment Delivery SHARE Rotating Gantry and Treatment Room ProBeam Gantry Room The ProBeam gantry is a steel structure containing the end of the beam transport system and the scanning nozzle The rotating gantry moves around the patient delivering the beam at any desired angle It rotates in both directions for full rotation so that the proton beam and the target volume are positioned and delivered with great accuracy and with highly conformal treatment Together the gantry and treatment table ensure precise positioning of the beam relative to tumor volume Gantry Beam Delivery and Safety Features The Varian system s beam can be fully rotated around the isocenter In addition a dedicated system helps ensure patient safety during the entire course of treatment For instance if sensors detect that an object is in close proximity to the gantry nozzle the system automatically slows or if necessary halts gantry and treatment table motion Both audible and visual signals are emitted from the control keypad in the treatment room and control room Patient Positioning System and Treatment Table The treatment table support is located in front of the gantry The movement of the table six degrees of freedom is computer controlled Designed for a maximum load of lb kg the table s load cells compensate for variation in patient weight In case of an emergency loss of power the table can be moved and lowered manually Any potential flexing of the treatment table due to patient weight will be automatically detected and corrected to ensure appropriate therapy delivery Events

Resources For Patients Solutions Radiosurgery Radiotherapy Proton Therapy Medical Oncology Brachytherapy Professional Services Radiosurgery SHARE Overview Resources Radiosurgery Radiosurgery is a procedure that precisely delivers large radiation doses to tumors and other relevant anatomical targets in one to five treatments Varian radiosurgery involves the use of sophisticated technology to ablate tumors or other abnormalities with non invasive high dose radiation while minimizing the exposure to surrounding healthy tissue Starting from classical neurosurgical targets SRS stereotactic radiosurgery is progressing to treat targets previously not considered candidates for high dose hypofractionated delivery Varian radiosurgery can be used for treating benign malignant metastatic or non oncologic targets Benign lesions can include schwannomas adenomas neurofibromas and meningioma Malignant lesions include astrocytomas and glioblastomas Metastases to distant targets such as brain or spine can come from any malignant primary cancer the leading ones of which are lung breast melanoma and prostate Non oncologic targets include vascular malformations trigeminal neuralgia and others prescribed by the doctor Varian has helped pioneer new stereotactic treatment technologies in use for the treatment of cancer and other conditions Treatments take advantage of recent advances in proven technologies including Imaging with cone beam CT Motion management Precision beam delivery with RapidArc Treatment planning through Eclipse Automated patient positioning technologies Radiosurgery treatments using Varian technology are helping expand the options available to multidisciplinary oncology teams to treat a wide variety of targets throughout the body including Neuro Oncology Benign brain tumors Thoracic Oncology Lung Esophagus Gastro Intestinal Oncology Liver Pancreas Adrenals Genitourinary Oncology Prostate Kidneys Related Products Edge Radiosurgery System

Education Events Resources For Patients Treatment Techniques External Beam Radiation Internal Radiation Therapy Brachytherapy Particle Therapy Internal Radiation Therapy Brachytherapy HDR LDR IGBT PDR HDR SHARE HDR High Dose Rate Brachytherapy High dose rate HDR brachytherapy uses a relatively intense source of radiation typically Curie source made of Iridium delivered through temporarily placed applicators The source is usually attached to or embedded in the end of a wire or cable The wire is driven through catheters into applicators that have previously been placed in the patient The source dwells in a preplanned position for a preset time before stepping along the catheter This process repeats to create the required dose distribution By varying the position and dwell time of the radiation source the dose is neatly sculpted to conform to the shape of the target The patient typically receives the total dose in a series of treatment sessions also known as fractions Varian offers a computer controlled afterloader technique comprising of the VariSource iX or GammaMedplus iX afterloaders BrachyVision Acuros BV and Vitesse treatment planning software Applicators and accessories In comparison to older manual loaded brachytherapy techniques HDR brachytherapy enables treatments to be planned after the applicator placement but before radiation delivery helping to improve treatment efficacy and safety The accurate dose distribution shaping of HDR helps target tissues while minimizing dose to surrounding healthy tissue The rapid dose delivery of HDR allows for more

Newsroom Oncology About Solutions Products Treatment Techniques Service Education Events Resources For Patients Treatment Techniques External Beam Radiation Internal Radiation Therapy Brachytherapy Particle Therapy Internal Radiation Therapy Brachytherapy HDR LDR IGBT PDR LDR SHARE LDR Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy LDR low dose rate brachytherapy uses permanent seed implants to treat early stage prostate cancer In this technique radioactive seeds about the size of a grain of rice are positioned in the prostate using needles that are guided into position by ultrasound and a template or grid through which the needles are inserted to control their spacing From to more than individual seeds may be placed in a single session using to needles Radiation is then delivered to the prostate slowly over the following month or so as the sources decay As the seeds emit radiation they reduce in strength and in a few weeks no longer emit any measurable amounts of radiation The most commonly used LDR treatment site is the prostate which involves permanent placement of tiny radioactive seeds in the prostate tissue Treating with brachytherapy requires the seeds be placed so the radiation dose adequately covers the entire prostate but minimizes dose to the surrounding healthy tissue To accomplish this task Varian has developed the VariSeed LDR prostate treatment planning system which uses trans rectal ultrasound TRUS images to help design the intended placement of sources It then helps provide dynamic dosimetry to update the dose map in real time as the individual seeds are deposited in the prostate This allows the physician to compensate in real time for any gaps that may arise as a result of prostate deformation by the needles or other needle placement issues that may occur VariSeed can also automatically detect seeds from a post implant computed tomography CT image set to confirm the received dose distribution Related Products VariSeed LDR Treatment Planning System

Medical Affairs Investors Newsroom Oncology About Solutions Products Treatment Techniques Service Education Events Resources For Patients Treatment Techniques External Beam Radiation Internal Radiation Therapy Brachytherapy Particle Therapy Particle Therapy IGPT IMPT IMPT SHARE Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy IMPT What is IMPT Intensity modulated proton therapy IMPT is a highly precise type of radiation therapy using proton therapy Intricate treatment planning and precise proton beam delivery results in modulating the intensity of the proton beam and shaping it to match the contours of the tumor IMPT also provides the most conformal dose delivery technique for radiation therapy coloring the tumor precisely within the lines prescribed by the physician It also produces significantly fewer neutrons than other types of proton systems and therefore delivers less radiation to healthy tissue adjacent to the tumor This is especially important for pediatric patients who are at greater risk of developing neutron induced secondary cancers later in life and for patients with tumors in close proximity to critical structures that cannot be exposed to radiation Learn More Only Pencil Beam Scanning Delivers True IMPT Not all proton therapy can deliver IMPT only Pencil Beam Scanning PBS can With its highly accurate targeting of tumors IMPT focuses a narrow proton beam to paint the radiation dose spot by spot and layer by layer onto all parts of a tumor even irregularly shaped tumors IMPT is effective for tumors that wrap around critical structures such as the brain or spinal cord or are located adjacent to structures or organs e g the frequent proximity of prostate tumors to the bladder or large intestine or of breast tumors to the heart Learn More Related Products

For Patients Products Treatment Delivery Software Cloud Based Apps Real time Tracking Motion Management Treatment Delivery SHARE Overview Pencil Beam Scanning Bragg Peak Contact ProBeam Proton Therapy Proton therapy is a major technological advance in cancer care The effectiveness of proton therapy is due to the way the energy is delivered at a prescribed depth known as the Bragg Peak Varian s ProBeam system is at the forefront of the industry having created the world s first commercially available pencil beam scanning system which is the most precise form of proton therapy available Only pencil beam scanning is able to deliver intensity modulated proton therapy IMPT which is recognized for its effectiveness and conformity of dose delivery and considered an advance over other proton therapy delivery methods Currently proton therapy as a whole offered at centers worldwide composes a small percentage of radiotherapy treatment options But many centers are in the planning or construction phases ProBeam Compact Single Room Proton Therapy Solution With the ProBeam System clinicians can take advantage of Varian s first in the industry expertise in pencil beam scanning which offers more precise control from the beam to the targeted tumor In addition a single room system requires significantly less space than a multi room proton therapy center fitting into an area the size of a tennis court or about parking spaces Learn More ProBeam Multi Room Proton Therapy System Some centers may opt for a multi room proton center with its capacity to treat higher numbers of patients Others may choose a compact single room system Varian s ProBeam system delivers the same technologically advanced pencil beam scanning therapy as well as a fully rotational gantry a single integrated console and other advanced functions regardless of the number of treatment rooms Learn More Brief Look at Pencil Beam Scanning Advantages Varian stands apart from other proton therapy systems in that it uses pencil beam scanning exclusively With the ability to program pencil beam scanning to the precise depth of the tumor clinicians are now able to achieve the following Deliver higher radiation doses with increased conformity and speed of the dose than experienced with scattering proton technology Sculpt doses to the complex shapes that reflect the contour of the tumors Treat tumors in difficult locations for example tumors that are surrounded by critical healthy tissue and organs Can often reduce the side effects common in traditional radiotherapy due to sparing of healthy tissues

Resources For Patients Treatment Techniques External Beam Radiation Internal Radiation Therapy Brachytherapy Particle Therapy Internal Radiation Therapy Brachytherapy HDR LDR IGBT PDR PDR SHARE PDR Pulsed Dose Rate Brachytherapy The process of delivering pulsed dose rate PDR brachytherapy is similar to HDR but radiation is delivered in short pulses over several hours The principle behind PDR is that it is biologically similar to traditional low dose rate LDR techniques where sources are manually loaded into catheters and applicators The source is left in place for a number of hours or days Because PDR uses a remote controlled afterloader it promotes radiation safety prospective planning and precise dose shaping In contrast to the HDR technique PDR treatments are delivered on an in patient basis and require a dedicated shielded treatment room where a patient can stay for up to a day Controlling applicator movement during that time adds another level of challenge In order to allow visitors and staff to interact with the patient PDR equipment typically has a treatment an interrupt capability which allows the source to automatically be returned to the afterloader while nurses hospital staff and visiting family members are in the room Outside the United States Varian supports PDR techniques with the GammaMedPlus HDR PDR afterloader BrachyVision treatment planning

Volumetric Arc Therapy VMAT or RapidArc Radiotherapy Technology is an advanced form of IMRT that delivers a precisely sculpted D dose distribution with a degree rotation of the gantry in a single or multi arc treatment Unlike conventional IMRT treatments during which the machine must rotate several times around the patient or make repeated stops and starts to treat the tumor from a number of different angles VMAT RapidArc can deliver the dose to the entire tumor in a degree rotation typically in less than two minutes RapidArc uses special software and an advanced linear accelerator from Varian to deliver IMRT treatments up to eight times faster than what was previously possible The algorithm ensures treatment precision helping to spare surrounding healthy tissue RapidArc is made possible by software innovations that may be used with Varian manufactured treatment technology RapidArc consists of two components treatment planning and treatment delivery and is used for both radiotherapy and radiosurgery patients Volumetric modulated arc therapy differs from existing techniques like helical IMRT or intensity modulated arc therapy IMAT because it delivers dose to the whole volume rather than slice by slice And the treatment planning algorithm ensures the treatment precision helping to minimize dose to surrounding healthy tissue RapidArc radiotherapy technology is a major advance from Varian Medical Systems that improves dose conformality while shortening treatment times RapidArc is available for Varian linear accelerators including the Edge TrueBeam Trilogy and many Clinac linear accelerators RapidArc uses a dynamic multileaf collimator MLC variable dose rate and variable gantry speed to generate IMRT quality dose distributions RapidArc planning for Eclipse treatment planning system is fast simple and precise With minimal learning curve you can quickly plan for IMRT quality treatments and deliver RapidArc treatments in just a fraction of the time Events

Resources Centerline Events Webinars Varian Unite App Centerline SHARE Oncology Advancing the Value of Tumor Boards Multidisciplinary tumor boards are important for the continuity of care and improved patient outcomes Cancer care teams devote considerable time and resources to tumor boards says Benjamin Sintay chief physicist Cone Health Greensboro North Carolina It s important to measure the value of tumor boards so we can maximize their benefit for patients Maximizing the effectiveness of tumor boards is one reason Cone Health is implementing the Multidisciplinary Tumor Board module of the Varian Oncology care management platform The other is improving the value equation by making resource intensive tumor boards more productive and efficient Cone Health is a private not for profit community based health system of six hospitals and hundreds of locations in central North Carolina It s our goal to be in the top percent of all organizations in providing value to patients says Sintay In radiation oncology specifically we have a vision of being a national leader in providing innovative solutions in patient value In keeping with that vision Cone Health is first implementing Multidisciplinary Tumor Board at its brain tumor clinic one of six clinics devoted to cancer care The obstacles to running a productive brain tumor board mirror many of the obstacles that stand in the way of improving cancer care in general The complexities of integrating data from multiple sources across the care spectrum The challenges of analyzing the data and using it for evidence based decisions The burden of time consuming manual processes that are also vulnerable to error or oversight The limitations of technology that make information access and multidisciplinary collaboration difficult These are the obstacles that Oncology is designed to overcome Oncology care management is a cloud based platform that brings together radiation medical and surgical oncology social services primary care physicians as well as the patient to facilitate true collaborative and coordinated care It also includes access to rapid real time learning systems that may help cancer teams transform clinical evidence into clinical practice The web based multidisciplinary tumor board module integrates the relevant patient records lab reports diagnostic images and team recordkeeping tools to facilitate collaborative case review and decision making Cone Health s brain tumor clinic is a high functioning group of medical professionals comprising radiation oncologists neurosurgeons pathologists neuro radiologists medical oncologists and others all with important roles in serving patients They meet weekly to discuss as many as patients When we take time to have a multidisciplinary discussion we want it to be productive for all concerned we want it to benefit the patient to the maximum level and we want to retain the record of the opinions and recommendations for future reference says Sintay However there has been no software environment that facilitates quick exchange of information for tumor boards We re interested in the Multidisciplinary Tumor Board module because we anticipate it making preparation less complicated and communication easier Making case review preparation less complicated and time consuming For each weekly conference a nurse navigator spends a half day or longer in preparation assembling all the history scans reports and other data points required for every patient to be reviewed In addition to the time involved there is always a risk that some relevant information may be missed in this manual process The extensive preparation time also limits the cases that the board can review Patients can come up at the last minute and you don t want to have to wait a week to discuss them Having the ability to rapidly add a patient would definitely improve our ability to respond says Sintay When fully configured the Multidisciplinary Tumor Board module will automate the process We can very quickly within a few clicks select patients for our tumor conference and Oncology receives all the information automatically thereby saving staff time and also improving the speed at which we can add patients says Sintay Improving access for collaboration Sintay also sees unimpeded access to the Multidisciplinary Tumor Board as a distinct advantage Oncology is contained in the Cloud and sits independent from other databases and medical record systems The tumor board presentation can be accessed securely from any computer system through a web browser This access is important in multidisciplinary care because often you re dealing with multiple physician practices that don t have the same computer network says Sintay Oncology will work very fluidly no matter what device or system people are using for access Preserving the discussion and recommendations Sintay considers Oncology to be a platform for the future of big data The Multidisciplinary Tumor Board captures and converts discussions recommendations and patient treatment into useful data for future decision making I think that s needed That s where the potential of something like Oncology is going to be the greatest in capturing all of the important information in one place and making it easy to recall or mine the data in the future Blog

Treating cancer from the inside Varian Brachytherapy has proven to be a successful treatment for cancers of the prostate cervix endometrium breast skin bronchus esophagus and head and neck as well as soft tissue sarcomas and several other types of cancer Brachytherapy treats cancer by placing radioactive sources directly into or next to the area requiring treatment This enables clinicians to deliver a high dose with minimal impact on surrounding healthy tissues Brachytherapy primarily uses two different techniques Low Dose Rate LDR uses a lower strength radioactive source and is associated with longer treatment times for the one time treatment The most commonly used LDR treatment site is the prostate which involves permanent placement of tiny radioactive seeds in tissue in the prostate Historically LDR has been used in the treatment of other sites such as gyn and head neck where low activity sources are temporarily placed for several days then removed High Dose Rate HDR uses a higher strength radioactive source contained within an afterloader device The afterloader delivers the source for a brief period of time to catheters needles or other appliances placed in the tumor site Per treatment HDR is much shorter procedure minutes vs days than LDR but it does require multiple treatments Increasingly more common HDR techniques have replaced LDR techniques for most body sites Other brachytherapy techniques include Pulse Dose Rate PDR and Image Guided Brachytherapy IGBT With any radiotherapy technique the goal is the same to conform the dose to the size and shape of the target while limiting side effects by sparing the surrounding healthy anatomy In brachytherapy radiation falls off very rapidly from the target area easily accomplishing this objective The oldest form of radiotherapy brachytherapy now uses the latest in computer and radioactive source technology Image guided brachytherapy IGBT combines advanced imaging techniques with advanced brachytherapy procedures allowing doctors to treat patients quickly and precisely Active in the brachytherapy market since Varian produces a full range of brachytherapy products including afterloaders

SBRT is emerging as an attractive option for treating cancers in the lung head and neck prostate liver and other disease cites outside the CNS SABR SBRT is a non invasive treatment procedure similar to SRS except that it deals with tumors outside the central nervous system CNS The objective of SABR SBRT is to escalate the dose to the target lesion and thus to increase local control while limiting dose to nearby critical structures and normal tissue Some requirements of SABR SBRT program may include precise localization of the target lesion in the treatment planning process account for tumor motion due to respiration or other changes in the body highly conformal dose distribution to the target volume including a steep dose gradient to minimize dose to surrounding healthy tissue sparing and image guidance at the time of dose delivery for verification and adjustment of the target localization Designed to treat targets using sub millimeter mechanical accuracy of the couch collimator

HyperArc High Definition Radiosurgery Enabling Fast Accurate Treatment of Multiple Brain Mets Approximately percent of newly diagnosed cancer patients will develop brain metastases For many stereotactic radiosurgery SRS is recommended as a primary treatment option SRS has made it possible for us to treat brain metastases very aggressively observed Aidnag Diaz MD medical director at Rush Radiosurgery in Chicago Illinois Whether the primary cancer was in the lung breast or elsewhere we re often able to control brain metastases I tell my oncology colleagues If you can take care of the body I can take care of the brain According to Diaz many patients live a relatively long time after treatment for a brain lesion If they develop a new brain met we can often do radiosurgery again I have patients who have been treated two or three times who are doing well and functioning at a high level as measured by Karnofsky performance scores At Varian the idea of turning cancer into a manageable rather than fatal disease has been galvanizing If we can enable the very precise ablative treatment of brain metastases while sparing healthy brain tissue to make retreatment feasible if needed we will have really moved the needle in terms of extending life and helping to create a world without fear of cancer said Agam Sharda director strategic marketing HyperArc high definition radiotherapy takes a very big step in that direction HyperArc addresses concerns about complexity patient safety cost and human resources that can make SRS inaccessible for many patients and unfeasible for many institutions It automates and simplifies the planning and delivery of high quality non coplanar radiosurgery treatments for single and multiple metastatic targets in the brain Filippo Alongi MD director of radiation oncology at Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Cancer Care Center Negrar Verona Italy and associate professor of radiation oncology at Brescia University recently became the first clinician to use HyperArc in the treatment of brain lesions and metastases In August of this year Alongi and his colleagues completed HyperArc treatments for seven patients Five had isolated intracranial lesions and two were dealing with multiple metastases We were expecting to see better dose distributions with HyperArc plans as compared with conventional RapidArc radiosurgery in the cases involving multiple lesions Alongi said Surprisingly we saw that also in cases of isolated brain lesions particularly in terms of the conformity and gradient indexes Technological advances benefit planning and safety HyperArc high definition radiotherapy HDRT is an end to end class solution for frameless MLC based intracranial radiosurgery Everything needed for establishing an SRS program for treatment of both simple and complex intracranial cases is included A prescriptive workflow is one of the key elements making HyperArc simple to deliver It includes simulation guidelines patient immobilization treatment planning patient setup intra fraction imaging and a pre determined delivery sequence HyperArc is designed to enable consistent high quality planning and seamless one click delivery HyperArc treatment plans automatically specify the specific arcs and couch positions compatible with patients clearance to the machine HyperArc addresses patient safety through the fully automated execution of treatment fields plus the fact that all of the hardware the linac head as well as the patient immobilization device are digitally modeled in the treatment planning system to ensure that each field is safely deliverable Alongi pointed out A HyperArc treatment can be completed within a typical minute timeslot making it a time efficient approach compared to other radiosurgery techniques that treat each target individually or separately According to Alongi the HyperArc treatments he delivered increased deliver time by no more than minutes compared with conventional RapidArc and broke down as follows minutes for patient setup minutes for cone beam CT image guidance minutes beam on time for multiple non coplanar arcs and the couch rotations needed between them Hope for brain related and multiple metastases Treating multiple intracranial metastases together involves some special challenges Alongi pointed out As is often the case these patients lesions were distributed throughout the brain with some close to other sensitive organs Typically these procedures use non coplanar fields making them very time consuming as dry runs are necessary before each treatment field Alongi said With HyperArc multiple metastases can be treated in a single session taking less than minutes beam on time without the need to manually reposition patients In one case the treatment encompassed more than intracranial lesions This was an unusual situation in that the young patient refused palliative whole brain irradiation so we offered an alternative approach that probably would not have been possible without HyperArc Alongi said HyperArc HDRT allows us to deliver state of the art radiosurgery for highly complex cases efficiently and with a very high degree of dose compactness and conformity HYPERARC TECHNOLOGY FOR HIGH DEFINITION RADIOTHERAPY AND RADIOSURGERY from the August issue of Centerline magazine DeSantis CE Cancer treatment and
