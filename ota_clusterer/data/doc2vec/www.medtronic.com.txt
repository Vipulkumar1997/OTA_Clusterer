Compatibility Guide Patient Services For Implantation Cardiac Devices Medtronic heart devices are built with protective shields so the majority of items that you use or come into contact with will not affect the normal operation of your implanted heart device However items that generate or use electricity or transmit wireless signals such as a portable generator power drill or cell phone have electromagnetic fields around them Some of these fields may affect the normal operation of your heart device Electromagnetic compatibility is the relationship between these electromagnetic fields and your heart device How items may affect your heart device If the electromagnetic fields surrounding an item are too close to your implanted heart device and your heart device happens to detect these fields this may temporarily affect the normal function of your heart device This same effect may also occur if the item being touched is not in good working order or properly wired causing electrical current to flow into your body In either situation this may temporarily cause your heart device to deliver a therapy that is not needed or withhold a therapy that is needed For this reason we recommend you only use items that are in good working condition In addition we recommend you maintain a minimum distance between certain items and your implanted heart device This will help to avoid any temporary effect on your heart device What to do if you think an item is affecting your heart device If you feel dizzy lightheaded a change in heart rate or receive a shock while using an item simply release whatever you re touching or move away from it Any temporary effect is unlikely to cause reprogramming or damage to your heart device Your heart device is designed to return to normal operation Of course if your symptoms continue or do not improve contact your doctor as soon as possible About this guide We ve organized this guide to make it helpful and convenient for you to find the answers you re looking for It s divided into main categories Household and Hobby Items Tools and Industrial Equipment Communications and Office Equipment Medical and Dental Procedures Frequently Asked Questions Activities and intimacy MRIs Anti theft detectors and airport security systems Household magnets Welding and chainsaws Each category is broken into sections ranging from no known risk

TRANSFORMING SO ARE WE Transforming Medtronic to Support Progress in Healthcare VIEW POSITION PAPER Share Global healthcare systems are under intense clinical and economic challenges that can undermine global growth and development and leave millions around the world untreated Our goals of improving clinical outcomes expanding access and optimizing cost and efficiency are fundamental to all healthcare systems around the world and they are what will propel us forward Transforming Healthcare Resources Aligning Value Meaningful Innovation Global Access MISSION STAYS CRITICAL VALUE EXPANDS Our Mission has remained the same for six decades to alleviate pain restore health and extend life for people around the world Today our medical device innovation positively impacts more than million people each year But the nature of today s healthcare problems requires a new approach That s why we believe that our technologies insights and expertise can be combined in partnership with hospitals payers and governments to help create aligned value based healthcare models that can deliver better patient outcomes while maintaining or reducing costs FURTHER TOGETHER We call this new approach Further Together Further because we will continue to drive meaningful innovation at the therapy procedural and system levels while also devising powerful solutions with proven clinical and economic value And Together because we will forge new different and stronger partnerships to help our customers achieve their goal of expanding global access and delivering more seamless integrated care across the healthcare continuum Read the Further Together Position Paper Transforming Medtronic to Support Progress in Healthcare PDF CREATING MEANINGFUL INNOVATIONS This year alone we have invested billion in research and development to bring about meaningful innovations that deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs and lead to enhanced quality of life Some of our breakthrough innovations include the world s smallest pacemaker a game changer in how strokes caused by blood clots are treated and the development of what could be the first artificial pancreas We hope these innovations will help redefine the standard of care and lead to future changes at the therapy procedural and system levels ALIGNING VALUE FOR STAKEHOLDERS We re working with the global healthcare community to leverage our technology services and insights into solutions that drive operational efficiencies and augment the delivery of care through better patient care management That s why we created the Medtronic Integrated Health Solutions IHS business to move beyond medical devices and focus on system level services and solutions Today IHS is helping hospitals and health systems align value across the care continuum by delivering more efficient improved care to patients One way we are doing this is by reducing recidivism and patient readmissions to hospitals At Centura Health in Colorado a pilot program using our telehealth solution helped nurses to regularly follow up with patients which helped reduce heart failure related hospitalizations by percent in a day period following the initial hospital stay INCREASING GLOBAL ACCESS TO CARE To help improve outcomes around the world global access to quality healthcare becomes a critical area of focus for our company as more than million people currently lack access to care That s why we re working with governments and providers in developed markets to improve care delivery and efficiency And in emerging markets we re assisting with infrastructure development therapy awareness and education capacity management and physician training In the past five years alone we ve trained thousands of physicians around the globe Equity is a matter of concern across nearly all indicators in many parts of the world with at least million people currently lacking access to care THE FIRST STEP TOWARD PROGRESS While we firmly believe Medtronic has a unique role to play in the move toward aligned value based care we know we can do more We have the ability to create powerful new technologies and services to achieve better outcomes for patients at a reduced cost And we recognize that no one can solve the world s healthcare challenges alone Only through collaboration and partnership can we all achieve the benefits of

ASSESSING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS OF COUNTRIES HOW AND WHY The EIU Global Assessment commissioned by Medtronic is an up to date look at healthcare in countries around the world Representatives from ICHOM Medtronic and EIU Healthcare explain the methodology and importance Hear how the Assessment will help define strategies and track progress as we make the necessary shift away from healthcare systems based on volume to those based on value to the patient EIU Global Assessment Reveals Framework and Key Indicators in Value Based Healthcare DOWNLOAD MEDTRONIC S PERSPECTIVE ON THE VBHC REPORT Healthcare systems are under intense clinical and economic challenges worldwide causing many leaders to consider value based healthcare VBHC approaches While health systems in many countries are still in the early phases of VBHC implementation the Global Assessment developed by the Economist Intelligence Unit and commissioned by Medtronic creates a set of global indicators that capture progress today and builds a roadmap for action as we move into the future As the Global Assessment reveals we re still in the early stages of the journey to value based care but this is one step we re taking to help accelerate VBHC worldwide Read More WATCH THE NOV WEBINAR VALUE BASED HEALTHCARE BUILDING A NEW ECOSYSTEM Watch a conversation between an Economist Intelligence Unit EIU editor and an independent panel of experts about the findings from our recently published value based healthcare VBHC global assessment report The discussion will consider the significant challenges to implementing VBHC across the globe The report covers how these challenges differ by region which parts of the world have strong models of VBHC systems and how demographic shifts and changing lifestyles build a stronger case for achieving these models This Medtronic sponsored event will include research based on findings and methodology policy papers and case studies Watch Now VBHC GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OUTPUTS ASSESSING THE STATE OF VALUE BASED HEALTHCARE WORLDWIDE Rising costs aging populations and the emergence of disruptive technologies are just a few of the challenges facing global healthcare systems How will the world deliver high quality care while containing costs Value based healthcare VBHC is gaining traction as the best path forward However despite growing acceptance implementation is proving more difficult in some countries At this pivotal time of change the EIU looked across six continents to gauge the readiness of key healthcare systems The result is a comparison of countries and the state of play for VBHC progress View Matrix VALUE OVER VOLUME THE PATH TOWARD PATIENT CENTRIC HEALTHCARE The rationale for a VBHC model is at an all time high but it requires a paradigm shift that involves a re think of policies and procedures the healthcare industry has followed for decades How will countries implement systems that prize patient outcomes How will they overcome forces of inertia such as fragmented systems limited infrastructures and antiquated payment models Here is an examination of the challenges and opportunities complete with frontier countries that are making impressive strides and a look at why some countries have yet to start this journey Read Executive Summary PAY FOR PERFORMANCE MODEL GROWS SLOWLY As people are living longer the instances of chronic diseases rise as do healthcare costs In order to manage this financial strain policymakers must consider outcomes in order to provide value to patients But shifting to this value based model is challenging especially for lower income countries By assessing the existence of core components of VBHC across countries this study provides new insights into the state of the enabling environment for value based care around the world Read Findings Methodology GLOBAL VALUE BASED HEALTHCARE ASSESSMENT BY COUNTRY Around the globe the VBHC model is being introduced incrementally But in many places political will is strong and policymakers are moving in the right direction These country snapshots will show how the enabling environment and policies differ across countries as well as the varying priorities among those countries Explore Snapshots VALUE BASED HEALTHCARE MODELS WORTH ANALYZING In assessing the varying degrees of VBHC readiness and adoption it becomes clear there are pilot projects policy initiatives and experiments worth noting Whether it s the Regional National Health Service NHS health boards implementing pilot projects on outcome collection in Wales to policies being developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS to replicate and spread good practices and shift the trajectory of US healthcare away from fee for service models and towards value based care these case studies shed light on some of the most innovative thinking from around the world Read Case Studies Sign Up For Updates Get updates on our value journey Sign Up Related

Advanced Search Tips EXPANDING GLOBAL ACCESS NARROWING THE HEALTHCARE GAP Share At Medtronic we believe the history of medicine has been and will be a continuous quest to ensure that people receive the life saving or life enhancing treatments they need to return to full life We also recognize that access to quality healthcare is a fundamental right of all people around the world At least million people around the world still lack access to care The quest for better healthcare stems from foundational or universal healthcare needs for any healthcare system The goals of improving clinical outcomes expanding access and optimizing cost and efficiency are fundamental to all healthcare systems around the world But we also know that we participate in global healthcare systems that are under intense clinical and economic challenges and that if not corrected these issues can serve to undermine global growth and development and leave millions around the world untreated for even the simplest diseases We believe that what got us to the current state of healthcare is not necessarily what will propel us forward The future of healthcare requires new approaches and new forms of innovation Even though we have accomplished a lot today more than million people benefit from our technologies each year equating to two people every second at least million people around the world still lack access to care That s why we ve empowered our more than employees in more than countries to work with health systems around the world sharing technologies services resources and expertise to help remove barriers to affordable treatment of chronic diseases In developed markets we re working with governments and providers of care delivery and efficiency while in emerging markets we re assisting with infrastructure development therapy awareness and education and capacity management Healthy Heart For All program by the numbers facilities cities physicians patients screened patients treated BUILDING CARE INFRASTRUCTURE IN EMERGING MARKETS Emerging markets face unique obstacles in their quest to stand up and establish sustainable high quality and cost effective health systems Access is typically impacted by location and proximity to quality health institutions a lack of quality trained specialists and healthcare practitioners and a lack of infrastructure or facilities Recognizing these dynamics in emerging markets Medtronic is focusing on developing market models and partnerships that establish centers of excellence where specialized tasks and procedures are housed in order to increase quality outcomes develop physician expertise and maximize expenditures and costs Medtronic s Healthy Heart For All program is an early and successful example of our emerging market care pathway approach The program works to continually evaluate and improve the entire cardiac patient care pathway and it has worked to resolve issues associated with patient awareness and screening referral connections between general physicians and specialists and counseling and financing options for patients who need financing assistance to access therapy options The program works with more than facilities across more than cities in India To date more than physicians have been trained patients have been screened and more than of these patients have received treatment In India alone an estimated million people have hearing impairments India has also served as the home of our Shruti program In India alone an estimated million people have hearing impairments One of the causes middle ear infection can be treated to prevent the disability yet many individuals don t have access to healthcare Medtronic working with both local and international partners created a program to raise awareness of this issue offered free community screenings and set up a referral pathway for patients in need of treatment Nearly people have been screened by this program and we have identified ear infections and or hearing loss in more than people In Brazil which was estimated to lose billion due to premature deaths associated with heart disease stroke and diabetes in the last years we re working with local government officials leading physicians emergency care personnel and hospital systems to put into place the appropriate infrastructure to provide optimal care for heart attack patients In a program called LATIN Latin America Telemedicine Infarct Network Medtronic is working with key stakeholders to develop localized protocols and educate both cardiologists and emergency care physicians on the most appropriate care pathway for STEMI patients before they arrive at the hospital through the use of telemedicine technology Coupled with a large scale public education initiative to better inform the community the LATIN program has trained healthcare personnel and reduced STEMI mortality by percent in just one year We re now in the process of replicating the program in geographies where similar care issues are present including Colombia and Mexico PARTNERING WITH GOVERNMENTS In China a growing diabetes epidemic has been called a catastrophe after a report showed million people in the country have the disease making it the top geography in prevalence on the planet Last year Medtronic announced a partnership with the National Institute of Hospital Administration to research ways of building a better system for people with Type diabetes The collaboration included pilot sites at regional hospitals across the country where the best ways to integrate care and support people with diabetes through the entire disease state are being studied The goal is to apply these lessons nationally to reduce common complications that arise among this patient population and then extend our learning to other geographies where diabetes is taking an unprecedented toll on healthcare systems In China a growing diabetes epidemic has been called a catastrophe after a report showed million people in the country have the disease BUILDING CAPACITY THROUGH PHYSICIAN TRAINING One service that stretches across all geographies and is imperative to improving outcomes is physician training In the past five years alone we ve trained thousands of physicians around the globe Recently we completed a year long physician training program in Russia that educated physicians on everything from innovations in interventional cardiology to approaches for improving patient outcomes EMPLOYEES IMPACTING GLOBAL HEALTH To spur similar advancements in other geographies we also offer our top employees the chance to work with government and non government organizations to find ways to improve access to healthcare locally in underserved areas This program called Global Innovation Fellows has helped us better understand why certain hospitals in Vietnam have long wait times and we have offered suggestions on how to boost diabetes awareness in South Africa among other initiatives These programs demonstrate that one company can t do it alone Only through working with a variety of stakeholders going Further Together in many different ways can we improve access to care and outcomes around the world LEARN MORE Case Study Shruti Program References World Health Organization Tracking Universal Health Coverage http apps who int iris bitstream eng

Orthopedic Solutions Menu Close Search Close Go Advanced Search Tips Using Advanced Search The information below covers some key search concepts and describes advanced filtering techniques using the Filter Options located in the left hand column of the search results page to produce more efficient search results Getting Started with Search To search for a desired page or content type a few descriptive words in the search box click the Go button or press the Enter key A results page appears with a list of documents and web pages that are related to your search terms with the most relevant search results appearing at the top of the page By default only pages that include all of your search terms are returned To broaden or restrict the search include fewer or more terms or use the Filter Options located in the left hand column of the search results page You do not need to include and between the terms Every search result lists one or more snippets or excerpts from the document to display the search terms in context In the snippet your search terms are displayed in bold text so that you can quickly determine if that result is from a page or document you want to view Spelling For searches in some languages a single spelling suggestion is returned with the results for queries where the spell checker has detected a possible spelling mistake The spell checker supports the following languages by default U S English French German Italian Brazilian Portuguese Spanish The spell checker feature is context sensitive Capitalization Searches are not case sensitive All letters regardless of how you enter them are handled as lower case For example searches for pacemaker and Pacemaker return the same results Common Words Because they tend to slow down your search without improving the results search ignores some terms including Common words and characters such as where and how when they are used in conjunction with other search terms Certain single digits and single letters If a common word is essential to getting the results you want you can include it by putting a plus sign in front of it Include a space before the sign but not after it Alternatively you can enclose a series of words with quotation marks and conduct a phrase search Example pacemaker implantation procedure Date Sort By default search results are sorted by relevance with the most relevant result appearing at the top of the page Results that do not contain dates are displayed at the end and are sorted by relevance Numbers When you search for numbers do not use exponential numbers such as e or negative integers such as Numbers that are separated by commas are treated as separate figures not fractional numbers that is the comma is treated as a term separator not a decimal separator For example if you type the search query is treated as a search for two separate terms and not the decimal fraction three and three quarters Commas that separate every three digits are ignored and are not necessary For example both and are treated alike Widening Your Search You can expand your search by using the OR operator To retrieve pages that include either word A or word B use an uppercase OR between terms For example to search for an office in either Minneapolis or Dublin type the following office Minneapolis OR Dublin You can also expand an Audience specific search for example by selecting multiple Secondary Search Filters e g Healthcare Professionals and Healthcare Administrators under the Audiences Primary Filter Refining Your Search Search returns only web pages that contain all of the words in your search query refining or narrowing your search is as simple as adding more words to the search terms you have already entered The refined query returns a subset of the pages that were returned by your original broad query If that does not get the results that you want you can use multiple Primary Filter Options e g Audiences Conditions Treatments Products etc located in the left hand column of the search results page to affect a specific search refinement Searching for the broad term of heart disease can result in a large number of search results Using the Primary and Secondary Filter Options of Audiences Patients and Caregivers will refine the results to only include the pages with content on heart disease that is pertinent to patients and caregivers and not information for healthcare professionals You can also take the approach of employing word exclusion operators or searching for exact phrases These search query input techniques are described in the following subsections Word Exclusion If your search term has more than one meaning you can focus your search by adding a minus sign in front of words related to the meaning you want to avoid Make sure you include a space before the minus sign You can use a list of words you want to exclude For example to search for carelink and exclude search results about diabetes or software type the following query carelink diabetes software In this case the search returns pages about carelink that do not contain the word diabetes or software Phrase Searches Phrase searches are useful when you are searching for therapy or procedure searches or specific product names You can search for an exact phrase or name in the following ways By enclosing the phrase in quotation marks The search only returns documents that include the exact phrase you entered By using phrase connectors such as hyphens slashes periods equal signs and apostrophes in between every word of your search query Phrase connectors and quotation marks join your search words as a single unit Print Email Menu Close Search Close Go Advanced Search Tips MEDTRONIC FOUNDATION TOGETHER WE RE

World s Smallest Pacemaker Passes Space Test Micra TPS remains functioning after bumpy rocket ride into space The world s smallest pacemaker aced its space test NASA rocket launch June Courtesy NASA Medtronic s Micra Transcatheter Pacing System TPS not only survived a bumpy minute mile high rocket ride into Earth s sub orbit but initial interrogation of the device done a few hours after launch showed the device still functioning the way engineers had designed Just fantastic news said senior program manager Wade Demmer who spent eight years working on Micra TPS for Medtronic Micra TPS was among dozens of experiments packed into the nose cone of NASA s foot long Terrier Improved Orion sounding rocket In some ways this is well beyond what they d ever send an astronaut into Wade Demmer senior program manager Medtronic NASA rocket launch June Courtesy NASA The June launch subjected the device to more than times the force of gravity vibrations worse than a paint shaker temperatures reaching degrees Fahrenheit radiation from Earth s sub orbit and a splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean This isn t a manned rocket It doesn t come with the protections that an astronaut gets Demmer said In some ways this is well beyond what they d ever send an astronaut into So to know that Micra was still operating properly after all that is a really good feeling I think there s going to be a lot of damage but I could be wrong Shelbi Klingsporn High School Science Project Lesley Billingsley and Katie Juarez The idea to launch and test Micra in space came from year old Shelbi Klingsporn a high school student from Scottsbluff Nebraska Encouraged by science teacher Katie Juarez and English teacher Lesley Billingsley Shelbi submitted a proposal complete with diagrams and a written summary to the Cubes in Space CIS project Cubes in Space is a private non profit education program that in partnership with NASA encourages students to get involved in science and space Hundreds of students from around the world submitted ideas Shelbi s was among just selected for the flight Learn more Shelbi Klingsporn I think there s going to be a lot of internal damage But I could be wrong Students picked for Cubes in Space were invited to NASA s Wallops Flight Facility near Chincoteague Virginia to watch the launch They also set up exhibits in NASA s Visitor Center on the day before liftoff and explained their experiments to the general public Shelbi s presentation included a hypothesis that the Micra TPS which contains some glass components and wires thinner than a human hair could not withstand the brutal G forces of the launch Personally I don t think it s going to come back and operate or function like we want she said as she watched the rocket race into space I think there s going to be a lot of internal damage But I could be wrong You never know Preparing for Launch Tom Anderson and Wade Demmer Demmer and Tom Anderson another Medtronic engineer who helped develop Micra TPS shared her concern After Shelbi contacted Medtronic with her idea Demmer and Anderson gave her advice and support Medtronic provided a working device for the flight and Anderson added a resistor to mimic the electrical activity inside a human body So the Micra TPS would think it was pacing a real person Demmer said The two engineers attended the launch with Shelbi and her teachers and brought along special equipment to interrogate the Micra device as soon as it returned from space Eight hours after launch and two hours after the payload returned to NASA s hanger they got their answer Post Flight Interrogation and Examination Micra under the microscope after the space flight Using a special computer programmer Demmer interrogated Micra TPS by hovering a reader over the device his computer screen sprang to life as Micra immediately answered Just for that little thing to happen the battery had to work the circuit had to work and the antennae had to work and those were the three major components that we worried about Demmer said The interrogator downloaded data from the device That information showed Micra TPS which is designed to automatically adjust pacing therapy based on a person s activity levels had increased its pacing rate during the flight and lowered it again afterward Micra interpreted the shaking as exercise and increased its pacing which is what it s supposed to do Demmer said That means the accelerometer inside the device is also working Great news What s Next NASA engineers take apart the rocket after it returns from space Shelbi will turn during the summer and wants to become a physician s assistant I ve learned a lot about pacemakers and the field of medicine she said And I learned about how to conduct good research Every part of this experience really helped Medtronic may do more testing on the device and students with other experiments on board are planning to share information with Demmer and Anderson about radiation levels and other data their projects gathered during the flight This test doesn t mean that anyone with a pacemaker can go into space Demmer said But the idea that someone with a medical device might someday be able to travel into space isn t as far fetched today as it was yesterday Note Patients are encouraged to consult with their physician regarding their lifestyle and activities while implanted with the Micra TPS June Micra Transcatheter Pacing System Additional Device Information An implantable pacemaker system relieves symptoms of heart rhythm disturbances They do this by restoring normal heart rates A normal heart rate provides your body with the proper amount of blood circulation The pacemaker system is intended for patients who need rate adaptive pacing or chronic pacing Risks associated with the Micra Transcatheter Pacing System Micra implant include but are not limited to complications at the surgical site injury to the heart where the device is attached such as pericardial effusion fluid around the heart and or sensitivity to the device material failure to deliver therapy when it is needed or receiving extra therapy when it is not needed After receiving a Micra you will have limitations with certain magnetic and electromagnetic radiation electric or gas powered appliances and tools in which you are allowed to be in contact Once implanted removal of the Micra after it has become encapsulated may be difficult because of the development of fibrotic tissue At such time your physician has the option of permanently turning off the Micra and leaving it in the heart This treatment is prescribed by your physician This treatment is not for everyone Please talk to your doctor to see if it is right for you Your physician should discuss all potential benefits and risks with you Although many patients benefit from the use of this treatment results may vary For further information please call the Medtronic toll free number at a m to p m Monday Friday Central Time or see the Medtronic website at www medtronic com Important Safety Information Micra Transcatheter Pacing System VVIR Single Chamber with SureScan tm MRI INDICATIONS Micra Model MC VR is indicated for patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent high grade AV block in the presence of AF symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent high grade AV block in the absence of AF as an alternative to dual chamber pacing when atrial lead placement is considered difficult high risk or not deemed necessary for effective therapy symptomatic bradycardia tachycardia syndrome or sinus node dysfunction sinus bradycardia sinus pauses as an alternative to atrial or dual chamber pacing when atrial lead placement is considered difficult high risk or not deemed necessary for effective therapy Rate responsive pacing is indicated to provide increased heart rate appropriate to increasing levels of activity CONTRAINDICATIONS Micra Model MC VR is contraindicated for patients who have the following types of medical devices implanted an implanted device that would interfere with the implant of the Micra device in the judgment of the implanting physician an implanted inferior vena cava filter a mechanical tricuspid valve or an implanted cardiac device providing active cardiac therapy that may interfere with the sensing performance of the Micra device The device is contraindicated for patients who have the following conditions femoral venous anatomy unable to accommodate a mm French introducer sheath or implant on the right side of the heart for example due to obstructions or severe tortuosity morbid obesity that prevents the implanted device from obtaining telemetry communication within cm in or known intolerance to the materials listed in the Instruction for Use or to heparin or sensitivity to contrast media that cannot be adequately premedicated Steroid use Do not use in patients for whom a single dose of mg of dexamethasone acetate cannot be tolerated WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS End of Service EOS When the EOS condition is met the clinician has the option of permanently programming the device to Off and leaving it in the heart or retrieving the device provided the device has not yet become encapsulated Removal of the Micra device after it has become encapsulated may be difficult because of the development of fibrotic tissue If removal of the device is required it is recommended that the removal be performed by a clinician who has expertise in the removal of implanted leads MRI conditions for use Before an MRI scan is performed on a patient implanted with the Micra device the cardiology and radiology professionals involved in this procedure must understand the requirements specific to their tasks as defined in the device manuals Rate responsive mode may not be appropriate for patients who cannot tolerate pacing rates above the programmed Lower Rate Asynchronous VVIR pacing with sinus rhythm may not be appropriate when competitive pacing is considered undesirable or causes symptoms of pacemaker syndrome The patient s age and medical condition should be considered by physicians and patients as they select the pacing system mode of operation and implant technique best suited to the individual Precautions should be taken before administering anticoagulant agents antiplatelet agents or contrast media in patients with known hypersensitivity to these agents The use of deactivated Micra devices in situ and an active Micra device or an active transvenous pacemaker or defibrillator has not been clinically tested to determine whether EMI or physical interaction is clinically significant Bench testing supports that implantation of an active Micra device or an active transvenous pacemaker or defibrillator next to an inactivated Micra device is unlikely to cause EMI or physical interaction Post approval studies are planned to characterize risks of co implanted deactivated Micra devices Currently recommended end of device life care for a Micra device may include the addition of a replacement device with or without explantation of the Micra device which should be turned off POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS Potential complications include but are not limited to toxic allergic reaction oversensing acceleration of tachycardia myocardial infarction and surgical complications such as cardiac perforation pericardial effusion cardiac tamponade death device embolization access site hematoma and AV fistulae vessel spasm infection inflammation and thrombosis See the device manuals for detailed information regarding the implant procedure indications contraindications warnings precautions MRI conditions for use and potential complications adverse events For further information please call Medtronic at and or

ever since perforating her eardrum at age nine Like many others in her New Delhi India community Hina never saw a doctor for her condition and so it went undiagnosed and untreated for eight years Around the world nearly million people endure chronic ear infections and disabling hearing loss In India the problem is particularly pervasive percent of the population suffers from some form of hearing impairment due to a lack of health education or limited access to ear nose and throat ENT specialists Our groundbreaking Shruti program meaning to hear in Hindi bridges this gap by equipping community health workers in poor urban neighborhoods in India and Bangladesh with ear screening kits Led by Medtronic s Surgical Technologies team and in partnership with local and international organizations the project also trains community health workers in the basics of ear anatomy and hearing loss conditions In Hina underwent a successful surgery through Shruti to reconstruct her eardrum and now sees a specialist for regular checkups Successfully recovered Hina is currently pursuing her college degree and loves dancing to Bollywood songs with her friends We plan to expand the program through Southeast and South Asia and Sub Saharan Africa Our goal is to elicit a positive response from tens of thousands of patients to the life changing query can you hear me now Case Study Patient
