weekend away but hold the romance Events Holidays Posted Wednesday January Comments Partying in Paris Where to go Posted in City Focus by Ellen Curham Paris is a top European destination and a favourite of ours at Hostels com Not only does it feature some of the continent s top tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower and Da Vinci s Mona Lisa in the Louvre The French capital is also home to some top notch cuisine with traditional French fare as well as a host of international restaurants that fit in with the diverse population However we re not here to talk about that today At Hostels com we want to make sure that you get to explore as much of a city as possible and that includes the nightlife scene We ve compiled some of the best places in Paris to check out if you re looking to party The Cocktail Bar Paris is a classy city so why not try some sophisticated cocktails while you re there Head to the Montorgueil neighbourhood and check out the Experimental Cocktail Club This bar is everything you expect from an excellent cocktail haunt it has bespoke drinks with fresh ingredients and knowledgeable bartenders The atmosphere is lively and it gets pretty crowded but that adds to its charm This isn t necessarily a place for a quiet drink but the live DJ and delicious drinks promise that this will be an excellent start to any night in Paris Address Rue Saint Sauveur Paris France The Nightclub The Bastille district is where you ll find many of the cities nightclubs if you re looking to dance and party for the night A Hostels com favourite is Badaboum which has casual interiors a cocktail bar and a quality sound system It s inexpensive and has a young and vibrant crowd as well as some great guest DJs Hit this place up if you want to hear decent techno music and avoid the touristy style club crawls Address B Rue des Taillandiers Paris France The Dive Bar If you want to spend the night partying without spending too much money then Le Bar Dix or Bar is the perfect Parisian dive bar to drink the night away in Sangria isn t the first concoction that comes to mind when you think of dive bars but this grungy hole in the wall is famed for the refreshing fruit laden drink that comes with a refreshingly low price to match Packed to the brim with locals and mainly mustached barmen this place is a riot and perfect for partying on the cheap Address Place de la R publique Paris France The Concept Venue Trust surrealist Hollywood director David Lynch to set up a concept club in Paris Based on the strange Club Silencio from his movie Mulholland Drive this space features artsy interiors alternative music and an exclusive guest list As it is a members club ask around if you happen to have Parisian friends or else wait until after midnight when they let a limited amount of mere mortals in Silencio is one of the hottest places to be during Paris Fashion Week but has a pretty trendy crowd all year round too Address Rue Montmartre Paris France The Show If you re going to see a show in Paris then it s essential that you visit the Moulin Rouge Sure it will be packed with tourists and overpriced drinks but it s the original Parisian cabaret that still puts on one hell of a show You need to prebook tickets online and they are normally in the triple digits but it is worth it if you are a fan of dance the movie or showmanship in general Make sure to dress up and join in the fun Address Boulevard de Clichy Paris France By heather thompson Add your comment Please try again Spam filter please enter the answer to City Guides and Information

European country Most hostels are really small guesthouses and hotels and many have rooms located on individual floors in a variety of properties many don t even have a designated reception area A lot of hostels in Italy have restricted arrival times so it is important to give accurate arrival times when booking as due to the fact many hostels have no reception area the owner waits for you at the hostel at your expected arrival time YHA hostels in Italy are some of the most interesting and varied in the world Romantic villas that date back to the Renaissance fantastic fortresses and old castles enchanting ancient buildings and ultra modern buildings house the YHA hostels Many Italian cities offer campsite accommodation as an alternative to staying in a hostel These tend to be luxury camping villages and often have their own bars restaurants and swimming pools Accommodation on the campsites consists of cabins bungalows or caravans and bedlinen is provided City Guides and
