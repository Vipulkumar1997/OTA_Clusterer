 Home Clinical Specialties Diseases Anemia Types of Anemia Types of Anemia TYPES OF ANEMIA There are several different types and various causes of anemia Some of the most common types are summarized below Iron deficiency Anemia IDA Iron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world As well as affecting a large number of children and women in developing countries it is the only nutrient deficiency which is also significantly prevalent in industrialized countries IDA is usually caused by insufficient dietary intake and absorption of iron or by iron loss resulting from bleeding from a variety of sources such as the intestines uterus or urinary tract Megaloblastic Anemia Low levels of vitamin B or folate are the most common causes of this type of anemia The prevalence of megaloblastic anemia is rather low affecting fewer than people in the U S Megaloblastic anemia is usually caused by a deficiency of folic acid or vitamin B Pernicious Anemia Pernicious anemia a form of megaloblastic anemia is a rare disorder in which the body does not absorb enough vitamin B from the digestive tract resulting in inadequate production of red blood cells It is also referred to as vitamin B deficient anemia Contact Us Services Support Education Training Subscribe to Newsletter Related Links Women s Health and Anemia Anemia Organization Lab Tests Online

Tests Anti CCP Anti CCP antibody measurements are valuable tools that can aid in the diagnosis of RA and predict the development of the disease they are associated with disease progression and more severe disease Anti CCP measurements facilitate early diagnosis of RA allowing for early initiation of therapy An aCCP antibody test may be ordered along with or following a rheumatoid factor RF test to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis and to assess the severity and probable course of the disease prognosis CCP antibody may also be ordered to help evaluate the likely development of RA in people with undifferentiated arthritis those whose symptoms suggest but do not yet meet the American College of Rheumatology ACR criteria for RA According to ACR approximately of those with a positive CCP antibody will meet the criteria of RA in the future Both the American College of Rheumatology ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism Collaborative Initiative EULAR recommend the use of anti CCP testing for RA classification and management of early arthritis The anti CCP assay on the IMMULITE XPi and ADVIA Centaur XP CP and XPT Systems offers excellent specificity for differential assessment of RA www labtestsonline org understanding analytes ccp EULAR recommendations for the management of early arthritis report of a task force of the ESCISIT Ann Rheum Dis Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria D Aletaha T Neogi et al Arthritis and Rheumatism Vol No September pp Rheumatoid Factor The rheumatoid factor RF test is primarily used to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis RA or Sj gren syndrome and to help distinguish them from other forms of arthritis or other conditions that cause similar symptoms While diagnoses of RA and Sj gren syndrome rely heavily on the clinical picture some of the signs and symptoms may not be present or follow a typical pattern especially early in these diseases Furthermore the signs and symptoms may not always be clearly identifiable since people with these diseases may also have other connective tissue disorders or conditions such as Raynaud s phenomenon scleroderma autoimmune thyroid disorders and systemic lupus erythematosis and display symptoms of these disorders as well http labtestsonline org understanding analytes rheumatoid C Reactive Protein C reactive protein CRP is a non specific test It may be used by a doctor to detect inflammation if there is a high suspicion of tissue injury or infection somewhere in the body but the test cannot tell where the inflammation is or what condition is causing it CRP is not diagnostic of any condition but it can be used together with signs and symptoms and other tests to evaluate an individual for an acute or chronic inflammatory condition For example the CRP test is useful in monitoring people with chronic inflammatory conditions to detect flare ups and or to determine if treatment is effective Some examples include Inflammatory bowel disease Some forms of arthritis Autoimmune diseases such as lupus or vasculitis It may also be ordered on a regular basis to monitor conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus and is often repeated at intervals to determine whether treatment is effective This is particularly useful for inflammation problems since CRP levels drop as inflammation subsides http labtestsonline org understanding analytes crp Contact

Markers The ELF Program Overview Minimally Invasive Markers The ELF Program Contact Us What is liver fibrosis Liver fibrosis is the scarring process that represents the liver s response to injury In the same way as skin and other organs heal wounds through deposition of collagen and other matrix constituents so the liver repairs injury through the deposition of new collagen Over time this process can result in cirrhosis of the liver in which the architectural organization of the functional units of the liver becomes so disrupted that blood flow through the liver and liver function become disrupted Once cirrhosis has developed the serious complications of liver disease may occur including portal hypertension liver failure and liver cancer The risk of liver cancer is greatly increased once cirrhosis develops and cirrhosis should be considered to be a pre malignant condition Cirrhosis and liver cancer are now among the top ten causes of death worldwide and in many developed countries liver disease is now one of the top causes of death in middle age The biology of liver fibrosis The main liver cells that produce matrix are Hepatic Stellate Cells HSC This resident cell population exist in a resting phenotype as the body s major store of vitamin A However on activation they transform to adopt a myofibroblast phenotype capable of secreting collagen This fibrous tissue can then be remodelled through digestion of matrix by matrix metaloproteinases MMPs In turn the digestion of matrix is checked through the inhibition of MMPs by tissue inhibitors of matrixmetaloproteina TIMPs of which TIMP is of major importance Liver fibrosis previously thought to be merely the accumulation of scar tissue is now recognised to be a dynamic process that can progress or regress over periods as short as months What are the causes of liver fibrosis All chronic liver diseases CLD can lead to liver fibrosis Over many years the principle causes of CLD have been chronic viral hepatitis B CHB and alcoholic liver disease ALD While rates of alcoholism and ALD are falling in many countries hazardous drinking amongst young people is resulting in alarming rates of ALD in several northern European countries Over the last few decades two other diseases have emerged to make a major contribution to the burden of CLD Chronic hepatitis C CHC and non alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD are recognised to have already had a major impact on CLD incidence Hepatitis C virus HCV is transmitted in blood and blood products through unsafe injection practices and the therapeutic use of infected blood products It is thought that the world prevalence of CHC is nearly million people In the developed world with rapidly increasing rates of obesity NAFLD is considered to represent a major cause of significant fibrosis Although it appears that only a minority of patients with NAFLD maybe develop significant fibrosis due to the vast prevalence of the at risk overweight population NAFLD may give rise to an epidemic of liver fibrosis Liver Fibrosis Overview Page Minimally invasive markers of liver fibrosis The ELF Program Part of the article

Workflow Study Comparative studies demonstrate that Lean management principles can be applied to routine ISD testing Dimension RxL system enables routine ISD testing with less complexity and a reduced risk of error Eliminating manual steps reducing opportunities for errors and improving quality are among today s labs most pressing challenges that are being addressed by Lean quality management One area where Lean principles have not been broadly addressed is immunosuppressant drug ISD testing which often requires specialized analyzers dedicated personnel and complex sample handling techniques Because organ rejection in transplant patients can occur at any time lifelong administration and monitoring of ISDs is required to prevent graft rejection and minimize serious adverse drug reactions Consequently transplant physicians and coordinators require rapid and accurate ISD test results to appropriately manage their patients Unfortunately not all laboratories perform ISD testing as part of their routine workload In those that do ISD results are not always available hours a day days a week Hence the information clinicians need to make critical decisions may not always be available In many labs ISD tests are performed in batch mode by dedicated laboratory personnel because the testing requires complex specialized handling procedures including manual pretreatment and extraction steps that extend the turnaround time TAT for reporting results Slow TAT due to less efficient processes could impact transplant patient management Study designed to compare TAT differences for ISD testing A recent study was conducted to determine if Lean workflow initiatives could be applied to ISD testing in the routine laboratory setting In this study conducted by a third party consultant Nexus Global Solutions process steps for ISD tests were compared for two systems the Abbott ARCHITECT i SR System and the Siemens Dimension RxL Integrated Chemistry System The number of steps and time required to perform ISD testing were recorded ISD samples were tracked at a community hospital lab processing a mix of up to cyclosporine sirolimus and tacrolimus tests per day on the ARCHITECT system In this hospital ISD testing is performed in batches once per day and specimens received after the once daily ISD test run are held over for testing the next day Results fewer steps faster processing time and reduced risk of error Recorded observations showed that the required manual preparation pretreatment and extraction of ISD specimens before loading onto the ARCHITECT i SR analyzer took up to process steps distinct manual steps and to minutes of staff time For the ARCHITECT system TAT from start of testing including pretreatment and extraction took to minutes The same tests were processed on the Dimension RxL system at a Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics R D facility The ISD assays performed on the Dimension system require no manual pretreatment or extraction Without these manual steps the tubes can be loaded quickly onto the instrument after a simple pipetting step Consequently the TAT for ISD testing on the Dimension RxL system from start of testing took only minutes The Dimension system reduced average TAT including sample preparation and processing by minutes faster than the ARCHITECT analyzer Conclusion Siemens offers a Lean approach to ISD testing for any routine laboratory With the Dimension system there is no need for complex time consuming manual pretreatment and extraction protocols Hence there is no need for dedicated personnel to perform testing Additionally the lack of extensive manual sample processing lowers the probability for human error that could impact the quality of test results ISD samples can be quickly and simply loaded onto the instrument without batching making it possible to perform ISD testing any time of the day The ISD solutions on the Dimension system enable any lab to efficiently perform ISD testing as part of its daily routine These solutions help improve transplant patient management with faster TAT less staff involvement and lower risk of error This study was commissioned by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Contact Us Services

Diseases Allergy Physician Information Physician Information gAllergy Helps Screen Diagnose and Monitor Patients Allergies are often inherited Children with one or more allergic parents should be assessed for atopic risk by testing for specific IgE to common food and inhalant allergens A clinical history of skin gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms that are suggestive of allergy often prompts a pediatrician or family doctor to prescribe specific IgE testing Food allergies are more frequently seen in young children while inhalant allergies usually appear later in childhood Consequently it is recommended that children under the age of be tested for specific IgE antibodies to common food allergens initially and then tested for inhalant allergies when they get older The gAllergy assay is a third generation allergen specific IgE assay that aids in the diagnosis and early treatment of allergy patients The gAllergy assay delivers fast and accurate results to help

Blood Test Setting a New Standard for Liver Fibrosis Assessment The discovery of the ELF markers represents a significant advancement in the diagnosis of patients with liver disease Of particular benefit the ELF test can help diagnose patients with mild to moderate liver fibrosis which is usually asymptomatic so that clinicians are able to intervene before significant damage to the liver occurs William Rosenberg MD Centre for Hepatology University College London NICE Guidelines Now Include ELF Blood Test The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence provides evidence based guidelines across healthcare and is used by local authorities to inform healthcare related decisions NICE has recently recommended the use of the ELF test to test for and monitor advanced liver fibrosis in people diagnosed with Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease NAFLD Link to NICE Guidelines NICE Guidelines Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease assessment and management What is the ELF Blood Test ELF stands for Enhanced Liver Fibrosis The ELF Blood Test combines three serum biomarkers which have been shown to correlate to the level of liver fibrosis assessed by liver biopsy These biomarkers include Hyaluronic acid HA Procollagen III amino terminal peptide PIIINP Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase TIMP The algorithm measures each of these markers by immunoassay to create an ELF Score from which a designation for fibrosis severity can be determined The ELF Blood Test can be performed in a physician s office or health center For more details about the ELF Blood Test on the ADVIA Centaur systems please refer to the ELF Specification Sheet Download ELF Specification Sheet Information regarding the ELF Blood Test and the relationship to liver fibrosis can be found in the
