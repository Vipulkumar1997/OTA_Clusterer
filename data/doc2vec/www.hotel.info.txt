can take between and minutes and you will pay between and euros for a taxi The City Structure of Dubai Dubai is split into sectors whose only significance is to characterise which are the agricultural and the urban areas There are further divisions into communities and Dubai has communities in total Jumeirah is the most expensive residential area in Dubai Up until some years ago it was the home of the fishermen but now several bungalows have been developed here in the last few years The rich inhabitants and the mostly rich European guest workers live here Mirdif is a residential area where the

Bavaria Munich is one of the top tourist destinations in not only the country of Germany but also the rest of Europe as well Of course it is easy to see why there is a lot to do and see on any trip to Munich Located in the southern portion of Germany Munich is the capital of the Bavarian Region and has centuries of culture dating back from medieval times which makes for an interesting experience while visiting With the Franz Josef Strauss International Airport serving as a major hub in Europe and well laid out public transport via the U Bahn and S Bahn it is an easy place to get around Beer Lovers Paradise Every fall Munich is overtaken by the world s biggest beer fans for Oktoberfest a huge celebration that is on the bucket list of many a traveler But the good news is the famous beer halls and lively atmosphere of Munich can be felt all year round during any visit To start off the tour head to arguably the most famous beer hall in the world the Hofbr uhaus it offers some of the most traditional and entertaining activity and music you can find in Munich For something that might be a bit more low key well as low key as a German beer hall can get look for the more traditional Weisses Br uhaus In operation for well over years it serves delicious local fare and has a comfortable and relaxing atmosphere Plenty of Historic Sites Beyond beer halls the colorful history of Munich means the city is absolutely full of centuries old palaces castles and churches No trip to Munich is complete without taking time to visit a few of the former castles and palaces like the Schloss

the heart of the Midlands you will find the city of Birmingham It is known for its cultural diversity canals chocolate history and shopping to mention but a few The welcoming nature of the Brummie capital means that it is an interesting and unique place to explore A wealth of cultural sites culinary adventures as well as football stadiums and shopping paradises means that there is something for everyone in Birmingham The heart of the city is easy to explore on foot or for the more adventurous explorer why not try the canal network There are said to be more canals in Birmingham than in Venice Getting around Brum The centre of Birmingham is easily walkable even though it is a big city However if you want to explore slightly further afield the bus network is excellent The bus company Network West Midlands services the area and there are Centro information points around the city Birmingham is also a transport hub for reaching other exciting destinations across the UK so if you have a little more time on your hands why not jump aboard Explore the diversity of Birmingham There are many different districts of Birmingham and each of them are unique and rich in cultural history If you have a limited amount of time in the city we recommend you head out of the city centre and visit one or all three of our recommendations Brindleyplace It s all about the canal in Brindleyplace The beautiful picturesque district is the ideal place to have a canal boat experience or alternatively just watch the boats go by while enjoying dinner or a drink in one of the many restaurants bars and cafes But Brindleyplace has more to offer than just its waterside location The district is host to many venues Barclaycard Arena Ikon Gallery and The Crescent Theatre Make sure you check the calendar before you visit as from June onwards the area hosts events such as Dragonboat Festival and local markets Digbeth As the creative heart of the city Digbeth is an artist s paradise One of the most iconic buildings in the area is The Custard Factory The building is decorated in art and was originally the factory where eggless custard was invested and produced If modern art is not your particular interest then head to The Old Crown Pub which is the oldest secular building in Birmingham and dates back to the s The Jewellery Quarter Even if you don t want to pick up something sparkly for a loved one The Jewellery Quarter is worth an afternoon trip Did you know that of British Jewellery is produced there and in the district there are over listed buildings This world famous area of Birmingham is stepped in history and St Paul s church and the surrounding square is a beautiful example of Georgian architecture Not to be missed sights Why not catch up on a bit of reading Head to Broad Street and see the eye catching post modern architecture of Birmingham s library The library was only opened in September and represents a new vision for Birmingham The design is very unique which is probably the reason why it has won so many architectural awards It is also a totally digitalised library and built in an energy efficient manner This is a visionary building that represents the Birmingham of the future If the weather is nice explore the rooftop gardens and the fabulous views over the city In stark contrast to the modernity of the new library we recommend that you head to Back to Backs The National Trust charity offers a unique opportunity to step back in time and experience what life was like living in Birmingham between the s and s The name Back to Backs comes from the fact that the houses were built back to back around a communal courtyard Experience everything from a s sweetshop to a tailor s shop and enjoy this fascinating glimpse of social history Tours are available from Tuesday through to Sunday and you can book online Thinktank Science Museum is an exceptional museum which brings science to life with its themed galleries The whole museum is interactive and has everything from locomotives to a planetarium This museum is not just for kids it is awe inspiring for any age and well worth a visit Catch a bite to eat Birmingham is the home of a diverse range of ethnic groups and cultures With this the city offers a plethora of cuisines and truly something for every taste Here is our selection of a few restaurants to tickle the taste buds The Vaults Newhall Place Newhall Hill Birmingham B JH Situated in the Jewellery Quarter The Vaults used to be a Victorian cellar but today you will find a chic and sophisticated underground restaurant which is the perfect retreat The furniture is bespoke and this compliments the exposed brickwork The dinner menu is concise but offers some delicious contemporary British cuisine Choose from two courses for or three courses for If you aren t really too hungry no problem There is a lovely bar with a wide selection of drinks and cocktails plus secluded booths in which you can sit and truly escape the world The Balti Triangle Ladypool Rd B JS Birmingham is home to some great Indian food so much so that the Balti Curry is set to be given protected food status like Champagne or Parma ham With this in mind it would be a shame to miss out on the regions delicacy The Balti Curry which takes its name from the metal dish in which it is cooked and eaten is available throughout the Balti Triangle The area is located in Sparkhill Balsall Heath and Moseley Time for a good night s sleep Like many big cities there are an abundance of hotels to choose from but to narrow down your search here are two of our Birmingham hotel recommendations Hotel Indigo The Cube Wharfside Street B R This luxurious hotel is located inside The Cube at The Mailbox and provides you with excellent panoramic views of the city The hotel has boutique rooms and perhaps the best views can be found on the rd and th Floors However all rooms are beautifully decorated with a chic modern theme and offer an extremely high standard finish The main draw of this hotel is its proximity to shopping in The Mailbox and the array of bars restaurants situated nearby Hotel La Tour Albert Street Birmingham B J This star hotel is a reasonably new addition to Birmingham however it already has a fan following The position directly opposite The Bullring is an attraction for many but personally I feel the interior of the hotel is the main selling point The rooms are executed to the highest standard with nothing overlooked the lighting and heating is all controllable by a touch screen and the bathroom is complemented with a rainfall shower If you manage to leave the luxury of your hotel room then you are surrounded with a variety of pubs restaurants and bars to explore In and around Birmingham
