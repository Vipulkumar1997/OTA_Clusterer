Turns Personal By Carson Woodbury Date Carson Woodbury as a toddler with his mom Kate Kuhn Woodbury M D No one prepares you for listening to a lecture about how your mother died Medical students are trained to recognize grief and distress in patients and invite them to talk about it We are taught the complex molecular physiology behind diseases common and rare minor and terminal But we are not trained to see our own family s tragedy writ large on a lecture screen broken down into bullet points and illustrated with surgical images For me this moment came on a chilly January morning in the third week of our reproductive systems course The schedule listed two lectures on ovarian disorders the first on benign diseases such as cysts and infections and the second on cancer At the end of the first hour the professor introduced a case example The patient was a woman in her early s with three months of mild abdominal pain As we worked through the history lab values and imaging it became clear This was no infection or benign cyst This young woman had ovarian cancer The lecturer went on to describe the chosen treatment plan but I barely heard My mind had been yanked years away paralyzed with the sudden reminder of another young woman s cruel diagnosis my mother s A board certified anesthesiologist marathon runner and mother to two boys she died from an aggressive ovarian cancer on May She was I heard the class applaud My friend Eva who knew about my mom leaned over and asked me how I was doing Looking at my computer I thanked her for asking and mumbled something about the last case being a doozy I had a minute or two before the second lecture began I m still doing okay I thought I can still do this I desperately wanted to understand this disease But the more I thought about it the sadder I became I can t do this not now Not wanting to make a scene I grabbed only my laptop and left the hall focusing on walking at a normal pace Then I found a study room with no windows slumped against the wall and let down my guard It was seven days before I finally willed myself to watch the recording of the lecture It fit the familiar pattern of a cancer talk risk factors clinical features pathology etc but this time sprinkled with pieces of information that jabbed into my stomach like ice picks May not feel mass on pelvic exam until cm My dad once said my mom s tumor looked like the Death Star on her CT scan An intraoperative photograph showing an abdominal cavity littered with yellowish lobes of metastatic cancer Picturing my mother s youthful cream white skin cut with a scalpel and lifted up by cold steel retractors to reveal disease scattered far from its ovarian origin No overall survival advantage for CA screening in average risk women We still don t have a way to catch it early All the while I couldn t shake the stunning awe that every cancer every disease I learned about in medical school provokes this visceral reaction from someone somewhere because it has touched their life like ovarian cancer irrevocably altered mine How many of my classmates I wondered who didn t attend a particular lecture had excused themselves because they were too sad because the featured disease had once scarred their family How will we fare caring for our first patients suffering from diseases we could name before we could spell surgeon Illness touches all of us New medical students are not blank slates We arrive carrying the weight of our family s collective experience with health and the medical system I am far from understanding the full impact of my mother s death on my life in medicine but I am one step closer to understanding her disease and how I can care for patients whose diagnosis cuts me to my core Ovarian cancer has a face and a name and a story for me Ovarian cancer will forever be represented by my mother But there are countless more diseases for which I don t have a story In a few weeks my classmates and I will enter the hospital to begin learning the human stories with which to illustrate our textbooks Faces will replace PowerPoint slides Conversations will supplant bulleted lists A slice from a CT scan will lose its abstractness and become a window into understanding Ms F s bloody cough Disease will gain a face and a name and a favorite takeout dinner Disease will become human And then we ll go to work This essay

Prices Many Patients Turn to Medication Access Team Johns Hopkins pharmacy team works to help patients afford prescriptions By Patrick Smith Date The good news is there s a medication that can help treat your newly diagnosed serious illness The bad news is it s so expensive that you can t buy it That s not a situation anyone should face says Lori Dowdy manager of the Medication Access Team run by the Johns Hopkins Department of Pharmacy and Johns Hopkins Home Care Group Dowdy and her team work hard to make sure patients at The Johns Hopkins Hospital get the medicine they re prescribed even if their wallets are empty The Medication Access Team serves patients who are underinsured or have no insurance at all According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in September million Americans were uninsured and millions more had insurance premiums copays and deductibles they couldn t afford The Medication Access Team was established in Since then both the number of clinics and the number of patients the team serves have exploded Oncology was the initial clinic our team supported with just one employee to assist with prior authorization and patient assistance says Dowdy Since then as more clinics learned about this unique service we have grown tremendously Last year the Medication Access Team helped nearly patients across clinics at The Johns Hopkins Hospital As health care costs continue to rise many people whether insured or not are unable to pay for the medicines prescribed by their doctors Yesterday we had a patient diagnosed with breast cancer says Dowdy Her insurance company told her that the out of pocket costs for treatment would be A lot of our patients don t have access to that kind of money Dowdy and her team know the ins and outs of philanthropy government grants and other medication access resources They mine those sources every day to see what s available for patients at Johns Hopkins who are unable to afford expensive medications They found multiple sources to help the patient with breast cancer cover the exorbitant copay To get help from the Medication Access Team patients have to apply for whatever medical benefits to which they might be entitled as well as prove a certain level of income hardship We see a lot of patients who are struggling to make ends meet Dowdy says But we re also seeing growing numbers of working families who just don t make enough money to cover some of these incredibly expensive medications In addition to specialty medications to treat diseases such as cancer and hepatitis C the Medication Access Team helps Johns Hopkins transplant patients and those with common chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension The team works closely with the hospital s interdisciplinary teams to find solutions We re all focused on the same thing Dowdy says We re all doing our best to help our patients concentrate on getting better and not worry about how they re going to pay for their treatment Making a Dent in Baltimore s Hepatitis C Epidemic As Seen In Community Issue Follow Johns Hopkins Medicine Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google YouTube Contact Information

A New Push to Teach Future Doctors About Late Life Depression Online modules developed at Johns Hopkins highlight how to recognize and treat the psychiatric disorder in elderly patients By Judy F Minkove Date Looking defeated the year old woman arrived at The Johns Hopkins Hospital from the Midwest For two years she d seen doctors about her chronic shortness of breath and fatigue But her heart turned out to be fine Not sure what to do next her husband found Johns Hopkins geriatric psychiatrist Susan Lehmann in an online search and scheduled an appointment Within minutes of meeting her new patient Lehmann saw classic signs of depression low self esteem poor sleep quality and anxiety attacks the likely cause of her shortness of breath It s not so mystical but because she wasn t tearful her doctors never considered depression the psychiatrist says This patient like many Lehmann treats benefited from antidepressants and psychotherapy Lehmann directs the Johns Hopkins Geriatric Psychiatry Day Hospital Program and the school of medicine s general psychiatry clerkship Most doctors don t recognize the threat geriatric mental health problems bring because they re not trained to do so she says Now with the release of self paced online learning modules she s crafted for medical students Lehmann aims to heighten future physicians awareness about late life depression and its nuances Depression affects as many as percent of people age and older Other mood disorders such as manic episodes can also emerge later in life says Lehmann who recently published a book on bipolar disorder in older adults And she notes suicide rates among the elderly are rising especially among men Meanwhile many Americans are living longer About percent of the U S population is or older By an estimated percent of the population will be over We don t have enough geriatric experts for the tens of millions affected by aging Lehmann says And a negative outlook on life can worsen comorbidities like Parkinson s disease strokes and cardiac disease Expertise in this field remains woefully inadequate In a recently published paper in MedEdPORTAL Publications Lehmann and colleagues found that some percent of responding medical schools lacked specific instruction or clinical experience focused on geriatric psychiatry Of those schools percent reported having no geriatric psychiatrist on the faculty At some point says Lehmann Every doctor in almost every specialty will interact with geriatric patients Students need to know what s considered normal aging from heart problems to memory to mental health She says the new modules can bridge this gap with easily digestible clinical vignettes and videos showing how to engage with older patients and recognize and manage depression She hopes more medical schools will adopt the modules which are free of charge Lehmann draws from nearly years of experience practicing and teaching geriatric psychiatry In she was awarded the Berkheimer Faculty Education Scholar Grant offering resources and time outside her regular duties to create the modules After reviewing them says Lehmann students should be familiar with the signs and symptoms of geriatric depression and screening tools to help establish the diagnosis I feel a sense of mission to our older patients she adds noting that geriatric depression is highly treatable It s so rewarding to help people find a better quality of life Things That Might Surprise You About Depression in Older Adults It s never a normal part of aging Clinicians may recognize depression but often undertreat it with low doses of drugs It s sometimes confused with dementia Suicide rates among the elderly are growing especially among plus year old white men per As Seen In November December Follow

Institutes Core Facilities About Our Faculty Resources Events Calendar Home Research Research Topics At the foundation of Johns Hopkins Medicine is research Interdisciplinary innovative and pioneering investigations at Johns Hopkins are not only the stuff of scientific history but also the vital underpinning of both a world renowned medical education and unsurpassed patient care A mind boggling and ever expanding range of topics run the gamut from basic and clinical to translational research Basic research provides a fundamental understanding of molecules and mechanisms that without offering any apparent practical avenue for patient treatment involves identifying cellular processes and genetic mutations and revealing breakdowns in cellular communication associated with all manner of diseases and disorders Marfan syndrome for instance Clinical research such as testing a hypertension medicine in mice genetically engineered to have Marfan syndrome for instance applies itself directly to improving the human condition Translational research often described as bench to bedside studies accelerates the discovery of new treatments directed at the basic mechanisms of disorder and disease and hastens the time when effective treatments become a reality Marfan syndrome is just one excellent example of how finding the genes responsible for a disease and discovering what regulates them can lead to therapy General Research Research Type Department Addictions affective disorders Alzheimer s mood disorders anxiety disorders brain injury brain stimulation child and adolescent eating

Healthy Mind Healthy Connections Family Caregiver Resources Diseases Conditions Research Resources Healthy Mind Home Health Healthy Aging Healthy Mind Stress Management Important at Any Age You may be retired with grown children but stress doesn t magically disappear Here are the top stressors to guard against later in life with tips on handling them from a Johns Hopkins expert Try It The Magic Number of Stress Relief Long used in yoga the points relaxation technique has been shown to reduce heart rate and blood pressure You can find a guide online search for points on youtube com or simply sit comfortably close your eyes and mentally focus on every part of your body one at a time starting with the center of your forehead moving down to your toes then back up again The idea is to free the mind from other concerns as you focus entirely on the exercise Retirement is the time in your life when you can finally throw out the alarm clock and set your own schedule This new freedom may sound idyllic but for the millions of adults heading into retirement it can be a recipe for stress if caution isn t taken Today s retirees are facing unprecedented challenges retirement savings reduced by market crashes increasing health care costs and high rates of divorce So what can help assure you that you ll be able to enjoy these peaceful years Mapping out a holistic plan for your retirement life says Michelle Carlstrom LCSW C senior director at the Office of Work Life and Engagement at Johns Hopkins People think retirement is just a financial decision says Carlstrom But that alone won t determine happiness Even if you feel financially secure there are other issues to consider Here s what Carlstrom suggests for a less stressful retirement Plan activities with purpose How much does your job currently dictate your social interactions and sense of purpose For many empty nesters their workplace is where they socialize engage in stimulating conversations and feel a sense of accomplishment It s easy to focus on how much you will enjoy leaving behind the stress of your job But you also need to think about the potential social or spiritual void that might be left when you leave says Carlstrom In other words you should plan activities that will replace the stimulation and fulfillment you had from your workplace Those could include social clubs centered around interests such as cooking reading or gardening Volunteer opportunities also abound check with your local library schools art museums or volunteermatch org Or consider taking a class at a community college Consider continued work According to an AARP survey about percent of retired folks plan to continue working whether as a volunteer a part time employee or a new small business owner I know someone who decided to become an usher at a baseball stadium so he could enjoy all the games says Carlstrom No matter what you end up doing don t wait until you retire to figure it out Carlstrom recommends laying the groundwork at least five years out from your retirement date A survey of job websites now might help you gauge part time or consultant opportunities for later Ground yourself in reality Ask yourself if the problems that you are dealing with are real or are imagined and anticipatory says Carlstrom For example are you stressed because you are having financial troubles or is it the anticipation of health care expenses that could pop up down the road Our bodies can t tell the difference so we react with the same amount stress So spend time exploring whether you are experiencing real or imagined stress and develop a stress management plan that will ultimately reduce stress by instilling a sense of control over the situation Adjust your stress management style When you are stressed how do you react Do you go for a run Reach for a drink Call your best friend Gorge on junk food Head to the mall Understanding that everyone uses a mixture of healthy and unhealthy stress relievers is the first step toward focusing on healthier options like exercise meditation prayer and social support Retirement can be a new chance to really commit to examining how you handle stress says Carlstrom Definitions Social support The help you receive from others in your life Family friends peers and other people who care about you and for you make up your social support system or network You May Also Like Decode Your Stress Management Skills Take this quick quiz to discover what research shows to be the best heart friendliest ways to cope with stress in your

Ask the Expert Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine What to Know Reviewed By Lei Zheng M D Ph D Can a vaccine treat pancreatic cancer New research on the subject appears promising says Johns Hopkins medical oncologist Lei Zheng M D Ph D who helped develop the type of immunotherapy vaccine currently being tested in clinical trials But unlike most vaccines used today a pancreatic cancer vaccine doesn t prevent the cancer from developing In clinical trials doctors are testing how this vaccine therapy along with other specialized immunotherapies can harness the power of a patient s immune system to more comprehensively treat pancreatic cancer Zheng explains the basics behind this novel therapy Pancreatic Cancer and the Immune System Your immune system is a complex collaboration of cells and other molecules that work together to help your body fight off threats such as infection or disease As Zheng explains there are two main parts to the body s immune system Innate immunity These guard cells are always on call and ready to fight an infection whenever it presents itself Adaptive immunity Unlike innate immunity these cells largely T cells and B cells stay silent until they re activated or alerted to a threat Your immune system works hard to ensure just the right balance of immune response That s important because too little response means you stay sick Too much response causes autoimmune disease Cancer cells however have found a way to trick the body s immune cells into not recognizing them as a threat That means the immune lieutenants or T cells never alert the special forces team to attack cancer cells If not detected and treated cancer cells continue to grow and spread How a Pancreatic Cancer Vaccine Works Zheng is working on the pancreatic cancer vaccine This vaccine is made up of inactivated tumor cells which means they have been killed and are unable to cause disease So far research has shown that the vaccine can help some patients with pancreatic cancer activate a more effective immune response to the cancer Zheng explains When we give patients this vaccine it prompts the body to attack the cancer cells wherever they are in the pancreas as well as anywhere else in the body the cancer cells have spread Potential of Pancreatic Cancer Immunotherapies This is just one type of immunotherapy doctors are using to treat pancreatic cancer of all different stages today says Zheng For example doctors use this vaccine with specialized immunotherapy drugs called checkpoint inhibitors to help the body s immune system recognize cancer cells as a threat and then attack them Immunotherapies for pancreatic cancer are still in the research phase Doctors continue to learn more about how these therapies allow a patient s immune system to work with conventional treatments such as surgery and chemotherapy to more effectively kill pancreatic cancer cells Request an appointment Johns Hopkins medical concierge services offer complimentary assistance

as lupus your body s immune system which is designed to fight germs and other invaders that threaten your health mistakenly turns against your own tissues In the case of MS the body s inflammatory defenses attack myelin the insulation that covers and protects the nerves Like a worn electrical wire a nerve cell with faulty myelin can short circuit and affect the transmission of signals to and

type With RRMS symptoms can change affecting different areas of the body or disappear remit and then recur relapse Every week in the U S about people are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or MS According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society four times as many women have MS as men and more and more women are developing it Why Is it genetics Is it hormones or some other aspect of being female Peter Calabresi M D Ph D is the director of the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center His team including MS expert Ellen Mowry M D is combining research with clinical treatment for a better understanding of the disease including why it s more common in women The basic cause of MS has yet to be discovered The disease has been linked to a number of risk factors including smoking and stress But more studies are also pointing to the roles of female hormones vitamin D inflammation and even obesity Hormones and Other Female Factors When a condition affects women more than men scientists are likely to take a look at the role of sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogen Between boys and girls Mowry says there s less difference in the rate of MS among children before puberty but in older children and adults the trend changes striking more females in adolescence and adulthood Pregnancy Concerns Pregnancy also affects MS remissions and relapses During pregnancy some women with MS notice a lessening of symptoms This can be followed by a flare up after the baby is born Postpartum relapse is a recognized phenomenon among MS researchers and patients Calabresi says newly diagnosed

discuss concerns and risks carefully with their doctor Mowry says After children are born we stress to new moms the importance of keeping kids active and at a healthy weight to lower their risk of getting MS Body Fat and Obesity How could weight affect someone s chances of getting MS Inflammation plays a role in MS and obesity is linked to inflammation Mowry says that the rising incidence of MS among women may relate to body fat Obesity is epidemic in the U S with over a third of American adults at a body mass index of or higher Women typically carry more fat on their bodies than men and obesity rates are higher for women as well Belly fat in particular is associated with increased inflammation Carrying extra body weight may be especially risky for women Mowry says The inflammation chemicals in women s bodies are different from those in men and focusing research on these may provide clues as to why more women are affected Vitamin D Deficiency Calabresi Mowry and their team are leading the research effort on the role of vitamin D in MS In general MS affects more people living farther from the equator The skin absorbs vitamin D from sunlight Researchers are looking at the relationship between low vitamin D levels and a higher risk of developing MS increased frequency of relapses and greater negative impact of the disease on patients lives Mowry points out that higher vitamin D levels in patients with fewer relapses may also be linked to another factor such as exercise It could be that patients who are outdoors exercising absorb more vitamin D but that the exercise itself could be lessening the MS symptoms Conversely Mowry says patients who are more disabled by their MS may be spending more time indoors which could result in less sun exposure and lower stores of vitamin D Mowry s studies are exploring whether taking vitamin D supplements can help reduce the number of relapses in patients with the relapsing remitting type of the disease Precision Approaches to MS Calabresi is the director of the Johns Hopkins Precision Medicine Center of Excellence for Multiple Sclerosis an exciting new precision medicine initiative where patients with MS can get an individualized approach to therapy while providing essential data for researchers It s important for women and men alike with MS to get on the best therapy for them as early as possible Calabresi says As research reveals more about how genetics environment and other factors increase a woman s chances of developing MS new ways to address the disease are likely to emerge You May Also Like Tips for
