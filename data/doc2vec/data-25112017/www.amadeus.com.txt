Whether we re travelling to a new city for work or for fun we all want to find the most interesting neighbourhood most loved restaurant or that cool new bar The thing is we don t always have a local

on the same site says Alexis Batlle CEO of AVUXI So how does it work AVUXI s TopPlace technology shows the most popular areas within a city through easy to understand heat map overlays so travellers searching for a hotel on an online travel agency or metasearch site can intiutively understand the most popular places in the city they are about to visit In addition AVUXI s ranking scores assign location ranking to each hotel and vacation rental and travellers can even search for popular places by category such as eating shopping nightlife and sightseeing so foodies can look for hotels near a city s top areas for restaurants and fashionistas in the shopping district To deliver all this data to travellers AVUXI s platform analyses and ranks geolocated data including comments photos and reviews from millions of users through more than sources including Instagram Facebook Twitter Google Wikipedia and more For travellers with little time on their hands having access to all of this user generated data from locals all over the world means they can book their hotel with confidence And much to the old adage that location is everything travellers will pay for the convenience an AVUXI

Working towards inclusive and accessible travel for all Table of contents Foreword Executive summary An introduction to accessibility social imperative meets economic opportunity Amadeus Accessibility study methodology Needs and expectations the challenges of accessible travel The travel experience and customer journey THE PRE TRAVEL STAGE WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE THE TRIP Research and planning Booking and payment IN TRANSIT WHAT HAPPENS ON THE JOURNEY Flying high airports and airlines Wrong side of the tracks trains and railway stations IN DESTINATION WHAT HAPPENS UPON ARRIVAL Driving a hard bargain transfers and car rental services Home from home accommodation Being there destinations Evolving the travel experience the ideal accessible trip The four characteristics of the ideal accessible trip Open access how technology is empowering travellers Conclusion where to next Acknowledgements Foreword Foreword Over the past years travel has undergone a revolution that has brought it within the reach of hundreds of millions more people The rise of low cost options the ubiquity of the internet and sharing platforms have created unprecedented demand and choice In turn more people are visiting more destinations than ever before One demographic that is yet to truly benefit from this democratisation of travel people with accessibility needs Millions of people with accessibility needs around the world want to travel more be better connected and have greater variety of personalised travel services and destinations Above all they want to be considered as travellers first with the ability to plan search book and purchase their travel independently The travel industry has taken important steps towards improving the offer to those with accessibility needs but much work remains Offering accessibility services is the right thing to do and that will continue to drive action What might create even greater momentum is the business sense to address a growing and increasingly important demographic it is estimated that by a fifth of the world s population will have some accessibility need At Amadeus we are committed to accessibility We also believe that technology can play a pivotal role in delivering the right blend of services and options Equally however we know that the industry can only achieve its best results by collaborating to deliver the right solutions throughout the travel process from search and booking through to journey and destination services We have commissioned this report with the aim of stimulating further thinking about accessibility within and beyond the travel and tourism industry We look forward to working together with our customers partners and stakeholders to build a truly inclusive and accessible global travel future Tom s L pez Fernebrand Senior Vice President General Counsel Corporate Secretary Amadeus IT Group Executive summary Executive summary This study was commissioned to better understand the needs of travellers with accessibility needs and to identify a framework for action for the travel industry It is clear that delivering a more accessible travel experience which responds to the needs of all travellers is both a social imperative as well as an opportunity for the travel industry Delivering on travellers accessibility needs is an increasing demand World demographic indicators show a growing ageing population that will represent over per cent of people by This is why for the purposes of this study accessibility refers to the needs of people with disabilities and seniors This study provides a comprehensive framework for how the travel industry can think more strategically about accessibility In the Ambrose study identified three main pillars of accessible tourism where action needed to be focused information relating to both access to information and information on accessibility customer service relating to those working in the travel and tourism sector to better serve the travellers needs and facilities relating to the physical environment Ambrose provided a valuable reference for thinking about accessible tourism Taking the Ambrose study as a reference Amadeus identifies four key elements building the value proposition of the ideal accessible trip effective communication responsive service along with standardised content and services as well as a personalised offer as detailed below The customer journey starts from the moment someone considers taking a trip often referred to as the inspiration phase and then every stage throughout the journey to destination and post trip review In terms of effective communication the study highlights both the lack of relevant content on accessibility and the inaccessibility of information as major barriers Good customer service is crucial for a seamless travel experience In an ideal journey customer service teams would be trained in all aspects of accessibility and have clear guidelines on ways to serve customers with different needs Standardised content and services are essential The development of internationally recognised standards for accessible travel and tourism would help to eliminate one of the most shared concerns for this segment of travellers Finally a personalised travel experience is a key component of accessible travel Each part of the travel process should be tailored to the individual and their specific needs Across these four areas technology must be seen as an enabler of more accessible travel providing user friendly dynamic and effective tools to better manage travel experiences This will be achieved through mobile devices and personalised services delivering improved web navigation and facilitating the access to relevant content The interconnectedness of the framework requires a collaborative effort where travel providers both public and private policy makers and organisations that represent those with accessibility needs work together with travellers to move towards an inclusive and universally designed travel landscape Accessibility offers the travel industry a golden opportunity to do the right thing as well as driving increased revenue The combination of social imperative and economic opportunity provides a unique incentive to build a more accessible travel industry UNWTO considers accessibility a central element of any responsible and sustainable tourism policy It is both a human right imperative and an exceptional business opportunity Above all we must come to appreciate that accessible tourism does not only benefit persons with disabilities or special needs it benefits us all Taleb Rifai UNWTO Secretary General Innovative Approaches to Making Destinations Accessible for All Tourists Ambrose Ivor http www accessibletourism org resources enat ambrose accessible tourism healthtourismintegra pdf Mobile plays a key role as an enabler before and a er the trip A major trend is evolving products and solutions to enhance the overall customer experience We don t want anything special just to travel like anyone else Amadeus Accessibility Study highlights Expectations Main challenges Main demands for a premium travel

accessibility matters Only US EU represent a bln market of the spending of the net wealth will be likely to have some form of disability of the global population will be over by Baby boomer generation in US controls Figure a The Traveller Journey an overview An introduction to accessibility social imperative meets economic opportunity An introduction to accessibility social imperative meets economic opportunity Accessible travel enables people with access requirements including mobility vision hearing and cognitive dimensions of access to function independently with equity and dignity through the delivery of universally designed tourism products services and environments Simon Darcy Professor of Social Inclusion Centre for Business and Social Innovation CBSI UTS BUSINESS SCHOOL Australia While there are many descriptions of accessible travel the above provides a comprehensive overview It includes all people including those travelling with children in prams as well as the disabled and seniors It also encompasses everything from facilities in the built environment hotel rooms airports train stations and customer service people well trained to better understand the traveller s needs to information provision websites and brochures The ultimate aim for those involved in supporting accessible travel is to empower every individual to plan and travel independently at their own will However this ambition is far from reality As one wheelchair user says you ve got to be resourceful you ve got to be prepared you ve got to do your homework if you re not prepared to compromise yourself in some way This is the reality for many travellers with accessibility needs today and it is this issue which the industry needs to address Accessible travel is not a luxury Yannis Vardakastanis President of the European Disability Forum EDF Vardakastanis makes an important point when he says accessible travel is not a luxury Instead he points out it is a right enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities UNCRPD that the European Union and almost all its Member States except Ireland have ratified It is the key for many people to participate actively in society and their communities An inaccessible transport network prevents many people from going to school or studying working going to the doctor meeting friends going shopping or to the cinema and other activities that are taken for granted Making the whole travel chain accessible including the information and booking procedures as well as the infrastructure and processes means reinforcing other fundamental rights enshrined in the UNCRPD including employment education freedom of movement etc However despite current progress making travel accessible will be slow unless there is a concerted effort by the industry and regulators to understand the issues that travellers face and collaborate on standards that will remove barriers to travel Ivor Ambrose managing director of the European Network for Accessible Tourism is convinced that there is still limited awareness in the passenger transportation sphere As a consequence a lot of customers with accessibility needs find themselves looking for specialised solutions and travel agencies because they re not considered part of the mainstream This results in a lower quality of travel experience because the services are not planned with them in mind so they have to take the second best option Travel industry players need to sit down and agree to come along and standardise everything and everyone else follows Ivor Ambrose Managing Director European Network for Accessible Tourism Not only are these customers getting a raw deal but there is a missed economic opportunity for travel players The World Health Organisation estimates that by per cent of the global population will be aged over People with accessibility issues represent a large and fast growing minority group worldwide However the travel industry is not fully capitalising on the business opportunity this presents The retiring Baby Boomer generation in the US controls per cent of net wealth and per cent of spending Martin Heng Accessible Travel Manager Lonely Planet The ageing demographic in the developed world is driving the accessible tourism market according to Martin Heng Lonely Planet s accessible travel manager They possess spending power and the appetite for travel which makes them arguably the first generation in human history that will not leave their wealth to their offspring but instead will enjoy their retirement which in many cases involves travel These Boomers want products and services adapted to their desires needs and share of wallet It is this market dynamic which will help to drive greater accessibility for all travellers with needs This view is reiterated by Ross Calladine head of business support at national tourism board Visit England who maintains that embracing accessible tourism is important for the tourism industry to thrive He recognises that there is a huge economic opportunity presented by demographic shifts in our population and visitor profile not to mention a social imperative in providing tourism experiences that are accessible to all The ambition should be to build products solutions and services that are accessible by design By doing so accessibility is built in at the formation stage meaning that products or services are organically accessible and modifications which can be costly won t need to be made later Keiji Kawahara executive director International Association for Universal Design in Japan which has more over s than any other country at percent of population says that the implementation of universal design principles when designing and developing travel infrastructure services and technologies will make societies more inclusive will increase the usability of all products and will also benefit all people at large Accessible travel also makes business sense and is a competitive advantage for any smart company EU citizens with disabilities older persons or anyone with suitcases or pushchairs as well as those with a broken leg or temporary or long term reduced mobility make for an untapped market still to be explored Helga Stevens Member of the European Parliament World Atlas February http www worldatlas com articles countries with the largest aging population in the world html An introduction to accessibility social imperative meets economic opportunity Creating a legal framework in the US EU and India progress is being made Legislation is helping to transform the landscape of accessibility in travel In the US regulation by the Department of Transportation obliges US consumer facing primary desktop websites of airlines and kiosks in certain US airports to comply with specific accessibility standards WCAG Level AA The same standards are mandatory for certain websites in other countries such as Australia and the UK On the other hand the EU Commission s proposal for a European Accessibility Act provides a common legal framework for the implementation of accessibility in the EU which should lead to a reduction in costs and easier cross border trading as well as better market opportunities for accessible products and services The adoption of the proposal would mean that people with accessibility issues will benefit from fewer barriers in areas such as computers and operating systems ATMs ticketing and check in machines smartphones telephone services and related equipment audio visual media services e commerce banking services and services related to air bus rail and waterborne passenger transport The Accessible India campaign launched in recommends steps to make airports and railway stations accessible as well as improving the accessibility of important public buildings in cities There is also a new disability bill under review which places emphasis on accessibility and proposes punitive damages for non compliance The message is that progress is happening however more needs to be done We have a common goal to make Europe more accessible As Rapporteur of the European Accessibility Act it has been my aim from the outset to improve accessibility because I see accessibility as a precondition for a free and independent life We cannot create accessibility overnight but the Act is hopefully taking a big step in the right direction MEP Morten Lokkegaard Member of the European Parliament Amadeus Accessibility study methodology Amadeus Accessibility study methodology In the global travel technology provider Amadeus commissioned this research study with the consulting firm Ilunion owned by ONCE the Spanish National Organisation of the Blind The study brings together perspectives from travellers and experts to provide a complete picture of the travel accessibility landscape determining the different needs and pain points Using a combination of techniques the study provides both a qualitative and quantitative perspective developed from Five exploratory focus groups external expert interviews in depth traveller interviews online interviews with travellers representing different segments and markets The segments included those with visual hearing cognitive and physical disabilities as well as senior travellers over with accessibility needs in the US EU and India Characterisation of travellers based on Amadeus survey All regions have equal weight in the final results Europe Visual Hearing Intellectual Physical Older India United States Regions Markets Traveller segmentation based on disability aging profile The research phases Stage one consisted of five focus groups of travellers with different kinds of accessibility issues conducted in Spain to explore the main areas to be researched and set the parameters of the study Stage two consisted of a series of in depth interviews with travellers in the three regions as well as with subject matter experts In total interviews were conducted to validate the findings from stage Stage three consisted of an online survey across the three regions to further validate and quantify the study s findings By using these different techniques the study provides a robust and comprehensive perspective on accessible travel from multiple dimensions Figure a An overview of survey respondents Needs and expectations the challenges of accessible travel Needs and expectations the challenges of accessible travel Daniel Caverzaschi is a year old Paralympic tennis player who travels often He currently works at Liberty Seguros a Spanish insurance company I believe that there should be an international protocol that facilitates people with accessibility needs to travel especially for airlines Staff just doesn t know how to interact with a disabled person and their wheelchair or equipment I once had a three hour layover and when I asked for my wheelchair at the airport they insisted I needed an assistant I explained to the airport staff that I m totally self sufficient but they allocated me someone who didn t even speak English and I ended up missing my connecting flight For the first time ever I felt useless a real disabled person Another thing that annoys me is the way they treat my wheelchair five of mine have been broken during a flight Daniel Caverzaschi year old Paralympic tennis player As Caverzaschi s quote reveals there is still a long way to go before those with accessibility needs can travel in the same way as those who don t with independence dignity and ease The study has uncovered multiple pain points and obstacles across the customer journey from the point at which travellers start to think about and research their trip either on or offline through to their experience at their destination As detailed below in Figure a the overall evaluation of accessibility conditions across all stages of the trip is an unsatisfactory on a scale of This illustrates that the journey to a fully accessible travel experience requires substantial work and focus from every part of the industry What has emerged throughout this study is that tangible progress will happen only when greater understanding of the needs of travellers is aligned with action across all segments and stages of the traveller experience Embedding accessibility needs into travel industry thinking will create real change It requires a comprehensive and strategic approach to accessibility to deliver the necessary change in the experience of travel for those facing these issues ultimately benefitting all travellers The findings from the study detailed in more depth in the following section provide a clear and urgent wake up call Evaluation of accessibility conditions In the planes At the airports In the trains At the train stations In car rental companies In the transfer services taxi Uber etc In accommo dation Channels of searching and booking Overall evaluation of the trip is Accessible tourism the role of technology Ivor Ambrose in some ground breaking work identified three main factors of accessible tourism which need to be addressed facilities in the context that regulation and standards can be deployed to good effect ensuring universal access and enjoyment to all facilities for all travellers Customer service which means that even if facilities are not up to standard customer service can often make the difference to travellers with accessibility needs and can significantly drive up customer satisfaction levels And information because by providing accessible useful and accurate information travellers are better able to plan and make informed decisions about their journeys Amadeus study provides a comprehensive and holistic framework for how the industry can think about accessible travel It takes inspiration from Ambrose s work and develops it further considering the multiple variables that affect accessible travel traveller s needs and the role that technology and new approaches can play Technology can play a powerful role in all interrelated areas whether through deploying more innovative designs understanding how people will react to and with different environments and initiatives or equipping those working in the travel sector with the relevant information to support travellers with accessibility issues But technology must also be seen in the wider context of the accessibility picture as an enabler and facilitator of change and action General understanding of accessibility is providing ramps and accessible toilets There is still an issue of awareness for example of personnel not being aware of the needs of people with disabilities or what accessible rooms means In addition there is a lack of understanding at the design stage too Professional courses such as architecture engineering and design do not address universal accessibility so monitoring isn t effective Shivani Gupta AccessAbility India Innovative Approaches to Making Destinations Accessible for All Tourists Ambrose Ivor http www accessibletourism org resources enat ambrose accessible tourism healthtourismintegra pdf Figure a Summary and main points and barriers The travel experience and customer journey The travel experience and customer journey In this section we consider the different stages of the customer journey pre travel which includes research and planning booking and payment in transit which includes airports and airlines train stations and rail and at destination which includes car rental hotels and other activities The customer journey starts from the minute someone considers taking a trip often referred to as the inspiration phase It goes beyond the simple door to door experience and tracks every stage from idea to journey to destination and post trip review The pain points range from the frustrations during the very first web search and through the entire transactional process to the unreachable toilet roll or inaudible fire alarm And the whole experience can be fraught with obstacles for someone with accessibility issues In the study travellers were asked to rate from to the different parts of the customer journey highlighting clear elements for improvement in all the areas investigated Below is an overview of some of those findings THE PRE TRAVEL STAGE WHAT HAPPENS BEFORE THE TRIP Research and planning AR EA SE AR CH A N D P LA N N IN G Lack limited availability of information about accessible services Accessibility problems in the websites and or its contents BIGGEST BARRIERS Lack of accessible features in marketing advertising Too technical information and hard to find SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS Significant differences among operators airlines airports railway etc Information about accessibility is often not included in mainstream channels OTHER BARRIERS How do I do this I cannot cope with the forms And I don t know if I can just book a flight and if accessibility is a given It is not barrier free You usually still need a seeing person to help AW visually impaired traveller Germany Most travellers prefer online channels for research and planning but many still rely on phone and face to face visits with consultants in order to close the process A significant barrier online as illustrated in Figure a is the lack of or limited availability of accessibility content in accessible formats on websites User friendly information about accessibility is not always included in mainstream channels either online or offline Moreover there are significant differences between operators in how well this information is presented meaning the traveller experience can be very different Satisfaction with web navigation Overall accessibility of travel websites The payment process Availability of relevant content Ease of navigation on the website Current travel technology does not allow a seamless flow from the planning stage to the point of purchase and for many travellers planning the journey is key as most travellers with accessibility needs prefer to book in advance Online Navigation can be very complicated SN year old traveller from the US SN usually travels with a partner or family member and has undertaken organised trips as well as independent excursions She normally books travel by visiting a a specialized online travel agency or going directly to a provider She usually does this alone and says she carefully reads the comments and feedback on a destination before booking SN is technologically adept and used to using laptops smartphones and tablets Despite this she says one of the key issues she has at the planning stage is that the information on the internet is frequently incomplete or just doesn t make sense or is too complicated to use which is something shared by many users as indicated by the low level of satisfaction at as seen in Figure a Why start a travel platform for disabled people No you have to make platforms barrier free in order for everyone to be able to use them AS year old traveller from Germany quadriplegic Her experience is not uncommon AS quoted above uses a desktop computer for researching travel She travelled four times twice for business and twice for leisure in the months prior to being interviewed AS says she tends to find a destination and then look up a barrier free hotel or search for a barrier free room using search term criteria Though she uses the internet for research she says that she also has to call the different customer service teams as the online retail platform may not be fully accessible or she needs to recheck with service providers that what they are offering is really accessible and meets her needs She often calls to talk about the height of the bed the width of the doors and accessibility to the dining area She doesn t always trust reviews and so prefers to read the negative comments as they are less likely to be fake she believes Though she knows of quadriplegic forums online she says she doesn t subscribe to any and prefers to do her own research The lack of common accessibility standards for the provision of content and services in the travel industry clearly creates real problems for travellers at the time of assessing products and services appropriate for their specific needs which is why the rating for availability of relevant content on travel websites is low It is during this stage that technology clear standards in the supply of goods services and content can play a major part in improving the experience not just for those with accessibility issues but for all travellers Figure a Satisfaction with web navigation The travel experience and customer journey Booking and payment AR EA BO O KI N G A N D P AY M EN T Important difficulties even impossibility to buy due to non accessible websites BIGGEST BARRIERS Lack of procedure to communicate the specific needs of each passenger Customer services provided only by phone SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS Significant differences among operators airlines airports railway companies etc OTHER BARRIERS Online is the most used channel for booking transport and accommodation whether together or separately with travel agencies and telephone preferred for certain kinds of trips particularly international However the inability to complete a purchase due to non accessible websites poses a fundamental barrier There is also a lack of standard procedures for communicating passengers specific needs Where customer services are provided only by phone this is considered an even bigger issue Often phone services involve an additional charge and users may not be eligible for the same discounts they can get online Travellers with accessibility needs crave simplicity and the ability to book and pay in the way all travellers do HC doesn t want to navigate through lots of pages to get to the information she needs and cites not having to speak to anyone on the phone as an asset But unfortunately this isn t the reality for many travellers who have accessibility issues and who need to find out more However we are starting to see progress by some travel brands and Expedia quoted below recognises the value of making accessibility central to the design process and how it benefits all travellers Nevertheless and despite the progress made by some travel brands there is still a lot more work to be done as more than half of travellers surveyed per cent said they need help with all or part of the booking process More than three clicks are too many Pay it get it do it be gone without having to engage in any phone calls at all Less words I don t want to read through lots of paragraphs I want simplicity to take me where I need to go and find what I am searching for HC a year old traveller

other forms of transportation Whether traveling for business leisure or any reason in between an accessible experience from beginning to end is key Dallas Thomas Manager Customer Advocacy Regulatory Southwest Airlines As detailed in figure c for per cent of travellers the plane is the preferred transport method and per cent of the overall travel spend goes on flights This is clearly an incentive for Southwest Airlines which is very committed to meeting the accessibility needs of its travellers Dallas Thomas points out that accessibility is often thought of and promoted in terms of the airport and on board experiences however that is short sighted Making the point that accessibility factors into the entire passenger experience including shopping purchasing and after travel Dallas says it is important for travel brands to take a more comprehensive and universal approach to how they address accessibility As more and more passengers with disabilities look to air carriers for their travel needs technology will play an ever evolving role in enhancing the experience He feels that utilising technology to communicate a passenger s individual needs across the entire travel experience will be key to a seamless flow from beginning to end He hopes that technological development in the future will give air carriers the ability to weave accessibility programs into the fundamental fabric of the entire passenger experience Among the biggest issues with airlines is the difficulty of checking in online and choosing seats problems encountered travelling as a group and the fact that customer service is often only available by phone Within airports digital information screens pose significant physical barriers along with staff attitudes and varying levels of customer service standards Other issues included trouble finding assistance meeting points and non accessible check in machines One respondent recalled an incident when a man had to wait for two and a half hours for double doors to open to allow him and his service dog through to baggage claim because the only other access was via a revolving door If you ve got tight connections it takes a lot of energy you have got to rely on people you don t know to get you from point A to point B in the airport JA year old traveller from the US registered visually impaired Figure c Preferred destinations and transport methods Preferred destinations and transport methods Plane Train Private car Bus Car rental Shared car Other JA says he particularly struggles with airport transfers as you can only have somebody who is not flying go with you as far as the security point so then passengers are reliant on the airline He finds it difficult when travelling for business purposes as so much energy is taken up on the journey itself rather than the business purpose KC travels four to five times a year mostly within India He maintains that the first challenge starts when he enters the airport There should be more designated places where people can sit down and from there whichever airline he is travelling with should be able to get their person to help him Today when he reaches the airport he has to search as each airline has a different assistance point When they come and pick you up at check in time they should have a little more human concern and consideration Take the baggage allowance for example Some margin should be given because a disabled person or person like me has to carry certain things which we can t do without such as medical aids KC year old traveller India HC a deaf traveller from the UK has faced other problems and has nearly missed flights and trains because a gate or station platform changed and they never heard the announcement I ve travelled to Amsterdam the Canary Islands Portugal and around Spain many times so I m used to planes and trains I find it ridiculous that people with accessibility needs have to be at the airport three hours or more before instead of one or two like the rest of the passengers We can t sit in our wheelchairs when travelling by plane On the train I don t have to change my chair for a normal seat which makes it easier and more comfortable Estefania Felipe Alonso Spain student online equine retailer and wheelchair user The travel experience and customer journey Wrong side of the tracks trains and railway stations Signage at stations

poor signage issues with digital panels and screens in and on trains communication problems between station of origin and destination and the need for consistency across the system wheelchair accessible means different things at different stations for example Other problems include vending machines with their emphasis on visual display physical barriers to accessibility lack of means to contact staff and issues with public address systems There were also problems reported with locating meeting points for assistance I ve known someone who was dropped off on a platform late at night and the lift was broken The train was gone and he was alone at the top of the stairs It was a small train station in the middle of nowhere AS German traveller quadriplegic ML a wheelchair user from India complains that on trains toilets are not accessible and getting on the train is difficult She travels to times a year and prefers to fly avoiding the train unless she has no other option She has never tried using the specific rail coaches for differently abled as it seems only disabled people can travel in them and whenever she travels by train she is accompanied Figure d Barriers using

OTHER BARRIERS If you book an airport transfer it is difficult to find them when they arrive S traveller from India with impaired vision When travellers arrive at their destination ground transportation can be a challenge whether that is airport transfers or car rental services Effective transfers are found seriously wanting At international destinations in particular there is a lack of reliable information from accessible transfer providers covered to the visitor and it s in this area that standardisation could make a significant difference together with more information about meeting points There are also issues for those who want to rent a car because the cost of accessible rental cars is seen as prohibitively expensive The availability of accessible rental cars is also a significant problem A common challenge both for transfers and car hire is lack of reliable and updated content which provides travellers with information on accessible transfer providers and rental options at different destinations I have never rented a car for travel I avoid it because I need an accessible vehicle and they re usually double or triple the cost JB traveller from the US with a physical disability Home from home accommodation Accessibility is about much more than designing spaces It is a way of including and integrating all kinds of people At Ilunion we are all proud to be working on a unique model one that is inspired by different abilities and which helps to foster positive social change This is our project striving to make accessible tourism a right a reality and a model to follow Jos ngel Preciados General Manager ILUNION Built environment elements mainly toilets especially for people with mobility Mismatch between the accessibility announced by the providers and the real accessibility provided Accessible parking spaces Li s ease of use Public Address Systems Complain forms only provided in hard copies non digital version AR EA AC CO M O D AT IO N S BIGGEST BARRIERS SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS OTHER BARRIERS While accommodation is considered more accessible than other travel components missing information about accessibility and lack of skilled customer service are cited as the main barriers by per cent of travellers However progress is being made by hotel groups such as IHG Accessibility is a strong consideration for IHG s technology strategy and our industry leading Guest Reservation System will ensure that hotels can showcase their accessibility options more clearly We want to make it easy for guests with accessibility needs to search for and book rooms that match their preferences We made significant progress in this area with our legacy reservation system creating new room types to display specific accessibility options Guest personalisation will remain a key tenet of our technology evolution and we recognise that connecting guests with hotels that provide accessibility features will drive increased satisfaction and brand loyalty Craig Eister Senior Vice President Global Revenue Property Based Systems IHG Figure e Barriers related to accommodation The travel experience and customer journey Key accommodation issues include elements of the built environment such as toilets for people with mobility issues and the mismatch between the accessibility claimed by providers and reality Hot topics include accessible parking spaces lift provision and public announcement systems Captioning sub titles is good for everybody RL year old traveller from the US RL has been hard of hearing since the age of seven He also has a year old deaf son RL travels eight or nine times a year mostly within the US While he doesn t expect a destination to cater for his specific disability he says there are some things that accommodation providers could do as a matter of course to make the experience more inclusive such as the television in a restaurant or hotel lobby should have the captioning switched on That s good for everybody as the volume is usually not turned up anyway and both hearing and audio impaired people are usually engaged in conversation so they can look up and see what the news is on the television There are policies in place to ensure accessibility but barriers arise with service delivery and this has a major impact Brittany Perez occupational therapist and senior research associate at the Center for Inclusive Design and Environmental Access IDeA at the University of Buffalo Perez states that the laws are actually just the bare minimum For example there is a growing number of obese people So hotels might be meeting the guidelines but then if someone comes in with a larger wheelchair or with more weight needs they re unable to use the spaces effectively Case study Scandic Hotels When I stay at Scandic I am treated like a guest and not like a disabled person Swedish hotel chain Scandic Hotels has drawn up a point accessibility standard checklist for its plus hotels Technology on offer includes automatic push plates on entrance doors if doors aren t fully automatic hearing loops at reception vibrating wake up and fire alarms sockets for charging electric wheelchairs wheelchair accessible workstations and smartphone checkout Scandic was also the first hotel chain in the world to offer interactive online training in accessibility Accessibility director Magnus Berglund says We train our team in everything all the small things you can t read about such as how guests will reach the soap how to reach the toilet paper how to cook food for a person who can t see so well He adds A customer called me last year and said When I stay at Scandic I am treated like a guest and not like a disabled person That s the best thing that we really can have Being there destinations AR EA AC TI VI TI ES A T D ES TI N AT IO N BIGGEST BARRIERS SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS OTHER BARRIERS Exclusion and or poor adaptation of experiences activities for people with disabilities Low availability of sign guides Low availability of adapted seats in shows only in the most expensive areas Low offer of accessible activities or not flexible for groups Discounts are not properly communicated and published All of the stages that we have discussed so far happen before the traveller has even ventured on to the streets of their chosen destination or been to the local museum Barriers cited at destinations include the exclusion and or poor adaptation of experiences and activities for people with disabilities This includes but is not limited to low availability of signposting low availability of adapted seats in shows and those available being in the most expensive areas and the inflexible offer of accessible activities for groups Additionally discounts are not always properly communicated and published Sometimes this simply comes down to staff awareness says Lonely Planet s Martin Heng When someone calls with a query they often don t know the answer Even in response to a simple question such as Do you have a step into your establishment they would have to go and have a look He says that it s very difficult as a person with a disability to travel to less developed countries independently Visiting is often only made possible by tour operators who have relationships with individual establishments as they will know which establishments their clients can visit but if you go independently to find this information it s extremely difficult Figure f Barriers at destination Evolving the travel experience the ideal accessible trip Evolving the travel experience the ideal accessible trip As is highlighted in the previous section there are significant barriers at each stage of the customer journey to the realisation of a fully accessible travel experience These frustrations and barriers have a major impact on those travellers with accessibility needs and result in a loss of potential revenue for travel companies Figure a Pain points and barriers Most reported problems during the last trip Other The online booking payment process Coordination of the different travel providers Transfer service management Non accessible websites for searching shopping booking Amount of time needed for trip planning and booking Luggage management Indoor navigation in transit Knowledge about specialised providers at destination Challenges with the physical environment at destination Inaccuracy of information about accessibility at destination Lack of skilled customer service Lack of information about accessibility at destination When asked about missed travel opportunities the study found that travellers would increase their travel budget by per cent either travelling more or for longer periods of time if accessibility barriers were eliminated which is a significant opportunity for the industry The dual motivation of social imperative and lost business opportunity should be a major driver of change for the industry There are few areas in the travel sector where the coming together of doing the right thing and the profit principle align and accessibility is one such area Clearly there are some issues which involve changes to infrastructure that will take longer However others which relate to access to information customer service and personalisation could be achieved much more quickly Nonetheless it would help if there was a greater focus on standardisation which all parts of the industry could unite around This would help to catalyse change and ensure that whatever part of the journey a traveller is embarking upon or whatever part of the world they are from or are visiting there would be common standards when it comes to accessibility This would provide the increased reassurance and comfort that most travellers take for granted So what does a seamless accessible trip look like The ideal travel environment won t be one where those with accessibility needs can procure a long list of accessible destinations and friendly airlines and go off and make their own itinerary No the ideal travel environment will be one where they won t need to declare their disability because the travel experience will be as easily navigable for those with accessibility needs as it is for anyone else I used to work in the travel technology sector and was what you could describe as a road warrior Diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in April I travelled with a disability for a year Travel even for the able bodied can be stressful due to uncertainty jetlag different climates etc However knowing what will happen throughout the trip reduces stress I recommend that the traveller has access to a detailed description of each step at time of booking The traveller can then make an informed purchase decision During the trip the traveller should be updated on any changes Call the traveller after the trip to get feedback Andrew Knowlman year old author and traveller from United Kingdom with Motor Neurone Disease Evolving the travel experience the ideal accessible trip The four characteristics of the ideal accessible trip The four key characteristics of the ideal accessible trip are effective communication responsive service standardised content and services and personalised offer Effective communication The research demonstrates that communication is crucial at every stage Currently there are gaps in the presentation of accessibility information whether that s how it looks or the benchmarks used and how they compare with others On an ideal trip a traveller should be able to access sites which adhere to standardised web content accessibility guidelines and allow for example blind and partially sighted people to read them with screen reading software Such sites might also offer access keys for easy navigation and accessible search options Information will be reliable and up to date and take into account different disability profiles The information should be delivered across a range of channels visual audio and easy reading Responsive service Good customer service is crucial for a seamless travel experience At every point in the ideal journey customer service teams would be trained in all aspects of accessibility and have clear guidelines on ways to offer a universal service to all customers with or without disabilities ensuring the service isn t tagged on at the end Empathy will be designed into the training so services are offered without having to be inferred Standardised content and services One of the big difficulties facing travellers is that information is scattered among many different sources Greater integration and standardisation would make the process more streamlined with travellers able to rely on one standard of accessibility information and choose one location over another without relying on personal recommendations or having to call to discuss in depth We have a lot of really good initiatives in accessibility but there is no framework to tell you what accessible even means so a hotel that s accessible according to Flemish standards is different from a Spanish one Marie Denninghaus Transport and Mobility Officer at the European Disability Forum Personalised offer The ideal journey starts at the kitchen table or office desk the research stage and ends when the traveller is back home and tucked up in bed having just left a five star review on Facebook During the process the traveller is offered suggestions based on previous travel bookings both online and offline This profile information combined with data sourced from social media and typical segment behaviour ensures that each part of the journey can be predicted and tailored to the individual While there is a long way to go until the ideal accessible trip is a reality a lot is being done today and we are seeing progress in many areas from airlines airports online agents hotels airports and rail companies The key to progress is unlocking a different mind set thinking through the eyes of those with accessibility needs at the inception of new products and services The four characteristics outlined above provide a useful framework for designing a travel experience that works for all Open access how technology is empowering travellers Open access how technology is empowering travellers Technology is transforming the way travel information is created delivered and accessed and the next decade of tourism will be driven by how travel and technology can be made to intersect Travellers are already reaping the benefits of information sharing being used to create a more personalised travel experience Travel technology providers are working together to develop a cross channel experience by connecting location based information personal identification and context data to provide tailored services For their part customers are getting more used to sharing information on social media in exchange for a better travel experience They re also adept at mining user generated content such as travellers reviews to enhance their own trip They re beginning to anticipate a more holistic approach from travel providers expecting each stage of the travel process to be integrated This technology is crucial to the evolution of accessible travel The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG were developed through the World Wide Web Consortium to provide a single shared standard for web content accessibility and airlines such as Lufthansa are taking decisive steps towards accessibility by complying The travel industry is moving forward developing mobile apps with accessible travel search engines boarding passes in accessible formats and collating user generated content on accessibility through reviews and complaints Some companies have started incorporating artificial intelligence assistance for voice operated travel booking Some hotel chains are using mobile apps to allow guests access to their rooms and other facilities and others are using virtual reality technology to demonstrate accommodation and services In the last two years we ve made the homepage of www lufthansa com and the booking flow much more accessible and compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG The most challenging task was to enable our website for screen reader usage because we had to learn how our blind customers perceive a web site We realised that accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as usability design for older users search engine optimisation SEO improved maintainability and further system development It s not only about reducing barriers for our customers with disabilities It s about a modern implementation of well structured web pages with clearly laid out user interfaces from which all users benefit Stefanie Kratz Project Manager Lufthansa A people centred approach Travel companies now have access to enough data to build up comprehensive profiles of customers to deliver a fully personalised experience Customers are more likely than ever to be using mobile devices while they travel Mobile messenger services allow travellers to receive real time alerts on disruptive incidents itinerary details flight monitoring and risk management information as well as two way communication with travel arrangers Large technology platforms such as Apple Google and Android have quickly adapted to customer needs capitalising on the fact that mobile can be a hub for travel information and navigation The increasing use of iBeacons which allow Bluetooth devices to broadcast or receive tiny static pieces of data over short distances wearables devices which allow someone with a visual impairment to navigate inside unaided for example or a deaf person to sign at a computer interface and the prospect of driverless cars mean the future of accessible travel is exciting Successfully improving accessibility in travel means enhancing usability for all customers As global leaders in the provision of travel technology for the entire travel industry our findings support the idea that mainstreaming accessible travel will benefit all customers and providers and technology has a major role to play in achieving that barrier free travel ecosystem Conclusion where to next Conclusion where to next Europe has done away with many barriers between countries and people But important obstacles persist in particular for million Europeans with a disability We will never achieve inclusive societies as long as everyday life and mobility remains as poorly accessible as it is today We need to act now and we need to act together The technological solutions don t lie in a distant future they exist today Accessibility is a must for people and a great opportunity for business In short it is about making our society future proof Marianne Thyssen Commissioner Employment Social Affairs Skills and Labour Mobility European Commission For those who say accessibility is an issue for other people or something to think about when other travel issues are dealt with this study is a stark warning that this is not the case All of us may have accessibility needs at some point in our lives whether permanent or temporary Catering to these needs is not just the right thing to do but also a sound business decision The argument for moving towards a fully accessible travel experience for all is clear The impact on travellers lives all travellers cannot be questioned The benefits to the industry are significant The time to act is now Added value increased quality and differentiation are factors making companies care about accessible travel The industry needs to move from caring about accessibility to acting on accessibility requirements An increasingly older segment of the population is better educated more willing to travel and has more disposable income They see accessibility as a basic right and want to be able to plan their travel independently The travel industry needs to work together to address the full range of accessibility issues ideally by including accessibility by design as a standard requirement at the start of the product lifecycle Doing so avoids costly time consuming alterations and results in a more memorable travel experience and repeat business A company that complies with universal accessibility criteria is offering quality a differentiating factor that makes it stand out from its competitors Jes s Hern ndez Director of Universal Accessibility ONCE Foundation Spain Accessibility has the potential to create a lot of good and a lot of value in travel Realising the potential means addressing the key challenges of content standardisation technical standards communication personalisation customer service training and education outlined in this report require collaboration and partnership between the public and private sectors across the global travel industry Nothing can be achieved in isolation Building a truly accessible travel market requires ambition and a different way of thinking The industry needs to move beyond seeing accessibility as solely about facilities but instead about every step in the customer journey It needs to step into the shoes of those with accessibility needs and truly understand what is needed to allow them to travel independently and with dignity By doing so it will be able to take a more holistic and comprehensive approach to addressing accessibility needs in every sphere customer service information personalisation and standardisation In order to make travel accessible for all in an efficient manner it is crucial to develop and implement global standards for accessibility in travel and tourism that are universally recognised The very nature of travel makes it imperative that standards apply internationally thus facilitating accessibility and seamlessness both at the origin during the journey and at the destination Even if global technology platforms and travel providers are increasingly facilitating accessible services e g by exploring the opportunities of voice recognition these efforts are fragmented and lack the commonality that global standards could bring The insight presented in this White Paper highlight that technology can and should be the enabler and facilitator of accessibility solutions Technology can improve information flows and develop more intuitive user interfaces and perhaps more importantly technology can empower the traveler with accessibility needs to travel independently and confidently Travel technology companies need to understand and define a strategy to adapt these mainstream services to their specific travel related needs and collaborate across the travel and tourism industry to develop the standards that will accelerate the world wide adoption of accessibility solutions Now is the time to act Now is the time to think differently Now is the time to ensure accessibility is central to product and service development and delivery The time is now for two reasons It is the right thing to do It makes good business sense What better incentive for the travel industry which at its core is dynamic ambitious and forward thinking We all share the desire to explore our world to see new places meet new people or be near what s important to us Travel builds economies broadens culture and creates connections between societies This is why it is crucial to remove barriers to travel and currently accessibility requirements present barriers so that the joy of travel can be experienced by all We are committed to playing our part by working with customers and partners to deploy technology to build better and more accessible journeys Alex Luzarraga Vice President Corporate Strategy Amadeus IT Group
