explore at any time of the year with a steady stream of skiers and snowboarders heading for the snowy flanked Alps in winter When can I book cheap flights to Geneva from London Geneva might be laden with the expensive trappings of a city full of diplomats and big business but it s still a good option for a budget getaway The cheapest time to travel from London to Geneva is September The city s

there Book your flights at least days ahead to secure the cheapest deals Arriving at London Gatwick airport Those London Geneva flights departing from Gatwick Airport LGW probably have the best

you with fares averaging CHF What to do when in Geneva There are plenty of things to see and do in Geneva such as enjoying the delights of a boat cruise on Lake Geneva exploring the wide variety of museums and devouring the infinite supply of chocolate from the many artisan chocolate shops All this is imbued with a quirkiness that is unique to Geneva like the watery drama of the Jet d Eau The Jet d Eau is Geneva s gigantic lake fountain that shoots up a sky high column of water metres into the air a soaring delight that you ll be able to enjoy from just about every vantage point in the

you dig beneath the surface of Italy s very own northern powerhouse the more you ll find that Milan provides more than just the typical clich s With the eclectic Gothic spires of the spectacular Duomo the fantastic boutiques of the Quadrilatero d Oro the diverse array of backstreet flea markets and the fantastic caf s dotted around Milan this city has plenty to suit all tastes When can I book cheap flights to Milan from London With so many things competing for your cash in Milan you d do well to save a few pounds on your flights One tried and tested option is to leave booking your London to Milan flights until months before you go You should also avoid the hot summer months of July and August and the sparkling light decked rush before Christmas as this is when tickets are at their most expensive Instead thinking about booking your London to Milan getaway in the calmer cooler days of October and November Make sure to book your tickets for early morning departures as this is when tickets are usually cheapest Arriving at London Gatwick airport and Stanstead airport The cheapest London Milan flights leave from Gatwick LGW or Stansted STN Gatwick is just minutes south of Central London and you can easily get take a bus train or taxi to Gatwick s South Terminal from the city If you re flying out of Stansted there are plenty of direct rail connections from London Liverpool Street to the airport Flying from London to Milan London Milan flights generally take about two hours with most airlines offering a non stop service Ryanair flies out of Stansted and into both Malpensa MXP and Linate LIN airports easyJet on the other hand flies out of Gatwick and into Malpensa Airport If you want to travel in style think about booking with national carrier British Airways

which uses Terminal The Malpensa Shuttle bus picks up directly outside Terminal and costs about GBP to get downtown The Malpensa Express train is next to Terminal and costs about GBP one way A taxi to take you all the way to Milan will cost you a flat fee of about GBP What to do when in Milan Once you ve arrived in Milan it s tempting to make a beeline for the famed Quadrilatero d Oro reputed worldwide for its upmarket fashion boutiques The delectable eye candy of designer shoes bags and frocks along the Via Dante might even distract you from the astonishing splendor of the spectacular Duomo nearby But as night falls make sure to head to Teatro alla Scalla for sublime operatic performances and arias Map Zambala Luxury Residence out of Wed Jan Wed Jan London City Linate per person

of creativity and culture just look for flights from London to Berlin Berlin is a buzzing city and is just a two hour flight away from London Aside from its Cold War history this city has something for everyone Swirl and twirl your way through the weekend at the many dance venues such as the legendary Berghain lose yourself in the years of visionary artworks at Museum Island or maybe even find a nice place to relax in the sprawling Tiergartens When can I book cheap flights to Berlin from London This route is pretty affordable all year round but your best chance for savings on London to Berlin flights is to embrace the cold and look for winter travel deals especially between November and January December s winter wonderland vibe might bring a gleeful smile to your face but is also the most expensive time to visit Visiting between June and September is expensive too but serves up plenty of summertime sizzle including salsa dancing at Monbijou Park Don t forget to bring a brolly though as it may rain in July and August Arriving at London Stansted Airport If you ve already found cheap London Berlin flights you re probably flying out of Stansted Airport STN conveniently located just off the M There are plenty of coach and bus services to this airport with National Express offering hour service Take the Stansted Express train from Liverpool Street and you ll arrive right beneath the airport terminal in just minutes Flying from London to Berlin At around one hour and minutes you ll spend more time in the airport than on your journey from London to Berlin Wallet friendly Ryanair and easyJet fly the miles from Stansted and Luton LTN respectively arriving at Sch nefeld Airport SXF But if you re taking advantage of the British Airways frequent flyer programme then the larger Berlin Tegel Airport TXL will be your landing pad Getting from the airport to Berlin Tegel Airport is five miles from the city centre and is Berlin s main international airport Buses from here will zip you into Berlin in no time at all Note however that Tegel will close once Berlin Brandenburg Airport BER opens around Sch nefeld Airport s railway station is a minute walk away and the express train will get you into the city centre for GBP For the same price the S Bahn will also do the trick and is handy for destinations around Berlin If you prefer taking the bus hop onto the X or N to Rudow and then switch onto the U metro line What to do when in Berlin Eclectic and electric Berlin will leave you bowled over The hushed tones of the nave of Berlin Cathedral will first soothe you before it wows you with its amazing views from atop its domed towers The lazy days of summer will have you enjoying a picnic in the park and taking a long walk along the River Spree Alternatively you could have a few pints at a Tiergarten biergarten Schloss Charlottenburg evokes visions of royal splendour while the Berlin Wall offers gritty visual treats and stunning graffiti Don t forget to try the culinary delights of currywurst and pfannkuchen doughnuts Map Swissotel Berlin am Kurfuerstendamm out of Thu Jan Mon Jan Gatwick Schoenefeld per person NH Berlin Kurf rstendamm out of Thu Jan Mon

and Asia and as such it features elements of both Western and Asian cultures Book cheap flights to Turkey using ebookers and you can save on flights hotels and car rental The Cities of Turkey Turkey boasts seven cities with populations over one million Istanbul is the largest and it is often incorrectly regarded as the capital of Turkey Istanbul stands on the threshold of Europe and Asia and the former capital of the Byzantine Empire is well connected to both continents Ankara is the actual capital and it lies in the centre of Turkey It used to be called Angora and it is where Angora wool originated Izmir is on the west coast of Turkey and it is a major port Bursa a major car manufacturing area is just below Istanbul The other three cities are Adana which is in the south Gaziantep located miles from the Syrian border and Konya situated in the south of Central Anatolia If you need to book a flight to a hotel in any of these Turkish cities you can save money with ebookers The Sights of Turkey Turkey has been populated for thousands of years and its dry climate and status as a major civilization mean it has withstood everything from Mongol hoards to Crusaders The Byzantine Empire left its mark in Istanbul which was originally called Constantinople after Emperor Constantine Examples include the Hagia Sofia the Hippodrome the Topkapi Palace and Julian s Cistern Moving to Central Anatolia the G reme Open Air Museum is a huge monastic complex that is well worth the drive It is notable enough to be a World Heritage Site Approximately miles south of anakkale on the west coast of Turkey you will find the legendary site of Troy Another major archaeological site lies an hour south of Izmir near the town of Sel uk A minor noble looking for a bit of notoriety torched the former city of Ephesus and the classical style ruins are now available for tours Another site to visit is Safranbolu where you can see a collection of old Ottoman houses The Beaches of Turkey Turkey is a popular destination thanks to its beaches and sun Most of the good beaches are associated with major hotels and resorts and these beaches are often kept clean and tidy You may have to pay or stay at certain hotels to use these beaches but the price is often worth it because the public beaches are not always as clean You can find great flight and resort packages when you use ebookers to plan your trip to Turkey Getting Around Turkey As with many countries cars provide the easiest way to get around You can arrange for a rental car through ebookers and it can even be ready for you upon your

famous Opera House that looks out over the glorious harbour If it s fun you re after then a London to Sydney getaway is perfect for you When can I book cheap flights to London from Sydney The cheapest months to look out for London to Sydney flights are when the southern hemisphere spring hits in particular between September and November You ll better your chances of grabbing a great airfare deal by booking seven weeks in advance Tuesday evenings are also curiously much cheaper than the rest of the week December to February is when the summer really kicks in but so inevitably do the higher ticket prices Arriving at Stansted airport Many airports around London connect to Sydney but low cost specialist Stansted STN usually stands out as the cheapest for London Sydney flights Although it s nearly miles from central London the Greater Anglia train from London to Stansted is a great way to get to the airport Alternatively you can travel by car to the airport exiting at Junction A off the M motorway Flying from London to Sydney Make sure you have plenty of good books to read for this mile plus journey across the globe as it normally takes a full day to get to the east Oz coast taking into account stops along the way Also be prepared for a bit of jetlag Sydney is hours ahead of UK time To find cheap London to Sydney flights look first to Malaysia Airlines But if you fancy travelling in luxury China Southern and Qatar also offer fantastic prices if you book in advance Getting from the airport to Sydney Most international arrivals come into this city at Terminal of Sydney International Airport SYD Located just six miles from the city centre you can easily hop into a taxi and be in downtown in about minutes Most taxis charge about GBP The Airport Link train service will get you to downtown faster in minutes and is located at the northern end of Terminal If you fancy travelling on the bus then the Bus is also available to whisk you into the city centre What to do when in Sydney The captivating capital of New South Wales has an ambition that s left it with an abundance of world class delights including the Sydney Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge But of course there s plenty more places to explore around this fabulous city Embrace the rough edged working class charm of The Rocks or share thrills and spills with the locals at the beloved Luna Park But if it s the beach that you re after head out to famous Bondi Beach to enjoy a spot of surfing or sunbathing Map ibis Sydney World Square out of Mon Jan Sat Jan Heathrow Kingsford Smith

this Europe s premier banking city with both the Bundesbank and the European Central Bank sprawling their glass fronted towers here But this modern German city has a curious charm of its own There are fragments of old Frankfurt still clinging on in unlikely places in particular its ballet houses whose dancers can whisk you on flights of fancy There s plenty to see and do on a London to Frankfurt trip When can I book cheap flights to Frankfurt from London To make the most of this massive city and hear its ringing clash of modern and old you ll want make sure you haven t overpaid on your airfare Look to the season s flank months of mid May and November and think about travelling on a Wednesday or Thursday morning Arriving at Stansted airport London s budget carrier standby Stansted STN is the lowest cost place to fly to Frankfurt from even if it s miles to the north The fastest direct train to the airport is the Stansted Express which leaves Liverpool Street every minutes If you

GBP A taxi into the city centre on the other hand costs about GBP and takes minutes What to do when in Frankfurt There are some obvious things to do in Frankfurt and some less so A visit to the Gothic fronted R merplatz is one that has to be done even if it s just for the thrill of seeing a slice of medieval Germany standing up to the bullying mirror shaded tower blocks all around The Museum of Modern Art is a bizarre shaped work of art in itself and will have you as intrigued on the outside as you are artistically challenged within Then there are the curveballs A visit to the Struwwelpeter Museum will introduce you to Shockheaded Peter a nightmarish figure in the German psyche that you might want to wish away Alternatively you can stroll onto the Eiserner Steg Frankfurt s stalwart

the best time for cheap flights to Johannesburg from London Summer falls between October and April in sunny South Africa although winters too are mild and sunny thanks to the city s high elevation In terms of weather you ll be spoilt for choice Increased demand for flights during the popular UK holiday months of July and August brings price hikes so if you re planning to travel at this time you ll need to book at least month in advance to find the best deals Christmas is also a favourite time for family get togethers so if you are able to delay your reunion until mid January after the seasonal rush has abated you ll benefit from more competitive prices All the gen on London to Johannesburg flights Virgin Atlantic South African Airways and British Airways all complete the mile journey south from London Heathrow to Johannesburg in an average flight time of hours The convenience of non stop flights is offset by higher fares so if you re watching your budget it s worth checking out the wide
