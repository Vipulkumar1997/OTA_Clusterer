TRAVEL PROTECTION
Olivia recommends that you purchase a travel protection plan to help protect you and your trip investment against the unexpected. Travel protection helps provide coverage for Trip Cancellation/Trip Interruption, Emergency Medical Expenses and Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation, Trip Delay, Baggage Delay and more. To be eligible for the waiver of Pre-Existing Conditions Exclusion, purchase the plan within 15 days of your initial trip deposit.


For a travel protection plan quote, more information or to purchase a protection plan, please call Olivia at 800-631-6277 and select option 1 for a travel consultant.
