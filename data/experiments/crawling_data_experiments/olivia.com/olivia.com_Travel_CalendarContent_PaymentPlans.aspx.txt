Olivia Travel Payment Plans

Take Your Dream Vacation!

Olivia wants every lesbian to have the opportunity to experience her dream vacation with us! With this in mind, we offer you the following convenient payment plan options!


Three convenient ways to pay:


1. Pay in 60 days
Pay your initial deposit of $250 per person (for our Cruises, Resorts and Tours) or $500 per person (for Riverboats, Adventures and Selected* Cruises and Resorts) and then pay the remainder of your balance in 60 days. There’s no service charge for this option. Please note: Your balance must be paid in full 60 days before your trip, so this option is not available if your trip is within 60 days.


2. Four Equal Payments
Spread total equally over four consecutive months (first installment at booking). No additional service charge. Please note: Your balance must be paid in full 60 days before your trip, so this option might not be available if your trip is within 6 months of booking.


3. Monthly Payments

After your initial deposit of $250 per person (for our Cruises, Resorts and Tours) or $500 per person (for Riverboats, Adventures and Selected* Cruises and Resorts), you will pay monthly installments. The amount of your monthly payment will depend on how far in the future your trip is; for example, if it’s 12 months away, you’ll have 10 payments. Your trip must be paid off 60 days before the trip departs. The payment plan fee is $10 per person per month. There is no penalty for paying your trip off early.
