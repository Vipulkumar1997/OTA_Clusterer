Travel Solo With Olivia

With hundreds of solos on each of our cruise and resort vacations, you have endless opportunities to make new friends and maybe even meet that special someone. Our Solos Program, staffed by our very own Olivia Solos Coordinators, offers a wide array of activities—from dances and mixers to sunset cruises and pool games, allowing you to meet and mingle throughout the week. There’s special solo seating at meals and shows. Plus, Olivia will even arrange a room-share for you, making your vacation even more affordable. And, you don’t have to be “single” to participate in our program – single or just traveling solo – there’s something for everyone.
BEFORE YOUR TRIP
Meet other solo and single travelers who will be on your trip by visiting your trip group on
Olivia Connect
. It’s a great place to make friends and get travel advice!
ARRIVING
You’ll have an opportunity to meet your Solos Coordinator(s) as you arrive at the port terminal to board the ship or once you arrive at the resort. Pick up your Solos Week-at-a-Glance schedule (a preview of the Solos activities for the week), your Olivia solos tag (a cute dog tag necklace that simply says “Olivia” and that allows those in the Solos Program to find each other easily). Wear it if you want, or tuck it away it as a souvenir of your trip.
ONBOARD OR AT THE RESORT
We’ve got a full line up of fun for you!


Mixers, evening social hours and activities like Wet-n-Wacky Pool Games, dance lessons, and Club O Olympics abound!

Specially-designated Solos Excursions – We let you know in advance which excursions have been selected with our solos in mind! It’s a great way to spend the day exploring and getting to know other single and solo travelers.

Special seating for all meals – Dine at our Solos Dine Around tables and you’ll be sure to have a great meal and wonderful company!

Special solos show seating so you can enjoy the evening entertainment together.

Your Solos Coordinator is there to make sure you have the best Olivia experience


DO AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE AS YOU LIKE
We make it easy to make friends, so you’ll never have to be alone unless you want to be. Do as little or as much as you like!
