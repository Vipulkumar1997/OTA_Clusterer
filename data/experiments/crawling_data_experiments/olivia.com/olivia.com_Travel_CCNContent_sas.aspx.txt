SISTERS AT SEA and SISTERS AT PLAY

Sisters at Sea (on cruises) and Sisters at Play (at resorts) are great ways to enjoy the diversity of an Olivia trip! We welcome all women of color and their friends to participate in special activities, mixers and excursions. From our fantastic women of color entertainers, to onboard film festivals and casual get-togethers, our Sisters programs are designed to celebrate the beauty and diversity of our community. Come meet our Sisters Coordinators, make some new friends, and have the time of your life!

Give us a call and mention the Sisters group and you’ll enjoy a $100 per person discount on select trips!
Some restrictions apply, so call us at (800) 631-6277 for details.
