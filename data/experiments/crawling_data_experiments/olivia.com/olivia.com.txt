We bring women together…on vacation!

Whether you want to enjoy the relaxed vibe of an all-inclusive resort, sail the
    seven seas on a cruise with hundreds of lesbians, or immerse yourself in the culture
    of a new destination, we have a vacation that’s sure to fit your style. The Olivia
    Experience is about women having fun together, making friends – and maybe even finding
    that special someone. With our world-class, just-for-you, entertainment; fabulous
    singles activities; incredible touring excursions; or even a touching commitment
    ceremony, you can be sure you’ll have a vacation experience you’ll never forget.

Each Olivia trip has its own special flavor:

Cruises



The Olivia Cruise Experience







We charter the entire ship, so it’s all women, all the time. On board, there are
        concerts and comedy shows, dancing, casino games, singles’ activities, and so much
        more! Relax by the pool or plan a shore excursion. Cruising is an amazing way to
        travel – your meals and accommodations are included. Unpack once and see the
        world!





Resorts



The Olivia Resort Experience







Welcome to all-inclusive fun, olivia-style, where we always buy out the entire resort!
        At our resorts you can enjoy comfortable accommodations just steps
        away from the beach, sun and sand. Alcohol, soft drinks, gourmet food and a wide
        array of activities are included, of course. Add unparalleled Olivia entertainment
        – and WOW – you’ve got an unforgettable vacation experience.





Riverboats








Riverboat cruising is Hot! Hot! Hot! It is also the very best way to truly immerse
                yourself into the heart of a destination. On a river cruise, you’ll experience everything
                up close and personal. Olivia chooses the best riverboats and customizes each itinerary.
                You’ll unpack just once and your fare covers most everything. Enjoy an included
                daily tour, all meals, and wine and soft drinks with dinner. Add to this, Olivia’s signature
                programming and nightly entertainment – and you’ve got an exciting, new vacation
                option to consider.



Adventures








Dreaming of an adventure that will take you off the beaten path? Eager to learn
                more about the world around you? Want to experience an African Safari in depth?
                Or snap photos of unique wildlife on an eco-tour adventure to the Galápagos Islands?
                Olivia’s more intimate Adventures are the ultimate escape! These trips include all
                meals, excursions and expert guides to educate you about the places you visit. Each
                year we offer a new and exciting calendar of unforgettable destinations and experiences
                from which to choose.








Travel solo with Olivia!

With hundreds of solos on each of our cruise and resort vacations, you have endless
            opportunities to make new friends – and maybe even meet that special someone. Our
            Solos Program, staffed by our very own Olivia Solos Coordinators, offers a wide
            array of activities – from dances and mixers to sunset cruises and pool games—allowing
            you to meet and mingle throughout your trip. There’s special solos seating at meals
            and shows. Plus, Olivia will arrange a room-share for you, making your vacation
            even more affordable! And, you don’t have to be single to participate in our program; whether you are single or just traveling solo, there’s something for everyone.
