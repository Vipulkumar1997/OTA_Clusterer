In the heart of America and at the geographic center of the 48 contiguous states are Holiday Retirement’s three Kansas independent senior living communities. The Sunflower State is largely farmland and wheat fields, yet is known for White Castle burgers, the beloved Kansas City Chiefs football and the Kansas City Royals baseball teams. From Topeka to Wichita, residents enjoy hot summers and mild winters.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
