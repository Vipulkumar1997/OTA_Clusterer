Volunteers

Holiday Retirement’s philosophy for resident enrichment is to provide life-enriching activities and events for residents and future residents that will benefit them in every aspect of living —
physically, intellectually, socially, emotionally, creatively, spiritually, and vocationally
.

In order to uphold our philosophy and enhance our residents’ experience, community teams are always looking for opportunities to develop a robust volunteer program to increase the activity choices we provide for them.

Here are a few examples of activities volunteers can become involved with:


Seasonal or Holiday Decorating

Beanbag Baseball Games

Book or Reminiscing Clubs

Bingo

Ice Cream Socials

Poetry Readings

Arts & Crafts

Bible Study

Garden Clubs


We hope you’ll join us for some volunteering fun.
Find a community near you
to discover the volunteer opportunities available.
