The Buckeye State is bordered by Lake Erie and Appalachian Country, offering diverse scenery for Holiday Retirement’s six Ohio communities for assisted living, Alzheimer’s and memory care and independent senior living. From Cincinnati to Toledo, residents support Ohio State University football and the Cleveland Cavaliers. The state features four diverse seasons and is home to the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. Social Security benefits are exempt from state taxes.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
