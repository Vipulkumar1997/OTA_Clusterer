Expand your horizons

It’s a proven truth: engaged seniors lead richer, more satisfying lives. So at Holiday Retirement, we’ve put together a comprehensive program of activities and events designed to stimulate the seven dimensions of wellness:

Layers of the Holiday Lifestyle





















Physical

Emotional

Spiritual

Intellectual

Creative

Social

Vocational






Beyond just games and puzzles, our activities are part of a holistic wellness approach you’ll only find at Holiday Retirement, designed to help seniors live more robust, fulfilling lives. Holiday provides unique opportunities you won't find anywhere else:



Seniors Serving Seniors and Society

Our award-winning volunteer program, Seniors Serving Seniors and Society helps residents get involved and make a difference. Holiday residents volunteer for worthy causes like teaching children to read, helping animals, supporting our troops, or anything they feel passionate about.
Learn what it's all about.

Let's Talk Seniors®

Our senior residents are lifelong learners. Holiday Retirement extends the chance for residents to expand their horizons and attend seminars and talks on subjects relevant to seniors. We also welcome the local community to participate.
View common Let's Talk Seniors® topics and learn how to RSVP.

Adventure Travel

Holiday Retirement's seniors are always up for adventure, whether they are touring the U.S. using Holiday Retirement's innovative Travel Program or participating from the comfort of their community. The
Adventure Travel program
takes seniors on an intellectual (and gastronomical) adventure around the world.
Call a Holiday community today to learn more.

It's your retirement

The best part is, residents are free to choose how much they wish to participate. It’s your retirement, after all, and you have the freedom to focus on what’s most important to you.
