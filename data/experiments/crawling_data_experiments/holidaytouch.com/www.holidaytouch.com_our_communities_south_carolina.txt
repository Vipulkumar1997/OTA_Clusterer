Located near Civil War monuments and Atlantic beaches, Holiday Retirement’s seven South Carolina independent senior living communities are far from ordinary. Residents in Columbia and Greensville are treated to Southern barbecue, stately plantations and the “Golf Capital of the World” in Myrtle Beach. Notable attractions include Charleston’s Historic District, Fort Sumter and Patriots Point Naval & Maritime Museum. Residents enjoy warm summers and mild winters. For retirees, Social Security benefits are exempt from state taxes.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
