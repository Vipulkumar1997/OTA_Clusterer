Holiday Retirement’s seven Tennessee independent senior living communities are tucked in the Appalachian Mountains, offering vantage points along the Mississippi River and Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Known as the country music capitol, the state is home to the Grand Ole Opry, Elvis Presley’s Graceland and Vanderbilt University. Residents of Chattanooga, Knoxville and Nashville enjoy long hot summers and mild winters. Social Security benefits are exempt from state taxes.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
