Holiday's Commitment to Veterans







Holiday's Commitment to Veterans

Veterans are a major part of the rich fabric of Holiday Retirement communities, and we are proud that thousands of veterans throughout the United States call us home. Our veterans’ retirement communities provide veterans with much more than simply a comfortable place to live. We offer an affordable, relaxing, and enjoyable independent senior lifestyle befitting these brave men and women.

Our commitment to veterans extends from hosting numerous veterans’ events, honoring our veteran residents with distinguished Walls of Honor, and participating as a National Founding Partner in the Veterans History Project. We are extremely grateful for all veterans and the service and sacrifice they provide for our country. Learn more about our veterans’ retirement communities and special offerings for veterans below…







Veteran Profiles and Spotlights

We are proud of the many veterans who choose to call a Holiday Retirement senior living community home. Here, we spotlight several of our residents and their military service.







Walls of Honor



Every Holiday Retirement community honors its veterans with a Wall of Honor. These walls include the veteran’s name, as well as a photo displayed in a prominent place in the community. See our veterans and their walls here!






Veterans History Project

Veterans will find that Holiday Retirement is different from other veterans’ retirement housing providers. Not only do we provide an exceptional lifestyle, but we are also dedicated to celebrating veterans and supporting important veteran-related causes.
