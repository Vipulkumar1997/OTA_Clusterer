Holiday Retirement’s 14 Oregon independent senior living communities are surrounded by beauty near Mt. Hood, Crater Lake and the Oregon Coast. Residents in Salem and Portland enjoy college football, the Portland Trail Blazers basketball and Portland Timbers soccer. Major attractions include the Columbia River Gorge, the Oregon Zoo, Powell's Books and a thriving restaurant scene. The weather is mild, and produces lush rose gardens and forests. Oregon has no state sales tax and Social Security benefits are exempt from state taxes.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
