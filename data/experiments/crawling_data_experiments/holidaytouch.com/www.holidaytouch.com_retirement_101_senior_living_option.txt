Senior Living Options







Senior Living Options



You’ve probably heard all the terms — “Independent Retirement Living”, “Assisted Living”, “Nursing Home” — but you might not be completely clear about what, exactly, they mean or how they differ from each other. Below are descriptions of the different lifestyle and care options available to seniors to help you determine which one is right for you, or your loved one, and your family.

Independent Retirement Living

Independent Retirement Living is a concept pioneered by Holiday Retirement in 1971. Our founders saw an opportunity to provide seniors with an alternative to conventional retirement living options. Independent Retirement Living communities feature apartment or condominium living for seniors who do not require specialized care, although Home Care is often available. Typically, these communities offer weekly housekeeping, three meals a day, local transportation and regularly scheduled social activities for an all-inclusive, monthly rental fee.

Assisted Living

Assisted Living communities provide 24-hour assistance based on individual needs, including daily activities such as bathing, dressing, housekeeping, meals and medication.

CCRC (Continuing Care Retirement Communities)

CCRCs offer multiple levels of care in one location, ranging from Independent Retirement Living to Assisted Living and Nursing Home services. Admittance into advanced care programs may be restricted to residents from within the CCRC’s Independent Living component. CCRCs often require a buy-in fee and a long-term contract.

Alzheimer’s/Memory Care

Alzheimer’s/Memory Care facilities offer specialized care and programs for individuals suffering from Alzheimer’s disease or other memory loss. They provide a safe and physically secured environment and may operate as a stand-alone facility or part of an Assisted Living community.

Respite

Respite care is a short-term stay within an Assisted Living facility or Nursing Home that allows primary caregivers a break or gives the resident a trial stay to get acquainted with the service provider.

Nursing Homes

Nursing Homes provide 24-hour skilled care for seniors on a long-term basis. Care may also be provided for seniors who require short-term nursing care or rehabilitation assistance.

Hospice care

Hospice care is designed for terminally ill individuals in the final phase of their illness. Care may be provided in a range of settings including private home, hospice facility or nursing home.

Home Care

Home Care allows seniors to receive in-home assistance based on frequency and level of need, and may include daily activities such as bathing, dressing, housekeeping, meals and medication. Home Care is available for private home and
Independent Retirement Living
but may be restricted in facilities providing higher levels of care. At Holiday Retirement, Home Care is available through outside agencies, many of whom have an office right on site. Our Community Managers can provide all the details.
