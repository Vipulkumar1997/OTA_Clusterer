Bound by the Great Lakes, Holiday Retirement’s 10 Michigan independent senior living communities enjoy an abundance of natural beauty at the Sleeping Bear Dunes and car-free Mackinac Island. From Detroit to Grand Rapids, residents experience four unique seasons. The state is known for farming, its rich auto industry culture and craft breweries. Residents cheer on college football at the University of Michigan, and professional sports teams like the Detroit Pistons and Detroit Lions.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
