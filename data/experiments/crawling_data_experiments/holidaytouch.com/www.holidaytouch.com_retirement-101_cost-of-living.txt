Holiday Monthly Expenses







When it comes to retirement communities, there's a lot to consider. Budgeting and stretching retirement income are primary concerns for most seniors and their families.

We've developed this handy calculator to help you, or a loved one, compare the cost of living at home to the potential savings of an all-inclusive lifestyle at a Holiday Retirement community.  You can conduct a simple comparison in minutes by inputting your current monthly expenses.

Let's get started and see what moving to a Holiday Retirement community can mean to your pocketbook!

One of the most commonly asked questions is how the cost of living at a Holiday Retirement community compares to the cost of maintaining a home and everyday living expenses.

To conduct this senior living cost comparison, we’ll collect general information regarding your current monthly expenses including housing, utilities, food, entertainment and more.

Since the cost of senior housing rents varies across the country, the first step is to choose your preferred location.
