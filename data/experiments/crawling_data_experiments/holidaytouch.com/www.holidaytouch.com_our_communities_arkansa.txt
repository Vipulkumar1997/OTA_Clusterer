The Natural State is wondrous to behold, with sprawling mountain ranges, The Ozark National Forest and Mississippi River tributaries surrounding Holiday Retirement’s five Arkansas independent senior living communities. With locations in Little Rock and Fort Smith, our communities will wow you with beauty. The state is a source of natural diamonds and hot springs. Residents experience mild seasons where it's vacation weather all year.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
