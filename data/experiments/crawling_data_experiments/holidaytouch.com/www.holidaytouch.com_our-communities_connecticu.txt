The Nutmeg State is home to Holiday Retirement’s four Connecticut independent senior living communities. From Hartford to New Haven, the New England landscape offers rolling hills, farmland and charming coastal cities. Home to Yale University and the Mark Twain House Museum, the Connecticut plains are renowned for maritime seaports, whale-watching tours, fresh lobster and clam chowder. Residents enjoy warm summers, beautiful fall foliage and white winters.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
