Discover small-town charm in Holiday Retirement’s two New Hampshire independent senior living communities. Our communities in Dover and Derry are near the big city of Boston, yet surrounded by New England wilderness. The Granite State is known for ski resorts atop Loon Mountain, the gorgeous Lakes Region like Lake Winnipesaukee and breathtaking fall foliage. From white winters to lush green summers, residents enjoy four seasons and no state sales tax.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
