Holiday Retirement’s five Iowa independent senior living communities are located in what's long been considered the heartland, known for its farming, the Field of Dreams and John Wayne. From Des Moines, to Waterloo, to Iowa City, our communities are never far from the Iowa State Capitol, National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium, the Iowa State Fair or fall foliage along the bridges of Madison County. Residents enjoy diverse and beautiful seasons.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
