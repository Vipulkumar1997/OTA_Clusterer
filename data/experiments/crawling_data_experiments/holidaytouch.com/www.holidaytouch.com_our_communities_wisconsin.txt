Holiday Retirement’s three Wisconsin independent senior living communities are in “America’s Dairyland.” The midwestern state is surrounded by two Great Lakes and vast forest and farmland. Residents in Madison and Milwaukee enjoy four unique seasons, and are die-hard Green Bay Packers and University of Wisconsin-Madison football fans. Notable attractions include the Harley-Davidson Museum, the Circus World Museum and the Wisconsin State Capitol.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
