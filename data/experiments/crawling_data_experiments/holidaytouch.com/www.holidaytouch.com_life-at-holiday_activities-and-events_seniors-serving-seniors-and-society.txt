Seniors Serving Seniors and Society

Don’t just live with us, serve with us!

Seniors Serving Seniors and Seniors Serving Society (SSS) is an international award-winning volunteer program developed by Holiday Retirement. The purpose is to engage residents by providing opportunities to enrich the lives of others and enhance the purpose and passion in their own lives. Studies have shown that senior volunteers enjoy a better quality of life than the average non-volunteering senior.

Residents have the opportunity to get involved in several worthy causes, such as:


Teaching children to read

Fundraising to help animals

Supporting our veterans and troops overseas


Organizations that Holiday Retirement communities love to support include:


The American Red Cross

The American Cancer Society

Habitat for Humanity

March of Dimes

Local food banks, schools, police and fire departments, and senior centers.


Holiday Retirement has joined forces with the American Red Cross during natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Haiti earthquake relief efforts.

The Seniors Serving Seniors/Seniors Serving Society (SSS) program was named “Most Innovative” program in 2007 by the International Council on Active Aging (ICAA).
