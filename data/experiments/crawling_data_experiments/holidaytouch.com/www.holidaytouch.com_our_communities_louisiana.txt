Dixieland is home to Holiday Retirement’s three Louisiana independent senior living communities. French and Creole influence is prominent, especially in Baton Rouge and New Orleans’ French Quarter, where you can hear jazz and enjoy Gulf of Mexico crawfish. Residents relish in long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The Pelican State offers a bayou full of tax breaks to retirees. Social Security, military, civil service and government pensions are exempt from state taxes.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
