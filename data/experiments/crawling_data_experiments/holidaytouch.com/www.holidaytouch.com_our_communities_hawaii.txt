Mahalo! Holiday Retirement provides two Hawaii independent and assisted senior living communities in the Central Pacific. Located on Oahu and Maui, residents are never far from the gorgeous views afforded by local beaches, national parks and stunning the Pearl Harbor WWII memorials. The Aloha State is best known for lei garlands, pineapples at The Dole Plantation, tiki and luau parties and surf beaches. The tropical climate of the Pacific Island is one of the best features.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
