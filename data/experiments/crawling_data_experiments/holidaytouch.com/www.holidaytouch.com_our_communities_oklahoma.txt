The Sooner State is home to Holiday Retirement’s three Oklahoma independent senior living communities and rich Native American culture. From Tulsa to Oklahoma City, the midwestern state’s national pastime is University of Oklahoma football. Regional attractions include U.S. Route 66, the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum, the Oklahoma City Zoo and the Philbrook Museum of Art. Residents enjoy hot summers and mild winters.

We understand that each individual is unique and that needs may change over time. Holiday Retirement's Independent Living communities do not provide any health care services. Residents are welcome to use outside home health care options that may enable them to continue enjoying life at our community.

Holiday's Assisted Living and Memory Care communities provide care based on individual resident needs and desires. Care levels are derived from a unique and personalized care plan assessment to create a customized care plan.
