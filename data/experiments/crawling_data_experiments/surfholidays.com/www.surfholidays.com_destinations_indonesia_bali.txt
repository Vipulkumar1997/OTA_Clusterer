Bali

Bali is Asia's surf capital. 30 years ago it was a sleepy village but it has become a surfers paradise for travellers from all over the world. Surfing Bali has it all, from fun Bali surf camps to high end luxury Bali surf resorts. People come to enjoy its beaches, year round warm climate and its close proximity to some of the most year round consistent surf on the planet.

The Balinese are Hindus and are renowned as some of the friendliest people on earth. Make sure to take time to immerse yourself in their culture and long standing traditions.

When to go on a Bali surfing holiday depends on how big you like your waves! It is a year round destination but the surf can vary depending on the swell and the time of year. April to November tend to have the bigger 3-12 feet swells and the rest of the year it ranges from 2-8 feet, but it is the vast range of surf spots that make this area true surfers paradise.

Bali is probably the best well known island in Indonesia. It's a dream surfing holiday destination for any surfer looking to score world class waves . The island has countless beaches, points, reefs and slabs for all abilities, plus it is a great base to explore the rest of Indonesia.

The surf is all at the southern end of the island. Surfing Bali will take you from the village of Canggu in the north west, down through the surf city that is Kuta, and on to the Bukit Peninsula in the southern tip, and then around up to Keramas on the north east.


Kuta
has become one of the biggest surf towns in the world. Every surf brand has a big shop here and the area is full of surf bars, cafe and late night clubs. It is definitely a party spot.
Seminyak
a few kms further north is home to some of the worlds best hotels and restuarants. Both areas face out onto the long sandy beach break ideal for beginners and intermediates.

If you want a more chilled out surf holiday then head to
Canggu
or Padang Padang on the Bukit Peninusla. There are still bars & restaurants of course but just not as "all night" as Kuta. You can still head into Kuta for a big night out of course.

Bali gets the full force of southern ocean swells direct from the antarctic with its south-west and south-east coasts being littered with surf spots. The dry winter months (June-Sept) tend to get the most consistent and bigger waves but the other months can be equally as good and are often less crowded.



For a surf holiday in Bali you must fly into Denpasar Airport, (Kuta) which can be reached from all major airports. Getting around in Bali is quite easy and motorbike rentals are common place for less than $8 a day. Driving conditions can be, let’s just say interesting.

From Europe and North America, the least expensive way to Bali may be a ticket to Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur or Singapore and a connection to Bali on a budget carrier such as Air Asia or Lion Air.



Bali benefits from an almost endless supply of Southern Ocean groundswell meaning you are very rarely disappointed. SW swells wrap around the
Bukit peninsula
creating an array of world class lefts including the infamous
Uluwatu
which is Bali's most consistent wave. It is for the more experienced surfers and it tends to section when it's smaller which does spread the crowds out by allowing take offs almost anywhere down the line. The wave is broken down into three sections, Inside corner, Racetracks and Outside corner.

Further down the Bukit peninsula you can find
Padang Padang
which is home to Bali's most desired barrel and a more chilled out Bali surf holidays place to stay than the busier Kuta. It is a beautiful white sandy beach with reef out back for the more advanced, while in front it is perfect for beginners.


Bingin
reef is a fun short tube wave, that can get crowded.


Dreamland
beach is next in line and is one of the more user friendly beaches on the Bukit. It runs from deep water and can often be a shore break where you need to avoid creasing your board or hitting one of the many tourists playing on the inside.


Balangan
is slightly more secluded with another perfect looking left point. It fires when the swell direction is big enough and coming from the right direction.

For beginners & intermediates there are many quality beach breaks around including the long beach break in the centre of Kuta and up to Legian. Further north west is
Canggu
which has a better mix of beginner, intermediate and advanced waves than the high performance waves on the Bukit Peninusla.

On the east side of the island you can find Nusa Dua, Sanur & further up
Keramus
. This side of Bali tends to work better in the Wet season (October to April).

Across from the Bali Peninsula is Grajagan or
G-Land
.  A much more remote spot than the rest of Bali, surrounded by thick jungle and wild animals. It is often referred to as the best wave in the world. A long very consistent wave with a variety of different sections. but mostly for experienced surfers.
