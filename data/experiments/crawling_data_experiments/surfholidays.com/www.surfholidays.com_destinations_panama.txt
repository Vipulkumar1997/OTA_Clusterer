History of surfing in Panama
Any surfer who's ever glanced at a map of Central America has no doubt admired Panama's curving, south-facing west coast. There are still some areas of Panama that can be surfed by yourself with just a bunch of your friends. Few people know about Panama's surfing potential, and it still remains off the radar for the majority of the surfing community, which is a big plus for surfers who come to stay in Panama surf camps.
There is very little information on how surfing in Panama first took off but there a few rumours that lend their own take, one being that it was during the 1960’s when US surfers were surfing in neighbouring Costa Rica and decided to explore to the east in search of new waves. The other theory is that foreign sailors who were using the
Panama Canal
would dock and explore the region with their boards, keeping the locals on the beach entertained with their surfing skills.
What’s the surf like in Panama?
Panama surf spots are some of the best surf breaks in all of Central America! Whether you like point breaks, beach breaks, hollow tubes, or long walls, Panama has a variety of breaks to accommodate everyone’s style and ability.
In regards to the  Panama surf season, the Pacific side is best in the months between
April and November
. Whilst the Caribbean side is best between
December and March,
and can get swells any time of the year but can experience flat spells between September and November.
Panama's roads are some of the best in Central and South America, with highways all over the country for quick access to the huge variety of surf breaks. The transportation system is very good, and buses and taxis are readily available from the international airport.
Where to surf in Panama
Carribbean Ocean side
Named surf spots: 15
1. Bocas del Toro
You’ll find some of the best Panama surf spots on Isla Bocas del Toro, from hollow beach breaks to long peeling walls; you can access Isla Bocas del Toro by land, boat ferry or aeroplane. The islands are known for their
exotic wildlife
which includes sloths, monkeys, red frogs and birds, as well as a host of fun filled activities such as snorkelling, kayaking, fishing, island tours, a unique waterfall spa, hiking trails that lead to secluded beaches and a two-hour zip line canopy for those wanting an adrenaline hit away from surfing! Bocas del Toro is home to some great Panama Surf camps. There are also a good selection of cafés, restaurants and bars that serve all kinds of local and European foods, with barbecued meat and fish being a speciality.
Some great waves can be found at the
Playa Bluff
but once it passes over head height, should only be surfed by those seeking the best advanced and intermediate surf Panama has to dish out. There are many waves that are a short boat taxi away which will be taken care of by our guides. At
Red Frog Beach
, you’ll find left and right walls breaking over sand and rock, offering the chance to practice your turns with some of the best beginner surf Panama has to offer, as well as some other unnamed waves near it.
This area is relatively unexplored and has been described as the
‘Galapagos of the 21st century’
so is the perfect destination to get away from modern world living and get back to nature.
2. Colón
There are many small islands around Colón which are the perfect place to snorkel, pretend you’re the only people alive and of course, surf in total paradise.Our favourites include the Isla Grande which has three peaks and neighbouring island Isla Mamei which has a left-hand point break that is best surfed by intermediate surfers.
The Colon / Porto Belo area has several spots worth mentioning that are
best surfed between December and March
. To get there from Panama City, you go down the new toll road highway Corredor Sur towards Colon City, then on to La Guayra where you catch the boats to Isla Grande, where you will find
Playa Maria Chiquita

great beach for beginners
with both lefts and rights making for a fantastic Panama surf camp experience.

3 .Panama City
Named surf spots: 6

4. Coronado & Playa Serena
Named surf spots: 14
The Pacific coast area near Panama City is much cleaner than the city breaks, and gets much better surf. They are located 1 hour drive west from Panama City, over the Bridge of the Americas. Playa Serena is located in the town of Coronado, and is a
great place for people new to the world of surfing
thanks to long right hand waves that are slow on take-off. This allows you enough time to get to your feet before walling up, enabling you to trim across the wave.
The town itself is great for shopping, letting loose in the vibrant night life and enjoying delicious food in beautiful surroundings.You’ll find great conditions for your Panama surf holiday in this area, such as
Frente de Teta, The Point, Rinconsito and Little Hawaii.

Cambutal, Playa Venao and Boca de Oria which can be great to learn to surf
, Panama has it all!

and offers the perfect respite from the trappings of modern life. Sit back and sip on a jugo de caña (sugarcane juice) in downtown's Parque de Cervantes, the heart of the city.

Panama Wetsuit and Weather Guide
Panama surfing holidays are pleasantly warm. The country enjoys temperatures that are fairly consistent all year round, with daytime temperatures reaching between 30-34°C and night time temperatures between 21-24°C.
May to November:
It’s hot and humid, with heavy rain downpours that subside after an hour or so during May to November, which is known as invierno.
December to April:
During verano, which is December to April, you will experience more comfortable conditions with lower humidity, and the early part of the year experiencing little to no rainfall. Boquete, Cerro Punta and El Valle can get a little chilly at night so pack a long sleeve top and trousers.
If you are planning to go into the highlands, pack a heavy rain-proof jacket as it is known to have torrential down pours for an hour or two late in the afternoon.
The water is warm in Panama all year round, it never drops below 27°C and can reach 29°C in some places, so board shorts are more than enough; a rash guard is always advisable, as well as a hat to wear in the water to offer some protection from the sun.
