About Us










Why Surfholidays.com?

We set up Surfholidays.com in 2009 to be a place where you can browse, search, get inspired by, and book the best accommodation and the best surf schools throughout the world’s top surf towns.

SurfHolidays.com







Our original team started out with an Irishman, a South African and a Spaniard. We now have 12 different nationalities in our team. As surfers we had been exploring the coastline of Europe for years and had become increasingly frustrated trying to discover unique places to stay near the surf. We also found it very difficult to get any feedback on reliable surf schools. That set us on our path and soon after Surfholidays.com was born.
We all worked in the surf industry prior to starting Surfholidays.com and have got to know some of the worlds’ best surf towns inside out. We have used our knowledge to establish a platform that allows people find unique places to stay with quality local surf instruction and to ultimately have the holiday of a lifetime surfing some of the best breaks in the world.
We hope you enjoy browsing our site and find your perfect surf destination.
