Really nice chilled accommodation with added extras. 3rd time to Lagos so knew most places and pretty nice as well as eating out at regular haunts of nah nah bah and trying steak on the stone. Also casa de prego had really good food too

3 days surfing, 2 days at Praia da Bordeira which is a stunning location. Group size was ok and good Instructors who were motivating and fun. Could have done a bit more coaching for intermediate surfers such as water safety and more technique.

The room was nothing special, as expected for the price but the place is smaller than expected which gives it a nice cozy atmosphere. really welcoming team and the hot tub and terrace are amazing! pool is very cold! breakfast was not brilliant, could do with some more high energy foods to fuel ahead of a days surfing but having the kitchen to make your own if needed was nice. the BBQ nights were amazing fun as well! great food and great people, thats all you need (beer and wine helps too)

How were the surf lessons?








Surf lessons were amazing fun! instructors were all really friendly, knowledgeable and keen to teach! they seemed to know which beaches were good to go to, we did have one bad day for waves but it didn't sound like anywhere was good that day.

Highly recommend the chilled atmosphere at casa offshore and their hot tub and BBQ night were particular highlights. Very impressed with the old town of Lagos which had plenty to see and do, the restaurant 'nah nah bah' was great also for burgers and not far from casa offshore

The surf teachers really added to the experience and we're all very friendly and welcoming. Cannot praise them enough.

The surf shack was very comfortable and relaxed. It had everything we needed and more - the hot tub was great! The people were all really friendly (guests and staff).

Lagos was a nice small town with enough bars, restaurants and things to do.

How were the surf lessons?








The instructors were really good - the upfront instruction was great. When you got some 121 tuition it was really helpful.
Alfama(?) beach was a bit dirty with all the touists and the dogs.

Accommodation at Casa Offshore is great! Beautiful location, close to town and some beautiful beaches but in a quiet location. The Casa is fabulous with a lovely pool and hot tub, everyone is lovely and friendly. Pizza on Tuesday and BBQ on Thursdays - don't miss out. Such a super stay - can't wait to go back.

How were the surf lessons?








Beaches were great. I'm a beginner and a rubbish surfer but instructors Rita and Eduardo were patient and knowledgeable so I kept trying, I had fun and I learned lots ... even if it doesnt look like it!!

Another fantastic stay in Casa Offshore! I love coming here for so many reasons and the guesthouse itself is one of them. The staff are great, the rooms are clean and the pool and jacuzzi are fantastic after an exhausting day of surfing! Also, its only a few mins walk to the centre of town, with lots of great restaurants and bars to choose from.

How were the surf lessons?








The surf lessons were great as well. We are brought to different beaches each day depending on the conditions. The instructors cover the technical stuff on the sand and then when we try put it into practice in the water, they are on hand with advice. Its always a lot of fun!

The staff are fantastic, really friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the shutters keep the room cool in the day. Hot tub and pool is just what you need after a day surfing. Accommodation is right next to local supermarket, and a short walk (10 min) to the main restaurants/shops.

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing instructors are very good. They watch you to find out what level you are at and give you the help you need to progress. The instructors were friendly and helpful, really relaxed atmosphere overall. Can't recommend highly enough. Beaches we went to were great.

Stayed in Casa Offshore in the main house. It was really an amazing week. The surfing lessons were really good and the people the house attracts are all friendly and fun people. This is most probably as a result of how happy and friendly the staff are, they really seem to love their job. Amazing weeeek!!!

Surf lessons were well thought out and gave you a lot of practice. Within 3 days I was out back :)

How did you like the accommodation?








The accommodation was great, really comfortable with plenty of space to hang out with others or spend time on your own. The pool and hot tub were popular spots for post surfing catch ups.

The food was great breakfasts catered for everyone (including coeliac) with additions of tasty pancakes some mornings and eggs other mornings. The lunches on surfing days were lovely with great filling options for roll fillings and biscuits or crisps. The kitchen was well kitted out for those who wanted to cook for themselves, the staff have compiled a list of good local restaurants which the reevaluate regularly. We sampled a few over the week and all were really good food and well staffed. The BBQ that was put on for those staying in Casa offshore was delicious and a really good fun night in the house! The pizza evening I would recommend too as the cob oven fired pizzas were delicious with proper Parmesan cheese for toppings and fresh salads.

The town centre was within easy strolling distance as was one of the beaches which was great for days when you are not surfing. There is a supermarket pretty much across the road from the house and there is also an atm there which is very useful! The town was lovely to potter around and dip into shops. Some great ice cream to be had too!!

How were the surf lessons with Extreme Algarve?








I went on this holiday as a beginner - I had surfed for about 1 hour prior to going on the holiday. I learnt loads over the week! Knowing the different types of waves, how to spot rips and what to do if you get caught in the rip, tips about how to correct common mistakes, how to turn on waves, how to safely wipe out. I have become more confident standing on the board and can now catch and stand one white waves most of the time, still working on the green waves.

Over the week I had four different instructors I thought all of them were great, they each have their own style but cover the same basics which means you get to hear things explained in different ways, a plus for me! The kept us safe over the week and ensured everyone was included in lunch time chats.

All the beaches we went to were beautiful and had waves that were good for our levels. There were bathrooms at all the beaches we went to and bars at them too for afterwards if people wanted to grab something for the trip home.

What an awesome holiday!!! it was brilliant. I had a great time (although my ribs still hurt from the battering I took!) everyone was really friendly (staff and guests) and there was a really good atmosphere and the instructors were great.  I would definitely go back. The only thing that would have made it better would be some photos, because I was on my own I didn't get a chance to get any of me up on the waves.

Best surf trip ever! The casa was awesome - Sharon, Pete and all instructors were so laid back and lovely.  The house itself was like I was like being at home and staying in the dorm with fellow solo girl travellers was great.
Recommending it to all and any that listen and if I get the numbers, I'm hoping to bring a group back with me.  Well worth the wait and an absolute gem of a surf spot.  They've got a good thing going with that house.

Had a great time in Lagos, thanks! Casa Offshore was class - everything absolutely spot on (food, rooms, location etc) no complaints whatsoever. Sharon and Pete were brilliant! Both incredibly nice and friendly as were the surf instructors.
Really glad I got the transfer with Pete - well worth the extra cash! Everything was lovely really, thought the town was good craic in the evening without being too jammed full of tourists. Going out wasn't that expensive either. Definitely would like to go back and will definitely be recommending you

I was crap at surfing but the lessons were still great fun and everything was well organised.

Casa Offshore was fantastic, I had a great week. The set up that Sharon and Pete have there is like a home away from home and the surf lessons/ equipment package all rolled into one was a huge bonus for me particularly.  All in all it was a great week, and I hope to return next year.

How did you like the accommodation?








Casa Offshore is perfect for everybody who travels alone, in a couple or with friends. It's not a huge hostel but therefore the stuff and the residents are very close. Everything that you need is there: a big kitchen, a relaxing living room, an amazing hottub (perfect after surfing), an ice cold pool and big and clean rooms. I couldn't add something negative!  The accommodation is located on the top of Lagos, so you need to walk like 10 min to beach and downtown. But therefore it is really quiet. A small supermarket is directly cross the road.

How were the surf lessons?








The Surf lessons were amazing. I took 5 days of lessons - unfortunatly in a row. But that was my fault; I didn't expect that it is so exhausting especially for your arms. I would recommend surfing for 2 days and then 1 day off, then 2 days.  The beaches (especially Arrifana) are amazing and perfect for beginners.

The Surf instructors are really good and helped me a lot. I didn't expect that you can learn surfing that fast!  The only thing that annoyed me (but that depends of the group): there were some students who didn't listen and follow the rules. So they always jumped in front of the others when they tried to catch a wave. Especially when we were a bigger group, that wasn't fun.

How did you like the accommodation?








The cosy house and friendly reception made me feel at home right away, the place felt fresh and it was well worth its price. Traveling alone can get lonely at times, but it was really easy to meet people - first during the lessons during the day, and later in the evenings in the pool area, tv-room or at shared dinners. The Casa is in a really quiet area, but only a short walk away from the busy nightlife on the old, narrow streets of the city. If I ever go back to Lagos, I will probably stay there again.

How were the surf lessons?








I only did two lessons and they were both in Arifana, about an hour's drive from the hostel. The beach was nice - long enough, not too crowded, and with a restaurant in one end. I had only surfed once before. That time I got up standing once, something I now accomplished in about 15 minutes. This was partly due to the waves being a bit lower and slower, but of course getting the right advice both before and during surfing helps... Lunch was served on the beach on top of a surf board. Sandwiches with different toppings, fruit and some kind of crackers I didn't try. It was good.

Casa Offshore was lovely. Our twin room was perfect for our needs! Loved the garden with sun loungers (when warm and sunny) and hot tub (when cool and cloudy). Nice mix of people - staff and guests very friendly and chilled, made us feel comfortable.
Good location for heading out to the surf beaches by day and into Lagos at night, nice walks to local sunbathing beach, rocky coastline and next town too. The surfing was so much fun - and the beaches we went to so beautiful (Zavial and Castelejo).
Absolutely loved the Hawaiian massage from Freddie :)Would definitely recommend this place and the people to others, and hope I will come back and have another surf holiday sometime, or at least pass through and say hello if I'm out in the Algarve / Alentejo area

How were the surf lessons?








Being taught / encouraged / laughed at by Marcel, Tom and Sebastian did actually result in me able to stand up and move forwards on a wave... (as well as swallowing most of the Atlantic Sea and being covered in random bruises!). Loved it!

How did you like the accommodation?








Firstly couldn't thank the staff of Casa Offshore enough. they were very welcoming, couldn't do enough for me and made the whole experience thoroughly enjoyable. The BBQ night is great fun and a real highlight for most guest I would have thought.

The accommodation was really cool; had the feeling of being at home however shared with other 'surfers' of all ages and nationalities. I had an all male dorm which was basic but clean and comfortable and more than enough when you have been out all day surfing. The breakfast was plentiful with cereals, cold meats and fruit. It was taken in a relaxing setting underneath a beautiful covered trellis. The pool area is a great spot to cool down and have a lounge after an exhausting time on the surf.

The town of Lagos is excellent. It has some amazing restaurants with top notch menus and extremely good value for money with 3 course meals and drinks no more than 20 EUR pp. The town centre still keeps it historic cultural feel and authentically Portuguese  There are plenty of bars that are full most nights, so not a sleepy town by any stretch of the imagination.

The main beach Meia Praia is right next to the town centre and is massive. Long sandy beach stretching about 4 miles at a guess. There are also other smaller beaches along the rugged coast and within walking distance and these all provide some form of watersports whether that be SUP, Surfing, Kayaking etc.

How were the surf lessons?








Had surf lessons four days in a row which I wouldn't advise as it was bloody tiring. The lessons in themselves were excellent. you get given everything wet suits etc, driven out to beaches you would never find and then have real good tutoring for about an hour. After that it is up to you to just keep getting up on the board and going for it. The instructors will be at the shore giving pointers but ultimately you have to just keep going at it. Was quite nice just seeing the instructors surfing themselves as it shows enjoyment and how it should be done which in turn I feel motivates the learner.

Casa Offshore was absolutely amazing to stay in. I stayed here for 11 days in June and loved every minute of it and did not want to leave. I was a bit nervous going on a surf holiday as it was my first time solo travelling but it was the best experience of my life.

All the staff are really friendly, so helpful and any question you have is answered. It was such a secure and safe house to stay in. I have made friends for life by staying here in casa Offshore. The pool and hot tub are amazing and there are lots of little garden areas that you can chill with a beer with after surfing in the evenings. Also we had the option of yoga on Mon and Wed evening also after surfing which was great.

Lagos itself is a fabulous little town with lots of restaurants to choose from in the evening. A group of us staying in the casa would try new places to eat every evening and the value for money is amazing. Everything is so so cheap!! Best restaurants were the blue door and the restaurant just around the corner from Casa (Cant remember the name but just ask, its a Portuguese restaurant but the portions are HUGE)!!! And of course I cant forget the best night of the week- BBQ night on Thursdays! Sebastian cooked the best BBQ and for €15 it is all you can eat and drink for the night! It is a great way to meet everyone staying in the house too.  The main beach is only a 15 minute walk away and a great place to go on your day off from surfing and the beach bar there has the best raspberry mojitos!!!

How were the surf lessons with Extreme Algarve?








Surfing lessons were brilliant. I had only surfed 3 times before going to Lagos and by my last day of surfing in Lagos I was standing every time and cannot wait to get surfing some more and go to the back waves!!! The instructors really took their time to show everyone what to do and gave individual feedback everyday to improve on what you were finding difficult. Neils, Eduardo and Sam (instructors) are so patient and such great fun to learn how to surf with. They split the group so beginners were on the front waves and intermediate got a chance to go to the back waves so they catered for all abilities.

The beach was amazing where we went surfing. Lunch was supplied every day that we went surfing and it was fabulous. The spread of food was outstanding and when I saw lunch was included I thought it would be thrown together but no way, it was the freshest lunch ever and the best rolls especially after a morning surfing!!! We had a choice of different meats, salads, sauces etc for the bread and biscuits, fresh fruit, water etc also.

Best experience of my life so far! I loved every minute of it and really didn't want to leave. I was travelling on my own and was a bit nervous, but that eased immediately as you're made to feel so welcome by the team as well as fellow travellers.

Accommodation was lovely with everything you'd need and more. Use of all the facilities in and around the house is included - the whole atmosphere was just totally chilled out and relaxed.

During my week, we had dinner out 4 nights, all of which were superb meals followed by excellent cocktails and dancing in various bars!  BBQ night at Casa was a fantastic evening too - fab food and so much laughter :)  I wandered the local area on my 'day off' and explored the town, marina and went on a boat trip. The whole area is beautiful and I would love to visit again and see more of the surroundings.

How were the surf lessons with Extreme Algarve?








Surf lessons were brilliant, very informative and the guys were really supportive and encouraging.
They picked up on areas where you needed help, genuinely wanted people to improve and were happy for you when you did!  The best piece of advice I was given was to 'chill out' - it worked wonders all round :)  The beaches were stunning and the instructors made sure we were at a suitable location each day to make the most of the surf. Lunch was supplied each day and was very welcome after a morning of surfing.
The tips I've learned have been used already and will continue to be as I try and improve back at home. Thank you!! :)

I stayed at Casa Offshore in Lagos. It was a very friendly and relaxed place. Decent rooms and facilities.   It was less of a party hostel full on revellers. Everyone there was not looking for full on party holiday. which was good for myself as I wanted to concentrate on the surfing and enjoying meeting all the different people.    The local town was really nice with many bars and restaurants.so every evening was good for going for food and drinks somewhere place new.

The surf school party of the holiday was very enjoyable. For a complete beginner it was a good experience to learn from scratch from decent instructors. With lots of patience in the learning approach. All instructors were great fun and made the surfing enjoyable.

Everything was just perfect! I love the town and the location of the surf-house.On the one hand it's outside the the center with lots of people in high season months, on the other - just 10 minutes and you are in the heart of the town with shops, restaurants, bars. The nearest beach is just 5 minutes walk from the Casa Offshore. But if you just want to chill out you can  stay at the pool which is in front of your doors and not far from the fridge to get the cold drinks and fruit. It's a wonderful place to come both solo and with family or friends. If you want to have awesome holidays - Casa Offshore is the best choice.

How were the surf lessons with Extreme Algarve?








The surf lessons are perfectly arranged, I love the staff and the way of coaching, when people with different level of surfing can get the best advice and enjoy time on the most beatiful beaches.

I had a fantastic holiday. I instantly felt welcome and as I was travelling by myself, this was a big bonus. The accommodation was immaculate and the house staff were brilliant with information and general chat!
I particularly enjoyed their BBQ night which brought everyone together.
Lagos itself was great with a wide choice of restaurants and again some great recommendations from Casa offshore on particularly good restaurants.
All in all I really couldn't fault my holiday from the efficient booking through your website/ company to the delivery at the other end. I would recommend it to any one and would definitely plan a return visit.

The surf lessons were also great and I was particularly pleased that the groups were divided into those with some experience and complete beginners. The instructors were really encouraging and always on hand for some helpful advice. I learned loads!

I had a great time in Lagos, it was sad when the day I had to leave arrived, even though I had been there for 2 weeks! Casa Offshore was a lovely place to stay, you were made to feel so welcome and the added benefits - pool, hottub, gardens etc made a big difference in making your time on arrival back from surfing more relaxing.
The first week I was there, there were several groups and the second week more solo travellers. I met some great people. The entire area was very nice and people so friendly. The beaches were all different and special in their own way and very picturesque and clean. I met some great people and Amanda and Lucy who I met there and myself are heading off on a surf trip to Devon this weekend!

I improved so much during the surf lessons, Rick and Marcel were amazing instructors. Rick with his drive of getting you to improve your technique ... until you get it right and Marcel with his enthusiasm to push you to do better ... and you do!

I had a fantastic holiday! Casa Off Shore was the perfect chill out house if you want to meet like minded people. It never felt overcrowded and there was always someone to chat to so if you're traveling solo it's never lonely.
Sebastian and Denise were Great hosts. Really welcoming and happy to help you when you needed advice or recommendations. Lagos was a great town to stay in with lots of super places to eat drink and socialise.
I would recommend this holiday to anyone who loves an active break in beautiful surroundings. Solo, travelling with friends or as a couple, you meet people constantly and I will definitely be returning at some point for more fun!

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing was great: REALLY hard work but so rewarding and the instructors rotated which I think is good as you were able to benefit from their different advice. The stronger you are the better with the surfing really but it doesn't matter.
Either way you work at your own pace and your strength builds quite quickly. I was a beginner and never felt out of depth. Sebastian and Marcell (I hope I spelled your name right) were particularly helpful and would spot when you needed advice. They gave good technical feedback which helped me a lot.

As for Lagos, the town was beautiful and we had some really nice dinners! I definitely recommend Nah Nah Bah bar for their burgers and the Garden for their BBQ meats! Had great pizza in Pizzolino as well!
Overall, we had a great trip and are already trying to plan another one out there for next year so you will be hearing from me again!

Definitely stop by  Onda Norte for dinner and try the Feijoada de Gamba, Picanha or Cod, they are all great and in one of the days staying I totally recommend skipping the Hostel breakfast and try Bora Café in town, it's really great.

How were the surf lessons?








Yeah, the lessons were great, I loved it. Specially Rita and Barks, I arrived on a level of starting to catch green wave still needing a push and left pretty confidence that I can take green wave on my own and even do turns, they helped me a lot with tips to improve and always checking what I was doing wrong or where I could improve but also told me all the things that I was doing right. It was pretty fun. I loved the beaches as well.

Accommodation was fabulous!  We stayed in a twin room, there was plenty of space in both the bedroom and bathroom, and the heaters came in handy as there were a few chillier evenings in April when we stayed here. It was my birthday the day we arrived and the girls had decorated the room with banners for when we got there, it was a lovely surprise and just an example of the friendly personal service by the team here. The hot tub and hammocks in the garden were brilliant (and definitely needed) after a long day surfing, and a great place to chill out. We didn't use the kitchen much as we went out to eat but breakfast and lunches that were provided were delicious and filling enough to keep us going all day.

Lagos town is only a short walk away and the guys at Casa Offshore gave us a map with loads of recommendations for places to eat and drink, each one we tried was amazing! The best food of our stay had to be the BBQ at the Casa, Michaela's food is amazing! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! I would definitely recommend a stay at Casa Offshore!

How were the surf lessons with Extreme Algarve?








Surf lessons were loads of fun, especially for a complete beginner like myself! The beaches were chosen in the morning depending on the conditions and the ability of the group. The beaches were chosen really well for nice uniform waves, and all the beaches we visited were clean and had loads of space for us. There was generally 4-8 people to an instructor and we had some time on the beach going over the basics then went out into the water. I was given plenty of extra help when needed without feeling any pressure to do anything too advanced.

Honestly, I couldn't fault any of it! Casa Offshore was fantastic, Seb, Michaela and Denise were lovely and and helpful, the house and surroundings were so relaxing, with just the right amount of party spirit! I was really nervous about going away on my own for the first time, but I had the best time.
The town and beaches were so gorgeous. At night it definitely comes alive! I have to say, I wasn't expecting it to be quite as much of a party destination, I thought it would be more sleepy taverna type places than all out 4am raucousness, but it's definitely the kind of town where you can do what you want to do, whether that's a quiet night or not.
Also - Seb's BBQ is the best BBQ I've ever had! I really enjoyed myself

The lessons were really good - the tutors weren't too overbearing, they let you get on with it and learn for yourself whilst feeding you tips and advice when needed.

Casa offshore was a brilliant holiday - still missing it! Sebastien and Co. were great hosts. Accommodation great - not done a sharing accommodation holiday but great for what it was - clean etc etc.
Good food nights arranged - BBQ and pizza night. Lunches and breakfast were relatively basic but definitely what I expected and enjoyable - I wouldn't expect anything more given the type of good fun, active holiday. Couldn't really criticise the holiday.
Only very very minor comment is the instructors could sometimes help target some of us wannabe surfers who aren't so outgoing at asking for feedback and help - they could be sometimes distracted by more outgoing members of the group. Having said that, if you don't ask for help you won't get it!

Casa Offshore was a great place to stay - clean, comfortable rooms and a great variety of chill-out spaces indoors and outdoors. There's a lovely pool area for lying out in the sunny evenings after a day's surfing, but as it was March, it was also lovely and cosy by the fire indoors when the sun went down and temperatures dropped.

It's in a great location on the edge of the old part of Lagos - close enough to walk to the hustle and bustle but quiet enough for a good night's sleep. There's a great guide book that they have compiled left in the sitting room which gives great tips on things to do in the area, places to eat, go out, etc. We tried a different one every night and were never disappointed!

The breakfast was great - perfect to set you up for a day's surfing. The owner's wife cooked up an amazing barbecue for all the guests one of the nights. If you're going in the van with the instructors for lessons/surf guiding, they set off around 9 every morning. Leaving at the same time every day is the only draw-back I found with the set-up when trying to get to breaks that are so dependent on changing tides, although it actually worked out  pretty well for the week I was there.

All the staff were so friendly, welcoming and helpful - I changed my booking last minute and they were very accommodating, they even organised live streaming of the six nations for me the evening I arrived! I arrived by train & taxi from Faro airport which was straightforward enough. However, for the return journey I used Hoppa which collected me from the door and cost the same amount but without the hassle.

How were the surf lessons?








The instructors were very good - encouraging and good at giving individual feedback. One of the instructors is a longboarder as well so was particularly helpful in helping me improve my technique for that. We surfed at a couple of different spots, all beach breaks, on both the West and South coast. All beautiful unspoiled beaches

My daughter and I booked in for 7 days holidays with 5 days surfing lessons.  The only thing we would have changed about our holiday would be that we would  have stayed for a second week.
We were collected from the airport and got a mini  tour of Lagos from Pete - great for getting our bearings. When we settled in we  realised that the photos on the website don't do Casa Offshore any justice, its  much more pretty and there was even a lemon tree outside our twin room. As we  chatted with Sebastian, Michaela and Sharon we felt like we had gone from home  to home.
Over the next few days we realised that this was only a taste of their  warmness and hospitality. I have never ever felt so chilled and enjoyed such a  unique holiday quite so much. Everyone at Casa Offshore goes totally out of  their way to make you enjoy every minute of your holiday.
Im still sore  from the laughing but the wonderful hot tub took care of the post surfing aches.  I had to put my daughter on the plane kicking and screaming and shes already  saving up for our next trip.

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing was simply  awsome and our surf coach Bret taught us much more than surfing. We learnt about  the breaks, the beaches, the lingo, safety in the water and we saw some of the  most beautiful beaches in the Algarve. My daughter was brave enough to paddle  out the back and I doubt that she will ever forget that big step.

Surfing wise then we all really enjoyed it. The lessons were exactly what you want, a little bit of a demo and practice first and then we just got to go out there and try it. Think we all picked it up pretty well, by end of 3rd day we were all standing up.

It was very early season so there  weren't many people on the beach which I really enjoyed.  I had a wonderful week  and hope to get back again, perhaps even at the end of this year.
The couple who run the place are great, lots  of fun and really outgoing. They put on two nights while I was there bbq and  movie night, which involved €10 a head, they provide all the food and drink -  well worth it and good fun!  10/10 for the whole experience! Thanks for the surf  holiday

They had a bbq on the first night which was cool as we got to meet everyone who was staying there.
We really loved Lagos itself as there were gorgeous little cafes/shops and windy streets to see during the day and then at night the place came alive for when we fancied going out.

How were the surf lessons?








We loved the lessons - although getting up in the morning was hard going :-)

The Casa was really chilled out- it was made much nicer by the fact that (on the whole) there weren't that many teens/early twenties there and the facilities were way better than expected (beautiful garden area to chill out in, massive kitchen for cooking and hot tub to wind down in!).
The breakfast was also pretty good - wholesome and filling which is just what
you need when surfing, and nice and healthy with fruit and the home grown figs were delicious :)
As for the town, I didn't see that much of it! But the restaurants were all pretty good and you can't really go wrong ordering fish out there.... And the bar scene was also really fun, everyone up for a good laugh and really friendly... And the town felt really safe in the evenings which is a good plus.

How were the surf lessons?








I thought the surfing was great - I thought the instructors gave just the right level of attention to everyone on the whole. Sometimes I could have done with a bit more attention so I could push myself a bit further, but for the initial learning stage they were brilliant and I was standing up by the first morning.

Overall the holiday was excellent. Accommodation was brilliant - very clean, well equipped and the staff were helpful. Lagos town was lively and I liked the old pedestrianised bits. The beaches were more interesting than your average beach.

How were the surf lessons?








The surf lessons were just right - not too much messing about out of the water and very practical instruction. Marcel and Lee, in particular, were brilliant.

We had a ball!!!! Best holiday ever and would find it very difficult to go back to a regular sun holiday.  The house was fabulous...so well put together and very comfortable.
Everyone was really friendly and we made great friends who will stay in touch with. The house was close to the town centre and there were loads of restaurants to choose from. We had some lovely dinners and some not so great but we made a night of it anyway.
Will definately go back there!

Had a great holiday - Lovely house, Seb and the crew were great, All in all we had a great trip. Actually would love to take another one before the end of the summer (surfing in Ireland just doesn't have the same appeal), but not sure that will actually happen! If it does, I'd definitely come back to you.

I have horrific wetsuit tan lines and bruises,but totally worth it. It was a fantastic week!!! The accommodation was perfect, the hosts were amazing, and took care of us so well. Sharon and Pete made sure we got there and back. They all organised a movie night and then a BBQ for one of the guys birthday.
All in all we felt like it was home from home. Lagos was a laugh, some great food and drink at really good prices. We met loads of people over the week and good company really added to the nights out!

How were the surf lessons?








The surf was perfect! Im still slightly awful, but I had loads of fun, Dan got on brilliantly. Marcel, the instructor, was fantastic and had loads of time for everybody. Lunch on the beach was so gooood.

Seb, Michaela, Sharon, Pete and the rest of the crew made me feel completely at home from the moment I arrived. Lagos is a beautiful town, lots to see, nice atmosphere (not too touristy); lots of inexpensive wonderful restaurants (Seb is great for recommendations) and plenty of bars ( also very reasonably priced...dangerous!)
One of the highlights was the weekly (I think) barbeque on Thursday night, where all the guests and many of the "Off Shore" family took full advantage of Seb and Pete's cooking skills. I can't wait until my next trip.

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing was awesome, though I have still to hit the 'green room out the back'...maybe next time! And all the instructors so friendly, helpful and good fun.

Lagos was amazing, we enjoyed it so much. Casa offshore is gorgeous, everything is kept very clean and well looked after. The crew at casa offshore were all awesome, they made the experience that much better and treated us all like family. It was lovely!
Lagos is a very nice town, its not too touristy. The only time you really see tourists is when your out in the bars at night. Unfortunately we didn't get to see too much of the town as we were too busy surfing!
There are some really nice restaurants around and incredibly cheap out there as well - we came back with half our holiday money left!

How were the surf lessons?








Surf was really good, we went to quite a few beaches.

How did you like the accommodation?








It was a great holiday. I can't praise the hospitality of Michaela and Seb enough - they are such a nice couple.  And of course Pete (oh his cooking!!) and Sharon are equally as nice.
The  best part was probably the chilli and movie night, and the BBQ. It really got the group together. Everyone in the house went out together for dinner most nights which was great - I'm not sure if that's the way it normally works out. There was a good mix of people staying in the house.
The breakfast was lovely. The BBQ! Had to be the nicest food I've ever had.
Overall, I couldn't fault the holiday from the start of the booking with yourself and your accommodation recommendation, promptness of replies, transfers , the accommodation itself and the surf lessons - all excellent. It was my first time trying a 'solo holiday' as such and I would highly recommend it to anyone else that was considering it

The house was in a great location and has good facilities. I loved that they had a BBQ night, I thought this was a great idea and you really got to know the people you were surfing with. I had a blast and would probably go back.
I thought Lagos town was really a lovely little town with all it cobble streets. I have been to the Algrave a few times but had never been there. Lagos really has a great selection of bars, clubs and restaurants, you definitely wouldn't be short of things to do there.

We had a ball in Lagos, really really nice house, central to everything. Sharon, Pete, Seb and Michaela could not have been nicer or done any more for us or for anyone else in the house, really chilled about everything and the BBQ we had one of the nights was immense!
Could not say anything bad about the other people who were in the house at the same time as us, a plan was made at the beginning to try and go out for dinner every night as a group so that the people who were travelling alone were never stuck for someone to go out with or something to do. Restaurants were gorgeous, beaches were lovely, place was clean and locals and workers were always friendly. Overall, this type of holiday, which neither of us had ever been on, was a great alternative to the usual sun break and we will definitely be doing it again

How were the surf lessons?








The surf was brilliant, got 5 days of great waves. Found the instructors Marcel, Trent and Seb to be the best kind of teachers...they only suggested changing a part of your technique when you had a good ride in which was always constructive, they never pointed out if you did something badly or messed up because you knew yourself you were after making a b**s of it!

Casa Offshore was a great place. The breakfast, hot tub and internet were all great extras. The bars and restaurants we went too were all pretty good value, some dodgy little bars along the way but it added to the fun really.
We travelled to Lagos by bus, it wasn't bad at all actually and we found our way from the airport no problem and then from the bus station in Lagos to Casa Offshore.

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing was great, perfect conditions most days, just a couple of mornings when the waves were a bit rough but nothing that stopped us.The instructors were great, we found the lessons really good.

Sebastian, Michaela and Sharron are all really really nice welcoming people and the instructors are all top guys too!! we also organised a trip wake-boarding while we were there which was cool too!
Loved the format of the stay - we were out eating drinking and having fun with all the other occupants everyday and night : :) Lagos is great, a nice mixture of old Portuguese architecture with a young lively atmosphere. Definitely a place to go if you want a sociable interactive holiday I would definitely go there again and may even be looking to arrange something again for next year but taking a few more friends along with me this time!!!!

We had a really brilliant stay in Casa Offshore. The owners Seb and wife were so so nice and really accommodating- for example one of the nights we wanted to stay in and they let us use their BBQ. They also let us their Kayak for like 10 euros in total. Seb took whoever people mountain biking with him most evenings too.
Anyway loved the place. Would recommend that house and place to anyone interested in this sort of trip...

How were the surf lessons?








Yhought it was so well organised with regards to the surfing. The 2 sessions down on the beach with the lunch break in between was so perfect. Really felt we got our moneys worth.

The BBQ night was cool the food Pete and Sebstian made was amazing and we had plenty of beers and Craic after. Lagos was a great town and we found loads of good bars and restaurants there.
A meal there was very cheap compared to back home and the food was always good.The weather was great. It was always sunny.  We'll definitely go back again when we get a chance

We had 5 days of surfing 3 of those days the waves were fantastic. Probably the first holiday we came back fitter than we left.

I really felt that it was like one big family for the week! We had a big barbeque on the Wednesday night it was gorgeous. Pete's salads alone called me for seconds ;)
I hope to go back and try some more water sports!! I'd recommend to any one solo, couples or groups to go to Casa Offshore!! It's been one of my best holidays and will never go back to just lying on the beach holiday again- activities all the way!!

How were the surf lessons?








I wasn't great at surfing but thoroughly enjoyed every moment! The instructors Marcel, Trent and Garreth and Sabastian where great and as I wouldn't be confident with my swimming skills I felt so comfortable in the water with them looking after us!

We went to three- one day we had the surf to ourselves, one day it was a little busy and one day it was very busy, although on the busy days there were nice waves predicted. Lagos is a nice town. The house holds a BBQ on a Wednesday and that was very good- all you can eat and drink for 15E. Food was amazing. Good banter had

It was a great holiday. Jacuzzi at Casa Offshore is just what you need after a hard day's surf. Lagos is a nice place though we mostly saw it at night of course. One place sticks in my mind - Michelin-recommended restaurant called 'Artisans', was absolutely beautiful and great value, had lunch their on our last day, they seem to have lunch and dinner specials. Definitely will be surfing again soon.

Surf Lessons often occur at the areas best and most reliable surf beaches,
Praia do Amado
and
Praia do Amoreira
, 20-30 minutes from Lagos. Depending on conditions you may surf at any number of surf beaches nearby such as Maia Praia, Castalejo, Arrifana, Zavial, Cabanas and Porto de Mos. Either way the surf schools will pick you up and take you to the best beaches on the day.

Don't worry if you have no experience whatsoever. The beginner's lessons are taught in waist deep water riding the white water only. You will learn everything from standing techniques to turning and finally paddling outside and learning how to catch ‘green' (unbroken) waves. If you are already experienced the instructors will take you further out and help you develop your technique on bigger waves.

Lagos is a
year round surf destination
thanks to its position at the corner of the Algarve. It is one of Europe’s
best kept secrets
and offers waves for beginners, intermediates and expert surfers. It also has the warmest water in Portugal and the winter temperature is warm enough for t-shirts. In the summer the temperature is in the late 20s and stay bright until 10pm.

Within Lagos is the town's long golden sandy beach that seems to go on forever,
Meia Praia
, a very safe beginners surf beach, but not always reliable.


Further Afield

Head further West and after 20 minutes you arrive at a crossroad, take the turn South West and after a few minutes you reach the laid back surf town of Sagres where you will find breaks such as  Tonel, Mareta, Beliche and Zavial. Again different standards are catered for in these beaches that wrap around Cape St.Vincent

Alternatively take the right turn and after 10 minutes you will reach a great beginners /intermediate surf beach Praia do Amado. Close by is one of Portugal’s most beautiful beaches Praia da Bordeira. Further North is the world class surf break in Arrifana and beginners beach Amoreira. The UK's
Independent newspaper
sums it up best: "Here is one of Europe's undiscovered treasures - thankfully protected by a 120km-long Parque Natural, which helps ensure that "tourist development" mostly means a café in a shack on a beach. It all seems like a fabulous secret, shared only by the intrepid few who make it this far. Their reward? Having miles and miles of these dramatic beaches (almost) to themselves."
