How did you like the accommodation?








The accommodation was amazing, we all really felt at home and liked the chilled vibes of the place. The lodges had everything we needed and the pool was so much more refreshing than the usual.
We particularly liked the vegetable patch and the help yourself fridge stocked with items form previous guests. We left our contribution which is such a good thing to do, instead of items going to waste.
The beaches were all very accessible and the town with great restaurants are within walking distance. I would highly recommend taking the trip, we could not have asked for more and we will certainly be back.

How did you like the accommodation?








We had the best holiday in Ericeira and stayed in the "best accommodation",  according to some of the locals there, which we soon realised when we walked through the gates of Villa Ana Margarida by Nature.
This place is amazing. It is only a short walk from the town centre, yet it feels like you are in a secluded oasis in the middle of nowhere...so beautifully designed and with such a relaxing atmosphere. Our host, Hugo, was available to help us before we even arrived, recommending the best way to get there and even collecting us from the bus station. On arrival, Hugo gave us an overview of the town and some great recommendations on what to do/where to eat, before showing us to our home for the coming days ~ a beautifully designed, 2 storey Eco-Lodge (sleeps 4-5 people), complete with an upstairs balcony and hammock, where we loved to hang out and relax at every possible opportunity...
Hugo also showed us around our beautiful surroundings. The place has a strong eco-friendly message and you are encouraged to do your part, by being eco-aware and recycling. The eco-pool is stunning, surrounded by beautiful planting and lily pads, where you can watch frogs and dragonflies, while you swim in the chlorine-free pool.
There is a vegetable patch, where guests can pick their own vegetables, a BBQ area, a communal fridge and honesty bar. There is a chicken house and we were also lucky enough to meet the resident cat (we named her "Winks") and her 5 new kittens, during our stay. I was also lucky enough to receive an amazing massage by the eco-pool from mobile masseuse, Viktor (Here & Now), which I would highly recommend.
Ericeira itself is also beautiful and we fell in love with the little seaside town, with it's lovely blue and white, cobbled streets, stunning beaches and selection of great restaurants and bars, where you can find some of the best seafood I've ever eaten, yummy ice-cream, good coffee and great cocktails (Wednesday nights seem to be the best night for live music and dancing in the street with the lovely locals).
As well as all the water sports on offer (swimming, surfing and stand up paddleboarding), we particularly enjoyed Claustrophillia, a sea-themed escape room experience in the town centre.
The town is also in easy reach of Lisbon (do a free walking tour with Chill Out) and the beautiful Sinatra,  which you could easily spend a couple of days exploring).
I could go on and on about all the little things that made this place so special, but ultimately, it just has to be experienced. We will definitely return with our family and friends and wouldn't stay anywhere else but Villa Ana Margarida by Nature.

How were the surf lessons?








I did not avail of surf lessons; however, we did have a S.U.P. (stand up paddleboarding) lesson with Liquid Earth. We were picked up at the shop by our 2 instructors for our own private lesson and transported to Foz Do Lizandro beach,  where we availed of a beginner's lesson on the river there (€30 each). Our instructors were great and were really patient, while we (I) found our balance. This was good fun and I would really recommend it.

How did you like the accommodation?








Absolutely loved the ecolodge! Pictures didn't do it justice. Really chilled out, clean private little paradise! Very short walk to the town. Would love to go back, would be great with a group also.It was perfect! We were upgraded from a studio to a house, which was amazing.
Thought Ericeira was a gorgeous town, not over run with tourism - very authentic, gorgeous beaches. Lovely restaurants and very reasonably priced. Found a really big quicksilver store which has a bar and deck where you can watch the fab sunsets!

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








Surfing was a lot harder than I expected, but enjoyed it and glad I did it. Loved the beach Foz do Lizandro - surf school picked us up from accommodation which was great. Instructors we're really nice and very helpful. Good craic!

How did you like the accommodation?








Absolutely loved the ecolodges, surpassed our expectations. Lodge was clean and had everything we needed, especially loved the hammock on the balcony!
The communal areas were well thought, our only regret is that we spent so long on the beach surfing thwt we didn't spend long enough enjoying the communal areas.......we are already planning to return next year.
Ericeira had a great vibe, we so enjoyed pottering around town in the evenings and the food was great. The children LOVED the Quiksilver shop and all the surf shops.
Everyone very friendly, welcoming and helpful.
A fantastic week

How were the surf lessons?








We booked one day of lessons at Na Onda.
Foz do Lizndro was an excellent beach for my son to surf (he is 'out back' and very good) whereas my daughter, husband and I were in the white water.
Ribera was our 2nd favourite beach and Mataduoro was awesome at high tide for our son to surf

Very impressed and happy with the accommodation.  Very clean, well managed with great attention to detail and a cheery welcome upon arrival.  Just a ten minute walk from the town centre, with a great selection of restaurants. The Eco-pool was certainly a conversation-stopper when the kids first saw it, but they got over their concerns quickly and used it freely and frequently!

How were the surf lessons?








Toby and his team were fantastic on Fiz do Lizandro. Enthusiastic and very good with the kids and adults alike. Highly recommend them.

How did you like the accommodation?








The accommodation was really good. Everything that you need was there. The shared fridge outside the accommodation is a good idea, so that people can leave there food in there when they are going home. The swimming pool was really clean. We stayed in the studio and we only have some problems to get warm water. You have to wait for a little while. The town is not far from the ecolodges, its a 5 min walk. There are good surfshops and other shops. The people in the town are really friendly aswell. And are always willing to help you. We're definitely coming back! :)

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








We had the best surflessons ever :) The surfinstructors where very friendly and gave us some good tips. We both noticed that we're making a lot of progress. We also went stand up paddle boarding by Activity surf center in the river. Which was a nice experience.

How did you like the accommodation?








The ecolodges were charming, lots of quirky sculptures which never failed to amuse and surprise. We loved the hammocks, the eco pool, frogs and lily pads. The sharing cupboard was a great idea, we used and added to it.
my only complaint was that after the initial welcome (late at night- due to a delayed flight) we did not see any staff for about 3 days, we only had one key and the promised extra key did not materialise, also we could not take advantage of the beach towel hire, we had only brought one beach towel with us so it got well used!!
My son loved the open topped beach bus, which conveniently stopped just outside, we were often the only ones using it and it had great wifi ( very important to teenagers).
Walking distance ( up a steepish hill) from the town, located on a busy road, we were happy with the location.


How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








My son had 5 lessons with Na Onda, we had some problems initially.
It was a bit confusing as it was not clear that it was up to us to contact Tobi to organise lessons when we got there. This something that could definately be improved or better communicated.
My son was invited to the wrong group (despite being clear about his experience before the first visit to the surf centre and when we got there) and definitly did not enjoy his first surf lesson.

Once this initial problem was sorted he enjoyed the rest of the lessons, the actual surfing was organised and safe, the lads in the shop were very helpful and friendly.

The beaches were clean, and well patrolled by life guards.
we booked yoga lessons and again we had to chase too get any information, eventually Tobi gave us a number and we organised them ourselves. Viktor was lovely, we enjoyed his classes, he couldn't do enough to be helpful.

How did you like the accommodation?








Ecoldoges were great - photos on the website do not do them justice! Everywhere you go around the grounds there are little pieces of art/furtniture that create the overall feel. The pool/pond is lovely to swim and play in and the lodges are clean and comfortable. The honesty bar was particularly welcome as we arrived late in the day with water etc available. The common areas work really well for making new friends and eating out - don't forget to have a  night  in with the authentic Portuguese food that is detailed in the games room. We have recommended it to other families and if you want a bit of glamping try the wine barrels not a lodge!!

Ericeria was a lovely old fashioned fishing town - much more to do than you might think at first.  The 18 hole crazy golf was great fun - took nearly 2 hours for 4 teenagers/adults to get round! The cobbled streets gave a lovely feel and eating out was great - cheap and good food especially octopus. Try TikTapas for  different meal. Popular restaurants you are best to book a few days in advance for popular times or go early (before 7pm or late after 9.30pm).

Other than the beaches which are plentiful though challenging to swim in, a great day out if you have a car is Sintra - Unesco site - fairly tale palaces and castles. For a good strong hike try walking the palace in the centre to the palace on top of the mountain. Took us 2 hours up up up .... on cobbled streets and a treat in one of the private transport back down (a bit of fun and same price as the bus for 4 with guided commentary thrown in).  Mafra palace and grounds nearer by were also interesting to visit with its famous old hospital, organs and campaniles.

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








Surf lessons were great - the power of the waves made it quite challenging for real beginners  - first day all lessons were cancelled as conditions too bad.
The instructors were great too - their prime responsibility was our safety which was a challenge with the current and rip - particularly on day three when it was like being in a washing machine!
Be ready for boot camp warm up after your first day when the basics are explained - it is fun with instructors who are incredibly fit and agile!
It is testament to the instructors that the 3 beginners in our group were all up on the board on the first lesson and consolidating for the next 2. Our more experience surfer was taught new tricks and taken out to the bigger waves.

Ericeira is a very cute little town, very nice vibe and feel, people are extremely friendly, everything is clean and there is a great community feel. We've stayed in the wine barryls at the Ecologes, which was a very unusual accommodation, but suited the holiday style perfectly! We felt like Robinson Crusoe and Friday :) So charming (in a good way!) If you're looking for an unusual and environmentally friendly place, that's the one for you! You have to be able to live with nature on your doorstep :) the fantastic community feel with the other guests and the super freindly owner have made us feel very welcome

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








Great fun team of instructors, who tried their best to cater to all studients' abilities, motivated and encouraged us. I stood up on the board on the first day and started catching waves on day 2. My daughter absolutely loved hanging around Tobi, he is really great with kids.

How did you like the accommodation?








We loved our holiday. The accommodation was excellent: a beautiful setting with a really positive atmosphere (everything seemed set up to be helpful/welcoming, no penny pinching).

The area was perfect for our first family surf holiday with our young children (6 and 7). We would highly recommend the beach at Foz Do Lizandro: an excellent surf school, a very safe, shallow river for the kids to paddle in and lovely food and drink options. Our adventurous 7 year old loved surfing, our more cautious 6 year old might need another year or two to feel comfortable in the waves.

The town is delightful: think St. Ives with better weather! Lots of options for food and drink and if you like seafood, you're in the right place. A lovely vibe in the evenings with live music for those who can stay up late!

How were the surf lessons?








Surf lessons with Na Onda at Foz Do Lizandro. We absolutely loved the beach (sandy, surf, safe river for paddling, sushi, smoothies, good parking). The surf lessons were good and we liked the instructors, they were excellent with the children in particular. They were positive and encouraging but I was always confident that they were taking safety very seriously.

Accommodation was perfect for our family of 4. Very clean and well equipped. We loved the eco-pool, barbecue facilities and games room.
Town is only a 10 minute walk away. Plenty of great restaurants and curio shops. There is a beach bus available if you're too tired to walk home.
TIP: Many of the restaurants do not accept credit cards.

How did you like the accommodation?








Lovely accommodation. Very clean. Check in was easy even though we arrived late in the evening. Villa Ana Margarida by Nature is an oasis, unlike all the other buildings which surround it. We used the large games room  a lot.
It is walking distance to the town, but glad we had a car for getting groceries. The town is very picturesque with some good restaurants. The Beach Bus stops outside which is great for getting back from surf lessons at Fiz Lizabdro and only €1 each. Also Uber here which was €4.50 - and we were family of 4 so great value too.

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








We all enjoyed the surf lessons. Very slick operation getting wet-suits, boards etc. People were great. So helpful. Our favourite instructor was Tiago as he was so patient and encouraging. Lovely beach & good waves - although it did feel too full of surfing classes on one afternoon and a little unsafe due to so many inexperienced surfers (including us!)  Quite a long hike carrying boards to & from the waters edge as the beach is very large.
Good restaurants at the beach.

How did you like the accommodation?








The accommodation was very clean and more than adequate in terms of space and provisions to self cater. it's definitely a quite little oasis, hidden in between a residential area - although the dog choir can be a little unsettling late at night! Local shops, café and cheeky beer stop are 20m up the road and Aldi and Lidls are only a 5min walk away.

Ericeira is a lovely little town full of local charm and character and it's an easy 5min stroll from the accommodation. Local cafes around the main square are great value for after meal coffee, drinks and gelato! Restaurants get very busy and it's well worth spending you first night booking other restaurants for the next 2 nights ahead and continuing to do this for the rest of your stay.

The bus service to the beaches stops right outside of the accommodation and we'd definitely recommend going to Rebeira d'ilhas - it's got great facilities, has a great chilled out atmosphere and the beach does get amazing surf in the right conditions.

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








Unfortunately the conditions weren't great when we stayed - too big on the first couple of days and then pretty much flat for the rest of the stay. The frustration is that you have to wait all day whilst decisions are made as to whether lessons will go ahead - however I must say that I totally understand why this is as safety is paramount.

Ericeira is a lovely, authentic, pretty and very friendly town with lots of restaurants, cafes, bars and beaches.

The Ecolodge Vila Ana Margarida is a truly magical place to stay.  It's also a great, quiet location but only a short walk into town and the beach bus stops right outside it.

The adults and teenagers in our party would love to go back there and couldn't fault anything other than the strong and cold North wind!

Great beach, great instructors, thank you

Overall it was excellent - we had a fantastic time and would definitely return. The natural pool was amazing and the accommodation was of a high standard, The honesty bar and communal food stuffs are a particularly nice touch. My only suggestion would be that the kitchen was a little basic - could have done with a chopping board and a few other utensils.

The lodge was amazing, was equipped with everything we needed. The kids loved the eco pool and the games room. Couldn't recommend it enough for families looking for a chilled out quirky retreat in stunning eirciera.

The eco lodges and outside areas are stunning. We had a perfect holiday here and couldn't recommend it enough. The receptionist guy (sorry didn't catch his name) was superb sorting out taxis for us and contacting the beach bus company when they were late. The whole resort is something to be proud of and we will definitely be back in the future.

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








The surf school tutors were excellent and really looked after the kids. The booking office is very chaotic but they are extremely busy all day so is understandable. Would definitely recommend them. The beach is extremely windy but lovely as long as you take a wind break with you!!

The place is fantastic and Hugo with his family are wonderful hosts. Their approach to all the natural elements is genuine giving this place an extraordinary touch of uniqueness. The lodges are very cosy, absolutely clean and comfortable. The location is also very good as it is not far at all to the town centre and all the excellent fish restaurants by ocean. The beach bus stops right outside the Ecolodge making transport to surfing lessons convenient. After a day of rough waves, there is no better place to relax and calm down.

How did you like the accommodation?








The Eco Sound was lovely. The villas were nice, well equipped, clean and the hammock on the balcony especially good. The honesty bar, free pool table and table tennis made for a really relaxing environment. But my favourite thing was the eco pool.
We ate at the beach cafes quite a few times, the food was good and the view even better. Had lots of good seafood in the restaurants in Ericeira old town too.   We didn't explore the surrounding area at all. We didn't have very long and wanted to make the most of the surfing and the eco sound. Maybe another time as lots of the locals said that Sintra was well worth a visit.

How were the surf lessons?








We had a very friendly surf instructor and we were pleased by the progress we made learning to surf. The surfing beach was beautiful.

I have to say both myself and the lads had an unbelievable time. The lodge was amazing, it was really peaceful and had a very chilled out atmosphere. The food around the area was great too, the fish was fantastic and the beer went down easy after a long day surfing. I had previously been to Sintra and Lisbon before this trip, so we just passed through Sintra on the way to Lisbon to watch the Ireland V Sweden match. It was a shame that we lost but we actually met people we knew in the Irish bar in Lisbon so that turned into a great night. I had an absolute blast and would have no hesitation in booking again or recommending surf holidays to people I know.

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing was brilliant, the instructors were excellent and the beach that they used was lovely.

How did you like the accommodation?








We had a brilliant time in Ericiera.  The Ecolodge itself was amazing, really beautiful place and the people running it couldn't have been nicer.  The atmosphere was always very relaxed and we felt completely at home here.  Our rooms were the 2 person cabins which were very cool to look at but extremely small, if I was going back I think I would book the 2-4 person studio rooms. We found it nice and chilled as in its not a holiday you would be going out clubbing in! I loved the restaurants because I love sea food where Aidan found it a little more difficult to find really good meat when we were out.  The Ecolodge had given us a guide/map and had reccommended restaurants which was really helpful. I could definately see us going back to Ericiera and would definately be booking into the Ecolodge again

How were the surf lessons?








The surf lessons were great no messing around straight in the water which we were very happy about and we actually learned how to surf! We felt it was very good value for the lessons. The beaches that we went to were stunning and the overall place was really nice.

We had a great holiday. The Ecolodges were perfect for us. We loved the area and the climate suited us. We visited Sintra which was beautiful, but not Lisbon or Peniche. We are not overly keen on sight seeing.

How were the surf lessons?








We very much enjoyed the challenge of surf school although we were not very good at it. The instructors were very helpful, patient and made it fun which was important for us.

How did you like the accommodation?








Exceeded expectations, lots of room in the lodge itself, really liked the outside communal  areas as well as table tennis, pool and table football, pool very quirky but I like quirky and you can get chlorine anywhere! Loved the cobbles  in the town, the variety of restaurants, the municipal market and general ambience and helpful people.
Went to Sintra, well worth a visit, lots to see without going to formal attractions. On way back killed a few hours in park/embankment with cable car , by the Vasco de Gama bridge, which is close to airport – recommend as an interesting end to holiday without hassle of navigating round Lisbon. 3rd best family holiday of all time and 1st was honeymoon

How were the surf lessons?








Surf was very good, helped by waves being just right, i.e. enough to get our boys going but not silly large.

It was very nice, an oasis of green in a residential area up a hill of Ericeira. Outside the resort you walk down to the center and have a view of the ocean. We booked a barrel and got an extra one and the kitchen and bathroom were private. It was our own spot in the resort. Further you have a nice shared lounge area with a pool table and a self served bar. The ecological swimming pool is also very nice, including frogs. Ericeira itself is a nice relaxed surf town with some really nice beaches. If you prefer a beach further away there is a beach bus stopping next to the resort.

We liked the accommodation.  Quirky and unique in our experience, it was a very relaxing place to stay (except for the early morning cockerels next door!).  Hugo, the accommodation manager, gave us a warm welcome and was on hand every day to deal with any questions.  The honesty bar in the basement games room and barbeque areas were much appreciated.

There is a small supermarket 100m away, with Lidl and Aldi both nearby.  Local shops, butchers and fishmongers are 10 minutes walk away in the centre of Ericeira.  The town itself has plenty of restaurants, bars and other shops, meeting local and tourist needs.  The town beaches are only a short walk away.

The pictures of the ecolodges on the website do no justice to them : they are nicer! Spotlessly clean (cleaned every third day also) and well thought out. Most things are supplied / catered for. and there is a fridge and larder to leave your leftover sun lotion, milk , beer etc when you are leaving so that the next residents can avail of them.  There are random sculptures which add a really nice touch. There is a small organic garden with lots of herbs and we had fab fresh tomatoes from it, not to mention the custard tarts which are baked fresh each day.

We really liked the proximity to the town so that you could walk in and out at your leisure. There were some great bars and restaurants with real friendly service. The town itself was very pretty and not terribly commercial but still had some nice shops.

The surf lessons were professional and most helpful even down to picking you up from the lodge in the morning. We played some tennis on the local courts as well.

I have two teenagers and an eleven year old and they never said they were bored in the whole two weeks, however they did say they would have preferred a proper swimming pool ( It is an eco pond ) however they got used to it and at  least their skin wasn't exposed to two weeks of nasty chemicals.

We had a fantastic holiday!!

The surf instructors were professional, helpful and fun ! I felt very safe and learned a lot. John (don't know how to spell it in portugese) was exceptionally helpful. They were most helpful even down to picking you up from the lodge in the morning.

We really enjoyed our stay at Villa Ana Margarida. It's a beautiful place, very chilled out with a strong eco theme. Our accommodation (a lodge) was a good size, v.comfortable and well equipped; we could see the sea from our balcony and watch the sun set, which was an unexpected bonus! Our kids loved the natural pool (even the frogs that live around the edge!) and the games room, as well as our lodge's hammock. Parking is onsite in an underground garage and very convenient. There are also three supermarkets just up the road, which is a help when you're self-catering. Other nice touches include a fairly priced honesty bar, a herb garden and a cool barbecuing area. Overall a great base whether you're here to surf or just relax.

We went into Ericeira most evenings. It's a beautiful town, full of cobbled streets, pretty buildings, funky bars and nice restaurants. We were here in high season but it was never overly busy and felt very safe, eg, in the main square at 11pm on a Saturday there were parents hanging out with their babies eating ice cream! Our best meal was at Prim near the main square - delicious steaks and a really nice, earthy vibe. We also had an enjoyable meal at Com Pinta - awesome burgers, especially the Ericeira. Barwise, we loved Drop Food, a sort of Airstream-style shack next to Villa Ana Margarida's beach villas at Praia do Matadouro (discovered after a surf lesson) and the Hendrick's Gin pop-up overlooking the town beach (Praia dos Pescadores) - both great for sundowners.

The main town beach is safe for swimming if you've got young kids. Foz do Lizandro, a short drive away, is also a good option - it's a top surf spot but kids can paddle in the mouth of the river that enters the sea here. The other beaches are more surfy with strong currents and (obviously) bigger waves!

How were the surf lessons with 3 Surfers Surf School?








I went with 3 Surfers. They were really professional, friendly and encouraging. I must admit I found surfing much tougher than expected and I didn't stand up for as long as I'd have liked. However, I learnt a lot in my three lessons and definitely caught the surfing bug. They also taught my daughter (aged 10) and she stood up on her second go! 'You're a natural'' the instructor told her. She couldn't have been happier! I

The beaches are really nice and great for surfing. However, Praia do Matadouro, where we had our lessons, was quite busy with surfing classes. I'd like to come back when it's quieter - apparently October is the best time.

Hugo and his team were great hosts. The accommodation in port barrels was both imaginative and unique. My son loved having his own "crib" with funky LED lighting. The open air bathroom was a little corner of paradise in the morning when you had a shower surrounded by ivy, bamboo and fig trees. The pool was great, such a different and clean feeling from the usual chlorinated pools we are all used to. It is not suitable for younger children (under 5 say) given its depth and access points - there is no possibility of little ones paddling for example.
Facilities were clean, and there was a pool table, BBQ area and communal spaces dotted around. Ecolodges is a short walk into the village and the beach bus stop is close by too.

How were the surf lessons with Blue Ocean  Ericeira Surf School ?








Blue Ocean was a great school with friendly and patient instructors who kept you safe, motivated and having fun. The beach at Ribeira was our favourite in the Ericeira region. It has smooth consistent waves which were very forgiving for beginners. You had plenty of time to paddle and set yourself on the board. Very rewarding. The natural rock ledge of the surfing spot at Ribeira means the water is like glass - and there was no risk of a bump if you use common sense and jump off the board before it gets too shallow or like my son simply ride the wave to shore and step off.

Villa Ana Margherita is a wonderful nature lodge 10 mins walk from the beach. VAN has a relaxed feel, spacious communal areas and a centre piece of an eco-pool - frogs and all...!

Ericiera is a cute little town with an abundance of good quality fish restaurants (Mar a Vista topped them) and ice-cream parlours. We even managed a dance at the annual sardine festival.

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








As beginners, it's difficult to rate the lessons as we have little to compare to. Saying that our experience was overall positive. Antonio (guy in the hut) was professional and very flexible when it came to booking individual lessons.  How much you get from a lesson seemed to depend on:wave/wind conditions, the ratio of customers to trainers on the day and the attitude of the trainer. Some days were better than others for each of these; however, overall we had fun, and would surf with these guys again.

Beginning of July, we had magic holiday time at Ana Margarida by Nature! Decoration in exotic style, like an island of calm and relaxing! Very nice experience was the nature pool, so great without chlorine!

The "chalet" has all you need  and a perfect cleaning service every three days! Downstairs near the pool is a big chilly room, great for young, but also older people (billiard and meeting point)!

We met very nice English, Irish and Danish people! We went by car to that place and appreciated the underground parking. Ericeira is a beautiful small town! People is relaxed and friendly! Best fish we had at MAR D'AREIA, delicious!!! It was our first trip to Portugal and we discovered Ericeira by chance, because our son (16) loves skating and we needed a place for skate&surf;! It was just top in any way and we will come back!

We stayed in one of the lodges which was excellent for 4 people. The design was great and we all loved the hammock on the balcony. We didn't cook in the lodge but did notice that there was no oven, but who uses an oven on holiday!
The development was quiet and mainly occupied by couples/families, the setting was really good, being private and secure. The management team was discrete and friendly.
The town was larger than we expected but the short 10 minute walk to the old town (where we spent most of our spare time) gave access to an array of really good restaurants, cafes and nice shops. The children really enjoyed the burgers at pinto, tic tac and tic tapas were also excellent. My favourite was Gabriel's which was worth the slightly longer walk for beautifully cooked traditional Portuguese food at a hugely reasonable price. Generally the restaurants were really busy after 8 pm and booking was advisable.  We found the locals were exceptionally friendly and accommodating, even when I attempted ordering coffee and cakes in Portuguese. Ps local pastries were delicious (and hardly any calories!).
The bus to Lisbon was easy (45 mins) and the city was good to see, being traditional and unspoiled. Sinatra and the other towns also looked interesting. We had surf lessons each day. Had we not had this distraction and the essential  recovery period, we would have needed a car to see more of the region.

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








As a group of 4 (2 adults and 2 children) with no previous surfing experience, we all enjoyed the surf lessons. The instructors were excellent and their English was really good. They were relaxed but observant when we were in the water. At times the classes were quite large (up to 12 but between 2 instructors). The water was occasionally busy when other surf schools were on the water at the same time. The instructors generally took care to ensure that everyone surfed safely. the beach was great. On occasions the surf was strong and whilst my children are confident swimmers they recognised that the instructors were right to bring them ashore.
The restaurants on the beach were really nice and we enjoyed several relaxed lunches. Paddling up the river on SUPs was good fun with an abundance of wild life and really nice countryside.  The only issue being that Dad had to paddle a few of the boards back due to a particularly strong breeze!

The Eco-lodges were an island of querky wonder in what might otherwise have appeared a sea of relatively newly built samey samey Mediterranean apartment blocks. The lodge we stayed in was spotlessly clean on our arrival. The swimming pool or pond if you will provided a good outlook. It was warm and we all enjoyed swimming in it. Not often do you get to count the frogs on the lilly pads at the side of your swimming pool! (Good sign of clean water). The barbecue building was good, impressive too.
The small veg garden provided us with some free fresh plumbs and some lettuce (You are informed on your arrival that if things are ripe in the garden then help yourself.) There is also a cupboard and fridge in which departing guests leave things they can't take with them - worth checking on your arrival before doing a big shop. Items are date checked regularly  by the staff. I pretty much guarantee you won't have to buy Olive oil, salt etc. etc. The atmosphere with the other guests was excellent, a nice communal feel but with everyone respecting each other's space.
If you do need the shops there is a convenience store 50 meters form the door but also a Lidl and Aldi about 400 metres away. (downhill walk on the way back.) The old part of the town is within 10 minutes walk. The nearer beaches only a little more.
There is a stop for the new Beach bus service within 10 metres of entrance to the lodges. This is a Euro per person to Foz Do Lisandro, but in this its first year it only runs every two hours. Perfect! only obvious gripe is that the pool table is in dire need of a re-felt and some new cues.

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








My two teenage boys could already surf a little so went into the 'Advanced class'. Conditions on the first day were pretty demanding with big waves but the instructors were very good at Na Onda at Foz Do Lisandro. That beach itself was interesting with a large lagoon just behind the strand line, great for small kids. There was a fair range of beach side cafes with toilet facilities. The school made sensible decisions and showed flexibility regarding the lesson times and the conditions appearing to go the extra mile to make sure that those who had booked lessons got the best possible value for their time.

Excellent surf school and very friendly instructors. Would have like to see other beaches, but realise they are based in one place,  and my son who is a very good surfer didn't really have any lessons , perhaps an advance lesson would have been good.  However we would use them again but book individual lessons.

We loved the Eco Lodges. We stayed at Ana Margarida Villas last year but with 2 older kids the 2 bed lodges were better for us even if Ana Margarida was nearer the skatepark. The natural swimming pool was never too cold and the whole place was very chilled and relaxing. Plenty of sun loungers and enough space around each villa to make it all very peaceful. It's just a short walk into town and even Foz do Lozandro beach is walkable from here.

Ecolodges is a beautiful little oasis very a short walk from the town centre in Ericeira. The lodges are very cosy and we loved the natural swimmingpool and enjoyed several evenings by the pool listening to the various creatures. We also liked the common area in the basement with the honesty bar and pool table. Wi-fi worked best in there.
Ericeira is a cute little town and there are several nice restaurants where you can enjoy nice seafood fairly cheap. We rented a car and did our surfing at Foz do Lizandro where we also rented wetsuits and boards and the guys in the surfshop were very helpful. After surfing in the morning we could store our stuff there and then return for some more surf in the afternoon. We would definitely recommend Ericeria and Ecolodges.  We loved our visit and will more than likely return.

We travelled as a large group (36) and stayed at the Ecolodges/Ana Margarida Villas By Nature.

We had an amazing trip, everyone really enjoyed the ecolodges and all the activities Nicky helped us organise. One of the younger members of the group said the biking tour was one of the best things he had ever done in his life!!! The guide was so knowledgeable about the area which really resonated with people.

The Ecolodges are just magical with lodges, studios and even renovated wine barrels for us to stay in all with environmentally conscious messages. Hugo who runs the lodges can't do enough for you (like most warm, welcoming Portuguese).

Only negative was the catering on the last night was not great quality food (unlike the company they had used last year).

All in all an epic trip, I’ve no doubt all trip attendees have now fallen in love with Ericeira and the Ecolodges and will be back again.

We stayed in the wine barrels at villa ana margarida. When we arrived we knew we were too early for check in but hoped we could leave our bags and then go explore. We were met at the entrance by the receptionist Marco, who told us they had the barrels ready so we could actually just check in them and there, which was great!

The barrels were amazing! There was three, two with beds and one kitchen. The dining area was outside and there were fig trees covering the table. As we were the only ones booked in for the week, Marco let us use the second bedroom as well.

As we were staying at the end of May, we were a little worried the barrel might get cold at night but they were grand, nice and warm, and there was more than enough blankets to keep us warm.

Marco at reception was great, he was so friendly, couldn't do enough for us, and he really helped to take our stay to the next level. Thanks Marco!!

The accommodation was a ten minute walk to the town, it's a really nice short walk. Everywhere that we stopped for coffee or food in the town was lovely. People were all very friendly and the food and drink was great too! We tried to go somewhere new every time we went out for food, but we went to a restaurant that we enjoyed so much we went back, it's called Funky and we would highly recommend it! It was quiet when we first went in and the owner came over and had a great chat with us, on our second visit the place was packed out, but we were still made to feel very welcome. We had to wait quite a while but he made sure to call over with us to make sure we were ok at different points. And when the food came out it was amazing!

We also recommend Jukebox for cocktails, where for 5 euro you can get a VERY generous gin and tonic! And the bartender is good craic too!

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








We took three surf lessons with the surf school Na Onda. We had three instructors across the three days. They were all great, and we both felt we learned loads and got a lot of confidence in the water. They actually did push us to push ourselves in the bigger waves and it was tough but we finished each lesson very happy with ourselves. They also had a photographer on the beach that takes pictures of you throughout the lesson and at the end of your lessons you can buy them for a tenner, which made me feel a pro!!

The beaches were lovely. Surf lessons are highly recommended if you want to surf places you might not be confident enough to visit yourself.

The Ecolodges is a restful, relaxed piece of countryside in the centre of a friendly, town.  Everytime we come here I feel like someone has pressed the pause button on our lives for a week.  Ericeira is a lovely place to stay.  In particular, we spend a lot of time around the old town square.  Pao de vila bakery on the corner of the square is great for bread and for a daily espresso and custard tart.  Pedro Dura steakhouse just down the street on the opposite end of the square is so family friendly with quick service and friendly staff.  They always find us a table and no matter how busy they are the service is great [better to ask for the sauce on the side rather than on the steak!]. If we were alone tik tak tapas or una sushi would be great places to eat but the girls are too restless to enjoy them.  During the day the Na Onda café on the boardwalk at Foz de Lizandro beach is a great place for lunch.  Our favourite beaches are Foz and Praia del Sul which are both at the south end of town.  This time we made more efforts to see the area and especially enjoyed Palais Montserrat which is one of the palaces at Sintra.  We also made it to Mafra, Cabo da Roca lighthouse and up to Peniche which is really nice for alternate beaches.  Lisbon is really accessible and we took at trip down to the Oceanarium which is worth the trip especially if you drive back via Estoril.  The Ecolodges are within walking distance of Aldi and Lidl which have a great selection of food, fruit, veg and meat.  Cooking at the Ecolodges is easy especially for barbeque.

We stayed here in June 2011 and returned again in May 2015 and were not disappointed, the accommodation was clean, comfortable and all the basics that we needed. The Eco pool was refreshing, private and quiet as only a few lodges. We loved that the garden had fresh food especially the strawberries! In the evening we would head to the nearest beach which had cafes along the front which was relaxing and had beautiful scenic views. There was a good choice of restaurants and none of them disappointed. I would recommend to stay here and hope to visit again in the near future.

The Ecolodges are a fabulous place for a family to be based in Ericeira.  The size of the lodge is perfect for a family with two to three children.
There is loads to do in a safe environment and within easy walking distance of the town to pursue other entertainment.  Our girls (7,6 and 2 years) shared a room comfortably.
The town is so pleasant, people are relaxed and friendly and we have stayed in Ericeira twice and will return again.  The bakery in the Village square is lovely as is the Blue Ice gelateria nearby.  For food the kids were happiest at Pedra Dura but adults will enjoy Tik tapas.

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








Na Onda surf school were very friendly and personable.  The wind was up for our chosen week making it difficult for young children just beginning but they did their best to cater to a wide range of ages and ability. We also got to experience a variety of beaches.

The accomodation was amazing. As soon as you walk into Ana Margarida lodges you can feel the sense of love and creativity that has gone into creating such a unique place to stay. Hugo and his family were very welcoming and helpful and were happy to help us with any queries. Hugo even printed our boarding passes for us. The huge  communal lounge was a great place to chill and unwind in the evening and the honesty bar, fridge, veg patch and natural swimming pool made the place very welcoming and trusting. The lodges were perfect and even had a pull out sofa bed for our extra guest.

Ericeira is a beautiful area and the local people could not be nicer. We were made feel very welcome and it was lovely to see them with their dogs (they love their dogs!) chatting about them and watching the world go by.
The highlight of the trip was definitely the food. It had the most amazing seafood we have ever had. A real gastronomical experience. The best restaurants were Restaurant Funky, Restaurant Tik-Tak, Restaurant Tik-Tapas. There was also a great little cafe on the seafront called Restaraunt Joy, where a lot of the locals eat and is amazing value. It does a bowl of soup for €1.50!
Will definitely be going back.:)

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








The one lesson we had with NaOnda surf school was great and we learnt a great deal with our instructor. Unfortunately we were disappointed with the lack of communication as to whether or not our surf lessons would take place the next day. We felt completely ignored as there was no response from the school that we had booked with (even though we had booked our lessons in advance.). Thankfully surfholidays have dealt with this swiftly and we are being refunded for the way in which we were treated. We would hate anyone to have to go through this experience. as we were very much looking forward to having our lessons during our trip.

The accommodation was great - a very quiet eco lodge, set back from the main part of town but easily within 5 mins walk from all the restaurants / bars etc.

Ericeira itself is quite a small town in March. However if you are there purely for surfing then its ideal. Numerous beaches, all easily accessible & not too much nightlife to distract you. Additionally, various other resorts *and Lisbon itself) are all within driving distance (less than an hour) so you can find whatever you want.

How were the surf lessons with Na Onda?








We loved our time with the surf school.

"Na Onda" were great. They texted us to let us know meeting times etc & I have no complaints about the instructors. They were very professional & more importantly, very encouraging. I would definitely use this company again if I return to Ericeira

There were a number of beaches at the resort, so we have a lot of variety in terms of location & this helped break any monotony we might have had if we went to the same beach day after day.

We had a really good time in Ericeira.  The Eco-lodges were great and perfect for us with young children.  It was quiet (apart from the frogs) and very relaxing.  Ericeira itself was lovely and there was plenty to explore and some fantastic restaurants, all very family friendly.
We didn't manage to explore any other areas this holiday as on the days we were surfing the children just wanted to have fun on the beach or mess about in the pool. We had a brilliant holiday and I'm sure we shall make a return visit in the future. Thanks for all your advice on the different resorts and accommodation before we booked, the Eco-lodges and Ericeira were spot on.

How were the surf lessons?








The surf lessons with Tobi and Juan were really good and by the end of the third day our 8 year old son looked like he'd been surfing all his life, although I did find it a little bit harder, managing to just about stand up once by the end.  My husband is a more experienced surfer and he had his lessons with the advanced group and he found it very helpful.

Our holiday in Ericeira couldn't have been better! We loved staying in the cabin wine barrels, they were small and quirky, you wouldnt want to be to tall! The pool was great and Jorge was really nice and helpful!
The beaches were great and really easy to get to since we'd hired a car. The restaurants were great! We went to many of the places recommended in the info pack you sent us. The sea food was a favourite! I've recommended Ericeira and the Ecolodges to everyone I know and we're already thinking about coming back next summer.

Really good choice of breaks! The surf was powerful while we were there. The others ended up not taking surfing lessons. They hired some foamys and I showed them the basics.

Accommodation:
Villa Ana Margarida by Nature; Excellent. I have stayed previously and book the barrel accommodation which was very nice. This trip we booked a lodge. The lodge was very spacious for two. The furnishings were nice and the kitchen was well equipped. Sea view from the upper balcony. Great shower.

Ericeira:
This is honestly one of my favourite places. I have visited here maybe 5 times over the last few years. The surf is great and the town is beautiful.

Restaurants and bars:
Prim and Boa Viagem are some of my favourites for big meat grills.
Lebre does amazing pregos (Portugese steak sandwich), have to be tried.

Tubo and Adega Bar 1987 are great for drinks.
Discoteca Ouriço (the local club) is an experience :)

We stuck to Ericeira and were at Lizandro beach each day. A couple of days were pretty choppy and not perfect surf, but fine for us as we had our beginners' lessons. Otherwise it was great. We really enjoyed it down there. Tobi and Juan were fantastic, and we got on really well.

I have to say, both myself and Amie have had one of the best holidays together in a long long time!  Ericeira and its surroundings is truly a beautiful place, so much so that we were making plans, albeit drunken ones, to relocate to there sometime soon! :)  It was a really idyllic place to stay and it had everything we needed and more.  The studio apartment was a really cosey and really REALLY cool place to stay.  I would whole heartidly recommend anyone to stay there!  It's paradise!
We didn't travel out too much from Ericeira.  We went to Lisbon and Sintra.  We didn't plan our Lisbon excursion too well so that was a bit of a wasted day but we saw some parts of the city which was nice.  Sintra was gorgeous.  We only had a few hours there but a trip up to the castle on the top of the hill is definitely worth it! We rented a car but i would say to people that it isn't necessary really.  It was quite handy having that freedom of being able to drive where we wanted but it wasn't completely necessary.  We could have just as easily gotten around with taxi's, buses and our feet.  Though if people are going from the airport, I think a taxi would be a much better option than the bus.  Much less hassle!
Suffice to say, we had a great time and would really recommend this holiday to anyone!

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing was fantastic and we improved so much over the 5 days of lessons.  We weren't even back a day and we were over in the west of Ireland the following weekend looking for some waves. . . sadly the weather was against us (for surfing) but at least we got out and did a bit of sunbathing. Things i would highly recommend include booking as many days surfing as possible if that's what you're going to do.  The difference from when we arrived and when we left was amazing.  The guys in the surf school - Jean and Alvoro were fantastic and really pushed us.

We don’t have a bad word to say about the trip (except the last 2 days were misty and we had some rain – but can’t blame anyone for that!!) This was our second time back and again the lodges were great. We tried out some new restaurants as well, which we would recommend.

How were the surf lessons?








The lessons were so much better than before. The instructors were very nice and we noticed a huge improvement in safety. We all had to wear vests to identify us and the instructors were strict with us about not drifting off, which was a welcome change. The bigger boards was great too and they gave us shorter ones on our last day as we had progressed, so that was good to see. The waves were great on the beach and the set up with the bars and restaurants works really well. Tobi arranged for the surf transfers through a lady called Renata. Her cost was fair and she was flexible about picking us up after the lessons, so we could stay on the beach if we wanted. It worked out really well.

The weather was overcast on one of the days and we did do a bit of exploring and headed to both Lisbon and Sintra. The castle and the palace in Sintra were well worth seeing. In Lisbon we hired one of the "Go-Cars" dont know if you know them or not but they are three wheeled scooters that you sit into and have a GPS system that you follow and it takes you on a self-guided tour, really different and we had a great laugh.
Ericera itself is a lovely town with some nice restaurants. Who knows we may well be back next year for another go in an attempt to catch one of those Monster Waves

Beautiful location and so handy to get to and from Lisbon airport. Loved all the small restaurants/bars by night and the choice of beaches was great. It's fair to say we will definitely go back.
I never thought of Portugal to be like this but the place was great and very affordable. I also have to say the locals were friendly and always helpful. I might have to brush up on my Portugese next time and make a little effort with them, I felt a bit bad not knowing the local lingo but that was by first time there so I'll put it down to inexperience!
Eco Lodges were absolutely brilliant! Unique is right! I can't say enough good things about these but they are a hidden gem. When we go back we will definitely stay there! It's unique I think but really works. All of the other guests were great too and there was a really good atmosphere around the place.
Tobi and his wife (forgot her name!!!) were great too, we arrived late but they understood and they left us to our own devices which is nice but I always got the feeling that if we needed anything they were only a phonecall away.  Some questions were asked about renting the whole place out for a wedding and maybe hiring a private catering company for food and sorting music.  The whole place is great and the guide you provided us with before we left was brilliant. It explained things really well and we used it over and over to find our way around and just as a general guide. The language/translation part was used frequently!!!!

How were the surf lessons?








There were supposed to be 4 of us on the trip but a friend needed to pull out because of work commitments (his loss) so 3 of us used 4 of the lessons. The first day we got there we organised a 6pm surf lesson, but unfortunately there was not great surf so we organised with Tobi and his friend (his name begins with F but it escapes me now!) to return the next day for more lessons. We found the only nightclub in the town and celebrated my birthday late into the night so we missed the 10am lesson next day but the guys were totally understanding about it which was nice. I reorganised for the following day at 10am as we were leaving that evening and we got out and used 3 of the 4 lessons

We had a lovely mini holiday. The lodges were great and Claudia looked after us very well. We couldn't believe that honesty bars still exist! Wouldn't work in Brighton.  And we loved the town and the beaches. We didn't go to any other towns.
I would particularly like to point out how kind and helpful Ricardo and Joao from the taxi company were. Riccardo had to wait an hour for us at the airport, then managed to avoid us being killed by what seemed to be a piece of furniture falling off a car roof on the highway, waited at the lodges for us until Claudia arrived, and then took us into town and got us a table at a restaurant.
All very welcome after a long journey and over and above anything we would usually expect from an airport transfer. So all in all a success. If we decide to go on another surfing holiday we will certainly consider going back

The location was also perfect, was lovely to be able to walk into  the town in the evening for dinner etc. Overall the facilities we great  - games room, internet, pool, bbq, honesty bar and of course the house itself.
We did travel to Peniche and Santa Cruz beach - really lovely. Our favourite restaurant was Tik Tapas (much preferred in to Tik Tak) especially for kids as you could get small portions so would recommend for a family!  We didn't make Lisbon or Sintra - kids just too young. But the driving was very easy and cost of living much less than Algrave. Overall we had a wonderful holiday and would love to return!!!

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing was great....Tobi and his team were really lovely. One day my husband could not surf as there was no waves but they took them out on a paddle board instead. If I have any constructive criticism it would be just that for the kids lessons they spent alot of time sitting on the beach waiting for the instructor to arrive each day - would  be 10:30ish by the time they got started, while my husband's class were up and running once they have they had their wet suits on. But overall they really enjoyed.

The lodges are great, and especially the location of the lodges is terrific (a small paradise in Ericeira). Very nice: the honesty bar. I love the Portuguese, very friendly and accomodating.
Surroundings: it was very hot (40C) the first part of the week so we did not go out a lot to see things. However we did visit Sintra and the Pena Palace, which was beautiful.
Restaurants were OK, and compared to Holland nice price level.
Room for improvement: Kitchen equipment a bit insufficient, and the tab water in the kitchen was not very hot.
We had a wonderful week on a beautiful spot. We might want to do it again!

Yes, we had a great time and really enjoyed it. It was our second time around so we knew our way. The lodges are still great (maybe better now that the bar/bbq area is finished). Thankfully I couldn’t hear the cockerel this year!
We went up to an old town called Obidos which is close to Peniche. It has an old castle and was a good diversion for half a day. On the way back we went to the Buddah Gardens just outside Carvalhal. It shouldn’t work but somehow it does…amazing place in a very strange way. I’d recommend it to all visitors to the lodges.
We also went into Lisbon again. It was very hot so we went to the Expo area (NE of the old town on the bay). We went to the aquarium and did the cable car…pretty cool. Didn’t have time for the Science museum. It’s easy to drive to and plenty of parking (€5 for about 5-6 hours) so much easier to get around than the old city. On a hot day it was a good place to go in the city.
As for food, Tik Tapas gets the nod just ahead of Ribas but to be honest the small restaurants away from the main square and crowds are as good if not better than the headline ones. As for my boys the Blue Ice Geladaria gets the nod as the best spot in town!...along with mini-golf

Lovely town & beaches.  People were very friendly & food was good. Great fresh fish, fruit & veg, small amounts of crafts and butchers around.  We enjoyed the food in general and it was reasonably priced – a lot cheaper to eat out there than in Ireland.

He is a great asset and went out of his way to help us. He wouldn't even accept my attempt to buy him a box of beer to say thanks.
The beaches around are pretty good, we went on a scooter for an explore north which was good. Unfortunately we didn't get to Lisbon other than to pick up our rental car - for trip number 2!

The holiday was fantastic (kids both say it was the best holiday ever!). The Eco Lodges were a great place to stay, with a very relaxing atmosphere. The ability to go and pick some fresh salad leaves from the garden, along with the communal barbecue, are a great amenity.
We loved the old part of Ericeira, and had some great meals (and very cheap, compared to Dublin). Tik Tapas and Pedra Dura we found great for family meals. Also had a great meal at Tik Tak (though a bit more expensive). The find of the holiday was a little place called "Cafe American" (a misnomer, if there ever was one: it's a Portuguese family-run restaurant where nobody speaks a word of English, but the seafood is fantastic and incredibly good value).
The choice of beaches is wonderful: the one down by the harbour is lovely for swimming/paddling. We also drove and explored some other beaches along the coast: there are some spectacular, and relatively quiet, ones just north of the town. We did a few road trips to Lisbon (aquarium and science museum, in the "Expo 98" area of the city are fantastic day trips for kids). Negotiating the Lisbon traffic, however, is not for the faint hearted!. Also took a trip to Sintra, with is amazing (though much more touristy than Eirceira, and nowhere near as good value for meals, coffee, ice-cream breaks etc.) We've already recommended the holiday to others, and may well be returning ourselves next summer

The Surf lessons were spot on, and the school is particularly well set up for kids. One of our kids was sick for the first few days of the holiday, but Tobi was happy for us to reschedule the surf lessons and spread them out over the two weeks. The cafe at the surf school is also a great place to have lunch after the surf lesson, and is very good value.

We had a brilliant time, The lodges were exceptional, a real chill out zone. The kids loved the 'pool' and the common area under the lodges was great in the evenings, play pool, read, use laptop. Jorge and Lillyanna were on hand, but to be honest there was no need to bother them as everything ran smoothly.
Ericeira is lovely, nice and relaxed and not a party town, loads of cafes and restaurants to visit.  Sintra was nice but we didn't give it enough time, needs a full day. We went to Lisbon on the train from Sintra, easier than driving in Lisbon. Its a hectic city, and again needs the full day to get around (and it was hot). It is definitely a place we will visit again, one of the best breaks we have had.

How were the surf lessons?








Surf lessons went off really well with Alvaro and the guys really making an effort. He even took some of the more advanced kids on a extra session (no charge) on a different beaches. All the instructors really worked hard to make it enjoyable. By the way the Na Onda cafe/restaurant is really good to get a burger/salad/wrap for lunch after the lessons. We ate there a few times (got the kids vote as best place to eat).

What a place- I booked these lodges by default rather than by design if you get my meaning - I have seen the No Frontiers programme and intended to go there some day with my two sons Fionn who is now 11 yrs old and Lucas who is nearly 10 yrs. I had no expectations going on this holiday- I knew it was going to be either the best holiday we had or the worst!! I can say without reservation that it was  the best, most exciting place we have ever stayed in- the lodges were amazing- to step out in to this paradise each morning was so relaxing-

There is a superb energy in this little oasis !!!! From the frogs, to the plants, to the birds, to the pool, to the exceptional staff- what can I say- I have no complaints at all and I can honestly say that of the people I spoke to in the lodges I never heard one complaint for our whole 10 day stay!!!

As an aside I have a pathological fear of Cock roaches- if there is one in sight or in our accommodation, the whole place will know about it !- I go on holidays with my antenna up watching for them at night in my peripheral vision. To my great delight, I saw not a single roach for the whole 10 days either in the lodge area or on our walks at night  or in the town- a big bonus for me to say the least.

Eco sound is a very secure setting for a single parent travelling without another adult- there is a locked entrance with a high wall - a key pad lock requires a number access! This feature was very comforting-in the past  I have never left my children alone on holidays for a moment- in Eco sound I was able to slip to the local shop without the two boys knowing they were safe and secure. I would recommend the lodges for this peace of mind alone- I left my credit cards in my lodge for the entire visit- in my travel bag- there is a safe at reception - it is no problem for Jorge to hold passports , insurance etc- In truth, this was not necessary. My youngest boys said the holiday was "cool" and "awesome" - the best ever!!!

And to Ericeria- I just think I have found heaven- it is so noncommercial which is what I just loved- no strip , no booming music, no drunks or marauding gangs of drunk young people.

I just loved the local feel , not too many tourists, beaches semi deserted and clean. Restaurants were excellent also along with the cafes and the cake shops!!! I'm a stone heaver this week!!! All in all it was the best holiday we ever had - I have traveled to the Algarve three times before -I shall not be returning there or to the Spanish mainland or the Spanish islands in the future. These places cannot hold a candle to the holiday in the surf beaches of northern Portugal.

There is a sign in our lodge that says "life Needs Pauses"- What a place and what a pause! This is one of the most fabulous, worth while, life changing, value for money holiday one can buy. My only regret on this holiday was that I only booked 10 days - 14 would have given us the space to go to Lisbon or to Sintra to see the surrounding sights- never mind it is an excuse to return next year or even at mid tern?

A final word on the staff at the lodges- Olinda, Jorge , Lilly Anna and the owner Casado - there was nothing this crew would not have done for us- I look forward to returning to this paradise in the near future.

How were the surf lessons?








As to the surfing- well what an experience - my sons did fabulously - they took to it like ducks to water with my youngest getting up on the board after lesson 2!!! The surf school was so organised , a little laid back time wise but the tuition was exceptional- Joao and Alvaro and Andrea thank you so very much- you have opened a new world to my sons, a world they just loved. We booked for 6 lessons before we left Dublin- fun and value for money - the mornings had a structure for my two boys and they expounded so much energy at the surfing I have very little to do entertaining wise after each lesson. I whiled away time in the cafes at the surf school- what a set up there- the board walk, the choice of food and the relatively cheap prices considering the location- on the beach. No rip off here for sure.

We loved the surfing holiday and I'd be keen to go back. The accommodation was excellent, great fun with plenty of activities and our hosts were very helpful and friendly. The village was really pretty and we enjoyed a great range of meals. It's not easy keeping a 15 year old interested on holiday but he was through the surfing, swimming pond, garage football, basketball, pool, table tennis and fussball.

A truly unique and wonderful experience , probably one of the best holidays we have ever had. Jorge and Lynda were fantastic, catered for our every need, umbrellas wind breakers and when they were around joined in as part of the family. Friends for life i hope.

The lodges were spotless and had everything we needed. We Bbq most evenings as it was nice to spend time with other families in the other lodges, but did venture out to 2 fish restaurants without the children and both were superb.

What also made this such a great holiday was that there were other kids (young adults!) in the lodge next to us who teamed up with ours to visit the lively pubs like La Luna and the disco.

We visited Sintra and Lisbon but feel that we did not give ourselves enough time at either. Sintra was beautiful my favourite place with the little shops but we did not wear the correct foot wear to go hiking as we would have wanted. I would have research Lisbon before visiting again as it is a huge place and we only saw a very small piece of it but it was still a great day.

My only bad thing that you could pass on is the car hire company .We choose Alomo who are run in Portugal by Eurocar we had to wait 3 hours at the Airport before receiving our car!

Surf school had everything sorted and split us in to smaller groups and Raul and Andrea put so much effort in to the lessons determined to help us all succeed.

Great holiday.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  The lodges were great - really enjoyed everything about them. Jorge and Olinda were very hospitable (bbq on the Saturday night was a nice way to get to know everybody) and could not do enough for us, Any request was looked after immediately. Very sociable. We loved the pool and picking fresh veg and strawberries from the vegetable garden.

Ericiera was a very friendly town, mostly locals and not packed with tourists, very safe - we felt very comfortable letting our 15 and 17 year old wander around at 11/12 at night. We enjoyed the restaurants and very good value. We visited Lisbon - which we enjoyed but were glad to get back to the lodges.

The highlights of our holiday were the surfing, strolling around Ericeira and relaxing by the pool at the lodges.  An absolutely great holiday and keep a lodge for us for next year - the middle two weeks next year!!!!! The information pack was very helpful

How were the surf lessons?








Surf lessons were a big hit (Andrea, Raul and Tobi).  Molly was up on the first day and by the last we had all managed to standup even if we didn't look too graceful.  It was tiring but after the lesson everyone was on a high.  A great way to get teenagers to come on holidays with their parents.  Lovely beach.

We really enjoyed our stay in Ericeira and were well looked after by the friendly staff.  The Ecolodges  were very different to the usual self catering and exactly what we wanted.  There was plenty of space for the 4 of us, they were clean and comfortable.   Also as there are only 6 or 7 Ecolodges on the site each lodge felt quite private but there was plenty of well laid out common space too.  Good sunbeds etc.
I wasn't aware of the table football and pool facilities at the time of booking but they were a good source of entertainment for our teenage boys (16 & 18).   Had fun using the BBQ facilities one night and picking the home grown salad from the vegetable garden.
The lodges are well located for the town and there are plenty of restaurants to chose from and a range of prices, although it is definitely necessary to book the better ones. Pleased to see that the coastline seemed relatively undeveloped. Would definitely recommend it to friends

How were the surf lessons?








The lodges are a 35 mins walk from the surfing beach - I know we could have had a taxi but we preferred to walk.   The surf lessons were fun and the team of instructors were patient and enthusiastic and did what they could to help.  Seemed well organised and I like the fact that the school is based in a beach cafe so we didn't need to stagger very far at the end of the lesson for much needed refreshments.

We had a great time the lodges were great - the pool was great - the other guests were great. My 12 year old who is quite well travelled thought it was the best place we have ever been to. We stayed in Lisbon and then got the train to Sintra then the bus - it was so easy and much more exciting than sitting in a taxi - we also got the bus to the beach for surf lessons every day and that was easy - you should encourage your guests to use public transport more as it is so efficient and the people are so helpful.
My son loved the skatepark where you can hire boards for 3 euros so please advise your skate boarding travellers not to bother trying to take one with them. We ate well both at the high end fish places and the cheaper pizzerias. The mix of the cool surf shops and the traditional cafes was great - lots of energy without the drunks or fear of crime - we would be interested in coming back

We absolutely loved it – I think it was the best holiday we have ever had.  Ericeira is beautiful, unspoilt and very Portuguese.  Lovely restaurants and very friendly/helpful people everywhere we went from restaurants to cabbies.
The Lodges were unique, the girls adored the hammock and the pool was a big hit.  It felt like an oasis – they were really quite perfect.  Claudia was the perfect hostess.  She booked us a restaurant for my birthday and organised a cab to the airport.  She did a fab yoga lesson on the beach and I had a great time practising my Portuguese with her.
We only had a day in Lisbon – it was all we felt up to, preferring to relax during week 2.  Public transport was great – we took a bus which arrived when it said it would!  Portugal seems more organised and ready for tourists than it was 20 years ago.
We took the children to the Castle and walked around the squares etc. Sintra we didn’t visit, just ran out of time.  Peniche we visited last year when staying further north. We would definitely do it again.
Both the girls have mastered the surfing and want to keep it up.  They have already acquired boards!  I’d go back to Ericeira again any day.

How were the surf lessons?








The surf lessons were great.  I think at the time, it all felt a bit rushed. We had 6 consecutive lessons and being the wrong side of 40 felt aches and pains every morning!  Tobi runs a great set up there. I had a bump one day which almost put me off and Andrew asked Tobi if I could have some 1 – 1 the next day to restore confidence.  It really helped.  We rented boards 2 days during the second week too and they were very helpful with price/wax/where to go etc.

We loved it.  The set up at the ecolodges suited us and we met all the other families there which meant our kids were able to socialise with others their age. The surf lessons gave us some structure to the week and we also fitted in trips to Sintra and Lisbon (we caught the train in from Sintra which has a great car park and saved us the hassle of finding our way through a large city we didn’t know well). We did the right thing in renting a car - otherwise our options for getting around would have been limited. All in all a great holiday and we may well go back

We all had a great time in the Eco lodges... very simple but perfectly fine for what we wanted. The lodges were clean and tidy, and the whole Eco lodge site was so peaceful. The children made good use of the table tennis and the pool table, and even enjoyed the ‘eco pool’, although it took some getting used to!
We spent several evenings by the BBQ, listening to the frogs whilst drinking our beers! Ericeira was a charming town with lots of character, dotted with endless restaurants. We visited numerous beaches and spent one morning in Sintra but didn’t do it justice...we need to go back and explore properly. All in all, the holiday was a great success and I would love to think that we will return one day

The holiday in a nutshell was fantastic. It was our first visit to Portugal and I have to say we were bowled over by the genuine friendliness, warmth and hospitality of the locals.
We got off to a very good start with the info included in the welcome pack. Directions from airport were spot on. List of restaurants was very helpful - we were amused to realise that everybodies first port of call is Tik Tak. Lovely place and great staff.
Pedro, Juan and all the crew were lovely - we met them all again at the lodges for the weekly bbq hosted by the Mayor on Monday - That was great fun - we were so taken by surprise to be invited  to eat with them. the other Irish family (the Garveys from dublin) were also there so we had such a great laugh, eat delicious food and drank lots or really nice local wines and Sangres!
Ericeira is such a lovely town - its best attraction is that there is no mass tourism there. No loud trashy people or shops in sight. The lodges were great -  the accommodation itself was basic but the outdoors more than make up for it.
Loads of places to chillout and catch some sun. Its also a very sociable place (one of the main reasons we booked) - luckily the Garveys were there as they also had 3 children to keep our 3 company. Had great fun with some Portuguese tourists staying there also.
The weather was fantastic while we were there.  All in all we had a superb time. I wouldn’t hesitate recommending it to anyone who is into surfing. Would have no problem returning here again for another week.

Surfing went great - Toby and Flavio could not have been nicer. Talk about chilled out guys! We had a great night out with Flavio and the other surfers from the surf school on the Wednesday night. The local beaches were nice and we were in a pretty relaxed/lazy mode so we didnt travel to any other beaches or towns (as we thought we might).

We had a fantastic holiday! The lodges were lovely and the complex felt like a little oasis. We had a battle for the hammock most days but the girls usually won. They got into the routine of taking their duvet out at about midnight having a quiet chat and star gaze either end of the hammock till 1am then coming in to sleep.
The pool was lovely (once we got over the frogs and the green-ness!) The facilities were fab. The kids loved the pool table, the old radio and the sitting area. I dont think the photos that you have on your site do the place justice. The whole concept of eco-ness is great, we recycled everything and we only used one bin back for the entire fortnight -unheard of at home. The other lodges had families with kids around similar ages, so they all got on like a house on fire, we had English, Welsh, Irish and German families, they entertained themselves in the pool and in the games room.  We got out and about too.
Sintra is gorgeous, but the girls didn't think so when we made them walk right to the top to the castle walls ha ha. I promised them a great view, just as we got there the cloud wafted right over and there was absolutely no view!! Oh dear not popular on that day. We went to Mafra -great church and nice place for lunch, also went to Lisbon on a rainy day -bit of shopping and lunch in the Hard Rock Cafe -very Portuguese :)
The beaches were beautiful, we went to a few - definitely need a hire car if you want to explore, the countryside is stunning. The girls enjoyed the surfing, we enjoyed lazing! Eating out was great and really good value. We went to Tik tak a few times, always really busy but good food.
Ericeira is a lovely place and everyone was really friendly. We would definitely go back. We have raved about the holiday to friends and family. Sad it is over. Hope that feedback is helpful.

We loved our stay at the Eco Lodges and Ericeira was wonderful. The water in the natural pool looks a little green which made me sceptic at first, but it was by far the nicest and cleanest pool I have ever swam in, and that is competing with salt water outdoor pools in Vancouver (which are pretty nice). You feel much cleaner coming out than going in, ;)!
The set up of the resort is great, with the right amount of amenities, recycling facilities and relaxing areas. Also really liked the re-use element, like the honesty bar and food cabinet. It felt so much better to buy a big bottle of washing liquid knowing that someone else will use it after us. All and all perfect!  If you want any "critique" at all, I would say that I would like a little more shelf/hanging space on the first floor in the lodge. Places to hang up coats (which we brung but didn't use), put down phones/wallets/sun screen/keys/etc.
Ericeira was great. The weekend initiatives of the locals, like cleaning the beach with the fam, doing yoga on the beach was heartwarming. I am a sucker for these things. Even my six year old daughter noticed and commented on the fact that Ericeira was much cleaner than Stockholm.

We came at a good time with not too many tourist, and got pretty much private surfing lessons. Flavio was a great instructor and we both felt we got a lot out of our lessons. Hopefully next year the girls are big enough to dare to try out surfing!

The lodges are very nice and very convenient for the old town, if not the beaches. A car is really a must, unless you are being picked up by the surf school.  The journey from Lisbon airport is very easy too,  but leave plenty of time to get the hire car back because the return system is poor in high season!

Well we had an amazing time in Ericeira. The lodges are really cool and unique as you said. It was gread to chill in the evenings and also to meet other surfers. We really used the pool and vegetables they have and the barbecue area....really perfect! And also the lodges are not that far from the city centre if you want to walk at night. But it is good to have a car. We rent a car to get to the different beaches and it is worth it.
On 2 days it was raining or the waves to high. On one rainy day we went to Lissabon which is so close! We also went to Sintra to see the castle and to Obidos because it is really charming too. On the first day we went to Peniche and saw the half finals and the final of the Rip Curl pro surfcontest. There are a lot of different things to see in the area.
The beaches were really amazing and Ericeria town itself really cool. The restaurant we most liked was the Tick Tack! Great food and great people! The portugese people were in general so nice! Well i talk portuguese but it is really easy to get along with english too.  Hope we can go back soon!

We had a good time with Alvaro at the surf school. I first didn't think of taking surf lessons but then it was almost the same price to have 2 hours of lesson every day than rent a board and wet suit. If you are beginner 2 hours of surfing really is enough. So i took surf lessons and my boyfriend rented a board from the naonda surf school. This was really cool and Alvaro was a good teacher and he always took us to good beaches and gave tips also if it wasn't a lesson.  So we surfed 4 days of 6 (travel days not included)

We had a great holiday. We liked the lodges very much and would almost fight over the hammock on our balcony. My only quibble was that there were no reading lights in the bedrooms. Lovely to be able to add fresh herbs to your lunch! And beautifully landscaped.
We absolutely loved Ericeira and had great food every day with probably Tik Tak Tapas our best experience. We also went to Torres Vedra where there is a great museum about the lines to defend against Napoleon. We all enjoyed our holiday very much and would certainly go back to Portugal and that area. If you go surfing it makes it quite difficult to do any sightseeing, which absolutely delighted the rest of my family!

How were the surf lessons?








The surf lessons went OK and were enjoyed. There were some communication problems though in terms of timing. On the second day we turned up at the same time as the first day but were two or three hours too early - they had not told us what time to come. Then they explained that every day the lesson would be one hour later because of the tides. I am not a beach person myself but loved the beaches in that area and was very happy to spend time on the beach and in the cafes. They were so well organized and clean.

The lodges are great, really liked them. Arrival etc was a little bit annoying as we had to wait 20 minutes for Anja to turn up and let us in - but she'd never checked anyone in before so needed to hunt for keys etc.  Not a big issue.  We ate in Bella Sombra on the beach, or the Na Onda itself. Found a simple grill place that did good fish, or tried shellfish one night. Sintra is brilliant, well worth a visit. Loved Lisbon too. All in all very satisfied though, would recommend people to go

Just back from our first surf experience in Ericeira. What can I say it was one of the best holidays we had as a family, we are an active bunch but you know what we had the right combination of physical activity and then coming back to the lodge which gave us the chance to relax with each other after the surfing .
The fresh water pool was a new experience  as was the games room a real treat for our boys its the first time they could play pool without having to ask for money.
Eating out in Ericera was not only great value but a high standard of food especially if you like fish. Every restaurant you recommended we could not fault.
The staff were very professional and helpful Tobi kept in touch every day to let us know what time the surf was on.   We will be booking again.

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing was exhilarating hard work, addictive and even though I ski and run the effect on the body was amazing great for your core strength. If you want to loose a few pounds and tone up its a guarantee you would get a result.
We were well looked after at the beach by the instructors Flavio and Joanne were great and Flavio looked after my two boys when the powerful waves got too much for them he showed them tricks in the water and entertained them while still helping those who were surfing which meant I was able to surf .
I havn't stopped raving about it since Ive been home and I would say to anyone don't be put off if your not a great swimmer because its not about being able to swim in the sea its about having fun getting exercise and feeling alive and energised and the best bit at night you can eat and drink all you like because you work it all off the next day. its the first holiday I've been on that i came home in better shape than when I left.

The ecolodges were great-  the frogs were a bit noisy at night!

Ate lots of great fish and had a nice evening in Tik Tak.  We’re saving up for our next trip!

Ericeira is just the kind of coastal "town" we like and appreciate for its charm, its authenticity and its size plus the balance between the local population and the tourists. In Denmark we live just 30 min drive north of Copenhagen and at holiday we also enjoy staying in a short distance of a greater city, in this case Lisbon. People we´ve met are all very nice and friendy/open.

The climate/temperature was nice. The Ecolodges are unique and we liked very much staying there because of "it all": The houses, the mutual  facilities, the swimming lake, the fact that it´s a closed area and it feels safe. We also enjoyed the company of the other families and children - it is the first time we´ve spend a holiday staying and meeting to many British and Irish people, and that was great fun, we like you guys a lot! THE SURFING was fun! We´d looked forward to it and Toby and his crew at the surf school were very friendly and did a good job.

The transport with Renate´s company Stop and Go worked very well.  She is very nice and good at service, punctual and so on.  THE RESTAURANTS were actually a bit better than I´d expected, to our taste TIK TAK being the best, mind you we didn´t try a lot - and some of the other guests had other preferences, all liked Tik Tak very much. And Pedro took very good care of us! SHOPPING was also a bit better than I´d expected as we could enjoy a stroll just window shopping, and we also bought some cloth both for the boys and for myself.

As to food we fancied the little grocer 50 m up the street a lot - please let it always stay like this. We enjoyed it A LOT! Lidl and Aldi - go home! I mean, we bought basic start of sugar and that kind of thing but - like in the stores they have here in Denmark - it´s a big job to find low fat and healthy food products, I find. We went to Lisbon twice (without staying overnight). We did plan to go to Sintra but got caught up by lack of time. Has been great and we might very well get back to you again.

Myself and Donna had a brilliant time in Ericeira. The Eco-lodges are amazing, really enjoyed the whole laid back atmosphere of the place, relaxing by the pool, having bar-b-que’s and just sitting back with a beer and taking it easy. The lodges themselves are extremely clean and very comfortable. It’s very obvious that a huge amount of thought and care has gone into developing the place to a very high standard.

Having a few beers and tosta mistas in Na Onda’s after the surfing was always a nice finish to a day down the beach. We ate out a good bit, food and drink there is excellent value, Tik Tak and Tik Tapas are very good and we also really enjoyed the steaks and Piri Piri chicken in Prim (amazing local seafood in both places too). We’ll definitely be back, we’ve been recommending it to all our friends and family who are looking for something a little different to the usual “Sun” holiday.

I would suggest to people to maybe spend a day or two in Lisbon, there’s a great buzz to the place, lots of history and local festivals to be found, with great craic to be had in the Bairro Alto area if people are in the mood for beers and cocktails (atmosphere reminded me a bit of Galway).

We were down at the beach every day for the Surfing with Flavio and Johanna, they were brilliant and very patient, made sure everybody learned exactly what was needed to get standing up and surfing properly. The beaches were spotless and the surf was great.

We had a lovely holiday. The Eco Lodge complex was absolutely beautiful without a doubt,  the houses themselves were basic and comfortable and that suited us fine. We were given a really warm welcome by Toby (by the way the directions to the Lodges were fab) and we were very impressed with the idea of helping ourselves to the fruit and veg in the garden and also the idea of the honesty bar.

When we explored the complex (I'm sure thats not the right word for it!) I was really impressed. The whole concept was so beautiful and I do understand that that's what you're really paying for-the beauty and tranquillity. Ericeira is a beautiful place. The beaches were numerous, extremely beautiful and impressively clean. We went out to see the surf competition two days. That was really amazing.

The restaurants- where do I begin!!! Well we started in TikTak. We went to La Pizza. We went to Prim. And then we started over again!!!! The seafood we ate was, without exception, the best food we have ever eaten on holidays. We also enjoyed 2 lovely lunches, compliments of Tik Tak and friends at the Ecolodges. They came there to bbq the results of their fishing expeditions and together with the owner of the lodges, were very gracious hosts.


How were the surf lessons?








4 of us started the surf lessons but only the girls kept going 2 the end. Both my daughter and I really , really enjoyed the surfing.  I was pretty useless at it but nonetheless had a ball.
Our 15 year old daughter was the star pupil. As beginners we were in quite rough water but I think that was a good thing as I know in Lahinch, (which is right beside where I come from in Clare) they seem to put beginners in fairly calm waters.
It surprised me just what a physically demanding sport it is and I now understand why surfers look the way they do!

Wow! What an amazing holiday. I am lost for words, for once! I was just blown away by everything - the beach, the fishing village itself, and of course the lodges (which were right up my street)
We used the BBQ nearly every evening, and I am a bit of a hippie so I just loved the whole concept and ethos of the lodges.

We had a ball. I've been raving about it since and really hope to get back there next Easter.  The whole experience was amazing. The people were so nice. From the minute we arrived and Renata collected us, to meeting Tobi and our instructor Flavio. I couldn't praise them enough. Everyone was so friendly and helpful.
The accommodation was in a great location and well kitted out. The town was gorgeous. I was expecting a tiny little village with nothing much to see or do.  On the contrary the town was a happening place. We tried out most of the restaurants on the list and the food in Ericeira was divine. I've been on a few yoga holidays abroad but I thought that the surfing holiday was great value for money. I can't wait to go again.

How were the surf lessons?








We all really loved the surf lessons and had great craic with Flavio. By day 3 we thought we'd never be able to last till the end, because there were aches in muscles we didn't know we had. But I'm glad to say we lasted till the end and had forgotten about the pain by then.

The trip was fantastic.  We loved Ericeira, a beautiful old fishing town with great seafood and a lovely relaxed atmosphere.  The lodges were great, less than a 5 minute walk from the town centre.  Toby, Flavio (surf instructor) and Renee (transport) were great.  We loved the people, very chilled out with a sense of humour. It was really nice to chill out at the beach bar after surfing and the Ondi goatscheese salad is really good!

The lodges were lovely and we felt taken care of, as we were offered lifts down to the beach for the surf lessons every day. The beaches, the area and the restaurants were all lovely, so I will be recommending the place to others.

How were the surf lessons?



We had two surf lessons.  We had a proper lesson on the first day, but unfortuantely the waves were too strong on the second day so we only had a half hour session on paddling, rather than a full 2 hour session. Saying that, the instructor on the second day (when we did the paddling) spent a lot of time explaining things to us.

Had a lovely time in Ericeira.  The lodges were great! Very unique and lovely atmosphere.  Only suggestion would be that they had a little welcome pack of Coffee, Tea, Sugar and Pepper, Salt, cooking oil and detergent in lodge when you arrived but apart from that loved them.  The car was really handy as it was not really walkable to surfing beach with kit. Food at the beach was the same price as town which was great and handy.  They loved it.  We went to Tik Tak (not bad) although I think there are some better ones.  We didnt eat out alot.

Didnt do much travelling about sadly as girlfriend was more up for lazing at the pool.  Some of the other residents went to Lisbon (they were there for longer) said it was brilliant.  Would love to go back to Lisbon in Autumn.  Travelled to a few other beaches to check out but would only go with local advice on breaks etc.  Met most of your other clients who all had teenage girls (our boys were thrilled) so they had a good time together.

Vila Gale was great for the last two days as it meant we didnt have to think really about meals and just chilled.  Staff were attentive and rooms very comfortable.  Breakfasts were great and it was great overlooking the coast etc.  Even though we would have liked lodges the whole week it was a nice change at the end.  Everything was so close by.  Getting to and from airport so easy

We had a great time in Ericeira in the EcoLodges and with the surf school. Tobi and Renata, the driver, were very good to us and have a great set up. It was fantastic to get our lunch at the beach bar after finishing in the water in the morning.
The Lodges were great -  peaceful and relaxing. And the town is quite pretty. We ate out so well in seafood and fish restaurants, particularly the Mar da Vista and the Mar d'Areia and everyone around the town was so friendly

How were the surf lessons?








Our surf instructor, Flavio was absolutely excellent, so encouraging and you could really tell he wanted us all to learn the real skills and lose the bad habits we had learnt in Ireland!!! I learnt an awful lot thanks to him.

The holiday went really well, we fell in love with Ericeira and  will definitely go back.  Toby invited us to a beach party on our  last night, which was a nice touch.  There's something about this place  that makes you feel at home.
We had three teenagers with us and they  loved the lodges.  They loved the pool and all the common room to hang  out and the hammock to relax.  We met great people at the lodges,  Catherine, John, Brian & Hannah, who very kindly let us have showers  in their lodge before our flight home - great neighbours!!
The Lodges  are in a beautiful peaceful setting, very tranquil. We had three  vegetarians with us (one doesn't eat fish) so we found Pedra Dura, Pinta  and Prim catered better for their needs.  Great food everywhere anyway  and very reasonable too.
If I was to give any piece of advice it would be  to pack light, this is a laid back place with cobble streets so no high  heels or fancy clothes required. We should of packed for sun in the day  and just a couple of pairs of jeans for the night. Once the sun goes  down it gets cool enough just for jeans and a jumper.

The surf lessons were great and the  instructors were really great guys. We did 10 lessons in the two weeks  and loved every minute of it.

The  lodges were really better than they appeared on the website and really  made the surfing holiday. Tik Tak was one of our favourites and another down by the sea that i can’t remember the  name of, but overall the food was great.  Tobi was a great help and  basically helped orgainse everything for us.  We used the bus every now and again.

The surf was great too, missed a few days as  it was too big but 3 of the lads got out everyday.

Wow what a surf holiday! Completely unique and unlike any other  we've ever been on and would definitely go back in a shot. We were all hugely impressed with  the Eco-Lodges, which are very near to the centre of town, and a bit  further from the beach. The "lodges" themselves are perfect for 4 -  really we were only in them to sleep and shower. The rest of the time we  spent by the awesome grill and table by the natural pool, having  bought  food and drink very cheaply from the local markets.

I've got to  say the natural pool was probably the best thing about the lodges. Free  from salt or chlorine, the pool is home to an ecosystem of plants,  lilies and frogs (one of our group actually had an acute fear of frogs  and grew to love them by the end!). Seriously though, it actually feels  like you are swimming in a picturesque pond, refreshing and natural  after a tough day's surfing. There's also a deck which we spent a lot of  time on, usually between 4-8 in the afternoon, lying/sleeping, just  generally chilling in the sun - nice!

We couldn't actually find any hire cars (one of the group who  knows who he is was too lazy to arrange!), but to our luck it worked out  that we didn't need one at all. The driver Renata was really helpful,  would pick us up each morning to take us to the beach, and always very  happy to do a detour on the way back via supermarket or cashpoint. It  almost felt as if she was a personal chauffeur to our group, and worked  out much better value than 2 cars would have been (also we'd have ended  up lost the whole time).

On the last night Tobi (who owns the beach  bar/restaurant) hosted a massive party - a big bbq first followed by  some eclectic Reggae-Beats served up by Gi-Gi - son of the owner of the  best fish restaurant in town (seriously fresh fish grilled to perfection  - especially the clams) and generally an all-round hero. This finished  at around 2, then on to 121 bar to ensure we all had good hangovers to  travel back with.  To sum it up, this place is brilliant for a small  group (we were 8). You do not see many tourists and can properly chill  in Ericeira wherever you are as it feels so far from the UK. We would  all highly recommend the lodges and surf lessons, and guarantee you will  catch "the bug" (surfing not swine flu) if you've not already!

How were the surf lessons?








All of us  were complete surfing novices when we left the UK, and we returned all  able to stand and catch waves, so a massive success on that front,  thanks to the expert tuition from "Coach Flavio", who imparted his local  wisdom of the waves on each of us.
The surf groups tended to be more  mixed in the morning, so for real beginners this is the best option.
However, after the first few we found that we got more from the  afternoon sessions, slightly higher standards, smaller groups and less kids.

We had an absolute ball in Ericeira - well probably to be more  precise it was the lodges and the other people there that really made it  for us. Age ranged from 4 - 71 and we all got on famously. We even  organised a big Barbie one of the evenings for everyone (bar the  kiddies) - there was something like 21 of us...which turned into a mock  wedding of the 71 year old and myself, there were speeches and throwing of  the bouquet. So all in all a great holiday.

Oh my god, I loved it. I think it was seriously one of the best  holidays I've ever had! The lodges are gorgeous and so peaceful. We got to know everyone in  them by the end! Its amazing listening to the birds and frogs- felt like we were in the tropics.
We usually went back to lodges afterwards, had some lunch and  chilled out on the sun loungers...we all usually fell asleep for a  couple of hours!! One day we ate in Tobi's place at the beach- food is so good actually and then we sunbathed on the beach- totally blissful! Two of the evenings we had a yoga class with Carla. Oh my god, she is so  lovely. Then we'd head out to the town for dinner.
I'm afraid we only  got as far as Prim and Tik tak!! We went to both places at least twice!  It was just so good!! Pedro was so nice. Had the sea bass and steak...to  die for. I keep dreaming about them still. All the food is just so  fresh and tasty. It was my perfect mix of a perfect holiday...surf,  yoga, food, wine and sun....and chilled!!!

We loved the Eco Lodges. We stayed at Ana Margarida Villas last year but with 2 older kids the 2 bed lodges were better for us even if Ana Margarida was nearer the skatepark. The natural swimming pool was never too cold and the whole place was very chilled and relaxing. Plenty of sun loungers and enough space around each villa to make it all very peaceful. It's just a short walk into town and even Foz do Lozandro beach is walkable from here.

Surf lessons at Na Ondo were good although it gets very busy by end July/August.

This is where you surf  Europe's best coast line and let the fun begin.There are over 12 surf  breaks along the Ericeira coast, with different options for all standards. With so much choice you'll feel like a kid in a sweet shop! The area was introduced in the Stormriders Surf Guide to Europe with the heading "Enter the Heartland".


World Surf Reserve
In 2011 it was awarded the title of 'World Surf Reserve', there are only 2 other places in the world that share the title: Santa Cruz, US and Manly, Australia.

If it is your first surfing holiday to Ericeira then head straight to
Foz do Lizandro
and
Sao Juliao
beaches south of town, they are perfect beginner and intermediate surf spots. Closer to town is
Praia do Sul
. Another great beginner beach breaks. All best at mid tide but surfable at high and low tide also.

For Intermediates you have the reliable and safe reef break
Ribeira d'Ilhas
, which host the WSL World qualifying series surf championships every year. And for the more adventurous you have the world class
Coxos
. That's just naming a few, there are too many surf breaks to mention here!

Don't forget to explore further up the coast - 25 minutes away is Santa Cruz and an hour away is
Peniche
, home to the World renowned Supertubos and host of the Rip Curl Pro since 2009. 30 minutes south of Lisbon is the
Cascais
coast with the famous Praia do Guincho surf beach. And when north winds are blowing you can venture further south towards
Carcevelos
beach and the other surf spots along the Lisbon coast.
