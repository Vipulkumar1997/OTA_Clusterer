History of Surfing in Mexico

Rumour has it that Baja was first surfed as early as the 1940s by day tripping southern Californian surfers. However, the first documented surf was by
Mike Hynson and Bill Fury
somewhere just south of Ensenada in 1963. The Windansea Surf Club from San Diego came to surf big wave spot Todos Santos two years later.
Baja's first surf contest, the Baja Surf Club International, was held from 1966-1969 at San Miguel.
But the real credit of introducing surfing in Mexico goes to
Ignacio Félix Cota
who was one of the first to introduce the sport to the Mexican shores. Nacho Félix made Mexican surfing history by winning a world championship in San Diego, California, in 1965.
Other notable people who influenced surfing in Mexico were
Arturo Monroy, Rodrigo Huerta, Juan García, Luis Skeen and Alfonso Polidura
.

After the Trans Baja highway opened in '73, connecting the top to the tip, Northern Baja lost some allure for more "hardcore" travellers who loved camping out in the dirt to score long point waves in places like Scorpion Bay and Abreojos further down. But its proximity to the border and consistent surf insured that Northern Baja would forever remain popular with visiting surfers.
What's
the surf like in Mexico?



The Pacific coast of Mexico extends from
the dry and arid north to the lush green tropical south with a massive amount
of river mouths, point breaks, reefs and beach breaks littered along the coast
line, with the board and body breaking waves of
Puerto Escondido and Pascuales
being the most famous Mexico surf spots.
During the winter months of December to February, north-west swells propagate down from the Pacific
with south-west swells dominating for the rest of the year.

Baja
is a very popular destination for US
surfers, especially Californians who hop over the border to surf Baja’s famed
right-hand point breaks and have fun in the pounding shore-breaks, which surfing in Mexico is known for. Baja
picks up south-west swells from May to September and north-west swells from
October to April. Dominant winds blow from the north-west, but winter offshores
are common.


Where to Surf in Mexico:
1. Tijuana & Rosarito
Just over the border of the US lies Baja,
where the first stop is
Tijuana
,
this lively town is best known for its fun and wild night life, as opposed to
its beach break waves. It’s a great place to visit to blow off some steam and
stock up on souvenirs!
Baja Malibu
is a powerful and consistent peaky beach break that takes any swell from S to
NW and is best from low to mid tide, and due to the variety of peaks.
Rosarito
, a few miles further south, has a long stretch of exposed beach break
scattered with reefs and river mouths. It's a crowded party town with a great mix of restaurants and bars. Both towns are good and lively options for a Mexico surf holiday.
What you’ll find in Baja is that distance
markers in kilometres are used to name breaks like
K-38
and
K-38.5
which do
get busy due to the easy access and quality waves, but you can still get a peak
to yourself and works all year round, perfect for those on a Mexico surf trip.

Those looking to progress their surfing to
the next level, as well as those looking for more intermediate surf Mexico offers should head to spots such as
K-40
,
Las Gaviotas
and
Raul's
that provide waves with a bit more of a punch.
Salsipuedes
and
San Miguel
are legendary Baja right hand point breaks that will provide surfers of any
ability the best rides of their life, with small swells still lining up for
beginners. However, when big swells filter in they should only be tackled by
intermediate and advanced surfers.
2. Ensenada
A tourist town and weekend break spot for many US and Mexicans it is also the jumping-off point for Baja's most
famous wave, known as
Killers
, this
legendary big wave spot on the island of
Todos
Santos
is one of the best destination an experienced surfer will encounter.
Whilst this is a wave that should only be surfed by the most advanced surfers,
you can go out and explore the island and witness these mountains of water by
renting a boat and skipper for $100(USD) between 6 people, for a once-in-a-life
Mexico surf holiday experience.
3. Central Coastline of Baja
Once you venture to the southern part of
Baja, past Ensenada, is where the true Bajan experience begins as the towns
become fewer, the land dustier and the waves become deserted.
It’s an
exceptionally beautiful landscape with pink and orange hued rocks, green cacti
and azure blue waters, and it’s these back drops that surfing in Mexico is all about.

For those looking for beginner surf, Mexico has the answer, the towns of
Punta San Jose
or Punta Cabras
have great point, reef and beach break waves, and due to the
kelp beds that line the bottom they are regularly glassy all day long.
Follow
the paved road that leads to the fun reefs and beaches of
K-181
and the
well-stocked town of
Erendira
.

As you go south of here, access becomes a
bit more difficult with dusty tracks and hole riddled roads, yet once you reach
San Telmo de Abajo

it turns into a long-boarder’s, as well
as a beginner’s, paradise as the waves are forgiving and mellow.
At Rincon de
Baja, also known as
Freighters,
located
in Punta San Jacinto, you will score some of the longest right hand waves in
Mexico making for one of the best Mexico
surf spots.


4. Los Cabos
Los
Cabos lies at the bottom of Baja’s 750 mile long
finger and is home to rocky headlands, beautiful white sandy beaches and turquoise waters
along with a great selection of waves. This southern tip of Baja is open to a wide
swell window that covers NNW to SE and when coupled with the higher quality of
roads they have down here, makes scoring some of the best surf in Mexico highly
likely.
Los Cabos best swell direction is from the south, from either long
distance lows or hurricane swells, your guides on our Mexico surf tours will know the best spots to head to on any given
day.
In the
Palm
Beach
and
San

Pedrito
areas you’ll find a very
artistic vibe and fantastic uncrowded waves. The
Pescadero
reefs offer great conditions for all levels of surfers as
the waves break close to the shore and pick up the smallest of swells.
One of
the best beginner waves in Mexico is
Cerritos
,
set amongst jaw dropping scenery, this slow peeling, walling, right hand point
break provides the perfect set up for someone new to surfing, as well as all
levels of long-boarders on their dream Mexico
surf camp trip.

Cabo
San Lucas
is home to the infamous
Backwash,
a flaring hollow shore break
that is a heaven for skim boarders and body boarders, offering you a one of a
kind surfing in Mexico experience.

Spend the day here, sitting in the shade of
an umbrella from the sizzling sun, as you watch the fun unfold in front of you.
Next door you’ll find
Monuments,
a
left hand wave that offers faster walls due to an offshore submarine canyon, a
great spot to head to for beginner and intermediate surfers and a special
Mexico surf
experience.

Punta
Palmilla
is a resort town where you will find
energetic night life, delicious local cuisine and several surf breaks for all
levels of surfers.

La
Punta
is a right hand wave that can handle large swells
so will appeal to intermediate surfers ready to jump to the next level when on staying in on of our Mexico surf resorts.
Costa
Azul
has three sections that comes to life on specific swells;
Acapulcito
breaks on larger swells and
provides some of the longest rides in the area, this feathers in to
The Rock
which can offer up punchy
walls, whilst further in you will find
Zippers
,
a fast breaking right hand wave that will appeal to regular footed surfers
looking at brushing up on their technique in the Mexico surf.

The whole of Los Cabos is a haven for
marine life, so participate in some big game fishing or whale watching, making
sure to keep your eye out for migrating humpback whales. Cabo has become a
booming tourist area and for those who want to let loose for a night head to
the areas
Squid Roe Strip
for a wild
night out!

5. Puerto Vallerta & Sayulita
The area from
Puerto Vallarta
to just north of
Mazatlan
is one of mainland Mexico's most populated and accessible
tourist destinations. Its proximity to the US, dependably decent summertime
surf and laid-back lifestyle ensure its popularity with surfers of all shapes,
sizes and skill levels will increase.
It's easy to get here, easy to find a place
to stay, most of the region's waves are easy to surf and after an all-day
session at one of the region's left point breaks, watching the sunset from a
beach-side bar with an ice cold corona in your hand, well, it doesn’t get much
better!
In the southern part of the state of
Nayarit
lies the emerging Mexico surf holiday town of
Sayulita,
located just 30 miles from
the Puerto Vallarta International Airport, it’s easily accessible but still
boasts rural charm. It has experienced a boom in the last decade thanks to its
beautiful beaches, laid back atmosphere and fantastic waves for all abilities.
Crystal clear waters, white sandy beaches
and perfect left and right waves is what’s on offer at
Sayulita beach
. Breaking over patches of rock, but mainly sand
bottomed, Sayulita is a beginner to intermediate surfers dream. After a surf,
drag your board up to the shade of an umbrella and refuel on the cheap and
plentiful fish tacos.

Playa Escondida
is located just a 4 minute walk from the
mesmirising waters
of Sayulita and offers both left and right peaks for
beginner surfers, whilst when the swell reaches overhead, it can produce some
step walls and hollow barrels for intermediate and advanced surfers.
El Faro
is a regular footers dream as
this sand bottomed point break offers up long right hand walls that are perfect
for mals or long boards.
Twenty minutes to the north of Sayulita you’ll find
Lola’s,
a perfect left hand wall that
break in a picture perfect jungle cove, when the swell runs about chest height
the wave links up and produces some of the longest waves that you’ll find at
any of our Mexico surf resorts.

What makes Sayulita so appealing as a Mexico surf trip destination is that it has a lot
on offer away from the waves, such as horseback riding, hiking trails, jungle
canopy tours, snorkelling, bird watching tours and much more to keep people of
all ages entertained and happy.

Sayulita is a good place to experience what a stay is like at a Mexico surf camp. It's gained a reputation as a booming
hipster/surf scene and this results in a
safe, amicable and quaint little town
.
There are numerous art galleries to browse and high-end restaurants that cater
to foodies, with small deli’s that serve up cheap and delicious local cuisine in
addition to the healthy juice bars that will refuel you in between surf
sessions.
There are also a host of
yoga and pilates studios
that will aid you
in relaxation and flexibility, a great option for those post surf wind downs.

The beauty of the area combined
with the warm, friendly vibes from locals and tourists, as well as easy access
to Puerto Vallarta, have made Sayulita surf holidays a must go to destination
for surfers all around the world.
6. Pascuales
As you
head further South you’ll arrive into
Colima
where you will find
relatively new toll roads that are perfect for exploring the coast’s wide range
of waves for all abilities of surfers.
Colima is one of the smallest states in
Mexico, yet one of the most thriving. It has the lowest crime rate in the
country, nearly 0% of citizens are unemployed, has the largest port in the
country, home to one of the top universities in the country and has an
international airport in the port city of Manzanillo.

Colima is
home to
Pascuales
, which is the state’s best wave and arguably one of
the best Mexico surf spots. It offers fun waves when the swell is chest
height and below, but when an overhead southerly swell hits, it should only be
tackled by experts.

In
Boca
de Pascuales
you’ll find the hugely popular legendary eatery
Las Hamacas
del Mayor
which can seat up to 1000 people. Colourful mariachis entertain
the crowd of tourists and locals, people swim in the pool and there are unrivalled
views of surfers tackling Pascuales. Make sure you try delicious local
specialties such as fish fillets stuffed with octopus and shrimp.

South of
Pascuales you’ll find
Boca de Apiza,
a beautiful fishing town that is
surrounded by deep green vegetation, a
jaw droppingly beautiful location
for a Mexico surfing holiday.

The beach
itself provides excellent peaky left and right hand waves and for those who
like the bigger walls are also in luck, when NW swells pour in a big left hand
wall starts to break across the river mouth, providing some of the best intermediate
surf Mexico hast to offer.
7. Michocan
On South is the state of
Michoacan
where you may
encounter some poverty in the area, which makes it harder to access unnamed
spots, but don’t let that deter you, you can be rewarded with some great surf
with the help of a guide and a 4x4.
It has
every type of wave here and a very slow pace of life which you find out as soon
as you hit Highway 200, a road with one lane each way, limited turnouts,
virtually no shoulders, and tropical plants grow to the road’s edge. Average
speeds slow to about 40 miles per hour which perfectly illustrates the
lifestyle here.

You come
to Michoacan to slow down, surf the stiff morning offshores, relax with a chorizo
and egg tortilla or a fresh fruit salad, take a siesta, drink a cerveza, surf
in the evening and get an early night, only to repeat this over and over again.
Highly recommended waves are the peeling river mouth waves of
La Ticla
and
Nexpa
that make for a memorable Mexico surf experience.
8. Zihuatanjo (Zihua)
Zihua, as it’s now lovingly called, is a paradise of beautiful beaches and friendly locals which is tied together with easy going vibes.
It sits just a shade north of the centre of the state of Guerrero’s
coastline and is a fantastic place for surfers of all levels to explore.
La Saladita
offers up incredibly long
left hand walls that can run for over a minute, if your arms can keep up with
all the paddle! When on your Mexico surf trip, expert guides will be able to
take you to uncrowded waves such as
Barra
de Potosi
and the beach break peaks around
Tenexpa
, where more than likely you’ll be surfing in solitude but
on our surf tours Mexico you’ll be sharing the waves with your friends.

Zihua despite its tourism boom has retained
its historic charm with the narrow cobblestone streets of downtown, it is the
perfect area to amble along and browse the abundant and delicious local
restaurants, cool bars, boutiques, galleries and museums.
Paseo del Pescador
(Fishermen’s Passage) is a great place to
experience the traditional way of life, head there in the morning and pick up their
catch of the day to grill on an open beach fire after an afternoon of surf
sessions.(It’s no surprise to us that Andy and Red chose to live out their
post-prison days here in Zuhua, in
The Shawshank Redemption
).
30Km north, up the coast is the small village of
Troncones
, a great place to escape from any tourist hustle and surrounded buy gorgeous beaches and a few surf gems.
9. Acapulco area
Next stop South in the state of
Guerrero
where you’ll find the resort city of
Acapulco
,
set on a large bay backed by high-rises and the Sierra Madre del Sur Mountains.
Known for its high-energy nightlife and beaches along Acapulco Bay and the
Acapulco Diamante area. Some great fun away from the waves includes watching
the divers jump daily from
the iconic La Quebrada cliff
into a small cove.
The
hilltop fort of Fuerte de San Diego, with a history museum, overlooks the old
town and is a great place to spend a few hours away from the surf.

Guerrero is home to the wave that put
Mexico on the surfing map,
Petacalco
,
a world-class right that provides top to bottom barrels with its big and fun
peaks that even work chest height and below.
West Guerrero is full of top
quality beach breaks, points and reef/sand combos… all the right ingredients to
make your Mexico surf camp the best
experience possible!

With the right swell (small to medium) and
some northerly or easterly winds, there’s plenty of lightly surfed waves at
places like
Copala
,
La Bocana
or the left point at
Maldonado
, which has S wind protection
and more options in the immediate area.
10. Zicatela & Puerto Escondido
This is the
most famous of Mexico’s surfing areas, in the state of
Oaxaca
,

(pronounced wah-HA-ka), home to
arguably the heaviest wave in the country, the
Mexican pipeline
, in the
Zicatela
beach located in the town of
Puerto Escondido
. This top to bottom
pitching wave is the jewel of surfing in
Mexico, the wave should only be tackled by intermediate to advanced surfers
who are comfortable in big surf and are looking for an adrenaline fuelled Mexico surfing holiday.

At the southern end of the beach you’ll
find
La Punta
, a left hand point
break that offers long walls with a few steeper sections for practising your
turns, perfect for beginner to intermediate level surfers on a relaxing and fun

surf tour in Mexico
.

The town is a lively mix of locals, expats
and tourists, with plenty to see and do, it’s a magnet for surfers, would-be
surfers and every other kind of beach lover which makes it one of the best Mexico surf vacation

destinations on the Pacific
coast.

By day, you can surf, snorkel, dive, swim,
tan, horse ride across Zicatela’s golden sands, go big game fishing or look for
turtles, dolphins and whales. By night, a busy cafe, restaurant and bar scene
brings live music and a freewheeling, unpretentious nightlife.
Development here
has happened slowly over several decades, with much of Puerto's charm being
that it remains very much a fishing port and market town, as well as a tourist
destination thanks mostly to the popularity of surfing in Mexico.
On the strip at Zicatela you’ll find a host
of restaurants serving up local dishes such as chorizo tostadas and quesadillas,
whilst the offshore winds blow the aromas into the air in the late afternoon
surf, making your mouth water and your belly rumble!
You’ll also find healthy
and tasty options such as smoothies and breakfast bowls as local businesses now
cater to the healthy surfing community.
Mercado
Benito Juárez
is the local market and is a great
place to wander round looking at the array of colourful and delicious local
produce. The market is also a great place to head for a cheap after surf meal,
hospitable comedores serve up fresh fish, prawns, soups and antojitos at wallet
friendly prices.

Nearby
Punta
Colorado
is a wave that is dominated by body-boarders, however is the
perfect place to spend the day watching the action and relaxing on the white
sand that’s surrounded by lush green foliage and mountain ranges.
Even though
this area of Mexico is home to the most famous beach break in the world there
are a host of spots that include world class, sand bottomed, right hand point
breaks, it’s just the transport that becomes an issue, with the roads looking
more like dirt bike trails than roads for cars however those looking for
adventure may find this an intriguing tour.
11. Barra De La Cruz
Just 100kms south west of Salina Cruz you’ll find
Barra De La Cruz
, which became world famous after 2006’s The Search rocked up here and scored Superbank style waves. Barra De La Cruz offers great waves, from waist high to overhead in breath-taking scenery.
Located in the indigenous
Chontal
village, roughly a thirty minute car journey from
Huatulco,
this tranquil location will offer you the chance to recharge your batteries and offer you some of best surfing in Mexico.
Good swells for experienced surfers are at their most consistent during March to early October, and generally at their best in June and July. November to February is the best time for to head over for a beginner surf Mexico trip. Barra’s beautiful long beach has excellent facilities with showers, toilets and good beachside relaxation areas with hammocks, loungers and shade.
12. Salina Cruz
Located a four hour drive east of Puerto
Escondido down the Mex 200 you’ll find
Salina
Cruz,
once there you will find over eighty miles of jaw droppingly
beautiful coastline with numerous near empty waves that are perfect for
someone’s first surf and advanced surfers looking for deep barrels on their Mexico surf camp stay.
The coastline from
Huatulco
south towards
Salina Cruz consists mainly of right hand points that are framed by some of the
most beautiful beaches you’ll ever see. What makes this area so appealing to
all levels of surfers is that the vast majority of the breaks are sand-bottomed points, with
a point to suit every style and level of surfer- from the barrel hunter to
short boarders and long boarders, as well as someone who has never picked up a
board.
The curves of the coast line and range of the headlands allow
for different waves to work on different wind directions let you find perfectly
groomed offshore surf everyday while you’re staying in any one of the surf camps in Mexico in the area
.
There are
endless styles of waves
from perfect
points, powerful beach breaks, heavy barrels and super playful little peelers
to keep everyone entertained!

Mexico's Wetsuit Guide and Weather
Baja:
The hottest months of the year in Baja are
July through to September, when temperatures range from 29°C to 35°C and go
down to 25°C at night. The coldest months of the year are the first three
months, when low temperatures can reach 12°C, yet day time temperatures can
still reach 28°C.
Water temperature varies between 15°C
during winter and up to 24°C during the height of summer. Depending on your
tolerance for cold water you can wear a 4/3 or 3/2 during the winter and a
spring suit or board shorts in the summer months.


Pacific
Coast:

Mexico’s Sierra Madre is a high mountain
range, which prevents cloud cover from reaching the coast. During the wet
season (May-Sept) night-time thunderstorms can be torrential, with temperatures
at their highest this time of year, and when combined with the humidity, make
for constantly
hot and rather sticky conditions
.
Midday temperatures vary
between 28°C and 35°C, which is why many people take a siesta in between surfs.
The
water is also very warm
, especially
around Puerto Escondido, where it can reach a sweltering 29°C. Board shorts and
a rash guard are the go to choice all year round.
