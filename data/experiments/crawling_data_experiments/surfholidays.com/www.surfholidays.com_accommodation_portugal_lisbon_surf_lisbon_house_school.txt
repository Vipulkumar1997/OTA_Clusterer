out of

A typical Portuguese summer house converted into a surf house overlooking the Ocean.
The Surf House can accommodate up to 18 guests in 4 splendid private rooms and 2 shared rooms, all sharing three comfortable bathrooms. Guests have access to all the common areas: cosy living room with big LCD screen, large dining room where breakfast (included) is served daily, sea view internet room, fully equipped kitchen, garden with barbecue facilites, free wireless internet and even a special edition of a Red Wine from Algarve with Surf Lisbon´s label.



Location

Ocean front location in Caxias, a small village only 15 minutes away both from Lisbon´s historical city centre and Cascais. In Winter you just have to cross the street to score some waves and the most famous surfing breaks around Lisbon are only between a 5 to 20 minute drive from the Surf House.

How did you like the accommodation?








The house is really beautiful. The staff are really welcoming.

Getting there by train from the airport was super easy, I wouldn’t bother taking a taxi.

The train station in a 2-3 minute walk away, and you can get to one of Lisbon’s main stations in about 12 mins.

People did a mix of staying in and cooking, and going into Lisbon at night for dinner and drinks.

The super market is one train stop away from the house, but this isn’t as daunting as it sounds, I’d done a full shop and was back within 40 mins.

Most people in the house when I arrived were on their 3rd or 4th visit to the house and I totally understand why, I would definitely go back

How were the surf lessons?








You get picked up at 9:30am, and get back around 6:30pm. There’s a nice break in the middle of the day to grab lunch and sunbathe. It’s worth noting that there’s only one cafe on this beach and you can’t really go anywhere in the break, but that was fine by me.
The beach is beautiful with perfect, almost fluffy sand.
All of the instructors were fab, helpful and really good fun.

How did you like the accommodation?








The accommodation provided at Surf House Lisbon was of the highest quality. We stayed in the loft and loved the quirky details that made the house so special.  There was so much more space than in a standard shared room in a hostel. The house is big, bright and very welcoming. There was always space to sit and relax, and the big dining table was a lovely feature.  All the bathrooms are clean and well maintained, I don't think I queued once. The garden is very large and we used it a lot through out our stay. We could not have been more impressed.

The town itself is pretty small and very quirky, with a larger town (and larger supermarket!) one stop on the train line. The fish restaurant came highly recommended, however this was shut during our stay- next time!

I would also like to add that this surf house would be perfect as a solo traveler- super welcoming and so friendly.

How were the surf lessons?








We booked the beginner surf package and loved our time at the beach! The surf instructors are amazing (don't tell them though, they'll get a big head!!)

I had surfed previously and my friend had not. We were both looked after so well in the water at all times. My friend was a little anxious in the sea and the instructors took special care to make sure she was comfortable and was having fun! I was pushed my the instructors and definitely saw an improvement by the end of the week.

The beach was huge, beautiful and clean. There are only restaurants, no shops to buy lunch, but a range of prices are available to suit each budget. We had an amazing time on the beach, and the experience was enhanced by knowing everyone from the house. Surfing in a group is always more fun!

How did you like the accommodation?








We had a great time in Lisbon. Accommodation was excellent (spotlessy clean) and Nuno and the team where so welcoming, friendly and helpful for the duration. We went into Lisbon most nights as there was little restaurants right near the accommodation but it was handy enough to hop on a train into Lisbon for the night.  Really good experience all round and we made a few friends there during our stay. We will look forward to going again!

How were the surf lessons?








The surf lessons where great, we were all beginners and picked it up the surfing fairly quick, again the instructors where excellent and very friendly.We we’re taken to different beaches every day which was great as the instructors would know where the best waves would be given tides and weather conditions.

How did you like the accommodation?








The house was great- a big old house designed with a lot of thought and simply beautiful. There is a great grocery store 1 train stop away- everything is easily accessible as the train is less than a 5 min. walk away and the ocean is in front of the house.

How were the surf lessons?








The surf lessons were great. All of the instructors  were really nice and genuine, took their time and gave great tips. Everyone was standing on their boards on day one- it's staying up thats the challenge;)

How did you like the accommodation?








The surf house was great. Bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and spacious. Communal areas were really good and the whole feel of the place was laid back. The only draw back was that there was only one local restaurant, but Lisbon centre was not far away.

How were the surf lessons?








Instructors were very good and the beach was nice. Great place to chill for lunch also in the shade which was essential for my pale skin!







Helena

How did you like the accommodation?








The room was ok, however the outside is very noisy - busy road on the front, train on the back. My room was advertised as garden view but was actually street view. Earplugs are highly advisable. There's not much going on in the area otherwise, but as it's only a 20 minute train ride from Lisbon it's not too bad. There is one restaurant which was unfortunately closed when we got there, supermarket a train stop away. The advertised honesty bar doesn't exist. I would however recommend it and go again. The beaches are beautiful.

How were the surf lessons?








The beach was quite a bit further away than expected but beautiful once you're there. Unfortunately there weren't many waves when we were around, maybe a different beach would have worked better. Instructors were all really helpful and friendly, however somewhat distracted.

How did you like the accommodation?








I had a brilliant time at the Lisbon Surf House. Nuno was warm, welcoming and helpful, my room was clean, well organised, comfortable and bright. With regards to the house itself, if possible,  internal sound-proofing would be a good idea.
I loved Lisbon city centre; it's old, very safe, beautiful, interesting and especially at night time, alive. I do think that with the multitude of cobble streets, steep hills and steps it is very challenging place to navigate for the very elderly and/ or disabled.
I had fish every day as it was so fresh and flavoursome and thoroughly enjoyed the traditional desserts. The cost of food and drink, entry to attractions, public transport etc. was very reasonable.
Although a little out of town, It was very quick and easy to get to and from Lisbon surf house by public transport and taxi. All in all, I had an incredible time

How were the surf lessons?








The surfing lessons were great fun, all the instructors were attentive to us as individual learners and our safety at all times. The beaches opposite the house and where we actually went surfing were brilliantly clean, uncrowded and pleasant with very few tourists at all.

How did you like the accommodation?








Lisbon Surf House is the place to be if you looking for nice accommodation and really friendly and professional instructors for your trip. The location of the house is convenient also when you want to experience other things than waves. The Caxias train station is just few steps away and by train it is about 10/15 mins to Lisbon or 20 to Cascais in the other direction

How were the surf lessons?








We have surfed few times in other places, but never improved as much in short time as with LSH Surf lessons. The beach where we surfed in Caparica has nice sandy bottom and the waves suited well for first timers as well as little more experienced.
And what really makes the difference, David, Nuno and the other guys really wanted us to learn to read the sea, get the waves and ride them properly, giving tips and feedback all the time.

I fell in love with Lisbon, and I couldn't find a better place to spend my vacations, the staff was amazing, they did everything to make me feel at home, the atmosphere and the vibe is the same that you see on the surf movies!! The location is awesome- you can visit the city in the morning and surf on the afternoon, and still make it again to the city for the crazy night life.

How did you like the accommodation?








The surf house is anonymously placed at the end of a small street in a small town just outside of Lisbon, but once inside you have a fully equipped house in good standard and with a private beach styled backyard to yourself and the other surf guests. The nature of the house is a bit like a high standard collective rather then a hotel, where you will get to know the other guests and have the possibility to get a lasting relation. Breakfast is served everyday by the staff, and for dinner you are encouraged to either go out with the other guests or arrange a barbecue in the hotel backyard where the surf instructions might join in.

Surf House is clean and tidy.  The rooms facing the main road are a bit noisy. Little seaside town has everything you need a bakery, corner shop and restaurant.

Awesome surf lessons!  Felt really safe with the instructors even when the waves got a bit bigger.  My surfing has really improved in just two days.

I choose Lisbon as a destination with few of my friends for our first surfing experience as it combines beautiful beaches and amazing city break.
Accommodation - house is absolutely perfect - historic with so many vintage details but newly renovated filled with surfing artifacts, clean, spacious and very cosy!
Hosts - Nuno is great! Period. He is warm and helpful - ready to make the experience unforgettable.  I fully recommend!

I am a beginner and level of waves was perfect, beach was really nice.

From the minute Susanna met me at the airport I knew I was going to have a great trip. I really felt that Susanna, Nuno and David really care about their guests having a great experience at the Surf House. The traditional house and stylish decor are really well presented, clean and cosy.
Perfect for relaxing after a long day surfing. Even the train basically running through the garden has its own charm! Stayed in the lovely attic room with a sea view, sharing room and bathroom with other guests, but this was no problem as its all laid out so well.
Lovely breakfast! It was a like a homely hotel, nothing like a hostel and great value for money. There is a welcoming atmosphere created by the owners, and it helped that there was a great group of people staying there too.
Some great nights of wine and food in the garden getting to know some interesting and amazing people from all over the world.
This was a great experience as I was travelling alone and had no idea what to expect.
Hope to go back one day!

How were the surf lessons?



Surf instructors were really dedicated and really want you to succeed, even when you feel like you can't swallow any more sea. Kept encouraging me and analysing my technique to help me improve. Great beach, time to chill between lessons and fantastic bar next to surf school.

100% recommend! The house is beautiful, big enough so everyone has their own space but it's decorated very homey and cosy. Great views from the front windows out to the ocean. Big outdoor space outback, good for having your breakfast or chilling with a book after a exhausting day out catching the surf :)

How were the surf lessons?








The surf lessons were great. Teachers were professional, kind and motivational. Always happy to give you a free push to catch a wave! It was my first time surfing but I picked it up quickly, thanks to the patient teachers.

The accommodation was wonderful, the staff were great and the house was lovely and clean. It was very little effort to get to Lisbon on the train to spend the evening having drinks and eating out.

How were the surf lessons?








I'd never surfed before and the gang of instructors couldn't have been better. I was standing up within three days (not bad for someone with zero balance) and never felt like I was unsafe: I progressed so much over the week and ended up taking an extra day of lessons because I had enjoyed it so much.

I had a great stay in the Lisbon Surf House. The only bad thing about the stay was that it was too short!

I enjoyed my stay a lot and are looking forward to come back soon!

I stayed at the Lisbon Surf House one weekend to learn to surf and it was great! Nuno and Susana make you feel very welcome by picking you up from the airport if required. The house is homey and stylish at the same time, and the perfect place to chill after a big day of surfing.
It's close to the train station, so getting into the centre is easy and convenient. Everything is thought of and it makes for an extremely worry-free and fun experience! Would definitely, definitely recommend!

How did you like the accommodation?



The house was great, with good communal areas for guests to hangout, with a garden at the back, bathrooms were kept clean. Good kitchen & fridge facilities for cooking. It's 5 mins away from the train station which was convenient. Just be reminded that the trains into the city centre are not very frequent, every 20-30 minutes.

How were the surf lessons?








The one beach that I went to was great (cant remember the name), the first lesson I did not actually get much instruction and the instructors were more focused on the surfers who have already had a few days of lessons. The second and third day were better with having support from them. I was told that the waves were better and current was less during high tide, so it would have been useful if we can go out during high tide as well.

Loved the surf house! It is beautiful and has a lot of character. It's in a perfect place very close to Lisbon but also on the train line to prettier areas for tourist. Also five minutes walk away is the best grill restraint that they will tell you about it was so good I ate there every day because I couldn't find any other place that was up to that standard! But most importantly they create a friendly environment where ale trying becomes friends and has fun together, yet you can still have your own privacy.

How were the surf lessons with Surf Lisbon Surf School?








The instructors where awesome I loved Bruno! He was great o went to the same beach every time and it would have been nice to go to a different one too also they took us on one day that was so bad everyone was just crashing on a day like this it would have been good to be told to go another day instead j also took one more lesson but didn't know that I didn't pay for it so it would have been nice to be told before hand that I would have to pay for this. Otherwise it was awesome

The accommodation was hygenic and high-spec, and also felt homely and relaxing. A bit of improvisation required for hanging up wet things - designated hooks etc. might be useful. Nice big garden, and a practical and clean kitchen.

How were the surf lessons?








Good, enthusiastic surf instructors. They paid attention to all learners and gave useful advice. The beaches were good too, and appropriate for the conditions.

We had a fantastic time.  The house was absolutely lovely, both guests and staff. Nuno was particularly welcoming to my friend who was too late to book into the accom but came for the lessons and spent lots of time with us at the house. Definitely wished we booked for longer. The whole thing was really good value for money. Would love to return sometime.

We had a great time at Surf Lisbon House & School! Would recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent surf holiday. The house is lovely, really comfortable, and right on the coast too, so there are great views and walks right on your doorstep. Very easy to access either Lisbon or Cascais by train, so you've plenty of options for things to do and places to go before or after surfing. Plus there are some restaurants and bars nearby if you don't feel like heading too far afield. Can't recommend this place enough!

How were the surf lessons?








Surfing with Surf Lisbon was amazing. The lessons are great fun and you'll learn a ton from Bruno and the guys. From day one we were given instruction and the guys kept giving us tips throughout the week to help us improve. We surfed mainly at Carcavelos beach and the conditions were great for us to progress each day.

Had an amazing time at Lisbon Surf House! Easy to get to & find from his directions. Nice house (better than staying at a hostel). Felt very welcomed by Nuno and his wife (although they don’t stay there).
Room was clean and comfy.
Found some nice places to go out around the surf house area. Went into the centre of Lisbon once but didn’t really enjoy it - got hassled by drug pushers and by people selling tat!
Overall good value for money - took €400 for the both of us, ate really well and still had €50 left! Would definitely go back

How were the surf lessons?








Lessons were great and the instructions passionate about what they do. Belongings were safe on the beach and all equipment a good standard. Beaches were clean generally along with the sea.

No other European city matches so well the word Surf as Lisbon does. It was around its beaches that Surfing was born in Portugal, with different waves for all ages and levels along with a climate that allows people to enjoy the beach all year round. Adding to this, Lisbon itself, is full of history, culture, sports, gastronomy, nightlife and a great heritage of endless virtues waiting for you!

Main Surf Beach:
Carcavelos and Costa de Caparica


Surf Lessons we offer:

Kids Surf Lessons

In this initial surfing state, the overall objective is to provide a quality education and to engage the child in the context and culture of surfing, on a cheerful and safe environment. From June 1st to September 30th the lessons are 2 x 2 hrs each day. From October 1st to May 31st it is 1 x 2 hr lesson per day.


Beginner Surf Lessons

Downtown Lisbon city itself does not have a beach and walking around siteseeing you may be oblivious to the fact that dozens of beautiful white sandy surf beaches are only a 5 minute car drive away (Or 4 train stops!)

The surrounding beaches pick up all the swells the Atlantic have to offer making it one of the most consistent surf destinations in the World.

The area has a good selection for all standards. Closest to the city would be Caxias & Santo Amaro de Oeiras.
Caxias
is a beautiful beach that on its day can produce perfect lefthander barrels.
Oeiras
is more of a winter wave and is one of the best waves in Portugal.

Next stop is
Carcavelos
, probably Portugal's most famous wave. Its one of the best beach breaks in Europe and regularly hosts National competitions. It suits all standards, a perfect place to learn and a great place to score some fast beach barrels with multiple peaks along the 1km stretch of beach.

There are many other spots along the coastline that runs from Lisbon out to Estoril & Cascais. Long boarders will love
Sao Pedro
and short boarders will thrive on spots like
Poca and Sao Joao
. Then on the other side of Cascais there is the stunning long white sandy
Guincho
beach, one of Portugal's most consistent surf spots, usually best in the morning as it can be exposed to afternoon onshore winds.

Across the river Tejo in Setubal, a 20 minute drive away, is the less crowded
Costa de Caparica
. Perfect for beginner/intermediates as the man made jetties create nice consistent waves. The beach stretches for 30kms and all of it is surfable!

Lisbon is also a great base to explore other regions. The surf mecca of
Ericeira
is only 35 minutes drive away and 1 hour north is
Peniche
, host of the WSL World Tour every October.
