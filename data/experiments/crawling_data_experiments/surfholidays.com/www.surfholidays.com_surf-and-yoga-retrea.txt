Over the last 10 years a surf and yoga retreat has become very popular in the surfing world. Professional Surfers such as Kelly Slater & Taylor Knox credit it for their longevity in the sport. Yoga will help with flexibility and stiffness and allow for quick recover after a surf session. It is a very relaxing and rewarding activity, a perfect detox and escape from your normal week back home.

Our blog writer Francesca is an avid Yoga practitioner and has written some great articles about the different types of Yoga in the
Health & Fitness
section of our blog.

Have a look at our Surf and Yoga retreat options available below, see which suits you best and book online. All instructors are certified and bring the right amount of enthusiasm and passion to help you get the most out of the experience.
