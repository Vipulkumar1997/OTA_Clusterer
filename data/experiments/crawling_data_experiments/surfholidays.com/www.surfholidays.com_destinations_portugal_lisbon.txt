Lisbon

Lisbon, or Lisboa, is the capital of Portugal and means "enchanted port". A Lisbon surf holiday is probably not the first thing that springs to mind when thinking of the city however Lisbon is surrounded by dozens of beaches that offer some of the best surf in Europe.

The city they say was founded by the Phoenicians and grew in importance thanks to the River Tagus which flows across the country into Spain. It was also ruled by the Moors, the Arabs and eventually the Christians.

In the late 1400's the city developed the Caravel ship that allowed it sail faster and carry more than its rivals and so it took over from Venice and became the world's main trading centre for goods & spices. Vasco do Gama set off and discovered the sea route to India by sailing around Cape Town in South Africa and so began the Age of Discovery.

The city was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 1755 and rebuilt over time to become one of Euorpe's most charming cities boasting fantastic restaurants & the famous Bairro Alto nightlife area.

Enough about history, what about surf in Lisbon?!?! Thanks to its position on the Atlantic Coast Lisbon gets some of the best swells in Europe making it a perfect surf holiday destination. Lisbon's most famous surf spot is Carcavelos, a very reliable beach break that suits all standards.

Across the spectacular "5 de Abril Bridge" lies the uncrowded sandy beaches of Costa Caparica, and West of the city are a variety of different surf spots including one of Portugal's best point breaks Santo Amaro de Oeiras, the longboarders heaven Sao Pedro and the beach breaks Caxais & Guincho. Come experience surfing in Lisbon by day and exploring the city by night...

Lisbon is
Portugal's capital
, home to 3 million people, almost a third of the Portuguese population. It is located in the centre of Portugal, facing the Atlantic Ocean and at the mouth of the River Tagus which goes inland and on up into Spain.

The historical or downtown part of Lisbon is made up of different Barrios (Neighbourhoods). Many of these Barrios were destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent fire in 1755. The city is now made up of
small labyrinth narrow streets
and small squares dating back to before the earthquake mixed with the newer grid pattern streets and large squares. It is a fantastic city to wander around and explore, all under the watchful eye of the
Castle of Sao Jorge
up high in the Alfama district.

The centre area of the old town is called Baixa and is home to Lisbons two great squares: Praco do Rossio and Praco do Comercio. Many of the streets are pedestrianised and full of cafés, restaurants and impressive buildings. The Baixa area blends into the
Bairro Alto
area to the West, which is the main nightlife district, with people packing the streets and the bars till the early morning. Also within a few minutes walking distance is the
Chiado
area, the city's main shopping district where you will find all the worlds leading fashion shops.

Further West is
Belem
, famous as the port of embarkment for all the great Portuguese explores including Vasco da Gama and Pedro Alvares Cabral. Its famous tower is well worth a visit as is the nearby Jeronimos Monastery.

On the East side of the city is the
Parque das Nacoes
(Park of Nations), a new modern designed part of the city. Well worth a visit for its
Oceanarium
, the second largest in the world, and for a ride in the Telecabine pods that run along the Ocean, 50 metres in the air!


Getting Around Lisbon

The Metro system in Lisbon is very extensive and reliable. There is a station in Lisbon airport that takes you right into the city. From there you can get to virtually every part of the city. And don't forget the old yellow trams, a visit to Lisbon would not be complete without one; they take you around the old town area and are mostly used by tourists.

The city also has commuter trains to
Cascais
and
Sintra
, great for day trips.

The old town of Lisbon is easy to explore by foot also, the capita is known as the city of Seven hills so juts bear that in mind, but a walk from the Castle of Sao Jorge across the city to the Barrio Alto will only take 30 minutes.


Lisbon Food and Nightlife

Lisbon has just about every cuisine known to man but try and explore some of its more interesting restaurants such as that of its former colonies of Goa, Brazil, Angola & Mozambique.

The Bairro Alto area is made up of a grid of 5 streets all packed with bars, cafés and interesting small shops. The area comes alive from 11pm and doesn't tend to quieten down until 5am!


Lisbon Football

No trip to Lisbon would be complete without watching a game of either Benfica or Sporting Lisbon. Benfica is by far the biggest side, they say almost 50% of Portugues support them. Its easy enough to get tickets a day or two before hand unless it is a major game.



Lisbon airport is only 15 minutes from Lisbon city centre


Flights to Lisbon

Please note to check airports as new routes & airlines may begin operating at any time. Below are just some that fly to Portugal. Skyscanners.net is a good website that lets you know who flies where from different cities.

Downtown Lisbon city itself does not have a beach and walking around siteseeing you may be oblivious to the fact that dozens of beautiful white sandy surf beaches are only a 5 minute car drive away (Or 4 train stops!)

The surrounding beaches pick up all the swells the Atlantic have to offer making it one of the most consistent surf destinations in the World.

The area has a good selection for all standards. Closest to the city would be Caxias & Santo Amaro de Oeiras.
Caxias
is a beautiful beach that on its day can produce perfect lefthander barrels.
Oeiras
is more of a winter wave and is one of the best waves in Portugal.

Next stop is
Carcavelos
, probably Portugal's most famous wave. Its one of the best beach breaks in Europe and regularly hosts National competitions. It suits all standards, a perfect place to learn and a great place to score some fast beach barrels with multiple peaks along the 1km stretch of beach.

There are many other spots along the coastline that runs from Lisbon out to Estoril & Cascais. Long boarders will love
Sao Pedro
and short boarders will thrive on spots like
Poca and Sao Joao
. Then on the other side of Cascais there is the stunning long white sandy
Guincho
beach, one of Portugal's most consistent surf spots, usually best in the morning as it can be exposed to afternoon onshore winds.

Across the river Tejo in Setubal, a 20 minute drive away, is the less crowded
Costa de Caparica
. Perfect for beginner/intermediates as the man made jetties create nice consistent waves. The beach stretches for 30kms and all of it is surfable!

Lisbon is also a great base to explore other regions. The surf mecca of
Ericeira
is only 35 minutes drive away and 1 hour north is
Peniche
, host of the WSL World Tour every October.
