How did you like the accommodation?








The villa is superb! Very nice rooms and accomodation (kitchen, terrasse) were great.
Corralejo is a really nice town, full of bars and restaurants.

How were the surf lessons?








I was suppose to have group lessons, and for half the week they were private since I was alone. Nathan was a really great teacher, really careful and patient.
We only went to one spot but it was perfect to begin with.
Lessons were a bit short in my opinion, we could have started earlier to spend more time in the water, which explains the (only) 4 stars.

How did you like the accommodation?








Wave Riders Villa is a great place to stay on your holiday. Located right on the beach gives you beautiful views on Corralejo, Lanzarote and Lobos Island.
The place is very cosy and clean every day. It serves the best breakfast ever, always fresh and diversified.
Jacuzzi on the terrace gives you a chance to relax after surfing and enjoy beautiful views.
Chloe and Jamie take really good care of the place.
The location of Wave Riders villa is excellent. You can easily take a walk along the beach to the Dunes, basic grocery store is on the corner, nice 15-minute walk along the beach and you are in the Old Town Corralejo full of great restaurants and bars.

How were the surf lessons?








Surf lessons were a lot of fun. Nathan took us to different locations every day. The last one was a blast - the afternoon surfing on El Cotillo Beach with the sunset was unforgettable experience.

Amazing location, right opposite a surf break, although it's quite a small one is brilliant if like us we surfed before our lunchtime flights. Beautiful view of the ocean also! And a BBQ to die for!

How did you like the accommodation?








Chloe and Nathan have created an amazing holiday experience. The villa itself is beautiful, and is placed the perfect distance from the centre of town so that you can enjoy a quiet evening, whilst being a stones throw away from restaurants and bars. Sunbathing on the bed-things after a day of surfing was blissful, and being able to look out at the sea (and if you were lucky, seeing some unfortunate soul fall from a paddle-board) only added to the experience. As someone coming to Fuerteventura for the first time, I got very lucky seeing as I had no idea where anything actually was. Just don't make my mistake of assuming I could get there by Google Maps instead of just asking Chloe where to go, or even just accepting their offer of a transfer from the airport - they do it for €40, and there's no confusion as to where to go, whereas a taxi would be €50 (which is admittedly extremely good for nearly an hour's drive to get to Corralejo). I spent a very confused, burdened hour wandering around town before I found my way there!

I got a little unlucky with my booking timing, as there was a big group booking out the whole villa from the day that I was leaving, so the place was a near empty by the time that I was left! I still had a lovely time, and the mornings were great because we were given breakfast Monday to Friday prepared by Jamie, who is great for the chats and more than happy to give advice on what to do and where to eat. Chloe also told me about the beach yoga lessons that are held by Nina, who is lovely and leads a very wholesome and enjoyable class, which is especially enjoyable in the evenings because the classes happened at sunset.

How were the surf lessons?








Nathan is a fab instructor. He made the experience really personalised and enjoyable, and he seemed to cater his teaching to each individual, whilst encouraging us all to improve. As a complete beginner, I was pretty pleased that after 4 days of surfing I was (almost!) able to stand on the board! He's super knowledgeable about the waves and the effects of tides/currents/seasons/etc. He also knows the beaches inside out, so knows the best surf spots and what to look out for in each one.

How did you like the accommodation?








Really liked the accommodation, the paintwork and decoration was really nice, loved the kitchen v well equipped, great location, loved the jacuzzi and sun beds, breakfast was one of the highlights - loved the great range of food and Jamie was really friendly!

The restaurants on the seafront are great, friendly and good prices, better than the English-y ones on the strip! Good food especially the paella at La Vela, best paella ever had and did a great deal of paella for 2 and a litre of sangria for €25! Good bars as well for any age, good cocktails.

How were the surf lessons?








Had 5 lessons, really good, both instructors we had (Nathan and Zsoka) were motivating which I really appreciated. Liked that we got a say in which beaches we went to as well and liked the variety. Instructors looked after us well, had Zsoka for most of it and her instruction was amazing, everyone improved a lot with her and really liked her! Zsoka also spent time telling each individual exactly where they were going wrong and how they could improve which everyone really appreciated and which worked very well!

How did you like the accommodation?








We had a lovely time. It was really chilled and all the people were lovely. The surf villa is really great. Nathan has done a fabulous job on it and you can see he has put loads of hard work in to it and that it's important to him. He's a great skin and dropped by loads of times for chats and to see that everything was going ok for us.
When we got to Fuerta Nathan was there to pick us up and drove us around correlejo to show us the town. In the afternoons we chilled by the pool.
We ate out in the restaurants every night and loved that.

How were the surf lessons with Waveriders Surf School?








Tee picked us up everyday and she was fabulous - really good fun and invested in the school. She's really positive and kept us motivated for the lessons.

Absolutey loved the holiday! Had a fantastic time in the villa, everything was spotlessly clean and Nathan popped in every day to check on us.

How were the surf lessons with Waveriders Surf School?








Great teaching during the surfing lessons, I felt I made a good progress throughout the week. Both Tee and Nathan were really chilled and made us enjoy the waves.
And best of all, the daily trips to the bakery after surfing were definitely something I looked forward to! The cakes and coffee were delicious...

How did you like the accommodation?








Wave riders was excellent, It was exactly what we were looking for. good surf great location close to the town where there is lots of nice restaurants and bars but still far enough for lots of chilled relaxed time !

We fell asleep and woke up to the sound of waves which is so lovey too. There's a nice white stoney beach on a reef right out the back down steps!

There is a good buzz in town at night with some chilled cool bars- we liked a bar called cactus bar which had a nice roof terrace! That is across from a restaurant called Oscar tapas which is so tasty but go with a really empty stomach as the courses don't stop coming when you order the set menu which is very reasonable price!

Lovely fish restaurants along the sea also! We went to a bar called banana bar a few nights with some people staying in the villa and it's a cool surf bar and club.

We met lots of really fun cool people in the house and did big bbqs with people which was so nice and lots of fun, but it's still possible to have privacy also which is great. The hosts Nathan and Chloe were both so great and always helpful! They're both usually around at some stage in the day to do some work or check everything is ok which is nice and they're lovely people and we got on with them really well!

How were the surf lessons?








The lessons were great you could go morning for intermediates or people who have surfed previously and afternoons for beginners. The surf spots were great for all abilities and my surfing progressed loads there!

Really enjoyed my break. Nathan was great - really helpful, knowledgeable and all round good bloke. I couldn't fault the villa either -  comfortable, clean and a great place to relax after a days surfing.


How were the surf lessons with Waveriders Surf School?








The beaches were great also, but on day 2 of 3 the conditions didn't allow the waves to be that great. Altogether v pleased with the trip, and would consider going back.

How did you like the accommodation?








I had such a great holiday.  I loved every minute of it.  Nathan was awesome, such a great guy, very chilled, very welcoming and knowledgeable.  The villa was excellent, spacious and spotless and within a good location, close to the beach and within walking distance into Corralejo.  Corralejo itself was very touristy but not difficult to find good restaurants and bars.  I would definitely recommend this holiday to anyone who was looking for a great surf holiday.

How were the surf lessons with Waveriders Surf School?








The surf was good.  Both Nathan and Tee were excellent teachers, knowing where the best spots on the island were to surf and were with you in the water, giving guidance and tips as you went along.

How did you like the accommodation?








I had a great week in Fuerteventura. The villa was excellent, comfortable and spacious and good location close to the beach and within walking distance to the town. Nice sociable bunch of people too and we all got on well.

Corellejo itself is very touristy but Nathan pointed us to some good local restaurants and bars which I doubt we would have found otherwise. The BBQ social on Friday was a nice idea too, as it was a chance to meet everyone from the different groups.

How were the surf lessons with Waveriders Surf School?








The surf lessons were good fun, Nathan took us to a few different surf spots around the island, which got progressively more challenging as the week went on, so I feel my surfing has definitely improved, although some muscles are still aching!








Patrick

How did you like the accommodation?








I loved the villa it had a very chilled and sociable vibe, it was kept in great condition and there was plenty of communal food.

Nathan was a great guy and worked very hard to make sure everybody was happy. His recommendations for local restaurants were perfect and he even dropped us off one night. As long as you stayed off the beaten track the food and nightlife was great.

How were the surf lessons with Waveriders Surf School?








The lessons were mostly good, I did not progress as much as I had hoped as somebody that had surfed before I felt the lessons were geared towards the beginners most of the time as they represented the majority.

The surf was pretty good and there was some kind of wave most days.







Nadine

Dublin, Ireland

Travelled solo




How did you like the accommodation?








Corralejo is a nice, lively place, quite touristy (at least by comparison with my last trip to Famara), but that's fine for a few days. The house was great -- loved the garden and the private pool particularly. I would have much preferred an upstairs room as the two rooms in the basement don't have that same summery vibe to them, but it wasn't that big a deal. Nathan was nice and all in all it was just what I was after for a few days' break -- a bit of sun, sunbathing, surfing and a lovely, well-maintained house.

How were the surf lessons with Waveriders Surf School?








I had a really good time. I was unlucky to have come down with a head cold right before arriving, so I couldn't try as hard as I'd have liked to on the surfing front - I'm still as much of a beginner as ever -- but I was really happy with the beaches - they're perfect for beginner surfers and I would definitely go back to Corralejo on that basis.







J.J.

Travelled solo




How did you like the accommodation?








I really enjoyed the trip. In terms of location the house was great, located 2 minutes from a beach which we used for two days lessons and 10 minutes walk from the main town. Everything in the house was new and clean. It also was ideal for a solo traveller, as there were three other solo travellers staying there at the same time as well.

The area was fine, particularly when you got beyond the main strip and the usual tourist trappings. There was plenty of decent places to eat in the older part of the town. I didn't get to travel much around the area as the weather was a bit showery while I was there.
I'd recommend it as a holiday to anyone who wants a winter break especially a solo traveller.


How were the surf lessons with Waveriders Surf School?








The lessons were very good, professional and laid back at the same time. Nathan and Tee gave advice when and where it was needed without being too intrusive. They seemed to have a good handle on where to go based on the conditions, as we arrived at several spots ahead of other schools.

How did you like the accommodation?








Had an absolutely great time, everything we needed for a simple and hassle free trip was all sorted for us, from finding out about the most suitable surf spots to Nathan  organising a boat for us to search for waves off the nearby island of lobos, he really couldn't have done any more for us!
Accommodation was very clean, and spacious and ideal for a small group like ourselves!
Waves were really fun, nothing too crazy but surfing 3 times a day in board shorts more than made up for that!

How did you like the accommodation?








The Wave Riders is a beautiful villa with fantastic sea views and a big terrace, perfect for post-surf relaxation. It's a short walk to the centre of Corralejo's restaurants, bars and shops.

How were the surf lessons?








Tee was a very enthusiastic and motivating instructor who made the surf lessons a lot of fun. We surfed on 2 beaches, both had some great waves. I'd recommend using boots to avoid cutting your feet on the reef.

Despite being the second largest of the Canary Islands, Fuerteventura is still a small island and only takes an hour and a half to drive its length.  What this also means is that there is always a coast that is working and plenty of empty waves to be surfed! With practically 365 days of sunshine & 25ºC plus weather it has often been called the
Hawaii of Europe
.

Like the rest of Europe the Autumn/ Winter gets the biggest surf and the spring/summer is perfect for beginner/intermediate surf...The Canaries lie 100kms off Africa and are a magnet for North Atlantic swells. The island is known for both expert waves and many mellow beachbreaks perfect for intermediate improvers.

Corralejo is often the starting point for a Fuerteventura surf holiday, a perfect base and close to many breaks. The main surf break in town is Rocky Point. Perfect for intermediates, improvers and for long boarders. Further across is Los Lobos island (uninhabited) with a World Class right hand point that runs for up to 400metres.

South of Corralejo is beginners surf beach
'Flag beach'
, close to the famous Dunes. Further south there are many different beaches that pick up good swell.

The North Shore is what the island is famous for and where you will find a coastline full of just about every wave imaginable.

is a great spot - with 3 different sections suitable for intermediates to experts (
'The Bubble'
). On the North West coast is the small village of
El Cotillo
, and one of the most beautiful beaches you will ever see. It is a very nice intermediate beach break and also be on the look out as it is a nudist beach in parts.
