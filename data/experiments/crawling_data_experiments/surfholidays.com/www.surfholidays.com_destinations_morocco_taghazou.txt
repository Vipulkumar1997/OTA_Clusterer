Taghazout

Taghazout is the surf capital of Morocco and has enjoyed legendary status as the place to escape the cold miserable winters of northern Europe! Taghazout surf offers year round waves , sunshine and an unrivalled choice of beaches to suit all standards. Winter is the best time to go for advanced and intermediate but those learning any time of year is good including the the smaller waves from May to August. The town is a 20 minute drive from Agadir and 40 minutes from the airport. It is surrounded by sandy beaches and headland that continue for 200kms north to Essouira.

Taghazout and its neighbouring town of Tamraght are small bustling towns full of cafés, surf shops & interesting local stores. Due to the countries laws alcohol is not served in the cafes/restaurants so evening socialising usually takes place in your accommodation. It is a very safe area that has for years embraced the surf culture of foreign traveling surfers.

A surf holiday in Taghazout & Tamraght will usually involve all day surf sessions, a trip to Agadir and its never ending Souk (market), an afternoon at Paradise Valley (jumping into its beautiful natural pools) and evenings chilling out watching the spectacular sunset from the roof tops of your accommodation! Taghazout surf camps have a reputation for being some of the best places to stay in Europe. Surfing holidays in Taghazout often include Yoga before and after a surf so prepare to do some stretches on the roof tops!

Surf Holidays in Morocco: Warm water surf, year round sun. Unique Moroccan villages. Book online today.

Taghazout is a small village that is easily explored by foot in 20 minutes. The town itself would not win any awards for beautiful architecture but lets be honest you are not here for that! What is impressive is the vast stretch of coastline that runs through the town. The beaches are sandy, very clean and seperated by headland at various points which create Morocco's most famous and reliable waves.

The town runs for about half a km with cafés, shops, restaurants and housing on either side of the main street. Do not expect a traditional tourist town with fast food outlets, funparks & big holiday resorts. It is the exact opposite and that is why it is loved so much by travelling surfers looking to escape. It is a very friendly safe place to visit. In the evenings most people socialise in their accommodations which tend to all have large roof top areas. As the sunset on the West the evening skyline are beautiful to watch. The cafés/restaurants are not allowed sell alcohol so tend to be quiet in the evenings.


Currency & ATM's in Taghazout:

Morocco uses the
dirham
. You can exchange money on arrival at the airports. And there are also ATM's in the airports. 100 dirham is approximately €10/£8 although this changes of course. There are also ATM's in the big hotels in
Agadir
but there are none in Taghazout so you will need to bring money with you.
Bartering
is standard practice for almost everything.


Language:

The locals speak Berbere and French. English is not widely spoken but the locals and cafe/resturants owners will know the basics.


Roads & Safety in Taghazout:

If you hire a car the roads are very safe and modern. Cars tend to drive relatively slow but the Moroccans have the habit of forgetting to indicate when turning! Paying someone to watch your car is normal so its handy to keep a few coins with you.


Activities in Taghazout:

Obviously being by the Atlantic Ocean the main activities will be water based. As well as Surfing there is
Stand Up Paddle boarding
(SUP), and in summer Kite Surfing.
Yoga
is very popular in the area and all our accommodation options offer daily Yoga onsite.

There are a few excellent day trips and probably the best of all is a visit to
Paradise Valley
. Located 30 minutes inland it is a beautiful picturesque valley that also doubles as a natural water park with waterslides, cliff jumping and lagoon swimming!


Agadir
is an obvious choice also. The city sits on a beautiful open beach. It was destroyed in an earthquake in the 1960s so it has been rebuilt as a modern beach town rather than an old traditional city like Marrakech. A trip to the large open Souk (market) is a great experience and a good place to use your bargain skills if you want to buy some presents to bring back home! Also worth a stop off is the
Old Kasbah
- an old ruined fortress that sits on top of the mountain at the edge of Agadir. It offers a stunning view of the city and the Anti Atlas mountains, the final mountainous barrier before the Sahara!

Further north is
Marrakesh
, easily accessible by bus but it will take you 3 hours so get up early!



Taghazout is only a 40 minute drive from Agadir airport, so before you know it you'll be in the water surfing Morocco's best waves! You can also fly to Marrakech although it will take a further 3hrs to get to Taghazout

How to get from Marrakech Airport to Taghazout

Get a taxi to the Gare Routiere/Bus station (the main one - not the CTM one). This should be around 50dh (£4/€5). CTM and Supratours are the nicests and most comfortable buses. Its hard to buy a ticket online in advance for Supratours but you can with www.ctm.ma. You can buy your ticket at the station very easily. Price is approximately 100dh (£8/€10). There are two bus stations in Marrakech, one for Supratours and one for CTM buses. If one bus if full (this very rarely happens) then you can get a petit taxi to the other station.

Then just call your accommodation as soon as you know your time of arrival in Agadir and bus company, and they will arrange to meet you. Agadir Bus Station is small and you will be met when you walk off the bus.



The surrounding 10km area of
Taghazout & Tamraght
have gained legendary status as a surf mecca and without doubt Morocco's surf capital. There are not many places in the world that have waves accessible to beginner, intermediate and advanced surfers but this area has it all.

Taghazout waves includes the beginner/intermediate surf spots
Panaromas & Hash's Point
. Further south is the long stretch of beach that leads to the next town of Tamraght, a fantastic learner area with two advanced breaks at the south end
Devils Rock & Banana Point
.

On the north end of town is Moroccos most famous wave,
Anchor Point
, a world class long right break. And around this headland is
La Source & Killers
, another two of Moroccos most reliable & famous waves.

10km further north is the town of
Tamri
which has a great selection of beginner & intermediate waves as well as a few secret spots.
