Santa Teresa

At the southern point of the Nicoya peninsula in Costa Rica's Pacific Coast are the beautiful surf holiday destinations of Santa Teresa, Mal Pais & Manzanillo. While they are not completely off the beaten track they are far enough away to feel like a true escape into paradise!

They are not overdeveloped and Surf Camps in Santa Teresa and its surrounding beaches retain a very relaxed, chilled out vibe where surf and local traditions mix harmoniously. Santa Teresa Surf town is the largest, with Manzanillo and Mal Pais having more a fishermans village feel.

The area surrounding the peninsula has world class waves and are also perfect for learning and intermediates.

Santa Teresa is in the southern tip of the Nicoya Peninsula in the region called Mal Pais. A surfing holiday in Santa Teresa is a dangerous prospect as you may never want to leave! Just picture yourself surfing all morning, snoozing under a palm tree in the afternoon and come nightfall watching the sunset from the beach and you will know what we mean. The area stretches over 5 kms.

Surfing is the main activity in Santa Teresa and it has led to the rise of an interesting mix of international & local Tico surf culture. The village has a nice variety of Santa Teresa surf camps, cafés, restaurants and bars with everything from local salsa to international DJ's. Many of the restaurants have international chefs who have set up home in Santa Teresa.

There are plenty of other activities such as the waterfalls in Montezuma, zip lining through the jungle, snorkeling, diving and trips to many of the other beaches and small villages down the coast.



How to get to Santa Teresa
Tambor airport is 45 minutes from Santa Teresa. You can fly to San Jose and get a connecting flight to Tambor, it only takes 20 minutes.





Surf beaches around Santa Teresa
Playa El Carmen is the most popular spot in this laid back Santa Teresa surf area. It is an excellent open beach break for all standards. Surfing Playa Santa Teresa is a mix of sand and volcanic rock which create some barrel riding waves. Hermosa offers gentler waves, an excellent spot for beginners.

Air temperature in Santa Teresa is the same year round 32°C. The seasons can be divided in two: From December to April you have the Dry Season, and from May to November the Wet Season. The busiest time for tourism in Costa Rica is the Dry Season.

Santa Teresa is a year round surf destinations. From April to October is the larger swell season. From December to March waves are smaller but nice and clean, usually around 4 foot and it is probably the best time to stay at a Santa Teresa Surf Camp. The Wind is not usually a major factor and glassy offshore conditions are usually best in the morning.

The area has dozens of waves off the beaten track waiting to be explored and surfed from Manzanillo in the north and around to Montezuma on the other side. Come Surf Santa Teresa with us...
