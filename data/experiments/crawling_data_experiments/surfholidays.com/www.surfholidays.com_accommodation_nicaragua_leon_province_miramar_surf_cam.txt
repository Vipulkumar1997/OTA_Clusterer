An open and breezy hammock lounge area to quietly relax and feed the soul is located on top of a training area used for surf training, yoga, meditating and Jiu to Jitsu or any other kind of personal training you wish you practise.

Rooms are clean with modern furnishings and all kind of services for a comfortable holiday.

4 reasons to choose Miramar Surf Camp:

to Uncrowded and easily accessible waves by foot or boat.

Location

Located in the North, in a sleepy fishing village, this surf hot spot offers more than just the average wave. It is graced with opportunity for plenty of recreational activities and a calming, peaceful atmosphere. Blessed with offshore winds all day, rich with points and beach breaks, it provides sets for all levels of surfers, all year round.

During the high surf season, peaking swells allow for experienced surfers to shred the perfect barrel, easily accessed on foot or by boat. It is also an ideal place for those wishing to learn with the peak of a gentle wave at your door step. This majestic paradise, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, is home to all different kinds of adventures.

The beauty of Miramar Surf Camp is that it accommodates all levels of surfers, introducing beginners to the stoke of the sport and challenging even the most experienced of surfers with some swell. Throughout the year, at this rare uncrowded haven, the waves usually range between 3 to 8ft. There is no need for a wet suit as the water is warm, perfect if you just want to catch those last quick waves at sunset. During the surf season, waves peak at 12ft off the point directly out in front of the camp, home of a perfect left barrel.

Additionally, there are always an array of waves for beginners at the neighbouring beach breaks. Less than five minute by boat is Puerto Sandino, where experienced surfers can carve 15ft+, 100 meter long waves: a Pacific utopian dream.

Punta Miramar inside reef

Level:
Advanced

Perfectly situated right in front of Miramar Surf Camp, is a left hand point break reef Rocky one of the most consistence in Nicaragua that breaks from 2 to 15ft  .An easy paddle out thought the keyhole in the reef. It works on an incoming tide.This wave wrap arround the inside reef, carrying for about 150m with good walls and barrel sections , some waves will offer an inside section wich walls up and can be ridden all the way to the beach .






Punta Miramar outer reef

Level:
Advanced

The outer reef can be mellow and fun  with mid  south swells the wave is ripable and trow friendly barrels sections ,  but when the swell range anything over 6ft , the outer reef really starts to work and  will not close out and it will only increase in size throwing big  double section barrels  , for sure when its ON is one of the  best waves of Nicaragua.






Puerto Sandino

Level:
All Levels

The most famous  wave in the region is at the river mouth of Puerto Sandino known as Freight Trains as well.This world class wave is a monster that’s why is the most popular spot in the area. If you are a beginner surfer don’t go there. Sandino demands respect, and you need to be a strong swimmer to surf here. We go easely by boat from our camp. With an offshore break , an amazing left to hander over a sand bar eaks at dead low tide and surf the incoming tide. There’s more, Sandino can break for over two football fields. The break is a left, not a right. If you go right, you’ll not be seen for 45 minutes.
You can’t duck dive this wall of water you’ll have to get back out. Sandino is a long wave it has many sections; it can also provide a long barrel section down the line. If this wave is working and connects you’ll see why it could be known as the best wave in Central America.
As I already mentioned, go with a guide your first time here, and always take a boat.






Salinas Grandes

Level:
All Levels

Salinas a magical place, and will be always empty with many peaks going off a long the 3 miles beach.
This spot has a few beach breaks and a river mouth.
This is always a good option when the swell is smaller. Good at any picking up swell direction , but usually like some crossed up swell coming from west direction to be at best conditions .
This wave is super hollow and will provide some amazing barrels .It’s about 15 mins away from our camp going on our boat






The Pipes

Level:
All Levels

Just north around one minute walk from the camp,called by the guest nica to trestles  it allows for long lefts and rights it usually barrels on most swells although  it has a rock bottom pipes bends like a fruit bowl, giving you the option to get left or right. It works on a mid to tide and on big days not as good cause of the strong currents.Pipes is a really fun wave, and you can get some super nice rides there. The rocks are only a poten to  tial problem at low tide. If you go to Miramar, you need to surf Pipes.If the swell is on the right direction, the wave can be very hollow and offer a good barrel section. The wave side is 4 to 8 feet.






Shacks

Level:
Intermediate

Shacks is south of the point and it’s about 2 minutes walk south of Miramar Surf camp you can chose  of going right or left which is the best one to pick .It is the easest wave to get a barrel in Miramar, when you come out the barrel, you can carve it up or run down the line and boost an air. Shacks only works in the mid to  hight tide and it's a consistence break really good to snake out from everybody and go .






Shifts

Level:
All Levels

Located 100 meters from Shacks you are in Shifts, a beach break which can have some rocks.It works when
the tide is full. This wave you'll go a triangles. This is an A frame wave that produces  some of the funnest walls and even hollow barrels when you get the Double Up Drainers! This wave is special because there is an outer reef that that breaks up the energy on Large interval swells and creates this super fun playful, rippable lefts and right A to Frames.






El transito

Level:
All Levels

Located only 40 min by boat from our camp this beach break is a good swell magnet. The sand move around and make corners and sand bars up and down the beach and works good on small to mid days.It’s hardly ever world class, but it does pick up a lot of swell so we typically head down here when the swell is a bit smaller. When it gets overhead it get a bit closed out so we look to other breaks.It’s also a good place to chill, having a drink and a tasty dinner at a beach to front restaurant.El transito is one of the most beautiful beach on the area offer natural tide pools really worth the visit .
