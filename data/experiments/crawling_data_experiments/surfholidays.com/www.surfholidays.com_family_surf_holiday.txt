Looking for a Family Surf Holiday?
There comes a time in everyone's life when it just isn't possible to escape for a few hours every other day and surf. People's lives are getting busier, family takes priority and free time disappears. As long as you do your best to get those few sessions in each month and reward yourself with a family surf holiday then all is not lost.

As parents most of us do our utmost to ensure our offspring get dropped in the ocean at the earliest age.
Start them surfing young
and they will take to it much faster and pretty soon they will be paddling past you in the line-up. Once they get a taste for it you need to quickly ensure that each future family holiday revolves around surfing!

Unfortunately, young kids are unable to trek through fields or goose chase for endless hours to find the perfect wave. Dragging them through the jungles of Indonesia doesn't seem quite right (just yet) so there has to be a solution?


We have selected accommodation options that are perfect for a family surfing holiday.
From large resorts with great facilities to spacious apartments by the beach.  The kids can learn how to surf while the parents either join in or grab some
down time in a hammock
in the shade!


Family Surf Holidays - Combine sunshine with family fun. Lessons start from the age of 6.
The majority of surf schools start teaching
kids from the age of 6,
and sometimes younger if the child is confident in the water. On each surf school listing on our site it is displayed if they do kids lessons. Those that do not will only cater for 12 and up.

Browse through our family surf holiday options and when you go to book your accommodation you can add kids surf lessons in the checkout steps.
