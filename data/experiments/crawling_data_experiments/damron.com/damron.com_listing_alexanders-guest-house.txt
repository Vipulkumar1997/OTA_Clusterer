AlexanderвЂ™s Guesthouse is proudly gay-owned and -operated. Our guests can enjoy complete freedom and a little piece of paradise.

Our refreshing pool serves as a social center of the guesthouse and the spa is a perfect way to relax after a day of shopping and strolling. Guests begin their day with a compimentary expanded continental breakfast served poolside and start their evening of fun with complimentary cocktails at our Pink Monkey Bar. Two sundecks are also available for sunbathing.

Each room is uniquely decorated in a contemporary style. In addition to the basic rooms, AlexanderвЂ™s offers deluxe rooms, suites, and even a full apartment.

Our friendly concierges staff can help make arrangements for bicycles, taxis, and mopeds, as well as nightlife and restaurant recommendations and reservations.
