Sea View Inn at the Beach
3400 Highland Ave, Manhattan Beach, California
310/545вЂ“1504
Southern California's classic beach town. Miles of sandy beach welcome everyone from champion volleyball players to amateur sunbathers. The Los Angeles area's cleanest ocean also has some of its best surfing.  And the Sea View Inn is just a block away, with free parking, heated pool, complimentary bicycles, beach chairs, beach towels & boogie boards.

We're the city's closest hotel to the beach. Minutes away from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), 30 minutes from Disneyland, 45 minutes from Universal Studios, and only 20 minutes to Downtown LA, Beverly Hills, and Santa Monica, yet come home to cool ocean breezes and dazzling sunsets.

Come spend your vacations, get-a-ways, or business travel at your "Home Away From Home," at the Sea View Inn.
