Croatia Gay Cruise Tour 2018 Itinerary

Day 1
-
Friday, July 20, 2018
Zagreb
Bok! Welcome to Croatia. Check-in to our centrally located 4-star
Zagreb
hotel, then meet your fellow adventurers at 2PM before we take a guided tour of Zagreb.

This evening we'll have an optional dinner within walking distance from the hotel.

The four-star
Hotel Dubrovnik
is perfectly located on the main square in central Zagreb. It's just a few steps away from the main city attractions, significant cultural sites, and the main shopping area.

If you are checking in to the hotel under your OUT Adventures reservation, a complimentary arrival transfer will be included.



Day 2
-
Saturday, July 21, 2018
Zagreb / Plitvice Lakes / Split
Our day begins with a stop at Plitvice Lake National Park, which offers an awe-inspiring network of 16 lakes, all connected by a series of cascading waterfalls.
From there, we'll make our way to
Split
, where we'll board our private yacht  the
MV Avangard
 then enjoy dinner onboard followed by a night-tour of the old city and optional drinks at a nearby gay-welcoming bar.



Day 3
-
Sunday, July 22, 2018
Split / Hvar
After breakfast, we depart Split for Hvar. Hvar is the longest Island in the Adriatic and one of the sunniest; known for lavish lavender fields and breathtaking beauty.

Well spend the day on the jet-set island of Hvar for a guided tour and lunch followed by free time to frolic this fabulous port.



Day 4
-
Monday, July 23, 2018
Hvar / Vis
An early departure brings us to the quaint island of Bievo, where the Blue cave awaits providing the weather is in our favour (admission to this natural phenomenon is paid upon entry and costs about 10 EUR).
We then continue to the island of Vis, an isolated former Yugoslav naval base that captures the Mediterranean as it once was.
Taste the exquisite traditional offerings of nearby wineries, visit the remains of the Roman thermal place, hit up the city museum or simply take in the views of the beautiful Rustic Vill on the waterfront.
Tonight we overnight in the port.



Day 5
-
Tuesday, July 24, 2018
Vis / Korcula
This morning we depart for Korcula  the birthplace of Marco Polo  with a swim stop and lunch along the way.
Upon arrival well enjoy a late afternoon walking tour, followed by complimentary appetizers and wine.
Since its only a short walk to the yacht from anywhere in the old town, we encourage you to explore the area and its charming shops, bars and restaurants.



Day 6
-
Wednesday, July 25, 2018
Korcula / Dubrovnik
An early morning departure takes us towards the world-famous town of Dubrovnik, cruising past the old city walls while enjoying a buffet lunch. Well dock in the new port given the large size of our vessel, then transfer into town for a guided walking tour. This will be followed by a cable car ride up Srd Mountain where well soak up the scenic views of the Old City Walls and Elaphiti Islands.

Enjoy the afternoon at your leisure, with plenty of time to explore (we highly recommend walking the famous city walls, which are about 1.9km/1.2mi long and offer a fantastic perspective of the ancient town).



Day 7
-
Thursday, July 26, 2018
Dubrovnik / Trstenik
After lunch, well arrive at Trstenik, on the Peljeac peninsula. Even if youve joined us in Trstenik on a previous OUT Adventure, weve mixed things up with a new winery stop that includes a tour of the grounds and cellar, followed by a luscious 3-course dinner paired with five pristine Croatian wines.

Tonight we overnight in this quaint and charming town.



Day 8
-
Friday, July 27, 2018
Trstenik / Bol / Milna
Our last full day on the yacht, we depart Trstenik while enjoying breakfast.

Our final stop will be the Island of Brac and picturesque town of Bol. Walk along the promenade or swim at one of the famous beaches in Dalmatia  Zlatni Rat (the Golden Cape).

After lunch, enjoy some relaxing time on board prior to our Captains Farewell Dinner with entertainment. Well overnight in the small town of Milna or Bol depending on ferry schedules.



Day 9
-
Saturday, July 28, 2018
Milna / Split / Departure
This morning we bid farewell to our faithful yacht crew, and each other, as our adventure comes to an end. There are no activities planned, so you can depart any time after 1pm (we arrive in Split at approximately 9 AM).
