Welcome to the home of TropOut Phuket 2018
Modern, stylish and fun,
Cassia Phuket
is the perfect base to experience TropOut Phuket. Accommodations at Cassia comprise 1 and 2 bedroom suites, all with separate living area and private balconies. The stunning infinity pool is the perfect place to chill in the sun with friends. Set on the banks of a serene lagoon, complimentary boat shuttles operate to transfer you the short distance to Bang Tao Beach, where the resort has a private beach area.

Facilities
Cassia Phuket is located within the award-winning Laguna Phuket complex, giving TropOut guests access to all resort facilities in the complex. Below are some of the facilities located in and around Cassia for your enjoyment during TropOut.
Resort Spa
Let qualified therapists lull your tense muscles into a state of perfect calm through a wide range of Asian-inspired therapies and treatments.
Infinity Pool @ Cassia
Abounded by sun loungers and day-beds, the infinity pool at Cassia is the perfect place for you to chill under the sun and to meet new friends as chilled tunes fill the air and tropical cocktails flow freely.
Beachside activity centre
Go on a diving excursion, snorkel through shallow waves, try windsailing, or join in a game of beach volleyball. Here, there's an activity for everyone!
Private Beach
Step into a sandy haven- an exclusive private strip of Bang Tao Beach just for TropOut guests with direct access from Cassia. You'll appreciate tanning under the sun and splashing in the Andaman Sea, all in peaceful privacy.
Sports Facilities
For the sporty ones amongst us, Laguna Phuket's stunning and challenging championship golf course is a haven. Will you take out the inaugural TropOut Masters? For those looking for a hit of tennis, the complex's tennis courts are available for use.

Dining
There are over 30 restaurants in the Laguna Phuket complex where Cassia is located for you to experience. Plus for TropOut an authentic street-food village will operate in Cassia and our TropOut Concierge team will be on hand to recommend the best restaurants in Phuket. Below are some of our favourite options.
Baan Talay
Located just across the lagoon from Cassia is Baan Talay (our water taxis will shuttle you to the doorstep!), a traditional Thai restaurant with a focus on fresh and juicy seafood.
Street Food Village
Exclusively for TropOut Thailand 2018, a street-food village will operate within Cassia, so you can sample a traditional green curry, Phad Thai, barbequed seafood and many other authentic Thai dishes without leaving the comfort and atmosphere of our exclusive resort.
Dream Beach Club
The epicentre of much of TropOut, Dream offers a selection of contemporary European, Thai and Mediterranean favourites and a satisfyingly lengthy wine and cocktail menu!
EatOut- TropOut Restaurant Concierge
Feel like getting out and about for a gastronomic experience? Or maybe you and your other half would like a romantic dinner on the beach? The TropOut Concierge team is on hand to give restaurant recommendations, make reservations and arrange transportation. Phuket is home to some of Thailand's best restaurants- you won't be disappointed!


TropOut Story
TropOut was created because we were after a fun and refined travel experience where we could completely relax and be free to be ourselves.
As gay travellers, we can now travel to an ever increasing number of destinations that are accepting of us, but a look here or there when we hold hands or party with friends can leave us feeling guarded.
We want to feel totally unguarded when we travel, but cruises and circuit parties aren't really of interest to us.
Our ideal travel experience is one where we can get out and explore the culture and sights of a new or favourite destination, or rejuvenate in a chilled environment.
And after a day of exploring or chilling, we'd like to return to a stylish setting where we can meet and party with likeminded travellers from all over the world.
So TropOut was born: a new style of gay travel, where travellers from all over the world can chill, party and explore in a fun, yet refined environment.
Our mission as a business is simple: to deliver exceptional and comfortable experiences for gay travellers- experiences filled with relaxation, cultural discovery and chic party.
With the five star Cassia Phuket reserved for TropOut travellers, stylish beach clubs hosting premier parties with world class entertainment, and an array of cultural excursions and wellness options on offer, we have no doubt that we will deliver on our mission for TropOut 2018.
We can't wait for you to join us to Chill, Party & Explore in Amazing Thailand!
