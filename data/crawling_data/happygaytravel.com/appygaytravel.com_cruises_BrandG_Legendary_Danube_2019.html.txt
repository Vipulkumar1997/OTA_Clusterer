To help prepare you for your vacation, we have compiled some important tips. We encourage you to read this information carefully and to bring it with you as a reference during your travels. While traveling, please keep in mind that patience, understanding and the flexibility to adapt to a changing environment will enhance your vacation experience. Despite careful planning, unavoidable circumstances may require last minute changes to your itinerary. However, we have discovered that these deviations often reveal unexpected discoveries.

Traveling reveals new and exciting lifestyles, cuisines and traditions that may be different from what you are used to. Respecting these differences will create an infinitely more pleasant and rewarding experience. We wish you an exciting and memorable vacation.






Passports & Visas
A valid passport is required for all
Brand g
charters; your passport must be valid for at least six months after your return. It is your responsibility to ensure your passport is valid and secure all required visas. Consult with the appropriate consulates to determine if any visas are needed. Vacations can be disrupted, or altered if the correct documents cannot be supplied at airports or border crossings; please check your itinerary carefully. In the event that you lose your passport while traveling, we recommend you photocopy the first pages of your passport, airline tickets, drivers license and/or birth certificate to simplify and expedite the process of replacing lost documents. Keep the originals separate from the copies. This will make replacement easier if you lose them en route. It is also useful to carry spare passport photos. You may wish to scan your passport, airline tickets and credit card numbers and email them to yourself as attachments, so you may download copies to assist in obtaining replacements.






What To Wear
Comfortable clothes and good walking shoes while on land. And, since there are spa facilities, a putting green, shuffleboard and fitness room on the ship, we suggest workout clothes. Jackets and ties are not required. We recommend country club casual for dinner.

Special Diets
Please advise us prior to departure if you have any special dietary requirements. We will make every effort possible to always accommodate your requests, however, please note that local conditions and seasonality can restrict our ability on occasions.






Settling Your Bill Onboard
The day before your cruise ends you will be given an invoice for any onboard charges you may have made. Please check the invoice to make sure all items are accounted for before payment/closing of the account. All onboard charges will be in Euros. Payment is accepted in cash (Euros) or by credit card. Your bank/credit card company will convert this into your card currency at their own exchange rate. Some bank/credit cards may charge a separate fee, as well.






ATMs
ATM machines are widely available throughout Europe and readily accessible during shore excursions; the ship does not have an ATM machine onboard. Prior to traveling, we recommend that you notify your bank of your travel plans so they can inform you of any applicable transaction fees and provide any information on restrictions, etc.

Currency
For Austria and Germany the currency is the Euro, Czech Republic uses Koruna, and the Hungarian Forint for Hungary.






Who travels with
Brand g
?
All of our vacations are created for gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender (LGBT) travelers, along with straight allies, who enjoy innovative escorted vacations to international spots. None of our current trips are designed for participants under the age of 21.



What can I expect on
Brand g
travel program?
All of
Brand g Vacations
will have at least two trip escorts. Depending on the size and location of the program, we will also include signature
Brand g
entertainment, including cabaret artists, DJs and comedians. The true stars of any
Brand g
travel program are the travelers themselves. Whether youre traveling with a partner or interested in making new friends, our trips provide excellent opportunities to explore the world with others that share similar values.






Do you offer a single supplement or a roommate sharing program?
We do offer a single supplement on all of our travel programs; however, it may vary depending on the destination. Our goal with roommate matching is to help facilitate an introduction with other solo travelers prior to your vacation to see if there is compatibility to share a room.



I am traveling by myself; will I be the only single traveler?
Not at all, depending on the trip, anywhere between 15 to 40% of the group will be solo travelers!






Should I buy travel insurance?
Brand g Vacations strongly recommends the purchase of travel insurance to protect against unforeseen circumstances that might prevent you from traveling with us or unfortunate circumstances during your trip. Travel Insurance is an excellent way of protecting your vacation investment. We recommend
Travel Guard
, however you are welcome to shop and compare plans from
other companies
to find the best fit for you.



Is it hard meeting others?
Even the shyest among us end up in group hugs by the end of our cruises. The intimate size (generally 60-150 passengers) provides an opportunity for people to get to know each other in a way not at all possible on large ocean cruises. Countless guests have commented that they arent outgoing, and did not anticipate meeting anyone on their cruises, yet made extraordinary new friends  and, in some cases, partners  onboard.






What does all-inclusive vacation mean?
All-inclusive can never mean every single thing; but at
Brand g
, we come as close as possible. Our trips almost inevitably include pre-cruise hotel stay, all transfers, unlimited wine and beer at lunch and dinner onboard, guided walking tours in every port, etc. When we say inclusive, we mean it! The specifics for this vacation are listed above.



Will I be the youngest onboard?
Mainstream river cruises sometimes have the perception that all the guests are well past retirement age.
Brand g
cruises, on the other hand, host a wide range of ages, from 20s-80s. The average age is mid-50s, but on any given cruise there are a number of much younger and older guests.
Brand gs
entertainment offerings onboard  from shows to parties  make our cruises, in the words of countless cruise staff, the most fun group weve ever had on this ship.
