Gay Ibiza Info

Ibiza is the kind of place that makes you wet your knickers with excitement. Stunning beaches, stunning clubs, stunning weather, stunning men - Ibiza has it all. In fact, it has the holiday experience so right that you may never want to leave.

If the word Ibiza still evokes images of a less than sophisticated group of British youngsters vomiting in the street, then think again - it really couldn't be more different. When they finished filming 'Ibiyfa Uncovered', a 20ft electric fence must have been erected around San Antonio because none of the archetypal tit-flashers seem capable of venturing outside of this tiny area - thankfully. While there are some real tourist traps around, they are easily avoided and the rest of the island is open for your delectation.

A typical day could go something like this: Wake up next to the bronzed Spanish body you fully explored the night before and indulge yourself with a late breakfast. A quick dip in the pool (gently heated to perfection by the glistening sun) then throw on your linen trousers to head to the beach where people frolic in the waves in gay abandonment before peeling off their clothes to blend in those tan lines. Be waited on hand and foot by Alvaro or Nacho (or some-Juan else) as they help you avoid straining any muscles by delivering your desires direct to your sun lounger. If you do break a nail, no need to worry, one of the beachside masseurs will help you relieve your worries (and boy are they cute). When the sun gets too much, a spot of seafood in a sheltered restaurant will help cool you off while you weigh up the pros and cons of a night in the bars versus dancing until the early hours in one of Ibiza's superclubs - decision, decisions.

This is the Ibiza you'll love and we gays have colonised the most beautiful part of the island. Ibiza Town (or Eivissa as the maps will tell you) is the major port of the island and bustles with cosmopolitan vigour. As you sashay through the streets your eyes will been drawn skywards to the towering ramparts that protect the old town (D'alt Vila), home to much of Ibiza's gay scene. This exquisite medieval fortress is a maze of archways, cobbled streets, and castle turrets with outstanding restaurants and bars thrown in for good measure.

Gay Ibiza









Welcome to Gay Ibiza

Since the 1960's it has been one of Europe's main summer gay holiday destinations. Residents have long recognised the popularity of their island with gay men and lesbians from around the world.
The original home of the Balearic beat, famous for its image - loud, brash and utterly outrageous. Whilst the straight holiday hoards head for the "lager lout" resort of San Antonio, gay and lesbian visitors prime destination is the Island's capital - Ibiza Town, a quaint old town with plenty of atmosphere and character. Originally starting out as an inexpensive artists location, Ibiza has been an extremely popular Gay destination for over twenty years. As time passed, the island has been adopted by gay European trend setters and is becoming more and more attractive with American visitors. It's still relatively unspoiled and an interesting place to spend a week or two. Many visitors go simply to enjoy the archaeological sites and the two museums, others find great pleasure in visiting the studios and ateliers at Santa Eulailia Del Rio. To the south west of the town centre is the Puig des Molins, a Punic cemetery. The two other major tourist centres are the coastal towns of San Antonio Abad and Santa Eulalia del RÃ­o. If you fancy a flutter, the Island has its own Casino. Aside from all this, the major attraction is the very relaxed atmosphere of the island. Residents have long recognised that the popularity of their island with gay men and lesbians from around the world have brought them great recognition and prosperity.

The Gay Scene in Ibiza

Once the sun sets, your destination will undoubtedly be the centre of Ibiza Town where you'll find an abundance of
gay bars
and
clubs
. There's something to suit every taste - from small, intimate bars and
restaurants
to large, outrageous clubs, some with open-air dancefloors overlooking the sea, floorshows, live bands and orchestras. Bear in mind, the clubs can be expensive and tickets for the best nights are sometimes difficult to obtain. The varied local cuisine includes rabbit, a wide selection of seafood and pork dishes and numerous locally grown fruits and vegetables. The island has plenty of good wines and aromatic liqueurs and imported alcoholic and soft drinks are also widely available. There are also plenty of cinemas, theatres, concerts and art exhibitions. Also remember, you'll need to
get around
the island by local taxi but these are plentiful and cheap.

The Gay Beaches in Ibiza

There are over 80 different beaches on Ibiza, each one with its own character and atmosphere. Some are sandy, some have pebbles, some are busy and easily reached, others are remote and secluded. There is a beach for all tastes.
There are two main superb gay beaches on Ibiza, with a scattering of other popular beaches around the island. Really the whole of the south of the island has a bustling gay culture ingrained in the clubbing and tourist scene so no problemos with the closed minded on this little beauty of a Med Island.

Cruising
rules pretty much across the south so get ya glad rags on. Also, there's no shortage of Nude beaches and sunbathing spots, with plenty of private rocky coves if your bits are for the chosen few alone.

Playa des Cavallet
, just south of the airport in Ibiza has to be the most popular gay beach on the island, but Ibiza is an island of miles of unspoilt coastline and you choose your spot according to taste. If you're looking for seclusion you'll find it on Ibiza's coast!

Ibiza Clubbing

Ibiza has retained a status for being 'the' clubbing island for a very long time. Occasionally an article will appear stating that it is all over and Goa or Ayia Napa is now the place to see or be seen, but it still does not make any difference to the thousands flocking to Ibiza week after week.
One thing needs stating at the start, if you are looking for a gay club that you will immediately recognise as such, stick to
Anfora
within the walls of Dalt Vila in Ibiza Town, or for as long as it is open Babylon in Botafoc.
Though the majority of the mega-clubs (outside of San Antonio) have at least one gay or "poly-sexual" party a week, these are still predominantly straight affairs. Having said that, if you do want to give the legendary Ibicencen club scene a try at least once in your lifetime, the following pages should point you towards the best nights on offer. Hitting the right club, on the right night, may give you a fresh perspective on why so many people fall in love with the mega-clubs...
