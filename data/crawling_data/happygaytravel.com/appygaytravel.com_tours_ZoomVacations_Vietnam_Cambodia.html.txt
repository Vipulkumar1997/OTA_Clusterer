Gay Vietnam and Cambodia Tour Itinerary


Saigon, Hanoi, China Beach, Halong Bay, and Angkor Wat

Laos Gay Tour
, March 16 - 21, 2018

Day 1
- Wednesday, March 21, 2018

Arrive Hanoi, Vietnam

Hanoi
Hanoi is Vietnam's capital and is described by almost all who go there as an old-fashioned city. Old-fashioned in style, it is a city of lakes, parks, trees, villas, mansions and an area called the Old French Quarter where crumbling houses are crammed into narrow alleyways that are still named after the goods that were traded there  Silk Street, Gold Street, even Fried Fish Street! Hanoi has sidewalk cafes, sidewalk barbers, tree-lined bicycle-filled boulevards, and elegant colonial French mansions.

Arrival:
Upon arrival at Noi Bai Airport, you will be met by our local guide and transferred to your hotel for check-in.

Evening:
Welcome Dinner and Cocktails
This evening we welcome you to Ha Noi with a special dinner at one of the city's most special venues.

Accommodations:

Apricot Hotel, Hanoi

Meals Included:
Welcome Dinner



Day 2
- Thursday, March 22, 2018

Hanoi Sightseeing

7:00 AM to 11:00 AM:
Breakfast is served at the hotel.

Morning:
Hanoi Sightseeing
You will begin your sightseeing with a visit to Ba Dinh Square and the Ho Chi Minh complex. The tomb is monumental, built of marble, granite and precious wood.

Behind the Mausoleum, you can see Ho Chi Minh's house. The simple house where Ho Chi Minh lived and worked is made of wood and enjoys a tranquil setting, with a view of a lotus pond.

There is also the barely concealed misery of the  'Hanoi Hilton' where so many prisoners of war were incarcerated, as well as the religious pride that constructed the beautiful Temple of Literature - it's all here in Hanoi, a microcosm of Vietnamese culture.
Lunch at one of the best restaurants in town  a favorite of prior
Zoom Vacations
guests

Afternoon:
After lunch, you will continue visiting Hanoi and cyclo tour.

This afternoon enjoy the tree-lined streets of Hanoi with its French colonial architecture, including the recently restored Opera House.

Take to the streets of the Ancient Quarter or 36 Streets District by cyclo  Vietnams most traditional form of transport.  Enjoy weaving through the narrow streets and tree-lined avenues. Your personal cyclo rider will take you along some of Hanois boulevards in the center of the town to Hoan Kiem Lake, also known as Lake of the Restored Sword from the legend that surrounds it. The Old Quarter is a densely populated corner of the city which was once a centre of commerce where goods were sold under the street name of a particular guild, with ancient homes and temples interspersed throughout.

Afternoon:
Arrive at Ha Long Bay
Upon arrival in Ha Long Bay we will board a luxurious junk boat. On board a traditional-style luxury sailing junk we meander through the area whose name translates as 'Where the Dragon Descends into the Sea', stop off at an islet and climb through a series of breath-taking caves and grottoes, marveling at some of the most impressive stalactite and stalagmite formations anywhere in the world.

Zoom Vacations
tour guide, and transferred by air-conditioned vehicle on the scenic route to Siem Reap Town giving you a sneak peak of Angkor Wat. Continue on to your hotel to check-in and freshen-up.

The Kingdom of Cambodia remains one of Asias most enthralling destinations, deeply enriched by history and culture that never fails to impress. From the deserted beaches on the Gulf of Thailand to city streets of Phnom Penh where the senses are heightened, from the deep jungles and indigenous tribes of the northwest, to the final mystique and grandeur of the Angkorian period in all its glory, Cambodia is a land as yet untouched by commercialism and development. In its place lie a warm, enigmatic people maintaining the richness of their culture, now for the entire world to see.

Siem Reap is a quaint and peaceful town in the north of the Kingdom of Cambodia; rich in charm and retaining the feel of a big country town, its the perfect base from which to explore the regions Wonders. The city thrives in the shadow of the largest religious building in the world, Angkor Wat; and on the edge of the largest fresh-water Lake in South-East Asia, the Tonle Sap. Beyond the archaeological attractions, lush green countryside rich with culture and tradition and shy but friendly locals welcome you with their warm smiles. Lose yourself in remote jungle temples, trek to the holy mountain of Phnom Kulen and experience an innovative but challenging way of life on a boat trip through a floating village on the Tonle Sap Lake.

Take the time to treat yourself with 1 hour massage treatment, shop at a socially responsible enterprise, local market or an exclusive atelier or enjoy the city's growing cultural and arts scene.

Accommodations:

Belmond La Residence D'angkor, Siem Reap
- Deluxe Room

Meals Included:
Breakfast, Lunch



Day 10
- Friday, March 30, 2018

Siem Reap and Temples: Ta Prohm, Angkor Thom City, Angkor Wat for Sunrise

Early Morning:
After sunrise, we will visit the amazing 12th Century, Hindu inspired temple of Angkor Wat. Angkor Wat is arguably the largest religious building in the world and has a volume of stone equaling that of the Cheops pyramid in Egypt. Conceived by Suryavarman II, Angkor Wat took around 37 years to build and it is generally believed to have been a funeral temple for the king.

It has been occupied continuously by Buddhist monks and is well preserved with ongoing restoration taking place. Intricate bas-reliefs surround Angkor Wat on four sides, and each tells a story, but the most celebrated of all is the Churning of the Sea of Milk, which is located on the east wing.  Your guide will explain the mystical tale... There are also more than 2000 stunning Apsaras throughout the temple and no two are identical.  Keep your entry tickets.

Head back to the hotel for breakfast.

After breakfast you will go back to Angkor Wat to continue your temple exploration. In order to avoid the crowds you will start with Ta Prohm, also known as the Tomb Raider Temple as some scenes from the movie were filmed here. In the dry season it is possible to enter from the spectacular Northern Gate where you will be guaranteed not to see any other tourists. As you trek along jungle paths used only by locals, you will feel like an early explorer; closer to Ta Prohm you will cross the ancient moat and soon after the dense jungle opens to reveal this stunning 12th Century Jungle Temple.

Continue on to Angkor Thom City, the last Capital of the Great Khmer Empire, abandoned in the 17th Century. The high city walls are surrounded by a magnificent 3km x 3km man made moat; you will stop to walk through the Victory gate to appreciate its enormity before continuing by car. Admire the Terrace of the Leper King and the Elephant Terrace before continuing on to the exact center of this great city, which happens to be marked by the marvelous Bayon Temple.

This 12th Century masterpiece is an archaeological wonder of symmetry and grandeur. The exterior gallery walls have extensive and detailed bas-reliefs but the main features are the 49 remaining towers, each with three or four gently smiling faces pointing to the four Cardinal points.

Lunch at a nice local restaurant.

After lunch, we will proceed to the hotel to enjoy some pool time before tonight's event.

Evening:
Zoom Vacations
"Until Next Time" Event.

Accommodations:

Belmond La Residence D'angkor, Siem Reap

Mid-Morning:
Tour of the floating villages of Tonle Sap Lake
Today we will have a chance to visit the Tonle Sap Lake, the largest fresh water lake in South East Asia. It is the heart of the Cambodian fishing industry and the lifeblood for millions of Khmers living on and around it. Every year during the monsoon season, the flow of water from the Mekong River changes direction forcing water back into the Tonle Sap, bringing nutrients that fertilize the rice fields and support the breeding of over 200 fish species and other life. You will board a boat to see the true way of life in one of the floating villages of the Tonle Sap, where you can see how the Khmer and the Vietnamese live and work side by side.

is included at the hotel
