The Caribbean's Newest Ship

Holland Americas sparkling new 2650-guest
Koningsdam
brings you everything RSVP guests love with cutting-edge innovations and brilliant design throughout. Combining the best classical features with striking modern touches, Koningsdam is a true work of art with more dining options than ever before, sensational entertainment venues, and simply gorgeous staterooms. Youll find her spacious open decks and inviting pools provide the perfect place to work on your tan, finish a great book, meet new friends, or even join a RSVP pool game.



Explore Three Gorgeous Islands

Our incredible new itinerary starts in gay-friendly Ft. Lauderdale of course, sailing to one of the most popular islands in the Caribbean. St. Thomas is home to one of the worlds most beautiful beaches, Magens Bay, where youll bask in endless sunshine and crystal blue waters. Well then sail to the exciting new port of Amber Cove, an RSVP first, on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic. Its a perfect spot for exploring untamed wonders or relaxing on pristine powder-white beaches. Our final stop is our private island of Half Moon Cay, always an RSVP favorite. Relax on your own private beach surrounded by warm clear waters and endless water sports, with more options than ever before.



The Real Fun Is Right Here

Of course, the best days on an RSVP cruise are spent enjoying a day at sea. Start with a lazy brunch with friends. Wander up to our sunny decks, sparkling pools, and whirlpools to play and relax. Treat yourself to a treatment in the award-winning Greenhouse Spa, simply the newest and most modern spa at sea. Take in a fitness class from our talented instructors, or work out in the super-modern gym. Or get your game on at our outdoor basketball/volleyball court. Just save energy for RSVPs signature t-dances, pool games, and general good times all day long.



Culinary Wonders Reimagined

One of the best parts of any RSVP vacation is sharing a meal with friends old and new, and youll find a breadth of remarkable dining options to enjoy onboard Koningsdam. From the ultra-modern main restaurant, to favorites like Pinnacle Grill steakhouse, Tamarinds Asian specialties, Canalettos rustic Italian, and the all-new Sel de Mer seafood brasserie and Culinary Arts Centers farm-to-table dining, youll find something for every taste and style. And forget everything youve heard about cruise ship buffets -- the new Lido Market turns out a never-ending spread day and night that always keeps you coming back for more.

Every RSVP meal is designed for sharing great times, with no assigned dining times and no stuffy dress codes.



Bright Stars. Brilliant Venues.

With more dazzling entertainment than ever before, youll enjoy RSVP signature performers from the gay and lesbian world, stage and screen, along with Holland Americas award-winning productions. RSVPs stellar line-up of musical artists, comedians, cabaret acts has included such legends as Kathy Najimy, Ann Hampton Callaway, Leslie Jordan, and Ty Herndon along with RSVP favorites Amy & Freddy, Bob the Drag Queen, Sister Helen Holy, and so many more. Look for an amazing new lineup in 2018.

Koningsdam
features stunning new venues that let our stars shine brighter than ever, starting with the innovative World Stage, featuring a 270-degree wrap-around LED screen. And the two-story Queens Lounge showcases RSVP cabaret stars in a whole new way. Notes Piano Bar lets RSVP piano players tear up the keys up-close, while Lincoln Center Stage showcases the best in classical music. Well even produce poolside concerts, movies under the stars, and a host of thrilling surprises. One thing is certain 
Koningsdam
offers the greatest stage ever for RSVP performers.



Parties For Everyone

Koningsdams
wide-open center pool creates the perfect setting for RSVPs famous t-dances and evening parties under an endless Caribbean sky (with a retractable cover just in case of inclement weather). Our talented DJs play your favorite hits at our legendary theme parties. No matter what your taste in music, well welcome you to the dance floor with friends like you everywhere you turn.



Your RSVP. Easier Than Ever.

With fares as low as $899, its easier than ever to join us on our newest vacation. This amazing value includes virtually everything, from world-class entertainment and fabulous parties to incredible accommodations and dining. For over 32 years, RSVP has been creating amazing vacations where everyone is truly welcome. Whether youre traveling with your partner, spouse, friends, or on your own, youll find endless opportunities to connect, play, and simply relax. Theres no better place in the gay and lesbian world where you belong!






Having debuted in April 2016,
Koningsdam
is Holland America's newest and most luxurious ship, with modern updates to their timeless traditions. This groundbreaking 2650-passenger vessel features striking modern design and seemingly endless ocean views along with truly unique entertainment venues and cutting-edge dining options.



Innovative and Flexible Dining Choices

Koningsdam
offers an exciting blend of delicious options for all tastes and styles in an incredible choice of new venues. As with all RSVP cruises, there is never an assigned table, dress code (that's rightno more formal nights), or assigned dining time  you're always free to dine whenever, wherever, and with whomever you like. It's the perfect way to make new friends!

Framed by views of the sea and anchored by a stunning copper-sheathed wine tower, the heart of
Koningsdam
rests in
The Dining Room
, with an ultra-modern interior and lavish multi-course menus to delight the senses.

Abundant casual options begin with the
Lido Market
, a modern marketplace featuring themed stations that change throughout the day to tantalize your palate. From pizza and panini to comfort classics and hand-carved meats, you'll find a wide range of choices. Grab a delicious slice at
New York Deli & Pizza
or a mouth-watering burger poolside at
Dive-In
or a sumptuous snack at the new
Grand Dutch Café
. The choices are endless and virtually always available.

And of courseif those options aren't enough, there's always 24-hour room service. Please note that charges apply to some room service offerings.

Specialty Restaurants
For a masterpiece of grilled premium steaks and fresh seafood, look no further than Holland America's classic
Pinnacle Grill
. This intimate venue offers an elegant, sophisticated dining experience that's perfect for a date or celebratory dinner.

Canaletto Restaurant
,
Koningsdam's
signature Italian restaurant, serves fresh made pastas and other fabulous Italian specialties family-style in a casual yet sophisticated setting.

Tamarind Restaurant
and
Silk Den Lounge
offer spectacular pan-Asian cuisine with truly stunning panoramic views of the ocean.

Sel de Mer
is an intimate seafood brasserie offering French classics with a twist. From bouillabaisse and fresh oysters to salt-crusted whole fish, this new restaurant concept is sure to impress.

HAL's innovative
Culinary Arts Center
will now magically transform from its show kitchen and hands-on cooking classes during the day to a beautiful farm-to-table restaurant each evening. Simple, artisanal dishes prepared by chefs at the center of the action create an experience that is unrivalled at sea.

Please note that an extra charge applies for all specialty restaurants.

Healthy Options & Special Needs
For guests with special dietary needs, RSVP and Holland America offer "Light and Healthy" menu items featuring meals low in sodium and cholesterol, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, fat-free, diabetic, or other special needs, as requested.



New And Unique Places to Relax

Whether you want to enjoy private time outdoors or spend the week in a spa stateroom,
Koningsdam
offers an amazing selection of new choices for total pampering and relaxation.

The striking and modern main pool features plenty of space to relax, swim, and play. There's even a full "magradome" roof that can be closed to create an indoor pool space. Private cabanas will be available to reserve by the day onboard. They are tastefully decorated, filled with amenities, and provide an exquisite poolside retreat.

On the aft end of the ship, you'll find the inviting Seaview Pool, home to our afternoon T-Dances and evening parties. It's the perfect place for sunning, relaxing, and taking in the endless ocean views.

The Greenhouse Spa & Fitness Center
is the ideal place to go for heavenly beauty and wellness rituals. Enjoy a facial, hot stone massage, or a steam in the thermal suite. Soothe your tensions away in the relaxing hydro pool, or make time for a workout in
Koningsdam's
state-of-the-art fitness center.



Innovative Entertainment and Enrichment Venues

The incredible
World Stage
breaks new ground theatrically with it's reimagined 270 degree stage that puts guests right in the center of the action. You'll be closer than ever to our star entertainers surrounded by vibrant LED screens that will leave you breathless.

The
Queen's Lounge
, a striking two-tiered nightclub and performance venue, hosts RSVP's cabaret acts and then transforms to the hottest late-night dance club on the high seas!

Koningsdam's
new
Lincoln Center Stage
showcases outstanding chamber music performances each evening, as well as afternoon recitals on leisurely sea days.

One of RSVP guests' favorite spots,
Crow's Nest
, boasts panoramic views that change with each nautical mile, creating an airy, expansive place to relax and the perfect venue for many of our social gatherings.

If you're feeling lucky,
Koningsdam's

Casino
, with its popular slot machines and table games, offers an elegant way to play in style.



Spacious and Modern Staterooms

Guided by guest feedback, the designers at Holland America were given complete freedom to reimagine
Koningsdam's
staterooms, creating private havens characterized by light, space, and elegance. With welcome modern touches like bedside USB ports and frameless shower glass doors, her staterooms and suites are larger than most in the industry and provide the perfect retreat after a busy day experiencing all that RSVP has to offer.

Most staterooms offer a private verandah and all feature modern amenities, such as flat-screen televisions with video on demand, HAL's signature Mariner's Dream bed with finely woven cotton linens, large bathrooms, and 100% Egyptian cotton towels.

Koningsdam's
luxurious suites offer a series of luxurious amenities along with spacious rooms with sitting areas. Suites SQ, SC, SB, SA, & PS even boast access to the private Neptune Lounge.

Should you need anything day or night,
Koninsdam's
pampering staff is just a phone call away and ready to take care of your every need.

Fort Lauderdale, Florida - February 11, 2018

There's no better place to kick off the fun of an RSVP vacation than on the beaches of gay friendly
Fort Lauderdale
. The city has rolled out the rainbow carpet to welcome us, with favorites Hunters, The Manor, and Village Pub ready to entertain you! Our partnership with
Starwood Hotels & Resorts
gives you multiple options for your pre-cruise stay at discounted rates.



At Sea - February 12, 2018

Koningsdam
is all yours to explore today. Indulge in all she has to offer  from the Greenhouse Spa to her inviting pools. Or gear up for Sister Helen Holys first round of jackpot bingo. Just save some energy for a bit of silliness with our first T-Dance and zany pool games with RSVP Cruise Director Brad.

Now that youve come to know our little

Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas - February 14, 2018

Happy Valentines Day! Tonight well celebrate in red and pink, but before then, enjoy this spectacular island. Though its only 32 square miles in size, St. Thomas has a million miles worth of things to do. Go shopping, snorkeling, and sightseeing, or diving and dining at some of the Caribbeans most fabulous restaurants. Always ranked among the worlds Top Ten beaches, Magens Bay is our favorite. Still a popular gay hangout, look for the Little Magens section on the right along Peterborg Peninsula.



Amber Cove, Dominican Republic - February 15, 2018

Amber Cove combines colonial architecture with modern amenities, including a huge poolside lounge with swim-up bar, restaurants, cabanas, waterslides, water sports rentals, and zip lines.

At Sea - February 16, 2018

Today is our final Sea Day. Its your chance to enjoy endless sunshine as we sail toward the Bahamas. Looking for something a little different to elevate your RSVP experience? How about taking a class in our Culinary Arts Center or joining teamRSVP member Ty at the RSVP Book Club? Tonight is our biggest party of the week  our YouCreate Party, the party guests choose! We cant wait to see what you all come up with for its theme!



Half Moon Cay, Bahamas - February 17, 2018

RSVP returns to one of our most requested beach destinations, where warm Bahamian waters as blue as they come and pure white sand beaches beckon. The best part? The island is all ours today! After the island fun, join us for our final T-Dance of the week! Its our traditional Color T-Dance and the color iscerulean! Thats all.



Fort Lauderdale, Florida - February 18, 2018

We're back to where it all beganin beautiful gay-friendly
Fort Lauderdale
. With many of you heading home this Sunday, we wish you all safe travels. For those looking for a Sunday Funday afternoon, brunch and drinks at Rosie's Bar & Grill is a favorite of RSVP cruisers!






Take a Look Around the
Koningsdam

The iconic Queen's Lounge is a two-tiered nightclub and will host popular RSVP cabaret acts. And following the evening's entertainment, the room transforms into a late-night dance club fueled by state-of-the-art sound and special LED lighting effects.



Billboard Onboard

Billboard Onboard will showcase the talents of live musicians performing dynamic shows centered on interesting facts and figures of the music industry.
