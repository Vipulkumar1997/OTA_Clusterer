Quote or Reservation






All-Gay. All-Inclusive. All- Incredible.

The ultimate gay resort vacation is better than ever in 2018 at the newly re-imagined Club Atlantis Cancun. Atlantis takes over the entire
Club Med Cancun
resort for an incredible experience on three stunning private beaches filled with entertainment, sports, activities, parties, and great friends. There's no better place in the world to relax in total comfort, learn a new skill, challenge yourself, cut loose, or just spend time with friends old and new. All for one low all-inclusive price!






In 2018, our favorite mega-resort will be transformed once again, with a host of new features including 60 new stylish beachfront 2 bedroom rooms, two redesigned and expanded restaurants to enhance the gourmet dining experience, and a newly modernized theater.






New Ways to Play. Your Way.

Our Club Atlantis all-gay resort weeks are designed to create the perfect beach vacation in a welcoming gay and lesbian environment. For one very special week, this stunning resort becomes ours  filled with the entertainment, sports, activities, parties and sense of fun that makes an Atlantis vacation extraordinary.

Perfect your tennis game, learn to windsurf, kayak on the Caribbean sea, snorkel our private reef, or challenge yourself to the flying trapeze. You'll find an incredible array of activities at Club Atlantis, ranging from sports with expert instruction to unique experiences like Club Med's famous Circus School.




And that's just the beginning. Explore the nearby jungle, run on the beach, or simply relax with friends under the Caribbean sunshine. No matter how you like to play, our team and expert instructors are ready to take you to the top of your game.

Throughout your week, our Atlantis team entertain you with games, activities, skits, and some unexpected craziness. Settle into a chair on one of our three stunning white sand beaches and enjoy the warm ocean breezes. You're always free to do everything or nothing at all. It's your resort to enjoy, on your schedule, any way you dream.






A Private Oasis. Designed for Us.

Club Med Cancun continues to exceed our guest's expectations and has for years been a favorite Atlantis premium resort destination. You'll love the refined rooms with stunning amenities, the most beautiful (and private) beaches in Cancun, our inviting central pool, four gorgeous and delicious restaurants, our new modern theater, and the friendliest staff you've ever encountered.






In the center of our all-gay village, a sparkling pool creates a magical setting for sunning, swimming, water volleyball, or Atlantis' engaging pool games. The adjacent outdoor lounge and bar rival the hippest beach lounges in South Beach or Rio. There's no better place for relaxing during the day and enjoying the warm ocean breezes at night.






Outstanding Entertainment. Everywhere.

As the day ends, there's nothing quite like an Atlantis sunset T-dance on one of the world's best beaches. Afterwards, meet friends for a pre-dinner drink by the poolside or oceanfront bars.

As night falls, our theater comes alive with some of the top gay talent in the USA including comedians, singers, and our original specialty acts. Afterwards, stroll down to the open-air nightclub for Atlantis famous parties featuring some of the world's top gay DJs. Our theme parties are legendary, and we create a friendly environment with something for everybody.

And if you're looking for more, take in a late night cabaret under the stars, or a quiet stroll down the beach under the moonlight.





Always the Best Gay Vacation Value

At Club Atlantis, absolutely everything is included -- accommodations, all meals, sports, activities, entertainment, parties, gratuities, and even drinks at our bars. All this starts at a low $1499 per person for seven nights of true excitement! It's truly the best value in all-gay vacations. Anywhere.

Although it has the feeling of being worlds away, Club Atlantis is just minutes from the vibrant heart of Cancun, Mexico's incredible Mayan ruins, and numerous other cultural attractions. We work closely with the locals so that you get to enjoy both the beauty of our resort and experience the magic of this amazing area.

Join us as Club Atlantis returns to our most active and alluring resort. An unforgettable and occasionally outrageous time awaits you on the perfect beach.






All This Plus Boot Camp

Atlantis Boot Camp returns in a continuing effort to help you achieve your fitness and healthy lifestyle goals.  Come join us throughout the week for this invigorating workout!





Smart. Sexy. And Beautifully Designed.

We know you'll love the refined rooms with stunning amenities, the most beautiful beaches in all of Cancun, our inviting central pool area, three beautiful restaurants, and the friendliest staff you've ever met.

In the center of our all-gay village, a sparkling pool creates a magical setting for sunning, swimming, water volleyball, or Atlantis' engaging pool games. The adjacent outdoor lounge and bar rival the hippest beach lounges in South Beach or Rio. There's no better place for relaxing during the day and enjoying the warm ocean breezes at night.




Delicious in Every Way.

Four beautiful restaurants invite you to enjoy a variety of cuisines throughout the day. Club Med's famous international buffet offers lavish breakfast, lunch, and dinner options in a casually upscale setting. Indulge in contemporary Mexican-French cuisine at our dramatic beachside specialty restaurant. Meet friends for a leisurely dinner at our new steakhouse. Or enjoy a casual snack anytime at the café. Four stylish bars provide a great place to meet, relax, and enjoy. And since everything is included there's never a check to pay or extra charges.

With Atlantis, there's never a dress code or set dining time. We invite you to dine when you want during restaurant opening hours, with whomever you please. We believe that every meal should be relaxing, friendly, and always delicious.





Your Place to Call Home.

Every one of our rooms are perfectly designed for a beach vacation, and feature flat screen TVs, super-comfortable pillow-top beds, modern bathrooms with rain showers, and stunning Mexican furniture. All have private balconies, and many offer stunning ocean views. Our new two-bedroom suites are perfect for friends travelling together!

For the ultimate in beachfront luxury, indulge in the brand new Jade complex, featuring a private pool, concierge service, special menus, afternoon cocktail hour, complimentary internet, and stunning upgraded rooms. We offer both suites and concierge rooms in this gorgeous setting.
