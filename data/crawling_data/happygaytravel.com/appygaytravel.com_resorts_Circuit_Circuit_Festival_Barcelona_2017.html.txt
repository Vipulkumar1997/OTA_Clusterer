Circuit Festival

Circuit Festival is organised by nightlife promoter from Barcelona Matinée Group. Born more than twenty years ago, this company has achieved an international recognition and produces events such as Circuit Festival, La Leche! Festival, Matinée Easter Weekend, Girlie Circuit Festival and Matinée Summer Festival, as well as the Matinée World Tour, present in over 50 countries worldwide. The company also has a radio show, a record label and a streetwear brand.






In 2008, Matinée Group created a concept that changed the scene forever. For the first time in history, the best parties, promoters and international artists gathered in Barcelona to celebrate a week of clubbing and holidays that turned the city into what we know it for today: the international gay capital during the summer. It was the beginning of Circuit Festival.






Circuit Festival means discovering the best music on Earth, meeting with friends from all over the world and making new ones, celebrating cultural and affective diversity, discovering a city that has an endless leisure and cultural offer, visiting beautiful beaches and incredible places... But, above it all, we want Circuit Festival to be the place where your dreams can come true.






Weve already been ten years with you. Ten years of music, memories and exciting stories. Thats why this year we are coming up with the biggest Circuit Festival ever: a real XXL edition. Expect 15 whole days (3 full weekends!), new spaces and themed parties, the best DJs and astonishing events that will leave you breathless. We only have one aim: to make this summer the best one of your life... Do you want to join us?

Welcome to the 10th anniversary of Circuit Festival 2017. The best is yet to come...
