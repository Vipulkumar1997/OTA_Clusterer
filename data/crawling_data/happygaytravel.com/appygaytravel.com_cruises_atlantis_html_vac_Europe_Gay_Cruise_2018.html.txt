Italy & Greek Isles
Europe's Largest All-Gay Cruise 2018

August 21  31, 2018
Celebrity
Reflection

Get onboard the largest gay cruise Europe has ever seen with our all-new adventure on the massive 3000-guest Celebrity
Reflection
. Explore the best of Italy and the Greek Isles as we sail from Rome to some of the most beautiful islands in the world  including an overnight in stunning Mykonos. Onboard well dazzle you with endless stellar entertainment, the worlds best outdoor parties, and more fun than you ever imagined.




2018th Europes Largest Gay Cruise

With over 3000 guests joining us from over 50 different nations, the Atlantis Med gay cruise has become the largest and most diverse gay experience in the world. Over half of our 3000 guests are from Europe, with large groups from Australia, Brazil, and beyond. Its a unique place to revel together, take pride in who we are, and have fun along the way. In 2018, were thrilled to create a brand new experience on the largest weve ever sailed in Europe!

While most of our entertainment is in English, Atlantis welcomes guests who speak French, German, Spanish, Italian, & Portuguese through our international hosts and many special events.




Islands from Italy to Greece

It all begins in magical Rome, the perfect place to start a Mediterranean voyage. Well set sail to the vibrant coastal city of Naples, where the historical treasures of Pompeii, magical cliffs of Naples, thrilling coasts of Amalfi, and sensuous streets of Sorrento beckon.

After a relaxing day at sea, the shores of Crete beckon where pure azure waters meet sandstone shores and charming villages. From there we sail to the island playground of Mykonos, certainly the most famous gay resort destination in the world. Our overnight visit gives you plenty of time to explore the islands inviting beaches, dazzling shopping, tantalizing restaurants, and throbbing nightlife.

Save some energy to explore the whitewashed cliffs of Santorini where picturesque towns hover over the sea and inviting beaches of every color offer cool refreshment. Stay for one of the worlds best sunsets before heading back to the ship for a night of fun.




And Beyond

After another vibrant day at sea youll awake to the mysteries and windswept buildings of Malta, creating one of the worlds most fabulous settings for a day of exploration. The only thing more dramatic might be our next day in Sicily, where the inviting historical town of Palermo has marveled travelers for centuries.

Finally, Atlantis makes our first-ever visit to Sardinia where the capital city of Cagliari welcomes you to their medieval hilltop Castello and white sandy shores.




Endless Possibilities

Youll sail the most modern ship sailing today, the beautiful Celebrity
Reflection
 and the largest ship in the Celebrity fleet. Magnificent teak decks invite you to relax in the sun, enjoy a refreshing swim, or take part in our zany pool games. Best of all, its a perfect setting for Atlantis signature outdoor T-dances and outrageous evening parties.

Discover an oasis of calm at AquaSpa, our soaring indoor solarium. For a little indulgence, visit the Canyon Ranch spa where a state-of-the art gym, challenging fitness classes, and an array of indulgent treatments for every taste await.

For something truly original, sink your toes into our real grass lawn to enjoy a picnic or watch the stars. Meet new friends at the expansive outdoor Sunset Bar. Or indulge in one of the many exciting restaurants offering something for every taste.




Great Friends. Amazing Experiences.

Whether you come with a partner, friends, or on your own well make you feel right at home. Everything we do is designed to bring people together, whether youre exploring a new city, laughing at our comics, learning about wine, or joining a table of new friends. Our relaxed atmosphere makes it easy to feel comfortable, from the first day at the pool to nights filled with the silliest costumes youve ever seen.

Theres no better place to meet friends than over a delectable and casual meal.
Reflections
ultra-modern main restaurant boasts a two-story glass wine tower setting the stage for the freshest and most distinctive cuisine at sea. And thats just the beginning of a culinary adventure that spans seven delicious restaurants and an incredible variety of flavors and styles.

Majestic
Celebrity Reflection

Celebrity
Reflection
redefines the cruise experience with spacious modern staterooms, stunning design, and resort features. The worlds top designers have created smart, sexy public spaces and restaurants throughout.

Step outside and marvel at the magnificent open wood decks and modern Solarium  perfect for relaxing, enjoying a refreshing swim, taking in our pool games, or enjoying one of Atlantis signature outdoor T-dances.




Exciting Modern Spaces

With her magnificent architecture and advances in technology,
Reflection

Reflection
is unlike any ship ever built.

The vast outdoor pool deck features teak decks and overhead sails, flowing effortlessly into the massive indoor Solarium. Further up, youll discover the worlds first natural lawn on a ship  the Lawn Club. Its a perfect spot for relaxing with friends or perhaps a game of lawn bowling. At night its even better as the Lawn Club Grill comes to life with an interactive outdoor grill under the stars.

Reflection
boasts uniquely designed lounges and bars, including Martini Bar with its ice-covered bar and CellarMasters wine bar. And of course, theres always action in the sophisticated Casino.

The crown jewel is literally on top of the ship  a stunning cabaret lounge called Sky where floor to ceiling windows bring you closer to both the sea and sky.




More Choices of Modern Dining

Ten unique restaurants offer a variety of pleasures for a wide range of tastes. The Grand Cuvée restaurant boasts an amazing two-story wine tower along with stunning ocean views, setting the perfect stage for Celebritys fresh and delicious cuisine. Unique specialty restaurants include the spectacular Tuscan Grille Italian steakhouse. Pick up an iPad and explore Qsines innovative, playful, and daring menus. Our AquaClass guests delight in the light Mediterranean cuisine of Blu. And Suite guests have their very own private dining room called Luminae.

The elegant and refined Murano is the perfect place for an extraordinary evening of world-class dining, superb wines, and modern elegance. Or spend an evening under the stars at the Lawn Club Grill for one of the most unique experiences at sea.


For something more casual, Oceanview Café is open virtually all the time (including Atlantis famous late-night selections), featuring a variety of tempting choices in a breezy open setting. Theres even an outdoor poolside grill for lunch and snacks throughout the day. Sip a coffee in Café al Bacio, savor fresh homemade gelato, or a healthy lunch in the AquaSpa café. Relax with friends in Bistro on Five. No matter what your taste is, well find a delicious way to indulge it.

As with all Atlantis cruises there is never a dress code, and no assigned dining times. Ever!



A Spa for Your Senses

Lose yourself in
Reflections
deeply indulgent Canyon Ranch SpaClub, featuring pampering treatments and the immersive Persian Garden. Bask in the soothing tranquility of the Solarium, whose indoor pool is surrounded by dancing waterfalls and exceptionally comfortable lounge chairs.

The state-of-the art fitness center rivals the best gyms at home, equipped with the latest cardio machines, a full set of weight-training gear, and a variety of challenging classes. Workout. Relax. Repeat.


Your Stateroom. Reinvented.
From the balcony to the bathroom to the living area itself, no ship has better-designed or more beautiful accommodations than
Reflection
. Theyve been re-engineered for a modern traveler with clean sightlines, simple and comfortable design, and innovative storage throughout. Over 85% of the ship has balconies overlooking the ocean. Every room features a comfortable bathroom, plenty of closet space, decadent pillow-top bedding, and a fantastic interactive television system. And with 24-hour room service available, you might never leave your stateroom!
And if you want to stay connected, Celebritys new Xclerate internet offers near broadband speeds onboard. For an extra charge, of course.
For an added touch of luxury without breaking the bank, upgrade to a Concierge Class room, where suite-like amenities await you in the best locations on the ship. The unique AquaClass staterooms offer personalized sensory elements along with spa-inspired amenities, all designed to bring a bit of the spa experience back to your stateroom. Plus, they include complimentary priority access to Blu restaurant and complimentary access to the Persian Garden thermal suite.
