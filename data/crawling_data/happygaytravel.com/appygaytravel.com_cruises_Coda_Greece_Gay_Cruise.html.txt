All-Gay Aegean Odyssey Aboard
Harmony V
MegaYacht

8 days Greek Islands & Turkey Gay Cruise from/to Athens, Greece


August 24  31, 2018
Variety Cruises M/Y
Harmony V




Our all-gay yacht adventure is the ideal way to experience what many consider the worlds most beautiful islands: the Greek Islands. We will explore ancient archaeological sites and taverna-lined harbors, dine on fresh seafood and try out our talent for traditional Greek dances after a few rounds of ouzo!

The
Harmony V
is the perfect vessel for this intimate gay adventure. The
Harmony V
is a modern elegant yacht with a sleek high-tech look very similar to the private yachts to be found in the famous ports of the world. We at Coda Tours have been sailing the Greek Islands since the late 70s and have built up friendships and knowledge in the area that permit us special attention when we arrive in port. This is a customized, tailor-made journey that you will remember for a lifetime.
