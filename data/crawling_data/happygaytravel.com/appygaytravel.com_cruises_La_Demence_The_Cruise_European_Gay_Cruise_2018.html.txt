Unforgettable
Create moments and encounters you will remember the rest of your life.

Unexpected
Exciting ports of call. Wild parties and new friends. Quiet moments alone with the sea. Open yourself each day to new surprises.






The Ship

Our friendly space.
For our 8th edition, we will enjoy the spaciousness, comfort and amazing views of the
Sovereign
.
Sovereign
is the sister ship of
Monarch
,
and will be renovated in November 2017. It is operated by Pullmantur Cruise Lines. A ship offering the perfect size for our community feeling, that we all love so much.

So join us on
Sovereign
, operated by Pullmantur Cruise Lines:
• 2.324 passenger capacity
• 5-story Central Atrium
• Double Pools
• 360° Panoramic Bar
• Expanded Gym
• the Waves Yacht Club (new) - exclusive area for Suites.





The Cabins

A range of cabins to fit your style
The Cruise offers a selection of private homes at sea, so you can choose the one that best suits your style and pocketbook.

One of our luxury suites with a private balcony? A comfortable interior cabin for the budget traveller? A sea view? The choice is yours.

All cabins provide you with a private en-suite bathroom, dressing table, television, safe box, hair dryer and 220V outlets.





The Experience
Laugh. Chill. Explore.
We supply everything, but you are the artist.
A rich palette of possibilities has been carefully assembled for you: fabulous shore visits, good food, dozens of on-board activities, entertainments and parties, plus always the option to sit back and do absolutely nothing.

On
The Cruise
, we set up the canvas and hand you the brush, 
so you can paint the perfect holiday by following your own inspiration, each moment.

Traveling Alone? you wont be for very long.






Relax: Water + Sun

The ship has left the pier. Leave your shore-bound life behind.
On board this floating gay village, two large pools, two jacuzzis and sundecks for every taste, guarantee you will get all the sun  and water you want.

Afternoons, DJs spin chilled lounge music around the pools. Relax with new and old friends, take a dip, chat, order a refreshing drink. Or slip away to one of our quiet decks, where all you hear is the sound of the breeze and the sea. If tan lines aren't your thing, head up to our highest decka discrete haven for nude sunbathers.





Eat Well

Eat what you like, when you like. Feel like a midnight snack,
formal dinner or healthy lunch? The choice is yours.
With four restaurants on board plus room service, you will never go hungry. 
The
Sovereign
features three à-la-carte dinner restaurants (also serving lunch on days we are at sea), a full buffet with extended opening hours, and a 24-hour snack buffet.





Daytime Fun

When (and if) you're ready to leave your deck chair, we're ready for some fun.
Sporty? Head to the ocean-view gym, test your grip on the climbing wall or challenge a friend to a game of paddle tennis. Want pampering? Book a treatment at the Spa and Beauty Salon. Did you meet someone you'd like to sit in the dark with? Sneak into the 24-hour cinema. Shopaholic? Eight duty free shops are calling.

In addition, we organize fun activities like the Mister
The Cruise
competition, the hilarious "High Heels Run", a treasure hunt, singles games and much more.






Entertain Me

Once again this year,
we add our own specialty entertainment
to the ship's excellent offerings.
Laugh with Nickie Nicole, Maman and her girls.
Thrill at the unstoppable voice of La Diva Live. In addition, marvel at the shows offered in the Broadway Theatre by the ships international team of professional dancers and singers.

Prefer to make your own fun? Test your talent in the karaoke bar or try your luck at the on-board casino.

Or enjoy the cocktails for groups (singles, nationalities, ...) in the spectacular 360° Panoramic Bar.





Naughty/Nice Parties

As evening falls, the pool deck is transformed into Europes hottest and friendliest floating open-air gay party land, complete with the best sounds, lights and a happy, high-energy crowd.

Check out the party themes and start planning your costumes! While costumes are not mandatory, it is much more fun to have a little something in your suitcase, so you can join in.

Sunset Tea Dance
The perfect way to celebrate another day of blissful relaxation at sea and intriguing adventures on shore. Gather for some light-hearted fun as the light turns to gold.

Night Party
Dance the night away under the stars in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, to the beats of the best LA DEMENCE DJs. We greet the magic moment of sunrise with a last dance. Open air cruising zone.

After Party
Not ready for the party to end? Or just waking up and feel like dancing your way to breakfast? Head to the ship's disco for our after party. With darkroom.

DJs on board
to be announced soon






The Single Experience

Every year, we welcome hundreds of singles on board.
Join us!
Some just love to do their own thing. For the others, we offer several opportunities to make new friends or strike up a romance. From singles dinner tables to mix-and-mingle cocktail hours, we help you connect. The ship itself does the rest of the workthe warm, friendly village atmosphere means you won't find yourself alone unless you choose to create some "me" time.

Most of our single friends share a cabin with someone they didn't know before. And while many say they were nervous about this at the start, by the end they rush to tell us what a wonderful time they had with their roommate. If you join our "single share program", you will share the cabin with someone of your age.






The Sovereign

Space. Large Choice. Still Friendly
This sister ship of
Monarch
will be renovated in November 2017, which you will feel and see as soon as you board the ship.

The Cruise
is known for its friendly atmosphere, and the more intimate setting of its mid-size ships, the perfect size for our community feeling, that we all love so much.

Perhaps the most gay-friendly city in Europe, the Catalan capital offers visitors a rich mix of unique textures, sights and experiences. Lose yourself in the winding, medieval streets of Barrio Gótico.

Marvel at world-renowned architectural treasures like Gaudís Guëll, as well as striking contemporary creations like Aqbar Tower. Show off your latest swimwear on the gay beaches of Barceloneta or Mar Bella.

• Shopping queens feel at home on the Passeig de Gracia, which boasts various shops and stunning architecture.




Day 2 - Tuesday, July 10, 2018

Day At Sea

Slow down. Relax. Maybe visit the gym.

The mix of architectural styles reveals the waves of different invaders that conquered this place over the centuries. So do the features of the locals!

Day 4 - Thursday, July 12, 2018

Catania (Sicily), Italy

Catania is Sicilys second largest city and lies under the shadow of mount Etna. This stunning volcano shaped both the history and existence of Catania. The city, having been destroyed by lava eruptions on many occasions, was rebuilt in baroque style in the 17th century.
Nicknamed the lava city, this grey city with large avenues and wide open squares is unique in the world.

Day 5 - Friday, July 13, 2018

Valletta, Malta

The Archipelago of Malta consists of 19 islands, from which only the larger three, Malta, Gozo and Comino are inhabited. Maltas geographical location in the centre of the Mediterranean, made it an alluring and much-fought-over prize, which shows in the various above- and below-ground defences that can be found everywhere on the islands.

The capital, Valletta, built by the Knights of St John, is a harmonious grid. It is packed with interest, yet is laid-back and easy. Rocky stretches of coast, limestone cliffs with sheltered bays, gold beaches, beautiful towns, crystal clear sea, friendly people and breath-taking views, make this an ideal holiday destination. In brief, Malta equals architectural elegance and layers of undisturbed history that are definitely worth a visit.

The Marivent Palace was offered by the city to the then Prince Juan Carlos I of Spain. The royals have since spent their summer holidays in Palma.

The city has a very rich history with many cultural highlights: the old city with its famous La Seu cathedral, the Arab Baths, the Town Hall, the Plaza de España, just to name a few.

Offering all the amenities and comfort of the exterior cabins,
at a price that leaves more in your pocket for a day of luxury during your visit ashore, or extra pampering at the ships spa.




Frequently Asked Questions

What type of passenger?
There is not a type of typical passenger: you will find all types, ages and nationalities represented on board, which creates a very friendly and familiar atmosphere. Thats what makes this cruise so special!

Is there a minimum age?
The minimum age is 18 years at the time of boarding the ship.

Are women welcome?
You will mainly find gay men on board, but we are more than happy to have some 'crazy' women and lesbians with us!

Are pets welcome?
Animals are not allowed on board, so you will have to look for a babysitter for your dog or cat.

Do the cabins have  one double bed or 2 twin beds?
Almost all the cabins have 2 twin beds that can be converted into a double bed. Give us your preference when booking, and as long as your choice is available, you will have the bed configuration that you prefer.

What if I am travelling alone ?
You can book a room to share with another single in categories H (interior), PH2 (port hole) or C (exterior). We will then put you together with someone of your age in the same cabin.  You can of course also pay for 2, and then you will have your cabin for single occupancy. In that case, until the 29th of June 2018, you can give us the name of a person joining you in your cabin at no extra cost.
