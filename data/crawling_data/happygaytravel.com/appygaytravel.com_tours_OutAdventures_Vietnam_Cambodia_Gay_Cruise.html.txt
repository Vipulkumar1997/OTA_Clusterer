We then board an all-gay, private and luxurious seven-night river cruise along the Mekong river that ventures through stilted villages, Phnom Penh, and gorgeous countryside. Finally, our journey wraps in Saigon  aka Ho Chi Minh City  where Vietnam's ancient and modern worlds collide.

Vietnam & Cambodia Gay Cruise Tour Itinerary

Day 1

- Siem Reap, Cambodia
Joom reab sour! Welcome to Cambodia!

Our trip kicks off at 6PM with a group meeting, followed by an included dinner and drinks. Tonights restaurant is noteworthy as its restored the glory of Cambodian cuisine following the downfall of the Khmer Rouge regime and civil war.
After that, well savour some optional cocktails at a local gay bar.



Day 2

- Siem Reap, Cambodia - Angkor
We have a massive day ahead of us, beginning with a trip to the world-famous City of Angkor, where bas-relief carvings and architecture offer fab fodder for photographers. Well explore the temples with our guides, and enjoy an included lunch.
Tonights dinner is also included, at a restaurant that trains underprivileged young adults, and it happens to be a favourite spot of ours.
The night wraps with a circus (literally) where young Cambodian artists tell their tales through music and more performing arts.



Day 3

- Siem Reap, Cambodia / Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei
Photography enthusiasts are in for a treat! Well rise before dawn and head to Angkor Wat for sunrise, followed by breakfast at the hotel.
Then well explore favourite ruins like Banteay Srei, a sandstone temple devoted to the Hindu god Shiva.
This afternoon well visit the countryside, venture through a village, and end the day by splitting into smaller groups for a cooking class with local chefs. Our unforgettable creations will then be savoured over views of the sun setting beyond the paddy fields.



Day 4

- Siem Reap / Kampong Cham, Cambodia (Embarkation)
After breakfast well transfer to Kampong Cham, a provincial capital defined by the hustle of its markets and French colonial architecture.
Well stop at Kampong Thom en route, with a simple boxed lunch served on the bus en route to the beautiful
RV Mekong Pandaw
 our home for the next seven nights.
Well enjoy cocktail hour on the Sunset Deck, followed by a briefing and our first dinner aboard while we cruise towards Chhlong.



Day 5

- Kratie and the Dolphin Grounds
Today we sail for Kratie, a low-key French colonial town famous for its rare Irrawaddy River Dolphins (the other two places they can be found are on India's Ganges River, and Myanmar's Irrawaddy River itself).
As this is a protected area, well board smaller vessels to venture out in search of these glorious cetaceans.



Day 6

- Prek Kdam / Monkey Temple / Wat Hanchey
Continuing our journey down the river, today we visit three great destinations.

First up is the very curious Monkey Temple.
Then we'll visit the remote Wat Hanchey, which offers fantastic views.
Finally, we stop at Angkor Ban, a commune of stilted wooden houses that survived the Khmer Rouge Regime, for a glimpse at Cambodian tradition.



Day 7

- Phnom Penh, Cambodia
Today well explore Cambodia's capital by iconic tricycle taxis known as cyclos.
Well visit the Silver Pagoda, the National Museum, and the Royal Palace. Even better, our rides come care of The Cyclo Centre Phnom Penh, a charity providing basic welfare and medical services to the drivers of these unique cabs.
In the afternoon, well take a sobering break to visit the Killing Fields and Khmer Rouge's grim Tuol Sleng (or S21 detention centre).



Day 8

- Tonle River - Kampong Trolach, Chong Koh
The Tonle River awaits today, with visits to a silver-making village, Kampong Trolach, and the craft town of Chong Koh known for its silk weavers.
Depending on water levels we'll either travel by ship or by coach, soaking up the vibrant local life along the river banks.



Day 9

- Mekong Channel Cruising / Tan Chau, Vietnam
Its an easy day of cruising as we make our way up the main Mekong channel.
This international shipping route is also Vietnams border, so well stop to sort out immigration formalities  this could take a while, so why not arm yourself with a cocktail or book?
You can also go behind the scenes of our cruise with onboard tours, or take part in a cooking and fruit carving demonstration.



Day 10

- Chau Doc / Cai Bei, Vietnam
Today well visit a Chau Doc town, known for its stilted homes, a Cham tribal village and a cat fish farm.
If you want some time to yourself, you may also break off from the group, grab a mountain bike, and explore on your own.
The village exudes a charming French style, the local market is excellent, and if you have a chance, dont miss the colourful Catholic church after a brief Vietnam history lesson in a local saloon.
Our night will be spent in Cai Bei, the Mekong River Delta.



Day 11

- My Tho (Disembark) / Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
While the river cruise is over, our trip is most certainly not!
This morning well disembark and transfer to Ho Chi Minh City (aka Saigon), with a stop at the Cu Chi Tunnels for a tour. This extensive underground network, dug by the Viet Minh and Viet Cong, actually contained hospitals, accommodations and schools (beware the tunnels can be hot, sweaty, and claustrophobic for some).
Well then check-in to our lavish riverside hotel, then freshen up for an included dinner at KOTO  another fantastic restaurant that trains underprivileged youth. The rest of the evening is free to relax.



Day 12

- Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam
Saigon is full of chaotic thrills. Ancient and modern worlds mingle. Temples stand defiantly among zooming scooters and new architecture.
Well visit Thien Hau Temple (built in the early 19th century, and dedicated to the goddess of seafarers). We delve deeper into Chinatown, and visit the dazzling Cholon and Binh Tay Markets.
Lunch will be a classic Vietnamese pho noodle soup, before we head for the Reunification Palace, War museum, Notre Dame Cathedral, General Post office and Opera House.
After this final, ambitious afternoon, well celebrate a Farewell Dinner at one of the citys best restaurants that features local cuisine with modern flare!



Day 13

- Ho Chi Minh City / Departure
There are no activities planned today until your complimentary departure transfer. That said, you could keep the adventure alive with our
Hanoi & Ha Long Bay Gay Tour & Cruise
Extension
, January 15 - 19, 2018.






RV Mekong Pandaw
- Handcrafted Luxury

Built in Rangoon in 2002, the
RV Mekong Pandaw
was designed specifically for the Mekong. The
MP
as she is affectionately known is Pandaw's most spacious ship with wider promenades, a larger dining hall and more public space per passenger than any known ship on the Mekong.

In 2012 she was refitted and lower deck cabins removed in favour of a professional spa, gym, library lounge and office. She is quite justifiably the most splendid ship on the Mekong and the envy of anything that floats by.

The ship has quality mountain bikes for your independent exploration.

Trip Notes, Cambodia & Vietnam Info

How We Travel
OUT Adventures is all about good times with likeminded guys. Whatever's on the itinerary - from fireside camping to five-star decadence - our goal is to make the experience magical. We're also committed to supporting the communities we visit by hiring local guides, staying at locally-owned accommodations when possible, and celebrating local cuisine. It all adds up to a great way to immerse yourself in the culture.

Cambodia Visa
Visas can be organized either in advance or on arrival. Check with your embassy or consulate, and allow about three weeks for processing. It's also possible to obtain your Cambodian visa on arrival at the airport or border crossing for about $25 US (cost subject to change). There may be exceptions, and all visas are the traveller's responsibility.

Vietnam Visa
Visas must be arranged in advance through your local Vietnamese embassy or consulate. This trip does not qualify for a visa on arrival, as we enter Vietnam while on the river cruise, and not at a major port or airport. All visas are the traveller's responsibility, and you can reference the entry date of 10JAN2018.






Culture Shock
When visiting Vietnam and Cambodia you'll see both good and bad. Poverty is widespread, but the friendly locals make up for it. Since English speakers can be hard to find, arm yourself with a phrase book and a sense of humour!

Local LGBT Scene
Vietnam and Cambodia aren't gay hotspots, but's there's an impressive amount of nightlife in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Phnom Penh, and Siem Reap. From hole-in-the-wall drag bars, to cafes, to some of the best lady-boy cabarets we've seen, you certainly won't be at a loss for things to do after a day of temple hopping.

Weather
December and January are the best months to travel to this region. Rain is rare and the humidity less oppressive. Travel with a light sweater and jacket, but keep summer essentials handy: midday temperatures can eclipse 30°C/85°F.






Required Vaccinations:
Based on the entry requirements, there are no vaccinations needed for entry. To determine if you should take preventative measures to reduce the risk of illness, consult with your doctor or a travel medical clinic. OUT Adventures cannot provide vaccination recommendations.

Physical Preparation:
You'll be walking with your daypack and faced with potential weather extremes on this trip. This is a leisurely itinerary, primarily with easy-paced walking. There won't always be a dock, though, so you must be able to get on and off the ship on river banks.

Electricity
You will need an international travel plug/adapter for type A/C/G sockets.






Connectivity
All of our hotels will have Wi-Fi access. The ship has Wi-Fi when in Phnom Penh, in public areas (albeit slow). If you require connectivity, we recommend purchasing an international data plan or local SIM card (with an unlocked device). Even with a SIM card or roaming plan, coverage may be weak.

Travel Insurance
For everybody's peace of mind, all OUT Adventures include comprehensive travel insurance. That's up to $200 you won't have to fret about adding to your budget, unless you want to insure the value of your trip for cancellation. Here's what's covered:
• Unlimited Trip Interruption
• Up to $50,000 Emergency Medical plus up to $300,000 for ambulance transportation, up to $5,000,000 CAD with valid GHIP coverage.
• Baggage Loss or Damage up to $1,500
• Baggage Delay up to $500
• Flight Accident up to $100,000
• Travel Accident up to $50,000






Your Guides & Hosts
This tour will be led by several Local Guides, OUT Adventures Co-Founder Robert Sharp, & Female Delusionist Extra-Ordinaire Miss Conception.

Fellow Adventurers

OUT Adventures are a great way to meet people from around the world and all walks of life. Bear in mind that everybody's there for a good time, so mutual respect will go a long way. Please be on time for any meet ups, empathetic to the needs of others, and ready to roll with whatever the adventure brings.

Although we can't tell you who your fellow travellers will be for privacy reasons, we can tell you many great friendships began with an OUT Adventure. And just because we're a gay tour operator doesn't mean we're exclusive: friends and family are always welcome to join the fun.

Traveling Solo
If you've never travelled on your own, it's an amazing way to get to know yourself while making new friends along the way. We can arrange for you to share a room with people in your age range at no charge, or you can pay a supplement for your own room. And if there's an odd number of solos, we'll rotate a single room on a random basis.

Itinerary Disclaimer
The itinerary is correct at time of publishing. If anything, it will only improve with feedback from prior travellers and our own research. It's best to reference your final trip documents, rather than our website, in case there have been changes that affect your departure.

Group Size
Minimum 20 and maximum of 44 guests.

Meals
All meals and drinks are included on this trip. From authentic food served on the ship, to the best restaurants in Siem Reap and Ho Chi Minh, you won't head home hungry!






Tipping
Gratuities are included; however we do recommend tipping for any drinks that are not included, or any services that you purchase above and beyond your packaged tour. We do not recommend tipping guides and staff individually, so please provide any additional tips to your OUT Adventures Group Leader, which will be added to the group's gratuities.

Money
CAMBODIA: The local currency is the Cambodian Riel, however USD is widely accepted. We recommend carrying local currency or small USD bills for small purchases, however credit cards are accepted at most upscale restaurants and hotels.

VIETNAM: The local currency is the Vietnam Dong, however USD is widely accepted in major centres. We recommend carrying local currency or small USD bills for small purchases, however credit cards are accepted at most upscale restaurants and hotels.

ON THE SHIP: Any additional costs (espresso, spa, laundry, premium liquor) may be paid in cash (USD) or on credit card while on the ship.

NOTE: We recommend carrying approximately $400 USD to be used in case of an emergency, or if your credit/ATM cards are placed on hold. This should be in addition to any spending money.

What to Bring
Most OUT Adventures entail carrying your own luggage on occasion. You'll never schlep far, but things can quickly get heavier than a celebrity breakup if you don't keep your baggage under 20kg/44lb...and you may even have to leave it behind on domestic flights! You should also bring something smaller to carry water, your camera, and any souvenirs you buy on day trips.
