We bring all the magic from our cruises to the shores of Mexico to create an extraordinary week filled with entertainment, sports, activities, parties and an original sense of fun. It's the place to learn a new sport, perfect your tennis game, explore the jungle, run on the beach, or just relax with friends old and new.

Great Meals. Amazing Variety. Great Friends.

A world of choices await every time you sit down for a meal at Club Atlantis. Our six tantalizing restaurants offer an exceptional variety of cuisines, from a beachside Mediterranean restaurant to an authentic sushi bar. Sample grilled specialties at our authentic Brazilian churasccuria, or savor modern Mexican delights under the stars. No matter what your taste, you'll find a delicious way to enjoy every meal. And of course it's all included.

There's never a dress code with Atlantis, so come as you are and enjoy a great meal with friends old and new. Our friendly team will always help you find a great group to dine with.

We'll bring down our brightest stars, including comics, singers, drag performers, and so much more to dazzle you in our open air theater. Later on, enjoy our signature piano bar and cabaret stars in the intimate lounge.





A Party (or Two) for Everyone

There's always a party going on, starting with our exciting beachside themed T-Dances. It's the perfect excuse to dress up (or down) for a silly afternoon of musical fun. And each night we'll keep you dancing at our original nightclub featuring leading gay DJs from around the world.





The Easiest Gay Vacation

One of the great joys of an Atlantis vacation is that you'll always find friends wherever you turn. If you're travelling alone, we have special events for singles virtually every night, along with a comfortable and easygoing environment throughout. And if you're with your partner or friends you'll find that new friends come naturally.

Rates in 2016 are our lowest in years, making it even easier to join us. Take a look today at the wonder of Club Atlantis!






Our Own Deluxe Beachside Paradise.

The all-new
Hard Rock Vallarta
is simply the most complete and stunning resort complex that Atlantis has ever chartered for an all-gay vacation. With acres of beautifully manicured grounds leading to one of Mexico's most pristine beaches, you'll find a world of pure luxury that's far away from the everyday. All just minutes away from Mexico's #1 gay destination.

The
Hard Rock Vallarta
has it all: fantastic rooms with stunning amenities, a gorgeous beach, a seemingly endless pool complex, six beautiful restaurants, sports facilities, an outdoor theater, and an extraordinarily welcoming, gay-friendly staff that has hosted us for over ten years!






Pool or Beach? Tough Choices Everyday.

Two sparkling side-by-side pools offer the perfect setting for sunning, swimming, water volleyball, or Atlantis' original pool games. Afterwards, just relax in one of our two outdoor hot tubs. For a little more peace and quiet, find a private spot under a shady palapa on our expansive beach. Or join in a game of beach volleyball, take a sailing lesson, or kayak with friends. It's all right in front of our magnificent private resort and all yours for the choosing.






Six Restaurants. Four Bars. No Bill.

With six unique places to dine, you'll always find a mouthwatering temptation. Enjoy a casual meal with friends at The Market, or have a pizza from the wood-burning outdoor grill. Sample the Asian delicacies at Zen, or enjoy tableside temptations at Ipanema, our Brazilian-style grill. Ciao and Frida, our magnificent outdoor restaurants offer Italian or Mexican specialties under the stars. The choice is yours and reservations are never required. Come and enjoy!

Of course all beverages are included at all of our four fabulous bars, located throughout the resort. Imagine meeting friends for drinks when nobody has to pick up the check. There's even a swim-up bar open all afternoon, so you don't even have to leave the pool!






Rooms With a View. And a Jacuzzi.

The newly refurbished
Hard Rock Vallarta
features 348 deluxe guest rooms, many with balconies, and most with spectacular ocean views. Each features comfortable beds with pillow top mattresses and luxury bedding, along with all the comforts you'd expect: 32" flat-screen TV, Sony alarm clocks, fully stocked complimentary mini-bar, safe, free wireless internet, and a coffee maker. The modern marble bathrooms are inviting, spacious, and beyond comfortable  and all have an in-room Jacuzzi. If the beach weren't so inviting, you might never leave your room!
