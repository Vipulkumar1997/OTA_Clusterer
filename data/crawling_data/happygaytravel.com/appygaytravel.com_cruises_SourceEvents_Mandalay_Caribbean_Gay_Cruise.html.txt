Mandalay Caribbean
Clothing Optional
All-Gay Cruise 2018

February 25March 3, 2018
Sail Windjammer S/V
Mandalay

Theres no better way to explore the Caribbean than clothing optional all-gay sailing on a tall ship under a full moon. Get ready for an adventure filled with food, fun & fantasy. Your voyage begins on the exotic and romantic island of St. Lucia, a nature lovers paradise where the dueling Piton peaks serve as an inspiring landmark for sailors.






After enjoying St. Lucia, get ready to experience an unforgettable adventure cruise aboard the S.V.
Mandalay
as you set sail for the Grenadines.  When you board the tall ship
Mandalay
, you are part of a dreamscape where nature is your only guide and the only constant is freedom.   Its like sailing in a picture postcard.  Youll find yourself anchored off deserted beaches, docked in small charming harbors.  Imagine dancing under the stars, movies projected on the sails, and jumping off the ship into a sea of colorful fish.  It doesnt get any better than this.

Whats your pleasure?  Life aboard the
Mandalay
is filled with activities and fun.  Whether its sailing, snorkeling, hiking, swimming or just relaxing, its your choice.  And since this all-gay private cruise for men is clothing optional, youll have the freedom to sail naked.







Caribbean Grenadines exotic islands

This voyage on board the S.V
Mandalay
is a gay naturist's dream vacation as we sail from St. Lucia to some of the most spectacular scenery, wildlife, and natural attactions in the Caribbean. This adventure is sure to offer a taste of everything you'd expect in the tropics. Before you is nothing but blue sea, the tall ship
Mandalay
, and the anticipation of the voyage that is about to unfold.  You embark the ship, get naked, and raise the sails.

You are in a dreamscape filled with deserted beaches, exotic islands, and moonlit sails.  And this is just the beginning. You will find yourself anchored off deserted beaches and docked in charming harbors.  Dining at intimate cafes, watching movies under the stars, dancing or just relaxing with a massage.   Whether swimming naked to a waterfall, diving off the ship, or simply relaxing, nature will be your only guide.  This is what it feels like when your sailing on your own private yacht! Life doesn't get any better than this!






The best way to appreciate the Grenadines is by sailing there. The itinerary may vary slightly depending on the weather. The region is visited by only a handful of 'yachties' in search of eternal summer, making these islands one of the most exclusive sailing grounds in the world.
With Windjammer, there is never a dull moment.  You are not merely a passenger but part of a small group of fun-loving people.  You're not just a number to us and will get to know just about everyone, passengers and crew alike!

We'll sail you safe and steady on the
S/V Mandalay
to unspoiled beaches, hidden inlets and sparkling warm waters that conventional cruise ships just can't reach.  You will experience a Caribbean few others ever see or even dream of.

Partake in raising the sails, take a turn at the helm or just enjoy the winds of the Caribbean sea filling the sails with new friends aboard.  The choice is yours!
With Windjammer, you can explore Caribbean Islands on the
S/V Mandalay
!







Your Ship - Legendary
Windjammer Mandalay

Mandalay
is truly an historic ship. Recently remodeled this 236-foot barkentine was built in 1923 for financier E.F. Hutton and christened Hussar. In the 1930's she was sold to shipping magnate George Vettlesen who re-christened her Vema. Later she was put into service by Columbia University sailing over a million miles worldwide. Evidence gathered on her voyages confirmed the theory of the continental drift.
For many years, Windjammer Barefoot Cruises sailed
Mandalay
in the Caribbean, where she established an enviable reputation for delivering joy to her guests . She had a very loyal following, with "Jammers" repeating year after year. Then in September of 2007, that world ended. Windjammer Barefoot Cruises went bankrupt, its remaining assets were auctioned off and all her loyal "Jammers" mourned.






But the Windjammer dream never died, because it was more than a company. It was a culture. And it was a fragile culture - one that had a rare balance of fun, adventure, informality and one that would-be imitators never understood. Sail Windjammer purchased
Mandalay
, with a commitment to maintain the culture of "Windjammer".
The Rum Swizzles, crab races, story time, Bloody Mary's, peanut butter pates, PPP parties, sleeping on deck and the playing of Amazing Grace are back, as are many of the former crew.
Mandalay
has been refurbished to recall her former glory. Always a favorite of Windjammer Barefoot sailors,
Mandalay
is welcomed back to the fleet of tall ships

St.Lucia 
Sunday, February 25, 2018
Saint Lucia is an island nation in the eastern Caribbean with 2 distinctive mountains, the Pitons, on its west coast. A nature lovers paradise, which is blessed by nature, St. Lucia has geographic and cultural riches enough to embarrass far bigger nations. Its known for its beaches and reef-diving sites, as well as its rainforested interior with waterfalls such as at Toraille. Its home to quiet volcanic beaches and fishing villages as well as luxurious resorts, and the capital, Castries, is a regular cruise ship stop. The dueling Piton peaks serve as an inspiring landmark for sailors. Youll have a chance to visit waterfalls, hot springs, botanical gardens and the worlds only drive-in volcano.



St.Vincent 
Monday, February 26, 2018
From St. Vincents lush tropical rainforest full of eco-adventures, to the idyllic beaches, coral reefs and turquoise lagoons of the Grenadines, St. Vincent is a tropical paradise for sailing, scuba diving, enjoying nature, and relaxing in luxurious hideaways. It is the largest island of the country Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.



Union Island 
Tuesday, February 27, 2018
Welcome to Union Island, one of the undiscovered treasures of St. Vincent & The Grenadines. Unsophisticated, relaxed and friendly, Union is still off the beaten track. Once you land, you wont want to leave. A charming destination and a great base to pick up a mooring and explore the natural beauty of this region, Union is a paradise for yachting enthusiasts, scuba divers, hikers and sun worshipers. Theres mile after mile of undisturbed sand and wild mangos for the taking.



Tobago Cays 
Wednesday, February 28, 2018
The highlight of cruising the Grenadines is the Tobago Cays. The Tobago Cays are an archipelago consisting of five small, uninhabited islands and make up the Tobago Cays Marine Park. Snorkel with the sea turtles in an established area off the beach in Baradel. Marked by buoys, explore this protected area to view turtles in their natural and magical habitat. Enjoy postcard worthy, picture perfect beach with leaning palms and white sand between your toes. Treat your eyes to views of every color blue in the Caribbean sea that you can imagine!



Mayreau 
Thursday, March 1, 2018
Breathtaking, awe-inspiring, and pristine are three words that come to mind when one thinks of the island of Mayreau. The smallest of all the Grenadine Islands, Mayreau Island is home to roughly 300 inhabitants, mostly fishermen and their families as well as individuals involved in the tourism industry. An isolated island, Mayreau welcomes visitors that are in search of a remote get-away to relax and unwind.



Bequia 
Friday, March 2, 2018
Bequia is the most perfect island in the whole Grenadines. Youll be captivated by the islands charm while strolling along the lovely harbor with its shops, restaurants, and pastel-painted gingerbread homes. Stunning beaches dotting the shoreline, accommodations to fit most budgets and a slow pace of life all help to create an environment that is unforgettable. There are fine restaurants, shops that retain their local integrity and enough golden sand and blue water to keep everybody blissful



St.Lucia 
Saturday, March 3, 2018
Disembark in beautiful St. Lucia.
