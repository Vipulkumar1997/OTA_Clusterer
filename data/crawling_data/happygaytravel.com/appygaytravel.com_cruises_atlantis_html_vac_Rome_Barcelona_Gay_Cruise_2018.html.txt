Rome to Barcelona
All-Gay Mediterranean Cruise 2018

August 4  11, 2018
Celebrity
Constellation

Set a new course for fun and adventure with Europes hottest all-gay cruise next summer. Explore the stunning coasts of Italy, France, and Spain with 2100 guys from around the world onboard the spectacular Celebrity
Constellation
. In seven magical days, well dazzle you with the worlds greatest outdoor parties, sensational entertainers, awesome places to play, and five beautiful ports.
Best of all, Atlantis has scheduled this cruise to perfectly match the legendary Circuit Gay Festival Water Park party in Barcelona  the perfect ending to a spectacular journey!




The Hottest Gay Cruise of 2018

Exotic places meet endless fun when 2100 guys from over 50 different nations come together for a remarkable experience that simply doesnt exist on land. The Atlantis Med cruise creates a unique and diverse setting to make new friends, revel in our parties and shows, and discover beautiful places along the way. All at our lowest fares ever in Europe  starting at just $1199!

While most of our entertainment is in English, Atlantis welcomes guests who speak French, German, Spanish, & Portuguese through our international hosts and many special events.




The Heart of Italy

Start your holiday with a few days in the historical center of Rome before setting sail. Theres even a Gay Village all summer long to welcome us all.

Well set sail to the vibrant coastal city of Naples, where the historical treasures of Pompeii, magical cliffs of Naples, thrilling coasts of Amalfi, and sensuous streets of Sorrento beckon. Theres simply no better port in the Med for exploring!




Intimate Destinations. Big Adventures.

One of the great pleasures of cruising is finding unexpected joy in new destinations. A remarkable day in Ajaccio takes you to the heart of the gorgeous island of Corsica where imposing cliffs meet azure seas.

Well then make our debut call in the legendary Riviera town of Portofino, one of the worlds most picturesque harbors filled with colorful buildings, inviting restaurants, and elegant shops. Its no wonder Portofino is the most celebrated harbor in all of Italy, ready to welcome us with open arms!

Discover the French Riviera from charming Villefranche, where Cannes, Monaco, and Nice are only minutes away. From the playful seaside villages of the Cote dAzur to the imposing cliffs of Eze, its the perfect place to explore the worlds most famous coast.

Finally, Atlantis heads to the beaches of Mallorca for a relaxing ending to it all before we sail to magnificent Barcelona.




Sensational Days to Play

After day of serious sightseeing, Celebrity and Atlantis pamper you in grand style. Take a dip in our massive outdoor pools, sooth yourself in the AquaSpa, or soak in one of our inviting hot tubs. Maybe a relaxing massage, or work out in the fully-equipped gym. Just save some energy for Atlantis famous t-dances, pool games, and general silliness.

As evening approaches, youll always find friends at the Martini bar, or celebrate sunset with a sparkling glass of Champagne. When its time for dinner our friendly restaurants welcome you with an inviting and casual setting thats perfect for socializing over something delicious.




Stellar Shows Everywhere

Our fantastic entertainment lineup stars the worlds finest gay talent, including legendary drag performers, world-class comedians, singing superstars, and the worlds only gay acrobatic show. From the two-story main stage to intimate cabaret venues to our very own piano bar, youll find dazzling shows everywhere you turn.

And dont miss our superstar surprise guest stars!




Sizzling Parties

Atlantis outrageous parties take place day and night on
Constellations
massive outdoor decks, starring the worlds top gay DJs in one of the worlds most beautiful settings. Well fill the night sky with spectacular lighting and lasers, surrounding you with fascinating videos and flawless sound in a production that can only exist at sea.

Dive into our legendary theme parties, and thrill at our afternoon T-dances. Theres simply no better, fabulous, or more comfortable place in the world to dance than under the stars at sea!




Amazing Value

With Atlantis, virtually everything is included  superb accommodations, world-class dining, stellar entertainment, fascinating enrichment activities, endless nightlife, and so much more.

Sensational low fares start at just $1,199 for seven nights of pure sensory overload. Its easier than ever to get onboard the hottest gay cruise of the summer!




Our Favorite Premium Ship

Celebrity
Constellation
continues to be an all-time favorite for Atlantis guests seeking the perfect mix of sophistication, fantastic modern features, and friendly size. Shes the perfect ship for the way we play.

From her blue-accented hull to magnificent teak decks,
Constellation
stuns you the moment you step onboard. A three-story atrium feels like a contemporary grand hotel, surrounded by bars and lounges that make it easy to relax with friends old and new.




Unique Places to Meet

The vibrant Martini Bar is our social hub, boasting an ice-covered bar and huge range of specialty libations. Cellar Masters wine bar brings you close to some of the worlds best wines. And of course, theres always action in the sophisticated Casino.




Amazing Dining to Enjoy Your Way

The dramatic two-story main restaurant offers soaring views of the ocean to enjoy Celebritys award-winning fresh cuisine. Attentive yet unobtrusive service makes every meal a refreshing event. As on all Atlantis cruises, we feature open seating and a casual atmosphere with no dress code. Theres never an assigned table or dining time, allowing you to enjoy meals at your leisure with friends old and new.

Constellations
specialty restaurants set the stage for dramatic dining experiences ranging from the formal to whimsical. The classic Tuscan Grill takes you on a tour of Italy with a sophisticated and playful menu. And the innovative Qsine offers a new take on dining with a magically modern menu that spans the world.

Our AquaClass guests have access to Blu, featuring Mediterranean cuisine in a bright modern setting. And Suite guests have the pleasure of dining in the luxuriously delicious Luminae, a unique private restaurant.

For a casual bite, the Oceanview Café is open virtually all the time (including Atlantis famous late-night selections), featuring a variety of delicious choices in a breezy open setting. Theres even an outdoor poolside grill for lunch and snacks throughout the day. Sip a coffee in Café al Bacio, or enjoy a healthy snack in the AquaSpa café. Relax with friends for some Sushi at Sushi on Five. All of it is ready for Atlantis, and designed for the way you like to dine.



Relax, Rejuvenate, & Rejoice

Two inviting outdoor pools are perfect after a long day of exploring. Or relax at our indoor pool and whirlpools. Unwind with a yoga session or a run on the beautiful teak decks. The fully equipped fitness center offers everything from spinning to aerobics classes along with a complete weight-training center. Just leave some time to enjoy the sensory heaven of the world-famous AquaSpa, indulging in the hydrotherapy pool or luscious steam garden.

And for true pampering, check into the world-renowned Canyon Ranch SpaClub for some of the most fabulous spa treatments ever offered.


Showstopping Showplaces
Constellations
entertainment venues create the perfect showcase for Atlantis unique blend of talented performers, starting with the Broadway-quality two-story main theater. Seven bars and lounges feature Atlantis cabaret performers, live music, and comics. And if youre feeling lucky, check out the world-class casino.

True Modern Luxury
When youre finally ready to come home, your modern, well designed stateroom features a comfortable bathroom, ample closet space, pillow-top bedding, and an interactive flat-screen television system. And with 24-hour room service, you might never leave your stateroom!
For an added touch of luxury without breaking the bank, upgrade to a Concierge Class stateroom, where premium amenities await you in the best locations on the ship.
Even better, Celebritys unique AquaClass offer personalized sensory elements with spa-inspired amenities, all designed to bring a sense of the spa experience to your stateroom. Plus, they include exclusive access to Blu restaurant, and complimentary access to the Persian Garden thermal suite.
Finally, for the ultimate in luxury,
Constellations
sumptuous suites feature butler service and a wide range of pampering features. The private Suite Lounge features complimentary afternoon cocktails & canapés, and Luminae, an exclusive restaurant for Suite Class guests.

Or take a day trip to the island of Capri, an enchanting and picturesque island made of limestone rock.
