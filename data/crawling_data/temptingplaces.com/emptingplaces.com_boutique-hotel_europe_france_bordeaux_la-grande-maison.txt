The Destination

Destination : Bordeaux

The city of Bordeaux won the title of “Best European destination 2015,” facing giants such as London, Rome, Amsterdam, Brussels and Berlin. It is THE destination of 2015, not to be missed!
A bonafide city-museum, Bordeaux's heritage is in front of your eyes, beneath your feet. The Pont de Pierre, Pey-Berland Tower, Rohan Palace, Place de la Bourse and its water mirror are all must-sees!
Bordeaux is also the ideal starting point for an oenological getaway. Bernard Magrez has created his own agency, Luxury Wine Tourism, which welcomes guests to his four Chateaux and around the vineyards of its four Grands Crus, in the Medoc, Sauternes, Saint‐Emilion and Graves. Wine‐tasting courses and workshops are organized where you can learn about their production, along with stays or dinners in the dining rooms of the chateaux and enjoyable getaways travelling in style via Rolls Royce or helicopter. An ideal combination with a stay at La Grande Maison for the discerning epicurean.

The hotel experience


The Art of French Excellence

La Grande Maison is a symbol of the French way of life: the elegance, the gastronomy, grand wine and culture. The forged iron gateway opens onto a luxurious garden highlighting a sculpture by Chinese artist Shen Yuan, “the Skull of the Earth”, the first link to the Culture Institute of Bernard Magrez which faces the hotel.
The hotel used to belong to famous intellectual Leon Duguit, a scholar of law who gathered his colleagues and world travelers here. His library remains, stocked with thousands of books, as does his cellar, stocked with the finest wines of Bordeaux. Some books have been restored and carefully stored in the library lounge that bears his name, reborn as the dining rooms of the restaurant.

The decoration of La Grande Maison is the work of Federique Fournier who has reimagined Napoleon III style in a bold, elaborate and glimmering manner. Charm, elegance and refinement are combined in the six luxurious rooms decked out in pink, green and purple: embroidered Braquenié silk from Pierre Frey house, Houlès trimmings, Moissonnier furniture, Horus faucets, Carrara marble bathrooms and sophisticated products by Clarins. Each room has its own personality but they are all in line with the common theme of great wines: Passion of Life, Light, Contemplation, Wisdom, Hope, Harmony, each offer a great wine chosen by Bernard Magrez, in perfect harmony with the ambiance.

The restaurant is inspired by the same elegance: tasteful wood and plaster moldings, carpets and curtains in variations of purple and red, small Baccarat table lamps complementing glasses and decanters of the same, tableware chosen at Christofle, and presentation plates specially designed by Erik Ifergan from the same workshop that sheltered Picasso’s oven in Vallauris.

Innovation and tradition go hand-in-hand with a special menu comprising four courses, with three contemporary hors d’oeuvres, followed by a hearty dish of traditional French fare and personalized dessert plates. The tradition of carving dishes in the dining room has been revived. The menu boasts a several signature dishes by Pierre Gagnaire.





The Tempting Experience:

A unique wine collection


Owner of four Grands Crus Classés in Bordeaux, Château Pape Clément (Graves), La Tour Carnet (Haut Médoc), Château Fombrauge (Saint Emilion) and the Clos Haut Peyraguey (Sauternes), Bernard Magrez wanted to have an exceptional wine list which no other restaurant in the world can outclass. Available are all the Grands Crus Classés and similar wines (Pomerol and Bourgeois) from Bordeaux, a total of 259 wines! Connoisseurs of pinot noir or chardonnay will find the best examples from Bourgogne, as well as some bottles from neighboring vineyards and the Rhône, Alsace, Armagnac regions and foreign countries.
