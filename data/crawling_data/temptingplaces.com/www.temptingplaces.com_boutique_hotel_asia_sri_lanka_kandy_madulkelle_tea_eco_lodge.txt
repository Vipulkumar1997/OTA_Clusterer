The hotel experience


Colonial style and luxury camp

Precious wood, sculpted furniture, local fabrics… The decoration of the “plantation” style“ main house was made to make your stay in Sri Lanka unforgettable. A large pool table filled the beautifully illuminated library where you can read books in French or English. The Ceylon tea is tasted in the very British way in fine porcelain by the living room chimney. The terrace opens on the valley and the tea plantation, the ideal panorama for a candlelight dinner.

The rooms look like luxury camps worthy of the greatest African safaris. The decor is refined: tarpaulin canvas from South Africa, wood floors or polished concrete, contemporary bathroom in polished concrete, exotic wood furniture. With such a natural panorama, the hanging terrace is a must ! Not to be missed is the stunning view on the Knuckles mountain range blurred by the morning mist.
Lazing around the infinity pool in front of the mountain or strolling by the tea plantation, this is what the art of taking time is all about in the Madulkelle Tea & Eco Lodge.





The Tempting Experience:

All involved in the community


The owners take environmental and humanitarian commitments and conduct actions that involve the travelers, the staff and the inhabitants of the region. On the restaurant side for instance, the chef uses a maximum of fruits and vegetables from the organic garden in his ayurvedic recipes. The travelers can actively participate to the children educative program by attending the courses.  Also 1$ of each night is donated for the development of community projects supervised by an independent fund. Such a great philosophy of cultural sharing and respect.
