The Destination

Discover the charm of Cappadocia

Cappadocia is located in central Turkey, southeast of the Turkish capital of Ankara.

The Selçuklu Evi hotel is located in the heart of Urgup, a UNESCO world heritage village where all houses are constructed in pure 12th century Turkish architecture. Opposite the hotel, you will discover one of the best wine cellars of Cappadocia. A French winemaker will guide you through the discovery of Turkish wines.

The Goreme Open Air Museum, is located 4kms away from the hotel. A UNESCO world heritage site since 1984, Goreme is one of the most interesting places in Cappadocia.

The "fairy chimneys", strange geological formations caused by volcanoes, give Cappadocia its fantastic, distinctive look. The most impressive one is located in Urgup, only 500 meters from the hotel.

The hotel experience


A heritage hotel decorated with local arts

Push the doors of Selcuklu Evi Cave Hotel and discover a hotel with a very typical architecture, built in Cappadocia stone, and decorated in a refined oriental style.

The hotel is sited in 5 Greek twelfth-century houses that have retained all of their charm and bygone greatness: the Selçuklu Evi has preserved their original spirit by leaving the room dimensions and proportions untouched and by reusing the original materials. The lounge and dining rooms, for example, still have their original ceilings, picturesque furniture, and feature locally hand-crafted quilts and rugs. The bed covers and pillows are embroidered by the village-women and even telephones are vintage... The result is a charming oriental Turkish ambiance!

The rooms also offer a unique decoration with locally crafted furniture and decoration objects: wrought iron beds, benches covered with rugs, antiques ... Wood is used everywhere and the floors are covered with Turkish carpets.

Each room is different and has its own personality. The Cave Room is our favorite "Deluxe Room" and is built in stone according to troglodytes traditions. It has a private terrace overlooking the garden. If you prefer a beautiful village view then choose the Terasli Room.

Among the "Junior Suite", the nisli Suite features a spacious bedroom decorated with a wooden oriental-style ceiling. It`s jacuzzi bath is perfect for relaxing after a busy day of sightseeing. Finally, among the "Superior Suites", the Family Suite with its 2 bedrooms and oriental style living room is perfect for family holidays or for friends. Lovers will appreciate the Romantic Suite with its very private and intimate terrace or the Honeymoon Suite, decorated in white.





The Tempting Experience:

Hot-air balloon over Cappadocia


Stay at the Selçuklu Evi and enjoy a hot air balloon trip to discover the beautiful Cappadocia landscapes with their large tracts and their numerous "fairy chimneys"! This is truly a unique and magical experience!
