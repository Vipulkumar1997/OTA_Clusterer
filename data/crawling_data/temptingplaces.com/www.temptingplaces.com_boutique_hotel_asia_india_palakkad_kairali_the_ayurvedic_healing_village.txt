The Destination

Palakkad

The etymology of the name of this city says a lot about its environment: pala is a tree with very fragrant flowers and kadu means forest. Palakkad is indeed a haven of greenery near the Palghat Gap, a mountain pass that is the largest in the world 30-40 miles separate the Western Ghats between Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

Surrounding sites worth visiting:

• Fort Palakkad (or Tipu), built in 1766 by Hyder Ali of the kingdom of Mysore and then taken by the British in 1784.
• The Malampuzha Dam and Park, built on the river Bharathapuzha, it`s an amusement park with boat trips, a perfect place to entertain the whole family.
• Jainimedu Temple, a historic temple, one of the few vestiges of Kerala Jain

And the cascade Dhoni, the Karnak Temple...

The hotel experience


Ayurveda paradise

The unique Kairali Ayurvedic Healing Village is built according to the rites of vaashtu Shasthri, a traditional Indian system of construction which sees the home as a sacred space. Based on the laws of nature, the house Vastu Shastra brings a sense of peace and tranquility.
The Kairali is a paradise for the well-being through Ayurveda, the science whose benefits have been proven for 5000 years. There`s no alcohol or cigarettes and food is used to promote Ayurvedic relaxation of body and mind. Therapies are monitored by doctors and therapists and are accompanied by a daily program of yoga and meditation. The clinic offers various Ayurvedic traditional treatments, 7 to 21 days is the norm, but you can also spend a weekend and enjoy the oils and wellness treatments at the spa as well.

Each of the 30 villas is unique in its decoration. They all feature a living area, tastefully furnished and a private terrace. We recommend the Royal Villas for their baroque decoration, gilding fabrics and wood furnishings that offer real, a typical immersion.





The Tempting Experience:

Well-being depending on your date of birth


The Ayurveda belief is that, depending on the day of your birth, you fit a personality type and color. So, book a stay at Kairali, and the room that you are given will be based on your date of birth. Indeed, each villa is named after an Indian figure that reflects a character and a color theme associated. The Kairali assures nothing but the best for you in order to relax and go home in better health.
