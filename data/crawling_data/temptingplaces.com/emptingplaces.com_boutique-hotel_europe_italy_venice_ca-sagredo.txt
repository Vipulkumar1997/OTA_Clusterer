Ca' Sagredo, the luxury of a Venetian palace

In Venice, just a few steps away from St. Mark's Square and the Rialto Market, the Ca' Sagredo, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, boasts that it has stopped time. The typically Venetian Palace architecture with high ceilings and white-stone walls, highlight the frescoes signed by 17th century major artists. The 42 fastuous rooms and suites of the 5-star hotel while preserved in the shell of a "palazzo", built during the 15th century, offer a real contemporary comfort. The view over the Canal Grande is the promise of a great stay for couples in one the most romantic city of the world.

The Destination

Must-sees in Venice

The Doge's Palace
Built on St. Mark's square it was the place of power during the Republic of Venice. It although mainly known for its prison under the roofs and for for its hidden levels where entire rooms were built in order to hide the true purposes of Venice from foreign ambassadors.

The gondolas
If a stroll on a gondola humming O Sole Mio is a Venice must-do an even more original visit would be to pass by a gondolas workshop and find out about this real art. The Squero in Dorsodouro area is on activty since the 17th century. There are no guided tour but try to catch a glimpse without disturbing the craftsmen.

The Rialto Market
Right across the Canal Grande is the market where you'll be able to find fresh products.

The hotel experience


A hotel in the Canal Grande in Venice

The Italian way of life, the cuisine, the cultural buzzing...Ca' Sagredo is everything that makes Venice one of the world's true cultural capitals. The walls of the palace are adorned with frescoes signed by 17th century renowned painters, as the likes of Sebastiano Ricci, Giambattista Tiepolo or Nicolò Bambini. The hotel has been listed a historical monument and each corner holds a piece of history.

The 42 rooms and suites, luxurious and refined, overlook either the Canal Grande or the roofs of Venice. They are all decorated with style in a pure classic Venetian fashion. The shades of brown, cream, white and gold alternate and noble fabrics like silk or velvet dominate. Some even enjoy 17th century furniture and Venetian mirrors to ensure that you spend the most grandiose time, feeling like a Venitian aristocrat.

Couples will more likely enjoy the Grand Canal Junior Suite, an enchanting choice with a unique view over the city in order to live to the fullest the magic of a Venetian romance.





The Tempting Experience:

Stay in a palace of the Venetian nobility


Discover the residence of a noble Venetian family. The Sagredo are one of the oldest families in Venice and since they acquired the "palazzo" in the 17th century, the owners have continuingly improved it in order to feed their insatiable appetite for art. It is also one of the reasons why artists like Pietro Longhi were involved in decorating this exceptional place. Spending the night at the Ca' Sagredo feels like walking in the shoes of a 17th century aristocrat. Don't forget to ask about the ballroom' secret passages!
