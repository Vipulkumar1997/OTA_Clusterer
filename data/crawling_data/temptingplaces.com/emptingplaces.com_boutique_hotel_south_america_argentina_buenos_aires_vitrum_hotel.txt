The hotel experience


Rooms with a design and artsy atmosphere

The inside of the Vitrum Hotel delights the eye with its pure lines, contemporary spaces, and bright colors. It will exult those curious of recent trends with its stained glass, brightly colored sofas, designer wallpaper, asymmetrical forms, and bathrooms with colored glass mosaics...

All suites are different in design, color, and size. Some have a balcony; others feature a terrace; yet others have a small private garden! The furniture features atypical antiques as well as unique contemporary works such as those designed by Paula Lavarello. Each room has a "botanic" wallpaper theme signed by Vanina Mizrahi.

The 36 rooms and suites are equipped with the most modern technology including air conditioning, wifi, large flat-screen TV, and DVD player. The suites have a kitchenette with a Nespresso machine and a microwave. The bathroom amenities are signed L`Occitane.

For a romantic night, ask the superior suite full of little glamorous touches!





The Tempting Experience:

Immersion in local contemporary art


The Vitrum Hotel transpires contemporary art everywhere. The decoration by the two Argentine architects, Zas and Paula Lavarello,  is uncommon with designer furniture such as BKF chairs and unique wallpaper... Monica Giron signed the design of the facade.

But Vitrum Hotel takes the local artists design experience even further. The hotel also has its own art gallery to promote local artists: Gallery Dabbah Torrejon art gallery which honors Argentinean and Latin American contemporary artists.
