The hotel experience


A tribute to the architecture and refining of the 1920’s

The hotel is facing the King Albert parc and consists of two historical buildings to which have been added two contemporary wings. The house at 23 Nahmani dates back to 1925 and was signed by the architect M. Cherber. It is made of oriental elements mixed with some Renaissance influence in the upper floors. The Hasya & Isser Romanov House, at number 25, is an avant-garde symbol of a certain symmetrical minimalist of the 20's architecture. Work of art by Leon Adler architecture, it kept its concrete structure and its wooden shutters. Yoav Messer, in association with the architect Nitza Szmuk, was in charge of the renovation and restoration, in respect to the Bahaus style of the district.

David d'Almada de Sagrada signs the decoration with furnitures, objects and fabric carefully selected in a spirit mixing antiquities and contemporary technologies. In the rooms confort is given by the sublime Frette linen and bouquets of fresh flowers.
The mousharaby, traditional windows of the oriental architecture, allow the light and the lovely mediteranean fragrances from the citrus gardens in.

The Norman is also a window on the local contemporary art with Israeli contemporary artists’ works of arts exhibited everywhere in the hotel.

The Corner Suite is one of our favorite suites with its flowery curved balcony providing an impressive vew on the King Albert square and the famous  Pagoda House.





The Tempting Experience:

An ode to contemporary art


The Norman makes way for the Israeli contemporary artists with an "art concierge" right in the hotel. He is in charge of the exhibited artists and is available to guide you towards the wonderful galeries of the city and the artistic events of the region.
