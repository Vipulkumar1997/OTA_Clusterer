Ekies All Senses Resort, a child's dream

Ekies All Senses Resort, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located in Vourvourou Bay, Halkidiki, in northern Greece, only 120 kilometres from Thessaloniki. Alexandra Efstathiadou, the owner, used to spend time in the region as a child. She decided to make these memories come to life in her boutique hotel. The area proves a really relaxing destination, right at the edge of the sea, the water still as a lake and as crystal clear as a lagoon. Each of the 69 rooms and suites, a combination of Greek tradition and contemporary design, offer an endless view on the luxurious gardens and the sea. The cocoon atmosphere and the natural benefits of the region make it ideal for a romantic getaway or a peaceful family vacation.





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary massage for each adult participant (Length: 20 min)

The Destination

The sublime Halkidiki coast

There is so much to do in the area: enjoy a sun soaked day discovering the beauty of the nearby islands, take a boat from the hotel and picnic on Diaporos Island, discover the mythical Blue Lagoon or even journey to Mount Athos. Listed by UNESCO as world heritage, this hilly peninsula houses ancient orthodox monasteries that remain, to this day, closed to women! Shopping wise, try the traditional atmosphere, markets and many cafés in the villages of Agios Nikolaos and Nikiti.

The hotel experience


A purely contemporary boutique hotel devoted to your well-being

Ekies All Senses Resort has found the perfect balance between luxury, ecology and relaxation. The hotel is divided into three buildings, built by three contemporary architects, each structure influenced by the surrounding nature. The rooms are decorated with refined objects by local crafters, contrasted with sleek furniture by Stark and Castiglioni. Natural wood, Greek marble, simple lines and colours frame the décor with elegance.
Private balconies and verandas bathe the rooms in natural light. The brand COCO-MAT, made from natural material, all from sustainable sources, was chosen for the bedding, thus ensuring optimal comfort. Each room has its own range of colours, always a soft and radiant palette. Hydro-massage showers, flat screen televisions and complimentary Wi-Fi add to the luxury.

A Luxury Suite or Loft Suite will prove a great choice for families as they can welcome up to 4 people. For a romantic stay, try a Luxury Double room with its deluxe double bed, bathroom in coloured glass and intimate lighting.






The Tempting Experience:

Freedom!


Time does not matter at the Ekies All Senses Resort. Hammocks, lounge chairs and couches, spread throughout both exterior and interior spaces of the hotel, encourage travellers to put their watch aside and relax. The “anytime, anywhere” catering concept will add to the feeling of freedom.

The Services


Restaurant
Ekies has three restaurants to make the most of each meal. The main one, Kouzina, focused on authentic Greek dishes. More avant-garde is Koutali – there, Chef Andreas Voulgaris creates gourmet dishes with organic ingredients. The Tree House is the gastronomical signature of the resort. A tip for lovers: a private dinner right by the water or on one of the small islands of the region can be arranged…Don’t forget the ring!
Spa & Wellness
The cabana spa, inspired by nature and the sun, guarantees absolute relaxation. The Apivita treatments offer a range of detoxifying and hydrating options using regional ingredients like olive oil, red wine, red pepper, seaweed, bitter orange, green tea, wild juniper and lemon.
Swimming pool




The Activities


Beach
A beach with crystal clear water stretches almost along the entire length of the property – a fantastic setting for children. One of the most beautiful beaches in the region, Karydi Beach, is just 300 meters from the hotel.
