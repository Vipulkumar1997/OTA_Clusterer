A Catalan farmhouse near Girona

Mas Tapiolas, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a charming boutique hotel located in the heart of the Solius Valley, 28km from Girona and a mere 10 minutes’ drive from the beaches of S'Agaro. This former Catalan farmhouse has been completely renovated. Its 40 rooms and 13 suites now offer all a 4-star hotel service, with an elegant but warm and welcoming atmosphere. The grounds -70 ha, no less- are framed beautifully by the famous Ardenya Mountains, a wonderfully vibrant landscape. 
Aside from being a real island of greenery, the hotel will delight epicurean travellers with its Catalan restaurant, its thermal spa and its Pitch & Pull golf course. The natural setting is also perfect for family stays.

The Destination

Girone and the region

The centre of Girona is a real historical gem, particularly known for its Jewish quarter, one of the largest and best preserved in Europe.

A few kilometres from the city is the volcanic area which, which with Fageda d'en Jordà, has become a nature reserve.

Near Mas Tapiolas are the most iconic beaches of the Baix Empordà area. Looking for a quiet beach? Try Cala Palamos Canyers. Tempted by water sports? Platja d'Aro is best. A lively beach with restaurants and shops takes your preference?  Llafranc will delight you.

The hotel experience


An Epicurean stay in Spain

Whether you come from Girona or Barcelona, ​​an hour and a half drive from the hotel, Mas Tapiolas promises peacefulness, relaxation as soon as you step in, let alone a wonderful opportunity to discover the Costa Brava.

Each of the 40 rooms retains the charm of traditional Catalan farmhouses with even stone walls and exposed beams for some. The furniture either focuses on a rustic charm or a contemporary style. Comfort, however, has all the advantages of modernity. Expect to be pampered: bathrobe, wifi, air conditioning, terrace or private garden. Even the toiletries refer to Catalonia with the elegant local brand "Tous".

Families are very welcome at Mas Tapiolas – the hotel has dedicated rooms, but also a games lounge with all sort of games and activities, special children menus at the restaurant let alone the surrounding nature that always delights the little ones.

The restaurant will take you on a culinary journey, should you wish to discover traditional Catalan cuisine. The dishes focus on seasonal products and local ingredients like fish from Palemos, highly recommended.

There is something for everyone on the estate: gym, golf, mountain bikes, swimming pool, tennis court for sport enthusiasts, but also the Ganesh Centre for relaxation and the spa for beauty treatments and massages.





The Tempting Experience:

13 intimate suites with a view


The 13 Natura Suites are located further from the main building to offer a more intimate experience, dream-like, with a solarium garden, an indoor pool or a private Jacuzzi. Each suite is named after one of the local mountains you can admire from the large windows.
Comfort and spectacular views are top of the priority list here.
These suites, totally independent, are designed with sustainable materials adapted to the environment as well as being equipped with home automation technology for optimum comfort.
The private solarium garden is perfect to daydream in a rocking chair or sip on a coffee. The indoor pools of 10 m2 each have the latest innovations: massage devices, whirlpool and chromatic lighting. Worthy of a queen!

The Jacuzzi suites are favourites for romantic stays. How about a champagne evening for two?
