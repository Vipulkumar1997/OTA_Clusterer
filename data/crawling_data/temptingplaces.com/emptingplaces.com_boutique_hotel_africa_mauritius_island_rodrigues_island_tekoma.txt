A charming boutique-hotel in Rodrigues

More untouched than her cousin Mauritius Island, the Rodrigues’ lagoon hides 18 islets whose best known are Ile aux Cocos, and Ile Hermitage. The Tekoma boutique hotel, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located at the heart of the small volcanic island, by the Indian Ocean on the Anse Ally beach. It is just a 30-minute ride from the airport and a few kilometres from Port Mathurin, the capital city. Built in communion with nature, the hotel Tekoma is a place where the barefoot luxury is a way of life. Tekoma is a charming hotel turned towards the open sea and an ideal cocoon for couples or contemplative travelers in love with nature.





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary bottle of wine
- Complimentary massage
- Complimentary fruit basket
- Complimentary upgrade for honeymooners (upon availabilities)

The Destination

Rodrigues Island

Rodrigues is 350 miles away from her cousin Mauritius. Surnamed the "Quiet Island" it is a real authentic postcard image. No palm trees, nor coconut trees, but still the fine sand and the blue green coloured lagoon are a reminder of a pristine heaven.
The Mont Limon offers an extraordinary panorama, in particular at sunset. Scuba diving enthusiasts will enjoy the lagoon to discover the marine wildlife.

The hotel experience


In respect of the Rodrigues’ nature

The Tekoma’s Creole  architecture is settled in the Rodriguan tradition. The island’s wild beauty inspired the decoration’s tone all in elegance and sobriety. The touches of turquoise, reminding the Rodrigues’ large lagoon’s colour, contrast with sand, brown, and slate-grey colours, and the teck furniture.
Nine rooms offer a stuning view on the Rodrigues’ lagoon. Six others open on the garden, whith two of them adjoining. The bathrooms are equipped with a natural stone sink and an outdoor pond for a bath in nature. Very concerned about their beloved island’s protection, the hotel’s owners input an environment program : use of natural energy, water’s desalination and recycling.






The Tempting Experience:

Live the art of barefoot luxury


Tekoma Hotel borders the pristine beach of Trou d’Argent and offers the remarkable experience to walk barefoot on the fine white sand. A way of living in lightness and liberty. Barefoot or both feet in the water, you will feel serene and rest, in total harmony with nature.
