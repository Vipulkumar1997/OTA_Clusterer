The hotel experience


A tropical elegant boutique hotel

13 cottages set in the stone, covered by authentic thatched roofs with a view over the sparkling sea , surrounded by a flourishing garden; welcome in this tropical elegant paradise.
The style of the owner, Mr.Chris Blackwell, and his love for Jamaica is reflected in the cottages traditional architecture and in the tropical decoration: wicker furniture, ethnic wood sculptures, hand painted beheads and wall frescos, bright colored batik fabrics.

We recommend the Moonshadow cottage, almost a fully functioning home with its two floors, kitchenette, and a lounge area to share nice breakfasts with your friends or family.

Romanticism lovers will be very fond of the Sun dancer cottage, a unique fusion of contemporary comfort and warm Jamaican design, with a second floor master bedroom overlooking the Caribbean Sea. An exclusive getaway!





The Tempting Experience:

A private cave for your intimate dinners


Original and romantic, The Caves offers you natural underground caves, connected to the sea, that are available for private Cave dining offering a 5-course meal at an additional cost (reserve upon check-in) with a candlelight atmosphere, bougainvillea petals on the table, and delicious dishes. This magic and romantic out-of-the-common location is the right place to commemorate your stay and to celebrate special occasions.
