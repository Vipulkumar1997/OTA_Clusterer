Discover Rome

Rome is a city for walking and luckily the hotel is exactly at the historical center of Rome!  A few steps away from the hotel discover the Quirinale gardens, which you may even be able to see from your room. During your stroll through Rome, be sure to make a wish at the Trevi fountain, admire the infamous Coliseum, or make a quick stop at Piazza Navona, known for their famous panna cotta. Not far from there, you will inevitable pass by the Piazza di Spagne, the meeting place for the most privileged Romans. Uptown, visit the Villa Borghese which is the largest park in Rome. Palatino, Pantheon, Vatican and all the other amazing monuments will surely fill the rest of your free-time!.

The hotel experience


The elegance of living like the Romans

The passion of the Spalletti Trivelli family, the owners of the hotel, was to combine art and history with modern technology to create Villa Spalletti Trivelli, a contemporary and comfortable hotel. The drawing rooms are decorated with the antique furniture, tapestries, sculptures and paintings of the family’s own private collection. The library is home to magnificent wood paneling and the Count Venceslao Spalletti Trivelli’s private collection of books; it is under the tutelage of the Italian Ministry of National Heritage and Culture.

The 14 guestrooms and suites are named after the different districts of Rome. The attention given to details is that of a large family residence:  sumptuous wall-hangings, alpaca and cashmere bed throws, linen drapes embroidered with the family crest, large marble bathrooms… nothing has been overlooked. Along with the unique décor and ambiance, the rooms have views of the Villa’s private gardens or the gardens of Quirinale. In accordance with the hotel’s perfect service, the mini-bar is available free of charge.

Guests with families or those staying for a longer period may prefer the garden suites, located in the adjacent building and connected to the main Villa through the gardens.






The Tempting Experience:

Just like the count and the countess


Gabriella Rasponi, widow of the Count Venceslao Spalletti Trivelli, and niece of Caroline Bonaparte, sister of Napoleon, built the villa facing Quirinal at the start of the 20th century. She had the habit of welcoming the most renowned people of the era, such as writers, politicians, and artists, to her drawing rooms every Thursday. This vibrant soul still reverberates throughout the Villa Spalletti Trivelli as it once did. One can drink tea in the garden, read a book in one of the grand stylish living rooms, or sway to the music of the fountains. Settle in at the center of 20th century cultural life and relive the history of this unique residence.
