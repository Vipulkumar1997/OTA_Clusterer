The Destination

In the heart of Saint-Germain-des-Près

Villa Madame is located in the heart of St Germain des Prés, a district known for its bohemian intellectual atmosphere. The neighbourhood is a fascinating combination of historic places (Café de Flore, Musée d’Orsay, Luxembourg Gardens…) and more contemporary spots: art galleries in rue Dauphine, Aurélie Antiques boutique for vintage addicts or the new Kusmi Tea, rue de Seine for a tea detox. Time to take a stroll to discover it all…

The hotel experience


Exclusive Elegance

There is much history in this area and Villa Madame is part of it. The street where it is located was inaugurated in 1790 by His Royal Highness or "Monsieur", who was to become Louis XVIII.  He named it Rue Madame in honour of his wife, Marie-Josephine of Savoy, Princess of Sardinia.
The actual owners, Térèse Tafanel and Gilles Delfau, asked designer Michel Jouannet to highlight the natural elegance and sophisticated atmosphere of his 18th century building. Through the lobby and the rooms, you will be soothed by a beautiful palette of greige hues, framed with a little burgundy and raspberry to add a feminine touch. Each object has been selected with care, making the room feel more intimate, more personal. The furniture was created especially by Michel Jouannet and produced by the most famous names in the interior decoration world: SST for the chairs and sofas, Delaroux and Charpentier for the lamps and candlesticks edited by Pouenat, Dedari for the fabrics.
Madame absolutely loves flowers. Thus the hotel is adorned with amazing, often fairy tale like floral decorations by florist Yannick Suznjev but also exquisite little touches like an orchid branch in a niche, welcoming you on the way to your room.

The 28 rooms reflect the discreet and luxurious atmosphere of the lobby and lounge: a harmony in colours, black lacquered furniture and wrought iron sculptures designed by Michel Jouannet and created by Francis Pouenat.
Here and there, a splash of colour has been added: drawings, samples of Hermes scarf sketches belonging to the archives of the decorator decorate the walls. The refined Hermes Eau d`Orange fragrance fills the bathrooms. The Villa Madame hotel is proud to be the first hotel in France to equip its shower cabins with the « Skinjay experience » : essential oil capsules unveils unique scents when mixed with hot water during the shower.

To make the most of your stay, do try the rooms on the fifth floor: their terrace overlooks the Parisian rooftops, offering such a beautiful view of the city.






The Tempting Experience:

Paris Rive Gauche


The hotel was designed to look like a typical house of the Parisian Left Bank, elegant and subtle. This is the perfect occasion to live like French do: go shopping at St Germain Market, have lunch at Brasserie Lipp, discover boutiques near  Rue du Four, delight with Pierre Hermé’s macaroons and stroll through Luxembourg Gardens. Once you are back at the hotel, why not sip on a coffee near the fireplace or in the patio?

The Services


Garden
The yard was transformed into an extraordinary contemporary garden by the floral artist Yannick Suznjev. The perfect place to relax during sunny days, it also proves a rather magical spot in winter. You can wrap yourself in one of the blankets provided and enjoy a drink near the outdoor fireplace during the colder months.
Reading & Movies
The cosy fireplace in the lounge is another favourite spot in the hotel. Take a book or a board game from the shelves, ask for a tea and a sweet treat (maybe one of the delicious homemade Financiers?) and relax.
Every month, the hotel organizes an evening with games, theatre or songs for all, a great occasion to make new friends.
