The Destination

Zanzibar, the island of spices

Zanzibar is not known as the spice island for no reason! Go on an aromatic spice plantation tour and let local spices such as clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and chili fill your senses as you wander the picturesque grounds.
Also, try a fruit tour to taste several seasonal local fruits such as coconut, lime, orange and bananas.

Take a day trip to the Nungwi village and visit Mnarani Natural Aquarium, the turtle sanctuary and the nearby lighthouses, characterized by their Arab designs.

The hotel experience


Unwind in a luxury boutique hotel

Never has a name have been so evocative : Zanzibar transports you to a world of spices, endless beaches, blue lagoons and exotic fruits...
Architecturally, Essque Zalu Zanzibar is inspired by local styles and colours, the thatched roofs, refined décor and the dark brown, beige, white and orange accents blending into the landscape. Yet there is a immense sense of luxury woven throughout Essque, especially in the suites and villas and the hotel`s new hospitality venues.

The reception concept reworked: a "navigator" assists each traveler, from the booking throughout all their stay. There is no reception desk; completing formalities such as checkin and checkout is at the guest`s convenience and can be done in the suite, by the pool, at the bar...
Each suite has a large master bedroom, a lounge and an outside terrace overlooking the luscious gardens, pool or the Indian Ocean. Enjoy little details of native artwork that adorn both room types.

The Oceanview Suites are true bungalows. For families we recommend a Seafront Suite with 2 or 3 bedrooms.

For a more intimate stay, we recommend a Villa. They are all spacious with their own private pools, massage rooms, kitchenettes, terraces and patios.





The Tempting Experience:

A tribute to local Zanzibar artists


Essque Zalu is known for its strong connection to its local community. The hotel's 450 m2 art gallery embodies this commitment. The gallery showcases artwork from local, regional, and international artists to promote cultural African expression. Wander the halls of the gallery to discover diverse paintings, sculptures, photographs and glassworks. But the art is not just confined to the gallery; local art is displayed all over the hotel. If you fall in love with a piece, Essque can even arrange for it to be sent back to your home.
