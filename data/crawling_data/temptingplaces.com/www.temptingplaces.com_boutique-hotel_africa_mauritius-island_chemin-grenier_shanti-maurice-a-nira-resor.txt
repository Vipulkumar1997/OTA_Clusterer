The Destination

Mauritius Island

The island is in the southwest Indian Ocean and in the heart of the Mascarene Islands. Bathed in turquoise waters, the beautiful island of Mauritius offers spectacular tropical coral reefs, mountains, volcanoes, rivers and waterfalls.

A few kilometers from Shanti Maurice, you can visit to the Rochester Waterfall and refresh yourself in the small pond at the foot of the falls.

The estate of Bois Cheri is a must-see for fans of Mauritian heritage and tea. This plantation was established in 1892 and produces more than half of Mauritian tea! Don`t forget to stop at the Chalet Bois Cheri, 1 km from the plantation, to sip coconut-vanilla tea with a splendid view over the plantations and the ocean on the horizon.

The hotel experience


A hotel and island in harmony

The Mauritian architect Jean-Marc Eynaud designed an architecture that blends with the surroundings, playing with space as well as elements like the ocean and tropical vegetation. Local materials such as wood, lava stone and thatch are used, combined with the brilliance of marble and granite. Large, outward-looking windows allow air to circulate. Ponds, fountains and lava sculptures beautifully adorn the extensive gardens.

The 17 villas and 44 suites are spread over 14 hectares of tropical garden and are all facing the Indian Ocean. This direct access to the beach is perfect for beautiful morning walks, just outside your door. The design is contemporary luxury (plasma TVs, air conditioning, speaker systems, coffee machines ...) with a Mauritian influence, a mixture of cultures: Japanese sliding panels, Creole ceiling fans,  Indian furniture...

We recommend the upstairs suites, with wide balconies offering a perfect panorama to admire the sunsets over the bay. For a fully exclusive stay, choose one of the sumptuous villas, complete with private pools. A little further away from shore and overlooking the rocky coast, they promise a magical and serene stay.





The Tempting Experience:

Relax in the island`s largest spa


The Nira Spa spreads its 7000 m² around a charming Tea Pavilion surrounded by water lily ponds. It is one of the largest spas on the Indian Ocean, with 25 wellness rooms. Spa therapists, nutritionists, personal trainers, Yoga masters and Ayurvedic physicians all work together to offer unique and personalized treatments. Age-old secular Ayurveda medicine is combined with modern Africology products, a blend of 2 cultures in line with the Shanti Maurice philosophy.

On the menu: Soul of Africa, Intonga Amasatchi, African Goddess...ready to travel?!
