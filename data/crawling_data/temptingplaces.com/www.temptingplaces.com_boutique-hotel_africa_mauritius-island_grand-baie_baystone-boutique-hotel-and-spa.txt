The hotel experience


Contemporary architecture inspired by the ocean

The plan of the Baystone owner, Jean-Pierre Vissuzaine and his friend Franco Salon, was to create a unique boutique hotel, mixing a contemporary design, a refined atmosphere and a personalized service. He turned to the New York architect Albert Angel, who was inspired by the ocean to create this decidedly seaside hotel. The wave is the theme of decoration, you will find its undulating lines on walls, floors, carpets, furniture and the shapes of outdoor buildings. Glass and volcanic stone play with the lights that sculpt the space. Reflective materials were used to reflect the natural colors of the lagoon.

The 21 rooms are spacious with high ceilings to give a feeling of space and lightness. All of the furniture was designed and custom-made in sensual shapes, like polished by the wind. The color palette is minimal, ranging from white to stone grey. The touch of high-tech is evident in the bathrooms with a “pit rain” shower and a chromotherapy bath that offers appeasement and serenity with its changing colors.
The rooms have a view of the Canonnier coastal path, while the suites overlook the Grand Bay lagoon from their terraces.
The 3 Baystone Suites have the advantage of having a jacuzzi in the bathroom and enjoy exclusive access to the solarium and the rooftop pool, one of the only ones in Mauritius.





The Tempting Experience:

Float in the spa in a bubble of happiness


The Spa of Baystone has a unique care: a floatation tank that allows you to reach the deepest levels of relaxation. Spend approximately one hour suspended in 25 cm of a solution of epsom salts, heated at 96.8 degrees. The salt allows you to float effortlessly and soft music accompanies this moment of absolute serenity. Numerous studies have shown that floating reduces the amount of chemicals responsible for stress in the body. One hour of flotation brings the restorative effects of 4 hours of sleep! A true bubble of happiness!
