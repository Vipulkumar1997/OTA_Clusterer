A hidden gem in Burgundy

Luxury, discretion and heritage perfectly characterize La Borde, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, a historical boutique hotel nestled in Leugny, at the heart of Burgundy. Less than two hours from Paris, by car or by train, the closest railway stations are Joigny and Auxerre. The house dates from the fourteenth-and partly from the sixteenth century. Its five luxury suites open onto a peaceful, French-style garden housing some 50 species of trees. The magnificent glazed orangery, the wellness center and outdoor pool add to the comfort and sense of tranquility. Take a book, a glass of wine out of the extensive cellar and admire the scenery, this is the La Borde approach to a romantic weekend in the countryside or an epicurean stay to discover the region.





Tempting Advantages

- Fresh flowers & a basket of fruits in the room

The Destination

Once upon a time in Burgundy…

In the Middle Ages, there were five castles in Leugny. Burgundy remains a historical land where several beautiful properties and villages lie: The castle of the counts of Auxerre and of Nevers’ splendid testimony of the Middle Ages, The Basilica of Vézelay, Noyers sur Serein classified as "one of the Most beautiful French Village"... Burgundy is renowned worldwide for its wines. Feel free to ask the La Borde's owners for the best private wine tours. For dining, taste the famous escargot, one of 30 cheeses referenced (Chaource, Epoisse, etc.) or the charcuterie of Morvan.

The hotel experience


Luxury in the countryside

The five luxurious suites, sweetly named after flowers, mix the opulent style of the sixteenth century with contemporary comfort. The attic rooms are under the eaves, the beams are exposed and the headboards are covered in velvet, just like meridiennes that invite relaxation. The furniture and decor are signed by Mis en Demeure with a range of refined colors: greys, beiges, statements of saffron or maroon. Without stylistic faults, even the bathrooms with their vintage-style clawfoot tubs bring all their charm. The water in the pool and bathroom is filtered in a gentle way for a limestone-free experience. Beautiful but equally comfortable: the mattresses and box springs, of the high-end brand Schramm, provide a good night’s sleep.

For a cosy stay by the fire-place, we prefer the Aubépine Junior Suite with its fireplace, while families can appreciate the Suite, specially arranged with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a lounge and a kitchenette.

The garden is the pride of the owners, Rik and Marieke Klomp, who transformed what was originally seventeen acres of fields. Moreover, it earned the classification Jardin Remarquable. Beeches, lime trees, ginkos bilobas, etc. 50 species of trees stand alongside a French garden, a pond, an orchard with apples and pears and a vegetable garden of 1600 m², with vegetables that will delight your dinner. The pétanque surface awaits you for a game of bowls for the sunny days to come!

The wellness center will seduce you with its ​​Sweet Spa: shower, steam bath with two precise sensations, foggy (cold) or rainy (hot), and four different cosmetic treatment choices. If you prefer the Scandinavian style, the sauna offers four different program choices. Massage by ‘Massothermie’ offers a treatment of total body massage with hot stones of jade to deep relaxation of body and mind.






The Tempting Experience:

A castle-chic getaway


A stay at La Borde is the castle lifestyle but with a contemporary luxury and a chic, “at home” style. If the stones from the property could speak, they would tell memories dating back to the sixteenth century, to the time when the present castle came to replace the ancient, medieval fort…The chatelaine spirit from that time was the most important to preserve: an elegant home, refined and personalized. The incredible charm of a castle in Burgundy became a countryside hotel.
