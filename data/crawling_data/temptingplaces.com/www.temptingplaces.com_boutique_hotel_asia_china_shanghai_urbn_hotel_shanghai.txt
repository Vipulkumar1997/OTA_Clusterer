The Destination

Experience Shanghai differently

The Shanghai art museum is one China`s most innovative state-owned museums of China. It celebrates the Shanghai biennial and its permanent collection shows a very interesting perspective on 20th century Chinese art.

The Moca Shanghai, opened in 2005, is installed in the ancient glasshouse of the People Square park, renowned for its fantastic site and notably the centrally located artificial lake covered in water lilies. The Moca Shanghai hosts art exhibits of contemporary Chinese and European artists.

M50 and Suzou Creek are the spearheads of the city`s cultural engagements: the community hosts artist studios that also have the function of small art galleries.

The Hongkou neighbourhood, the ancient war-time Jewish ghetto, is a truly unique place to visit in Shanghai.

The French concession and the Bund are relatively well protected from rogue land promoters and are the perfect places for a nice stroll, cultural exposure, and interesting shopping. The People`s Park (People Square) is also the starting point of the Bund and close to the Nanjing Donglu shopping area.

The hotel experience


Natural, local, reclaimed materials and a contemporary design

Behind the impressive wooden door sheltering the URBN hotel from the outside world lies a calm and private garden and patio that leads to the hotel. The URBN`s outside decor is resolutely contemporary with wood, old Shanghai bricks, and bamboo. Inside, the parquets are made out of reclaimed shanghai hardwood from old demolished Chinese houses. The hotel`s reception area features an original wall made out of a patchwork of leather suitcases... The atmosphere is airy, very contemporary, sleek, and tinted with splashes of electric blue.

The guest rooms are designed to provide maximum comfort and, in line with the rest of the hotel, are decorated with natural, locally sourced, and when possible, reclaimed building materials. Platform beds with king-sized mattresses, sunken lounge areas with wrap-around natural linen sofas, large bright windows, stone walk-in showers and bath-tubs, lighting that provides a soothing and relaxing atmosphere ...

The bathrooms are equipped with Bayankala bath products, and the rooms have customized mini-bars, in-room fitness kits, WIFI, flat-screen TV, and the latest and best high-tech audio equipment (DVD, iPod, MP3 ...).

The URBN boutique hotel has 23 spacious rooms (35-45m²), 2 penthouse suites (60-80m²) with large 120m² private terraces overlooking the Jing An district, and a suite with a 30m² private courtyard garden and a private spa and treatment room!





The Tempting Experience:

Culture, design and ecology in Shanghai


The Urbn combine the discovery of the Chinese culture of the past, present, and future with impressive state-of-the art modern design, all with minimal impact on the environment. The hotel even makes it possible for guests to offset their flight carbon footprint by purchasing the appropriate accredited carbon credits! A great blend for a Tempting Hotel!
