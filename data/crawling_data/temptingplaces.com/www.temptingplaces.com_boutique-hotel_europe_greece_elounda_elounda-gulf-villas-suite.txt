The Destination

Elounda, Crete idleness

Elounda is a fishing village located in the Bay of Mirabello. Bordered by mountains, it has retained its picturesque quality. The market, fishermen, seafood restaurants... Sit in a cafe opposite the island of Spinalonga, and dream the face of this scene between land and sea.
If you want to visit Spinalonga, the former Venetian fortress turned a leper colony before being abandoned in the 60s, the boat leaves at Plaka, 5 km from Elounda.

The hotel experience


Relaxing in style

From the pool to the sky to the Cretan Mediterranean shimmering on the horizon of the Elounda Gulf Villas & Suites, the atmosphere is blue: navy, cyan, amethyst.... You will be amazed by this unique light on the Greek island conducive to daydreaming and relaxation.
The 18 private pool villas and 10 suites have each been tastefully decorated by owner Mrs. Kadianakis. Marble, Italian fabrics, antique and modern furniture come together to create a personal and friendly atmosphere.
The sumptuous villas offer private infinity pools merging with the Gulf of Mirabello. They are all equipped with a modern fully equipped kitchen, lounge, one or more rooms and enjoy and outside terrace surrounding the pool and jacuzzi.

For a honeymoon, choose without hesitation the Deluxe Spa Pool Villa! The living room opens with vibrant colors directly onto the terrace and the seasonally heated pool with Jacuzzi and jet for swimming against the stream dives into the Mediterranean. The panoramic windows of the room offer a sweeping revival "ocean view". Perfect for a love cocoon!

For a family holiday, we suggest a Luxury Family Suite with two bedrooms and bathrooms near the swimming pool for children. To combine independent living and access to hotel services such as the restaurant, choose a private Pool Villa. The Aegean Villa with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, lounge with fireplace and private pool offers ample space to relax and enjoy time spent with your family.





The Tempting Experience:

Private and customized paradise


Premium services can be fully tailored to suit your desires. How about a dinner prepared by a chef in the kitchen of your villa and served on your terrace or during early morning yoga near your pool or a diving lesson in your own private pool... Nothing is too good for guests of Elounda Gulf Villas & Suites. Natural setting, luxurious private villas, friendly atmosphere and dedication to the well-being ... The jetseters and royalty, who make Elounda Gulf their vacation home, were not deceived about its magic.
