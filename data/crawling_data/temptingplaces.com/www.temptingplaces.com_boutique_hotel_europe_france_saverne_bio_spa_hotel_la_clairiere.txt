The Destination

The Vosges forest

La Petite Pierre is a picturesque village, with Vauban` fortifications, located 2 km from the hotel. The must-sees are the 12th century castle, the Maison des Païens (Pagan`s House), and the Musée du Sceau (popular arts and traditions Museum).

The surroundings hold many other treasures, whether natural or historical (troglodytes house of Graufthal, alsaciennes houses and Bouxwiller Museum, Neuwiller-les-Saverne abbaye, Lichtenberg and Fleckenstein castles...). Not to mention the new architectural jewel by Jean-Michel Wilmotte at Wingen sur Moder: the unique Lalique museum of France which features Art Nouveau and Art Déco artists.

Hikers will certainly appreciate the 350 km of trails, walks from 2 hours to 2 days around the region. A very poetic trail takes you on a walk in René Char’s footsteps.

The hotel experience


Wellness and nature with an organic label

La Clairière is above all else a family affair. In 1981, charmed by the magic of the area, Mr and Mrs Strohmenger opened a six-room hotel in the forest. After twenty years, the hotel now boasts fifty rooms complete with an English bar and an indoor pool. Since the year 2000, their two daughters have taken over the management of the hotel and transformed it into a place of revitalizing rest. First, they added a spa, then the first certified organic French restaurant and then began offering free therapy sessions (Ayerveda, Yoga, Qi Gong…).

Nestled at the edge of the forest, this contemporary styled hotel lies in perfect harmony with its surroundings. Waking up in the morning, opening your blinds, and breathing in the fresh air with the fragrance of the woods nearby is extremely rejuvenating!

Each room`s décor harmonizes wooden materials and elegant colors. They are all equipped with natural latex bedding and cotton and organic wool to ensure your sleep is as rejuvenating as possible. In each room, you will also find massage oils and organic soap.

The Superior category is a real highlight with their large bay windows overlooking the forest, along with a balcony and sitting room area.





The Tempting Experience:

Experience a Media Detox


Does your phone keep buzzing with calls, texts, e-mails and news flashes? Are you tired of the information overflow? Turn it off! At La Clairière, wi-fi is only accessible, on demand, in the shared areas. Not only so that you can take yourself away from the center of your preoccupations but also to reduce the electromagnetic smog. Your body and mind will be grateful to escape far from technological stress - optimal well-being is guaranteed.
