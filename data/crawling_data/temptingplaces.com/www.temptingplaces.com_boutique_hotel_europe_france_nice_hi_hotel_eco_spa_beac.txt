The Destination

Nice, between sea and mountains

Nice is a multifaceted city. Among chic seafront, trendy bars and peaceful retreats, all kind of visits are possible.
Not to miss "La Promenades des anglais", famous city façade of 8 km length, that succeeded in keeping its characteristic Thirties side. Especially don`t miss the Negresco ! If you look for a lively district, head towards the Old Nice, its bars and restaurants. A small memory if Italy! Art lovers have not been forgotten in this city that boasts the Matisse and the Modern & Contemporary Art museum.

The hotel experience


A Matali Crasset signed boutique hotel

The owners, Patrick Elouarghi and Philippe Chapelet, have dreamed about creating an urban, accessible and friendly hotel. The decoration and creation of tailor made furniture has been committed to Matali Crasset, who signs a unique hotel which breaks the codes of the classical hotel business.

The exteriors are sober; the hotel`s name is barely visible on the white facade of this Thirties building. A discretion that rapidly disappears once in the hall that wraps you in a colorful ambience. Raspberry, acid green, turquoise... The atmosphere is original and sparkling and the colors carry energy from a space to another. In a free and friendly spirit, the decor is very changeable; the lobby armchairs for example, might blend in, in different ways according to the several color combinations.

The 38 rooms respect 9 concepts, "9 ways of living in a specific place" according to the designer Matali Crasset. Simple, off-code structures, shared spaces, these concepts become true in different ways; a bathroom in the middle of the room, a video screen that works also as room divider, or even a table that becomes a bed !

Our favorite is the HI-studio technocorner, a truly private auditorium where it is possible to watch a movie on giant screen directly from the bed or from the screen incorporated bathtub with home cinema sound. The sofa is equipped with speakers and integrated headphones to enjoy a unique nightclub.
The Rendez-vous Terrasse room, the largest of the hotel, allows you to pass directly from the bathroom to the office room. You`ll be pleasantly surprised by the layout inversion: it`s remarkable how the huge lavish stone bathtub is located in the room`s centre, whereas the bedroom is in an alcove. The private terrace with long chairs is a real invitation to idleness.





The Tempting Experience:

Surprising happy hour on Nice`s roofs


The coolest place of the Hi Hotel is without any doubts the 8th floor pool. It`s a real meeting point at the end of the day during high season, where you can appreciate a glass of wine or a cocktail with plunging view over the city of Nice, the Alps and the Mediterranean Sea.
