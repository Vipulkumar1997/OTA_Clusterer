The Destination

Holbox, a sun rhythm living island

Between fishing, hammocks and turquoise water, the small paradise of Holbox Island, has succeeded in keeping itself protected from mass tourism, continuing to offer a lush and diverse natural landscape. With only 2000 "mestizo" inhabitants (descendants of the Mayan, and Spanish and Cuban immigrants), and bursting with splendid, fine sand beaches, the island is characterized by a fishing village atmosphere, especially appreciated by those who enjoy the slow life.

Holbox is part of the ecological reserve of Yum Balam, which covers 154 000 square kilometers of protected areas, where unique species reside. Here you`ll not only discover the famous whale shark but also hawksbill turtles, pink flamingos, terns, white pelicans, different types of iguanas and horseshoe crabs.
Come discover the most beautiful hidden secrets of Mexico and the Caribbean!

The hotel experience


An exquisite hotel facing the Caribbean Sea

The hotel`s 20 rooms all face the Caribbean Sea and each of them boasts a customized artist`s decoration. Colors, style, rustic terra cotta floor tiles, Egyptian cotton sheets... Inspired by the island`s landscapes and its flora and fauna, Sandra Perez combines tailor made furnishings and brilliant bright-colored local handcrafts to guarantee a relaxing, exotic, and refined escape!

Our favorite room is the Superior Deluxe, which boasts a teakwood terrace complete with a hammock, to assure a pleasant afternoon soaking up the sun...





The Tempting Experience:

Caribbean Gastronomy


CasaSandra Boutique Hotel is the only gourmet restaurant on the Island of Holbox. It has a friendly and warm ambiance, focused on the Caribbean, into which Chef Felix, nicknamed "the happy Cuban", welcomes you. On the menu: lobster bisque scented with tequila, fish fillet with cilantro habanero sauce, and a Guava cheese tart...
All products used are locally sourced, and the fish, according to the famous chef René Redzepi, is "one of the best made of the Yucatan Peninsula."
A romantic candlelight dinner under the starry sky at Casa Sandra will satisfy all your desires!
