The Destination

Kuala Lumpur`s must do`s

Discover a city of contrasts! Kuala Lumpur combines modern cosmopolitan lifestyle with sophistication and charms of the colonial past and persistent traditions.

Start your visit with the bustling Merdeka Square where you can see the British-styled Royal Selangor Club located opposite the Moorish-styled Sultan Abdul Samad building (1897).

The ancient Kuala Lumpur train-station, with its arches, its minarets and its dome, is a very nice illustration of Moorish architecture.

Also take a stroll in the Lake Gardens located in the centre of KL. They are really beautiful and worthwhile your time.

The Central Market, hosted in an Art-Deco building, has become a touristic market nowadays bur retains all its charm. Do walk around the surrounding streets to experience the shophouses` atmosphere.

Malaysia`s rich culture and history unfolds in the National Museum (typical Malay architecture), one of the most beautiful museums of South-East Asia.

And, last but not least, don`t leave Kuala Lumpur without visiting the famous Petronas Twin Towers and the Batu Caves - a wonderful Hindu temple!

The hotel experience


Historical luxury, modern comfort, and personalised butler service

The Carcosa Seri Negara Hotel is composed of two Tudor and neo-gothic styled mansions located on two adjacent hills inside the Lake garden district. White colonial houses with immaculate gardens, they have become part of Malaysia`s history due to their historical status as the official General Residence and a place where numerous international treaties were signed. Her majesty Queen Elisabeth II stayed at the Carcosa Seri Negara on occasions, so do not be surprised to see, in the majestic stairway, a predominant painting of the Queen walking down these exact same stairs! Another one of the highly noted service of this manor was its` role as the residential home to the first British General Resident of the Malay state from 1904 to 1941. The Carcosa Seri Nagara is now a hallmark of Malaysia`s national heritage.

The 5 elegant suites are all unique and, by virtue of their individual design, size and decoration, derive their names from selected Malaysian States. All rooms are very spacious with high ceilings and living rooms that overlook the beautiful gardens. Some have four-poster beds and private terraces or verandas in order to enjoy tea in full intimacy.





The Tempting Experience:

English Afternoon Tea at the Carcosa


Ultra sophisticated service, finest bone china and silverware, enchanting setting of the Drawing Room or the wrap-around veranda overlooking the beautiful gardens, the English afternoon tea at the Carcosa Seri Negara reflects the true atmosphere of the colonial era when the founder, Sir Frank Swettenham, resided on the property.

This is a true Tempting Experience ... make sure you have had a light lunch and remember to cancel your evening dinner!

The English afternoon Tea is served in the most customary of British traditions with a succession of sweet and sour delights such as scones, homemade strawberry jam, freshly clotted cream and smoked salmon ... all served with a choice of 40 of the most refined British teas...
