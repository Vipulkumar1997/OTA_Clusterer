An eco-resort on a private Tahitian atoll

The Brando hotel, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is the dream Marlon Brando fulfilled: To see Tetiaroa, a French Polynesian island, become an ecological sanctuary welcoming visitors in a carbon-neutral hotel. From Tahiti and its international airport Papeete, it only takes 20 minutes to connect to Tetiaroa. Some say the short journey itself is extraordinary enough to disconnect from reality!

More than a concept, the Brando Hotel is an authentic and ecological masterpiece using sea water for its air conditioning and coconut oil as fuel. The 35 private villas with pools by a translucent blue lagoon, the surrounding nature, the activities, gastronomy and spa are the key ingredients to an extraordinary and exclusive journey.

The hotel experience


Brando’s vision

Marlon used to say of his little paradise: “The island is beautiful, beyond my ability to describe her or capture her on film”. The hotel reflects this peaceful and wild atmosphere, just as Brando wished. Each villa has been built from local materials with palm roofs similar to the ones on authentic Tahitian huts. Decoration is minimalist but the comfort is worthy of a five star luxury hotel: king size bed, dark wooden floor and a large bay window with full view over the emerald lagoon, coconut and pandan trees. The private terraces invite you to dive in the pool, right in front of the lagoon.
Villas are available with 1, 2 or 3 bedrooms.






The Tempting Experience:

Tetiaroa, the original island


Tetiaora is an atoll located 33 miles from Tahiti. It is the ultimate island paradise: sparkling sand, luxurious palm trees and turquoise ocean. It has always been a soothing island with even the Tahitian royal family coming there to rest each summer. Marlon Brando later made it his private world, where he spent his most peaceful years.

The Services


Bar
Situated on the second floor, the open air Manu bar offers sublime views of the lagoon. It also provides several private tree-top seating areas for more intimacy. Bob’s Bar is a relaxed and casual setting on the beach, perfect for a chat and making new friends. The bar is named after Marlon Brando’s factotum on film sets. Often, at the end of the day, Brando and Bob would wind up at the bar for long talks and laughs.
Restaurant
The Beachcomber Café is ideal to eat inside or on the beach. The elegant decorated restaurant Les Mutinés is surrounded by a moat, giving the impression that it is actually floating on the lagoon. The award-winning cuisine of Guy Martin (of the Michelin two star restaurant Le Grand Véfour in Paris) is featured in both dining venues and room service.
Spa & Wellness
The spa is nestled on the shores of the lagoon. Treatments offered are inspired by ancient Polynesian traditions coupled with modern techniques. The spa includes private massage and steam baths, both heavenly pleasures. A special spa suite for couples high up in the palm trees is also available.
