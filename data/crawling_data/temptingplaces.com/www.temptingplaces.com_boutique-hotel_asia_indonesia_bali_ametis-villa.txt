The Destination

Around Canggu

Ametis Villa is located in the village of Canggu, a 45 minutes’ drive from Ngurah Rai International Airport. The region has kept its traditions. If you are a morning person, do not miss the fishermen coming back to the harbour around 9am on their jukung. If you like cycling, we recommend a peaceful stroll through the tropical rice fields. If you love the fitness, Canggu Club is the best option, and if you are surfer, the nearest beach is the surf spot suitable for intermediate.

If you are looking for a vibrant atmosphere: Seminyak, a mere 25 minutes’ drive away, with many boutiques and galleries to delight shoppers but also bars, restaurants and clubs for the evening.

Echo Beach is a spot known for surfing. The beach, lined with restaurants and cafés-concerts, really does come alive at night.

If you are ready for a day excursion, don’t miss the world heritage “Jati Luwih”. Your personal butler will take you to Taman Ayun temple, Bedugul hill where you will enjoy a picnic lunch prepared by the Chef. The beautiful spot overlooks the lake. Then head to Jati Luwih, the most beautiful cascade rice terrace and traditional irrigation system called “Subak” in Bali. And then continue to Tanah Lot temple upon sunset time.Perched on a rock, it is one of the most famous temple in Bali and quite possibly the most beautiful place to see the sun set…

The hotel experience


Contemporary luxury meets the beauty of nature

Ametis, meaning Amethyst (the stone of wisdom) in Balinese, is a contemporary interpretation of the spirit of Bali. Wrapped in an exclusive yet authentic atmosphere, the hotel comprises 14 villas, a restaurant and a spa.
Its motto? Being one with nature, stepping away from routine, slowing down and taking the time to discover the local art and culture.

Every guest is assigned a personal Balinese butler from their arrival at the airport. Your butler will anticipate your needs and will help your organised your stay whether you wish to join a cooking lesson, an excursion on the island or a reiki session at the spa.

A refreshing interpretation of a traditional Balinese village, Ametis also focuses on modern materials and comfort. Each villa is a contemporary sanctuary that harmoniously blends local timber with glass and metal, carefully designed by architect Anthony Liu and Studio Ton Ton to create an elegant inside/outside effect.
The wooden doors of the villas are framed by walls of Kerobokan sandstone, as Kori style dictates. The Pelinggih, a sacred altar, marks the end of the zigzag path leading to the pond. The straw roofs may be traditional but look closely: polycarbonate and wood panels discreetly add elegance and lightness to the structure. Indeed, this project is all about finding the right balance between past and present.

The interior design is signed by Alex Bayu Saputra and Genius Loci. Bespoke furniture and artwork aim at creating a warm, home feel. Discreet, neutral tones and the minimalist decor fade the walls away, blurring the usual indoor/outdoor line and bringing you closer to nature.

Nature also is very present at the Ruby spa, with local plants and local being used as ingredients for the beauty treatments.

Ametis offers three unique accommodation categories.
The Premiere Villa is ideal for honeymooners. Designed around a private patio with pool and terrace, the kitchen and dining room guarantee total privacy during the stay. The living room, which roof is made of precious wood, opens onto the garden. Both the bedroom and bathroom look onto the pool through a transparent wall.

The Grand Villa adopts the same elegant, minimalistic style. Its three bedrooms guarantee a wonderful stay with a “home” feel and comfort to families and friends.

Imperial Villa, slightly larger than Premiere Villa is ideal for savvy travelers look for finer things in life. Room and living room is located side by side for easier access especially during rainy season without getting wet. Bath room is more open style than Premiere which offers the feeling of tropical spa style.
The Private pool is not visible from bathroom at Imperial Villa.

Ametis offers inter-connecting villas for your option, which is ideal for 4 adults such as parents and children(above 12 years old) or 2 couples to book each independent villa that can connect by opening sliding door.





The Tempting Experience:

A personal Balinese butler


Every guest is assigned a personal Balinese butler from their arrival at the airport. Your butler who becomes your personal assistant will anticipate your needs and will help your organised your stay whether you wish to join a cooking lesson, an excursion on the island or a reiki session at the spa. being from bali he will also guide you through its very own culture.
