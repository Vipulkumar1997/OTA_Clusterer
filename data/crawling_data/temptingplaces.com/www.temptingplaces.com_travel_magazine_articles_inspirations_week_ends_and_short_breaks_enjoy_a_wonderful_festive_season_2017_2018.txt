Enjoy a wonderful Festive Season 2017-2018

Christmas and New Year Eve in Paris, Bordeaux, Florence, Mexico and Cape Town















Cities are changing as the holiday season approaches. The monuments are illuminated, the decorations adorn the streets. Christmas markets, carousels and a host of other activities and events are set up for the enjoyment of all. Here are our tips for enjoying the holidays in the most beautiful cities in the world.

PARIS

The City of Light is even better named as the end of the year is approaching. The department store windows come to life, the Christmas markets perfume the streets of scents of spices and chocolate, everything is more wonderful!
Joyeux Noel and Happy Holidays!

Christmas mustgoes

The illuminations
From November to early January, the Christmas lights of the Champs-Elysées Avenue, Avenue Montaigne, Place Vendôme, the Montmartre district, Bercy Village and many other places in the city make Paris more magical than ever!

The department store windows
The showcases at Galeries Lafayettes, Printemps Haussman and BHV are truly animated shows that appeal to both young and older!

The most beautiful Christmas markets
This is the place to buy gifts or indulge with a treat, a wine or a hot chocolate. Here are 2 original Christmas markets in Paris:


Enchanting: Christmas in the Stars is the Christmas village of Les Halles with more than 70 chalets (crafts, decoration, gastronomy), but also entertainment (workshops, letter to Santa Claus …), an Enchanted Forest , a Hanging Forest and Santa’s House!
When: From November 27 to December 31, 2017
Where: Châtelet – Les Halles – 1st Arrondissement

Vegan: A fully vegan Christmas market to find ethical Christmas gifts and vegetarian Christmas dishes.
When: December 16-17, 2017
Where: The REcyclerie – 83 boulevard Ornano, Paris 18th


Holiday activities in Paris
The ice rinks at the Champs de Mars Christmas Village and the Forum des Halles
The ferris wheel of the Place de la Concorde
The special Christmas opening of the Museum of Arts Forains,

To celebrate the New Year
If you wish to attend the countdown to the new year in the crowd head for the traditional Champs Elysees. From 9pm party-goers start to flock to the famous avenue. The Eiffel Tower sparkles on the stroke of midnight. From 23:30 to 23:50, a video-morphing show will be screened on the Arc de Triomphe.
The avenue will be pedestrian from 23:00 until 1 January at 18:00.
More confidential but equally wonderful The Place du Sacré-Coeur in Montmartre is another favorite place to change year.

The parade
There will be a Grand Parade on the Champs-Elysées to celebrate the first day of the year with a carnival and fanfares.
When: January 1st, 2018
Where: Avenue des Champs-Élysées – From the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, Paris

BORDEAUX
Bordeaux is an epicurean town that likes to party, eat well and drink well. Especially during the end-of-year celebrations. A good time to visit one of the best destinations of the year according to the Los Angeles Times.

Christmas mustgoes

The carousels of the Allée de Tourny
From November 24, two carousels will delight children on the Allée de Tourny. Santa will be there too! He will wait for the children in his chalet for the traditional photo.

Christmas market
The 23rd edition of the Christmas market in Bordeaux, opens its doors from November 24 to December 26.
This year, the animations will be again at the rendezvous at Ludi’Land! A ski simulator, the Betty Blues theater troupe and a snowy forest await you in this covered space!

FLORENCE
The Christmas holidays are like in many countries an important moment for the Florentines and the Italians in general. It is December 8 that begins the Christmas holidays in Florence where we then celebrate the Immaculate Conception. Families buy and decorate their Christmas tree and participate in the construction of the nativity cene.

Christmas mustgoes


On the 8th of December Piazza del Duomo becomes the heart of the festivities for the Florentines, this is where the big Christmas tree is erected. Let the festivities begin !!! This event officially marks the beginning of the festivities. In the cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore, a monumental crib represents the nativity. The santons used come from Impruneta where a craftsman works terracotta to give life to these statues on a human scale.

The largest Christmas market takes place in Santa Croce Square.

The ice rink is yours near the place della Liberta. You can rent your skates and protections on site.

Christmas Mass
We recommend of course to attend the Christmas Mass in the Cathedral of Florence, celebrated by the Cardinal of Florence.
To celebrate the New Year
Numerous concerts are organized in different squares of the city on December 31st.
A great concert of classical music is also given on Piazza della Signora.


MEXICO
Santa does not exist for Mexicans, it is Jesus in person who brings the gifts on December 25 in the morning. Mexico Christmas is a very religious and family celebration are on for 9 days, from December 16th to 24th.

Christmas mustgoes
The Posadas are the traditional Christmas celebrations. They take place during each of the nine nights before Christmas, and celebrate the journey of Mary and Joseph to Bethlehem and their search for a posada (inn). The celebration begins with a procession that will go to a different house each night. Participants hold candles and sing Christmas carols. Those who are in the house respond with another song. The goal is to meet family but also spend time with close friends

For New Year’s Eve in Mexico City

The end of the year this famous around the street festival of Zocalo district.
Firecrackers, fireworks, Bengal lights … At midnight, everyone shouts: “Feliz año nuevo!”, hug and fire firecrackers. According to tradition, eat twelve grapes as the clock sounds midnight on the 31st, while you eat every grape make a wish for the new year.

CAPE TOWN

The holiday season in Cape Town means the sun is replacing the snow and the bikinis are replacing the warm coats! The majority of the Cape population is Christian, so you will find here many Christian traditions.

Christmas must-goes


The holiday season in Cape Town will begin on December 3, 2017. The Grand Parade will begin at 4 pm and the official opening of the festival, with the lighting of the Christmas lights by the Mayor, should take place at 8:30 pm. The show will include laser displays and fireworks. This is the largest free outdoor public event in the country. Some of South Africa’s best artists such as Freshlyground, Jimmy Nevis and Craig Lukas will be part of the streetparty. Do not miss it if you are in town.

Starting on Christmas Eve, Sunday, December 24, many local music groups will take to the streets of downtown, entertaining visitors and locals with popular Christmas carols.

Plan to listen to Christmas songs at one of the wonderful Carols by Candlelight Concerts. Festive atmosphere guaranteed!

The V & A Waterfront is beautifully decorated and free concerts are held at the Amphitheater. There is also the ferris wheel which is great for having a stunning view of the harbor and Table Mountain.

Go through the beautifully illuminated Adderley Street. Private homes are also often brilliantly decorated, especially in the suburbs of Bothasig.


Celebrate the New Year in Cape Town

The Waterfront is the perfect neighborhood, the best “all-in-one” with live music, restaurants for dinner, dancing, fireworks and many parties you can do on foot!
