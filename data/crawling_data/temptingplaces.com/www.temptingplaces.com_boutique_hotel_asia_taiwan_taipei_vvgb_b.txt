An exclusive and intimate boutique hotel in the heart of Taipei

VVG BB + B, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a charming and surprising boutique hotel located in the heart of Taipei. With only 2 suites it is one of those addresses we like to preciously keep to ourselves. It is a whole lifestyle concept: one hôtel, three restaurants (Bistro, Action and Thinking), a bookstore (Something) and a Arty and DIY boutique (Chiffon). This tiny hotel is a tranquil get-away combining European sophistication with exquisite Chinese antique and well-located in the centre of the vibrant capital of Taiwan.

The Destination

Taipei's must-do's

The National Museum of Taiwan and Palace of Taipei is a landmark not to be missed: it hosts the largest collection in the world of Chinese art-work (a historical consequence).

The Taipei 101 tower is, at this time of writing, the tallest building of the world with its 511 meters high and is a monument of national pride demonstrating technological mastery of Taiwanese industry. We recommend an evening or night visit as the nocturnal views of the capital and its lights are simply amazing.

Other interesting places are the Chang Kai-Shek memorial and its park (a favourite tai-chi training spot for Taipei citizens), the Taoist temple of Paoan, and the Lungshan temple located nearby to the night market and especially beautiful at nightfall.

The hotel experience


A warm and refined experience

The decoration of the VVG BB + B successfully mixes ancient Chinese furniture, accumulated over years of travels, with sleek European sophistication and this combination results in a truly refreshing and refined fusion experience. The combination of black and white mosaics of the bathrooms with Chinese figurines, nineteen thirties' hairdresser, crystal chandeliers, and the contrast of the white bricks wall with velour English seats, results in a delightfully cosy and comfortable ambience with a colonial touch.

The suites open-up on a small inside garden.

The Evon suite (50m²) mixes various tones of beige, grey, and black, and has a living room with a velvet couch and ancient armchairs. The bedroom hosts an eighteenth-century style king-size bed and two twentieth-century styled single beds. The bathroom has ancient copper plumbing.

The June suite (66m²) is a London Library style fills with over 1000 books!





The Tempting Experience:

Enjoy the extraordinary cuisine of Chef Fancia, trained by the very best chefs of Europe and Asia. An exceptional voyage for your senses…
