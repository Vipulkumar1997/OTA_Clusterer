The charm of the 50's

The Platine Hotel, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, guarantees its guests a rather magical stay. Located near the Eiffel Tower, in Paris’ 15th arrondissement, the discreet façade of this four star boutique hotel gives no indication of its luxurious interior designed by Vincent Bastie as a journey through Hollywood’s Golden Era and thus celebrating the glamorous Marilyn Monroe. From rooms dedicated to the elegant star to an irresistible diner for breakfast time, no detail has been left aside. This unique décor is sure to seduce travelers looking for out-of-the-ordinary memories. With three tube stations nearby, it will prove a perfect start point to explore the City of Lights.





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary upgrade (upon availabilities)
- Complimentary glass of wine per person

The Destination

Beaugrenelle area

It only takes a few minutes from the hotel to reach the Seine, a lovely opportunity to take a stroll (or cycle) along the river. Start with the Ile aux cygnes, less known by tourists, a very pleasant green space with… a replica of the Statue of Liberty! Leaving the island, you will be a few minutes away from the hypnotising Eiffel Tower and the Musée Branly, a formidable journey through the arts of Africa, Oceania, Asia and the Americas. Near the hotel is the brand new Beaugrenelle shopping centre and you will find many cafés and restaurants in the area.

The hotel experience


A luxurious boutique hotel dedicated to Marilyn

The transition from normal life to Hollywood starts as soon as you push the entrance door. Forget the outside world: the light is softer here, the vibrant colour palette inspired by the 50’s. In the bar, grey is contrasted with a sharp peacock blue and canary yellow while the breakfast room adopts a balance of mint green and candy pink. The atmosphere is simply, irresistibly, wonderfully cheerful.

Should you find yourself alone in the lift, take a chance to answer Marilyn’s lines. Indeed, her most famous scenes are played on a screen 24/7. You might find yourself missing your floor a few times! The corridors on each level are adorned with a kaleidoscope of film posters and photos retracing her life.

The 46 rooms of the hotel are declined around specific colours and themes: a sweet powder pink, Hollywood style gold, a bright red... Each is thought as a miniature stage with you as the main actor. Original touches have been added to the décor – giant roses on the carpet, lamps shaped as movie projectors, a confetti effect on the curtains, memories of an Oscar ceremony. A very clever lighting setting really brings forward textures and little details. In most rooms, Marilyn Monroe will watch over you as you dream away, a giant photo of her decorating one of the walls. The bathrooms are beautifully tiled and lit with vibrant colours, bringing a voluptuous boudoir effect.

Good to know: the Superior Rooms come with a comfortable round bed while some of the Deluxe Rooms have their own balcony.





The Tempting Experience:

A breakfast like no other, Hollywood style


This Hollywood dream continues at breakfast time, in a 50’s style American diner framed by New-York city lights. The scene seems to belong to a movie – tiled black and white floor, pink and green for the curved banquettes and table. It simply feels like a romantic scene is about to be played. An indeed, you can choose seats inspired the customised ones found on film sets. Will you be Grant, Curtis, Gable…?

The Services


Lounge
The hotel lounge recreates the elegance of the 50's to absolute perfection. There is something about that dimmed lighting, this harmony of colours, these lovely contrasts of textures and patterns that simply calls for sitting down in the comfortable and arty armchairs with a cocktail in hand. The breakfast space opens onto a little garden in the summer.
Spa & Wellness
Nothing better to conclude a Parisian day beautifully than to relax in a hammam or a sauna. The Platine Hotel has both, luxuriously decorated. Nearby even is a massage room where you can choose of the treatments provided the Omnisens Institute.
