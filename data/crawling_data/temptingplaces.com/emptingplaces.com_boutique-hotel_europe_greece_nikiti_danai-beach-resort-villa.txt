The Destination

The Sithonia peninsula in Halkidiki

How beautiful, the turquoise waters of the Sithonia peninsula! Nikiti, two steps away from the hotel, and Ormos Panagias, are two of the most beautiful villages of Halkidiki. It`s impossible not to fall under the charm of the sublime Karydi beach, south of Vourvourou, which offers to its visitors crystal clear water surrounded by white sand, shadowed by the nearby pines.
Go visit the Toroni fortress or pass through Sarti and Neas Marmaras to do some shopping. And lastly, don`t miss the exploration of Porto Koufo, a tiny picturesque port in the western part of the peninsula.
What are you waiting for? Come visit one of Greece`s best-kept secrets!

The hotel experience


A timeless and glamorous luxury hotel in Greece

The lobby is decorated in vivid tones, with a fiery red Versace sofa as the room`s centerpiece. The interior decor is a successful blend of Rococo and Georgian style furniture, magnificent marbles, fine Italian fabrics and some contemporary design hints that create a timeless and glamorous atmosphere.

Each of the 60 luxury villas and suites offers original decor characterized by luxurious details such as a Missoni bedspread, a Ming vase, or an ancient four-poster bed.
With bright white walls, mirror games, glass office desks, crystal vases and luminous marble that sparkle under the sun light, the Danai is like a multi-faceted diamond. The balconies and terraces are decorated with armchairs and canopy beds to make the most of the superb view over the Aegean Sea apparent through the pines.

For a honeymoon, choose without hesitation the Executive Pool Suite! The picture windows opens onto a terrace with heated pool, overhanging the Aegean Sea, for fabulous oceanview wake-ups.
Families will prefer a Danai Villa. With a living room area, 2 bedrooms and bathrooms, it is sufficiently spacious. Best of all, its private pool will please both children and adults .





The Tempting Experience:

The Maria Callas night on the beach


The Danai Resort pays tribute to the Greek soprano Maria Callas by offering on each full moon night, a Callas evening on the beach. The Seaside Bar installs tables, carpet and large pillows on the sand and the music slowly accompanies the rhythm of the waves while you savor a glass of champagne or a cocktail, with the diva`s seductive and stunning voice as background. Magic is the right word to describe all this.
