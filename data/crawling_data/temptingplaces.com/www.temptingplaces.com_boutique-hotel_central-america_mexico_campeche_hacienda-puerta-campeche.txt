The Hacienda Puerta Campeche, a Mexican boutique hotel

The Hacienda Puerta Campeche, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is composed of many 17th century colonial buildings and is strategically located in the centre of the beautiful city of Campeche, a UNESCO world heritage site. This boutique hotel recreates the « belle époque » of Southeast Mexico.

The atmosphere, style, and vibrant Mexican colors transport you into the world of regional folklore. If you let yourself sink into one of the relaxing cotton-woven hammocks and close your eyes, you can easily imagine yourself thrown back to the Campeche of a couple of centuries ago.

The 15 rooms and suites have been thought through down to the finest details - and this consideration of the little things will make your stay exceptional. And though you are in the centre of the city, fear not: the gardens of the hacienda are a haven of peace and the swimming pool will surprise you with its secret alcoves and open windows...





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary neck & shoulders massage for 2 persons (Length: 15 min)
- 25% coupon on SPA treatments

The Destination

Campeche, UNESCO world heritage site

The Hacienda Puerta Campeche is located in the city centre and is thus the ideal starting point to discover the city -- a UNESCO world heritage site.

The fortifications were built by Martin Torre for Emperor Charles II of Spain in 1680 and served to protect the city from invasions: the city, during the "Golden Age" was prone to attacks from pirates, privateers, and filibusters of all sorts. Campeche rapidly grew into one of the important cities of the Caribbean New Spain and the city prospered.

Today, it is a pleasure to walk along the paved streets, bordered by colonial houses painted in vivid colors or stroll around the beautiful port. You can visit churches, houses,  bastions...

But the Mayan sites are not that far and those who love archaeology may want to make a trip to the ancient Mayan sites of Edzna, Calakmul, or Balamkú.

The hotel experience


A bright and fresh hacienda

Wooden mahogany doors, floors with rust-colored Mayan tiles, orange and yellow walls ... the local and relaxed atmosphere of the hacienda will immediately put you at ease.

The rooms were fully restored in original buildings and are decorated in traditional Mayan style with 5.4 meter high ceilings, exposed beams and rafters, cool tiled floors, and very comfortable beds.

You can choose to stay in a superior room, junior suite, deluxe suite, or governor`s suite.

Some of the junior suites have glass-roofed ceilings above a day bed offering an incredible luminosity during the day and absolute romance when the stars come out!

The governor`s suite is oversized and allows for total intimacy with its large teak terrace which is ideally suited for intimate sunbathing.





The Tempting Experience:

Luxury and finesse, a historical tradition


At the end of the 18th century, Campeche was one of Mexico`s richest regions. The Hacienda Puerta Campeche was called "La Casa Guerrero" and was formed of the Guerrero house, a storage area, and offices. The house was actually a luxury store that sold the finest goods imported straight from Europe!

In the 19th century conflict broke out in the city: the Mayans rebelled and one governor rose up against another. Campeche was sacked and devastated. However, the Hacienda Puerta Campeche was recently fully renovated with style and authenticity, and the addition of modern comfort turned it into a luxury heritage boutique hotel. It has also preserved the long-ingrained sense of quality, personalized attention, and spirit of this large traditional house.
