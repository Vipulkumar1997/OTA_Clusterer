The Destination

Machu Picchu

The hotel entrance is 3 minutes away from bus stop where you can board to the citadel of Machu Picchu, one of the wonders of the world. Built by the Incas in the late fourteenth century, the site had virtually disappeared beneath vegetation before being discovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911.

The hotel experience


More than simply a boutique hotel

Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel was conceived, designed and built by Jose Koechlin so that visitors of Machu Picchu will be spared the requirement to return by train on the same day to go back to Cusco. At the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, you can find the same Inca citadel environment you are attracted to. As the Incas 500 years before them, the team of Jose Koechlin started from scratch to design the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel with the materials of the region, so that the guest is immersed in this Inca atmosphere but can also benefit  from the natural biodiversity, beauty, tranquillity, and the mystical cloud forest of Cusco.

Guests follow the paved path to their room which is located in a one or two storey cottage, covered with lime. Some of the cottages overlook the garden of orchids, the others being located near the Vilcanota river, unless you choose to stay in a Inkaterra Suite which enjoys a private garden and a covered terrace. All cottages known as "casitas" have a sitting area or a separate lounge to relax or eat near the fireplace. The bathrooms are spacious and if you are staying in one of the larger suites you will also have a shower and a garden bench. The rooms are furnished in a colonial style and for environmental concerns, your sheets are made of 100% cotton, the Inkaterra Machu Picchu Andean slippers are made with recycled materials and a complete set of toiletries have been hand selected to respect the environment.

The property covers almost 5 miles of natural paths where guests can observe the fauna and flora, such as the 372 species of orchids, 180 species of birds and 111 kinds of butterflies.





The Tempting Experience:

A conservationist hotel


Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel is a paradise Hotel located in the forest where you can not only explore the Inca culture and Andean nature, but also you can participate in the fight against global warming and its natural balance. Hence, You will become a true ecotourist ...
