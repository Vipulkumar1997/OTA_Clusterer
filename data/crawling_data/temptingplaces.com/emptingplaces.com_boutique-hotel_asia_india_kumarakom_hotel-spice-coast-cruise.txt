A boutique hotel on the water

Spice Cost Cruises, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a fabulous concept that offers you the possibility to navigate with charm the backwaters of Kerala in India, for 24 hours or more. You will board a private houseboat with a crew, and enjoy the calm canals and Lake Vembandad. The pace of peaceful navigation allows you to soak up life on the water or on the banks of the lake: a villager who goes to the market, children coming home from school, birds fishing, cows... A magical vacation for travelers who`ve been waiting for a fresh combination of dreams, relaxation, and ecology.

The Destination

Lake Vembanad

The lake Vembanad covers an area of 1512km2 between the Arabian Sea and Fort Cochin, where it later joins the backwaters. Canals connect it to other lakes in the north and south and several rivers flow into it. It`s a place of ecological diversity, a unique paradise of migratory birds and waterfowl and habitat for shrimp. Take time to explore the lake and the extraordinary adventure it offers.

The hotel experience


The Kettuvallam, cruise ancestral backwaters

At 55 km from Cochin, take a seat aboard a Kettuvallam, a boat typical of the backwaters of Kerala. These boats are made of wood and coir ropes covered with bamboo and palm leaves. They were once used to transport goods and now have been converted into a floating hotel.
Relax comfortably on silk cushions in the deck of the boat. It`s a unique opportunity to discover a landscape of great beauty: vast expanses of water, rice and aquatic plants (lilies, hyacinths and lotus), not to mention the wildlife (buffalo, dragonflies, waders ...)

The inhabitants of the inland lakes have specially adapted to this environment and live in modest houses built on narrow strips of land surrounded by water, sailing from one bank to another on various boats, barges, boat-buses, canoes etc. At various times of the day you will come across them, going about their business. You can also see the Chinese nets, Hindu temples, and the minaret of a mosque or churches.

At the end of the day, the kettuvalam stops on the lake for a magical night. The colors are more vibrant and fade gently. It`s the time when animals go to bed, so light the candles and spend time in the moonlight listening to the sound of crickets.





The Tempting Experience:

Live to the rhythm of the backwaters


Welcome to the region called in Malayalam (language of Kerala) "land of little men", perhaps in reference to the people of the backwaters who are often spotted partially submerged in water. On the boat Spice Coast Cruises, you will sail in the heart of the backwaters where you can enjoy the local life over the water.
