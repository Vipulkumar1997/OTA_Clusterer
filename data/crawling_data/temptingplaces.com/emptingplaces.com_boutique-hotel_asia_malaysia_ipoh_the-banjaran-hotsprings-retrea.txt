The Destination

The region of Ipoh

As explorers, don`t miss an excursion to the region`s many caves. The Gua Tempurung cave, one of the biggest and most impressive ones, is definitely worth the trip!
If you still have energy after exploring the tropical jungle, head towards the Menglembu hills for a revitalizing trek: from the top, you`ll have an absolutely breathtaking view over the forest and villages.

The hotel experience


An invitation to wellbeing in a natural spa

Blue, green, brown, ochre... The colors of nature come together at The Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat, which blends in perfectly with its postcard-worthy surroundings. This unique, natural spa is totally focused on environmental consciousness thanks to its independent hydro system, which diffuses thermal water throughout the whole complex and helps irrigate the surrounding nature as well.

Lacquered wood floor, precious wood ceiling, natural thatched roofs, cozy designer furniture, teak sliding doors to get to the sumptuous bathroom... It`s hard to resist these charming interiors, characterized by elegant Asian touches, offering modern comfort too: Wifi, mini-bar, Jacuzzi and LCD screen.

You can choose between two different luxury villas types:
For privileged relaxing moments, opt for a Water Villa, very intimate with its own interior thermal water pond and a magical view over the canal.
The Garden Villa is perfect for fresh air lovers with its large open-air patio overlooking the gardens, its sublime small pool, supplied daily with thermal spring water and its outdoor shower.





The Tempting Experience:

Crystal caves for alternative therapies


Since decades minerals are used for their energizing and purifying properties. At The Banjaran Hotsprings Retreat you`ll have the opportunity to test minerals beneficial effects in one of the amethyst or crystal caves. In here, Reiki is practiced, with minerals working as conductors for this treatment methodology focused on the energy diffusion. An original treatment that will help you return home feeling better than ever!
