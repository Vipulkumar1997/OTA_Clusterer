The Destination

Cape Town

The beautiful landscapes make the road to Cape Town a trip on its own! From the Colona Castle you will be in less than half an hour at the gates of this great metropolis of the southern hemisphere. Founded in 1652 by Dutch immigrants, the city has still in some neighborhoods, the indolent charm of a province city. Cape Town is renowned for its Victorian and colonial architecture known as Cape Dutch. Stroll through the neighborhoods of Constantia and along Long Street to admire old houses. Those of you wishing to shop should go to Adderley Street!

Another typical area of the city due to its aligned houses with pastel colors and their minarets, is Bo-Kaap, malay neighbored of the 17th century. Bo-Kaap, Malay-Museum is situated in Wale Street.

Cape Town has the privilege to be situated between ocean and mountains. You can enjoy the beautiful panoramic view of Cape Town by accessing Table Mountain (1087 m) by cable or by hiking (about 3 hours).

The hotel experience


Mediterranean house and colonial heritage

Enter into a family home of The Cape area that has been furnished with taste and refinement. Antique furnitures, silver candlesticks, collection of ancient vases, paintings of the 18th, sparkling chandeliers. There is an incredible view from every window.

The 5 suites and 3 luxury rooms of the Colona Castle are decorated in an original manner. The Mogul suite exhibits art objects that seems to arrive directly from the treasury of an Indian prince. Light wood furniture, animal skin prints, tribal statues give The Safari Suite an "Out Of Africa" ambience. The Moroccan room will seduce Rihad fans, with its faded colors. The Chinese Room will transport you to Asia with its lacquered furnitures and wall prints. For those of you who want an colonial England atmosphere, The English and Green rooms will welcome you in floral drapes, rich fabrics and luxurious carpets.

The Penthouse is our favorite with its 360° terrace overlooking the Bay. The charm of The New Room and its private patio also tempted us with its mixture of pure marble, glass design and South African furniture.





The Tempting Experience:

A 360° view dominating the Cape


Majestic mountains, sparkling lakes and pristine beaches of the Atlantic Ocean -  the view from Colona Castle is amazing from every angle. A panoramic view worth the greatest movies from the Table Mountain to the Lake Sandvlei passing by the surrounding vineyards, the South African nature will take your breath away!
