A boutique hotel inspired by the Naga Myths

The Hotel De Naga, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located in the Chiang Mai region of northern Thailand.  Far from the hustle and bustle of the city, this charming boutique hotel blends traditional Thai design with modern architecture, offering a stylish stay with excellent service.
De Naga‘s decoration is inspired by ancient myths. The avatars of Naga, the mythological creature who often presents herself in the shape of a serpent, are to be found in every one of the hotel`s 55 bedrooms: on statues, along the stairs or on doors.
Whether traveling as a couple or a family, you will be transported to a mythical world by the legends and traditions of the hotel.

The Destination

A few days in Chiang Mai

Chiang Mai, also known as "the Rose of the North", is famous for its cultural heritage, craft, and natural surroundings. A visit to ancient temples is fascinating. You should visit the Wat Phra Sing Temple which dates from the middle of the XIV century but also discover a 500 year old Buddha at Wat Suan Dock. At Wat Chedi Luang you will see the biggest Chedi of Chiang Mai, a bronze statue of 98 meters high and 54 meters wide. You may also visit Dont Wat Saen Fang and Wat U-mong...

We also recommend a visit to the Chiang Mai National Museum which highlights Northern Thai art. For other activities you may go the zoo and visit Doi Pui, a tribal village.

Chiang Mai is also an ideal region for an adventurous journey: elephant trekking, rafting or trekking across the jungle.

The hotel experience


Rooms in Thai silk

Upon your arrival you will be impressed by the local architecture of the hotel. Teak wood,Thai silk, tapestries, and green and red drapes give the interiors its cozy atmosphere.
The statues, the paintings, the gildings and even doorknobs carved into animal shapes, symbollize the Naga, a creature who represents strength, opulence, and eternal life.

In each room, above the bed, there is a gorgeous Naga art piece. In the only suite of the hotel a huge golden Naga snake spreads out along the headboard. Each bathroom, with shower or bath, is decorated in the same style with authentic wood and warm colours.

This unusual mansion opens out onto a patio with a swimming pool and a few loungechairs where you may relax. At dusk enjoy a glass of wine on the terrace from the Lovers Court`s large selection.





The Tempting Experience:

Peace and Thai legends


The hotel De Naga will take you on a journey through time, myths, and legends. Lose yourself in the traditional decoration: golden dragons, snakes carved into the walls, or along the stairs, red lanterns...
Close your eyes and you will be transported to another world !
