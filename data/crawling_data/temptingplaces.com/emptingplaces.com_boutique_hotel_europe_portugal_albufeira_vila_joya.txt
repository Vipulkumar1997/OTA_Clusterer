A Garden of Eden in Portugal

Vila Joya, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, means "House of Joy”or “Jewelry Box” in the original translation – a name certainly deserved by this boutique hotel set in the beautiful Portuguese region of the Algarve, a mere half hour drive from Faro airport. The former private villa has been converted into a luxury hotel in elegant Moorish style, overlooking the ocean. The endless views over the seaside landscape, the lush garden, the two Michelin starred restaurant, the private beach and the spa promise a feast for all senses. If you are looking for an exquisite getaway, intimate service and breathtaking views, search no more: Vila Joya will steal your heart.

The Destination

The Faro region

The Algarve and Faro are well known for their exquisite beaches but do take time to visit the pretty white villages dotted around. Their timeless atmosphere is sure to delight you. The walk along the ramparts of the castle in Silves is a must-do for history lovers. Loulé is renowned for its Saturday morning market, bringing together the whole region. Monchique, perched on a mountain, guarantees a breathtaking view. Yet the most spectacular itinerary is probably going from Alferce down to Fornalhas and Monchique, crossing a mountain landscape of wooded valleys and hills. Magical views await.

The hotel experience


Experience the best of the Algarve

Vila Joya is located in a residential area on the steep southern coast of the Algarve. Past the entrance gate, you find yourself in an exotic garden filled with palm trees and bougainvillea, fragrant with jasmine. A real paradise… From there, you can even hear the soothing sound of the waves washing up on the Praia de Gale beach.

This boutique hotel blends classical touches with a warm contemporary luxury style.
The stunning ocean view can be enjoyed from any of the 14 rooms and 8 suites (some with their own private pool) yet the most spectacular one is from the Deluxe Terrace Room. The large windows face both south and west, immersing you totally in the landscape. Each room of the hotel is decorated in a unique style, with the bathrooms finding inspiration from the local azulejos.

The suites rival in luxury. For the most romantic stay, you might want to go for the Royal Suite and its cozy private Jacuzzi. The Master Deluxe Royal Suite however has its own private pool overlooking the ocean.






The Tempting Experience:

Try the 22nd best restaurant in the world


Not only has Chef Dieter Koschina earned two Michelin stars for his high quality cuisine at Vila Joya, he has placed the restaurant at 22nd best in the world. This Austrian culinary genius combines local products and Northern European techniques in the most brilliant way. Expect original recipes such as bacalau with beetroot and yogurt coulis… Even the most demanding gourmets will be wowed.
