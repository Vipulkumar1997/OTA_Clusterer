The Destination

Jamaica`s Blue Mountains

The Blue Mountains are Jamaica`s longest mountain range, laced with rough rivers, streams and waterfalls. The mountainsides are covered with coffee fields, producing a blended brew that is among the leading exports of Jamaica. For nature lovers, the mountains reveal an astonishingly complex series of ecosystems that change radically as you climb from sea level to the fog-shrouded peaks. The 192,000-acre Blue Mountain John Crow Mountain National Park is a vast area of scenic beauty representing a real Garden of Eden.

The hotel experience


A luxury heritage retreat

In the 18th century, the Strawberry Hill was a coffee plantation deeded by the British Royal Family to Earl Horace Walpole. It then became a tea plantation and was bought by Chris Blackwell in 1972, the founder of Island Record, famous musical label which launched the career of iconic Bob Marley.

Strawberry Hill`s 12 deluxe cottages respect the proportions, materials and craftsmanship of authentic 19th century Caribbean design. The hotel won many awards acclaiming its`s respect of heritage architecture and respect of its surroundings. Each room is individually handcrafted with local Jamaican artworks and photographs. Royal Hut fabrics and quality linens complement the dark mahogany furniture and the four-poster beds, draped with a delicate canopy of muslin nest, creating an atmosphere of peaceful home.

We had a crush on the luxurious Deluxe HighGate Villa. This truly majestic double-story villa (3,000 sq. ft.) with 2 bedrooms, a dining room, sitting room, kitchen, visitor`s bathroom and balconies that wrap around both floors, is perfect to enjoy in all comfort the sublime Jamaican indigenous fauna and flora, a true feast for all senses!





The Tempting Experience:

Jamaican natural living experience with reggae


It all begins at the hotel`s check-in: recover from your journey with an island-fresh juice and warm towels gently laced with organic aromas, soothing Reggae music and the balmy Caribbean breeze. Once settled into your scenic room, you are invited to experience your first Strawberry Hill Living Elemental Nature session. This session, based on the 5 elements, helps to identify your Elemental Nature, and allow the hotel`s team to guide you and to enhance your stay.
