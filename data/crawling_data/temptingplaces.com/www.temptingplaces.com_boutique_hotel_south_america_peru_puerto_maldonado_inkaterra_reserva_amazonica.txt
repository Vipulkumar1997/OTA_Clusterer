The Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica: a boutique hotel in the jungle

Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is an ecological boutique hotel located in the rainforest of southern Peru, near the Tambopata National Reserve on the banks of the Madre de Dios river. This isolated and wild region is known as the capital of Peru`s biodiversity. Nonetheless, it is easily accessible by plane from Cusco in just 25 minutes. Staying at the Reserva Amazonica constitutes a great opportunity for adults just as for children to discover an amazing fauna and flora.

The hotel does not recommend bringing children under the ages of 5. But children between 6 and 12 years will be delighted, with their kit explorer, to choose from the various activities on offer : the Butterflies House, the Farm, the canopy and the pontoons of the wetlands, Sandoval lake  ...

The Destination

The Inkaterra universe

The Inkaterra group is a hotel group that has developed many activities and actions around the Amazon Reserve:

A canopy is used to walk on the treetops and the bridges over the jungle of the private ecological Inkaterra reserve. The canopy is considered one of the most modern and sophisticated of its type in the world due to its design that seemlessly blends with nature itself.

The path of the Anaconda is a 200m wooden bridge crossing the wetlands used for discovering and learning about nature, biodiversity and wildlife ...

Peru is home to many species of butterflies in the world. 20%, or 3.700 species, have been identified in Peru. For this reason the Inkaterra offers you the opportunity to interact with the private world of these colorful creatures in the "Butterfly House".

The hotel experience


Luxury in the heart of nature

The  Reserva Amazonica welcomes you with its 35 "cabanas" (cottages) each of which is elevated, roofed with traditional thatch, and built in the Ese`eja indigenous style around the main building that merges with the jungle. By the light of lanterns and the sound of the jungle, you will appreciate even more the luxurious furniture and the delicious cuisine of the place.

The 35 Reserva Amazonica villas are divided into 4 categories: with or without terrace, adjacent to the river, or adjacent to the nearby jungle. All suites have a beautiful white bed, under a "mosquito net canopy", which rises or declines, and beautiful atmospheric lanterns ... Romance and authenticity seeps out from every corner of these rooms ... You can also relax in the lounge or roll away your time in a traditional hammock .... The rooms have wooden furniture, a wooden floor, and are very airy.





The Tempting Experience:

Vision of a genuine


Staying at Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica is entering a world in itself ... A world that has always existed, but which is unknown to us, a wild world that we see from the top of a canopy or from a boat ... Two-thirds of all known plants and animal species are found in this magic jungle and scientists believe that there still remain hundreds of millions to be discovered.
