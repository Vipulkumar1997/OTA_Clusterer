A boutique hotel with the prestige of a 18th century colonial plantation house

The Hacienda San José, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, located east of Mérida in the Yucatan region, has been a colonial plantation house since the 18th century. Initially built during fast and prosperous times, the hacienda ended up in dire condition after enduring times of hardship and Mexican social conflict. The hacienda was therefore an ideal challenge for the architects to transform into a heritage and luxury boutique hotel.

The restoration works preserved the authenticity of the colonial house while simultaneously complementing it with modern comforts. The architects remodeled and added spaces to accentuate the hacienda`s original elements and architecture.

The Hacienda San Jose is hidden in an exceptional site with lush tropical vegetation and immerged in absolute tranquility. The impressive courtyard and building`s pastel blue façade is surrounded by colorful gardens, grass lawns, and fruit orchards.

It is an ideal location to practice siesta and relaxation in a traditional, cotton-woven, hammock or at the side of the pool. But also to enjoy romantic dinners for two and to discover the ancient and contemporary Mayan culture with the nearby archaeological site of Chichén Itzá.

The hotel experience


Taste the colonial past in a luxuriously restored hacienda

The rooms are located around the impressive courtyard which immerses guests in the atmosphere of the past. The 15 suites and rooms have access to private gardens and private plunge pools.

Inside, the suites are simply but elegantly decorated with wooden beds, ceramic basins, and natural materials. The hacienda has retained its traditional Yucatan hacienda decorative elements such as high ceilings, heavy wooden doors, thick walls, and cool tiled floors. Amenities like cable TV, MP3 player, and air conditioning ensure a perfectly modern and comfortable stay.





The Tempting Experience:

Under the sign of the Mayas


Start by reserving the "Villa Maya": a suite combining traditional Mayan architecture with a high level of comfort and luxurious amenities that will meet the needs of the most demanding guests. Then treat yourself to a Maya massage at the Hacienda`s Mayan spa which uses natural regional products such as honey, royal jelly, clay, and aloe vera. Why not try out the "Maya energizing massage" consisting of ancient Mayan massage techniques and mystique rituals.

Finally, visit the numerous nearby Mayan sites. All are extraordinary though we do highlight the renowned Chichén Itzá. The most ancient part of this pyramid called "old Chichén" dates from the 6th century and combines the Puuc and Chenes styles.
