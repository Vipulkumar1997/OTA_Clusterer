Clarum 101: a stylish and cosmopolitan boutique hotel

The Clarum 101, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located in the "Chapala" neighborhood of Chapalita, the second city of Mexico, and has no sign or plaque at its entrance. Its doors are, however, always open to those in the know ... seasoned travelers for business or pleasure. This boutique hotel`s 9 rooms and friendly staff provide highly personalized service.

The very popular 260 m² terrace is the ideal place to relax with a drink. Socialize with other guests and customers who may talk about the Clarum 101`s tapas that go so well with the wine list or about the impressive selection of teas.

The architects have used polished cement, aluminum, and wood to create a hip and stylish atmosphere. The style is definitively minimalist with an abundance of white, livened up by fine and delicate color touches of the fabrics, furniture details, designer objects, and local artwork and paintings.

A discreet boutique hotel that takes exclusivity and privacy seriously!





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary bottle of Tequila from the "Clarum 101"
- Complimentary upgrade (upon availabilities)

The Destination

Guadalajara

Its name means "river that flows between the stones" Guadalajara was founded in 1542. With an ideal climate its parks are in blossom all year. It is nick-named "the City of Roses".

Guadalajara is considered to be the cradle of several symbols of Mexican culture such as the charrería, the mariachi, TAPATIO liqueur, and tequila.

Take a walk and enjoy the beautiful and historic religious architecture, particularly the Cabañas Hospice, decorated with murals by José Clemente Orozco and now added to the UNESCO list of Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

In the historic center you can visit the Cathedral and the Degollado Theater, a monumental 19th century building.

The hotel experience


Exclusive rooms in a design hotel

The common spaces are styled for design and comfort. Relax with a drink and a snack on the patio amongst the shades of white on stylish, wooden outdoor furniture. Or try out the dining room with its very intimate atmosphere and oriental decoration. You can also enjoy a casual lunch in the lobby, styled with glass and marble.

The 6 rooms and 3 suites are uniform, yet very different from each other. They aspire to making you feel even better than at home: for example, relaxing on a Le Corbusier sofa to watch a DVD on the flat screen, in a serene environment...

One of the 3 suites has a private terrace, a quiet and intimate environment to escape the bustling city. If you are in Guadalajara for business, you will appreciate that every room has a desk and free wifi.





The Tempting Experience:

A very select hotel on a nice street


Clarum 101 is the stop for a chic clientele, largely because it is located on the prettiest street in Guadalajara: Parque Juan Diego. And after a walk in the city you will be delighted to taste the martinis and have a tea that created the esteemed reputation of Clarum 101!







Classifications & Awards
