The Destination

Simeulue and Medan

Simeulue is an Indonesian island, situated 150 km from the northwest coast of Sumatra. Its beaches, possibility to surf, sail and dive make of it a little paradise. Hikers and nature lovers will be delighted with the island’s lush vegetation, waterfalls, tropical forest and rice fields. If you fancy playing Robinson Crusoe, spend a day on Mincau Island, a deserted island.

Medan, on Sumatra Island, is the third largest Indonesian city after Jakarta and Surabaya. Here are 4 visits not to be missed:
Maimoon Palace
This palace was built by the Sultan of Deli in 1886. Renowned as one of the most beautiful palaces of Southeast Asia for its architecture and decoration, combining Malay, Spanish and Indian styles.

Mesjid Raya (Grand Mosque) – for its amazing architecture and beautiful black dome.
Graha Maria Annai Velangkanni Church - the architecture of this Catholic Church showcases an Indian influence, quite a unique feature. A surprising mix of kitsch and religion.

Merdeka Walk is the place to eat! The choice ranges from street stalls to elegant restaurants.

The hotel experience


Nature and traditions

Mahi-mahi being the name of a colourful tropical fish, it’s no surprise this boutique hotel follows the ocean’s rhythm, inviting you for the perfect escape.

The 5 villas, built following traditional methods with local materials, are situated within the most beautiful garden, more than 10,000 m² wide. They all have a 180 degree view of the ocean, The rooms come with wide beds protected with a mosquito net, spacious indoor-outdoor style bathroom. There is no hot water, no wifi  and no AC in accordance with the natural local style. The views are either on the pristine beach or the garden, the atmosphere peaceful with only the sound of the waves brushing upon the white sand.

Guests can choose between single rooms, double rooms or a whole villa for up to 9 persons.
Waking up between the Indian Ocean and the tropical forest brings the promise of a day full of extraordinary adventures….

Included in the price: the lodging, 3 meals a day, filtered water, fishing/diving/stand-up paddle equipment, fruits, tea/coffee and airport transfers.






The Tempting Experience:

Peacefulness and nature protection


Mahi Mahi, set in a rather unique location, is fully aware that nature should be respected and protected. The hotel works with the HaKA Association to support (both on the finance and logistics side) the endangered sea turtle conservation programme in the neighbouring Bangkaru. Mahi Mahi thus hosts an NGO from the association, focusing on putting together a team of volunteers – the hotel guests are welcome to join. The chance of seeing the turtles coming up from the ocean to dig the sand and lay their eggs is an unforgettable experience.










From tempting magazine






Anna Madsen, Manager at Mahi-Mahi Resort

I get to wake up for work every morning next to the ocean and a magnificent sunrise, and finish the day with a breathtaking sunset. It beats the Parisian mornings in the metro by far! We met Anna Madsen, manager at beautiful Mahi-Mahi..
