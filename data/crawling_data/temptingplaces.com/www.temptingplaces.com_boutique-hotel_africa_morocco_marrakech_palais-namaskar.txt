The hotel experience


An Oasis of Luxury

"Peace" is the first word that comes to mind as you walk down the paved path leading to the main residence. The owner, Philipe Soulier, called on architect Imaad Rahmouni to turn his dream of a feng shui hotel into a reality. Here the calming colors, the greenery, and the Asian-inspired architecture all contribute to a sense of purity and energy. The stretches of white bougainvilleas, pools, and waterfalls invite you to let go and enjoy the present moment.

This Asian-inspired concept, combined with Mediterranean influences with arches, columns, domes, and gilding, seems like the perfect backdrop for a contemporary version of One Thousand and One Nights.

From the Deluxe to the Pool Villa, each one of the rooms and suites enjoys an outdoor area with a garden and daybed, jacuzzi or private pool for the most luxurious, helping to keep the focus on the outdoors.





The Tempting Experience:

Feng Shui Spirit


Palais Namaskar is the only hotel in Morocco constructed in accordance with the principles of feng shui. The architecture, ambiance of the villas, and availability of services are all in harmony to contribute to visitors` well-being. Water is an element that feng shui considers virtuous. At Palais Namaskar, water plays a leading role: lake, ponds, pools, fountains...the atmosphere is mellow, energy circulates, and one seems to float.
