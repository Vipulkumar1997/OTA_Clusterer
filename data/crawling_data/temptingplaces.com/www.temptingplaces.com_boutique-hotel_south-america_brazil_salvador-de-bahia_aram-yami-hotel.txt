The Destination

São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos

First capital of Brazil from 1549 to 1763, Salvador de Bahia was the birthplace of Brazil, at the crossroads of European, African and Amerindian cultures. The Bahians are predominantly Afro-Brazilian because Salvador was, from 1558, the first slave market in the New World plantations for cane sugar.

The historic center of Salvador (Pelourinho) has preserved its Renaissance architecture that evokes Portugal. It is pleasant to stroll about. The city was ranked particularly for its Renaissance architecture of its brightly colored houses, adorned with stucco decorations.

A few minutes from the hotel, you can visit the house of Jorge Amado and the famous Fondation of the photographer Pierre Verger.

Visit also:

The church of Bonfim
The district of Ribeira and Fort Montserrat
Lake dique do Tororo at the foot of the Forte Nova football stadium
The famous Mercado Modelo, where you use the Lacerda elevator, a city landmark, to take you to the upper town from where you can enjoy a superb panorama over the Bay of All Saints.
Do not miss the Carnival of Salvador de Bahía

The hotel experience


Stylish Suites with asian influences in Salvador de Bahia

The Hotel Aram Yami combines the colonial style of the house with a high level of comfort and blends contemporary Buddhist elements with the golden baroque decoration. The house remains very authentic though through its stylish parquet floor and staircase that both contrast with the modern design.

The 6 bright and spacious suites each have their own character. They all feature a large canopy bed,  colorful and ethnic-inspired cushions, stylish lamps, and dark wooden furniture from Viet Nam. A pleasant mix of baroque Bahian style and Asian Zen.

The hotel uses solar energy to power the rooms including the wireless Internet access, the satellite TV and the air conditioning. The bathroom amenities are exclusively Brazilian and made with natural herbs and plants from the Amazon forest.

The Top Suite is the largest suite and is ideal for a family. It has 2 bedrooms overlooking a private swimming pool. If you travel as a couple, then why not choose the Panoramic Suite with its unique panoramic view of the ocean and of the historic city center. It also has a nice private terrace.





The Tempting Experience:

Service, Privacy and Bahian culture!


The priorities of the Aram Yami boutique hotel are the quality of the service and the intimacy of the place. The hotel is very committed to its guests and will gladly assist you in discovering the Bahian culture and its values: religion, cuisine, and music.
Not far from the sea, up on the hill of Santo Antonio, the place is ideal for calm, charm and its views on the bay of Todos los Santos (Bahia de Todos los Santos).
An exclusive place in an heritage environment with legendary beaches!
