The Burgundian hospitality

Nestled in the city centre of Beaune, Le Cep hotel, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, finds its roots in two town houses, one dating back to the 14th century, the other to the 16th. Situated just a few steps from the Hospices, this 5 star boutique hotel showcases the heritage of the region with elegance and comfort. Each of the 65 rooms, including 29 suites, are named after local villages or great wines: "Chablis", "Clos Vougeot", "Romanée Conti", "Charmes Chambertin"... The owner, Mr Bernard, has a particular fondness for his beautiful region and loves to share with his guests the many treasures of architecture, gastronomy and of course wine that Burgundy has to offer. The Michelin starred gastronomic restaurant and service tailored to each visitor’s needs will delight all travellers.

The Destination

Beaune

Beaune, capital of Burgundy wines, is at the heart of the Route des Grands Crus, one of the most beautiful wine routes listing more than 600 winemakers. A rather exceptional French region!

The place to be for all wine lovers, every 3rd Sunday of November the city hosts a famous auction of the Hospices de Beaune.

Culture is not lacking, with many monuments and museums such as the famous Hospices de Beaune, Notre Dame, the Burgundy wine museum or the Fallot mustard factory...

Not to be missed is the summer International Festival of Baroque Opera, one of the most prestigious in Europe, which follows the musical tradition set by the court of the Dukes of Burgundy. Expect the same festive atmosphere as in the fifteenth century.

Beaune is also cinema friendly: it has been home to the International Detective Film Festival since 2009. You will, by the way, get to glimpse the actors invited and director of the festival at Le Cep hotel!

The hotel experience


A boutique hotel with a wonderful heritage

Two magnificent yards, classified an architectural heritage site, ogee windows opening onto balconies (in fact an Italian Renaissance gallery dating back to the 16th century), a tower with a stone spiral staircase… Conservation of the estate really matters to the Le Cep hotel. Indeed, the team takes great pride in showcasing their regional heritage. This is the perfect place to slow down, really enjoy the peacefulness of an exceptional setting and having time to oneself. Sipping on a local nectar in the gorgeous garden or one of the quieter yards is a rare privilege in such a fast-paced world.

Each of the 65 rooms and suites has its own unique decoration, in a classic French style, either with period furniture, French ceilings and a canopy bed or in a more colourful palette, both elegant and contemporary.

The Village Rooms all have a double bed. Some of the 1er cru rooms can accommodate an additional single bed if you are coming as a family.

The names chosen for the rooms are inspired by the local vineyards and their wines: "Chorey", "Vougeot", "Chassagne", "Savigny", " Griottes Chambertin”...

More spacious still, the 18 "Grand Cru" suites also include a seating area with armchairs or sofas.

The 11 splendid "Nectar" suites are divided in 4 categories:
- 4 Appartements (« Meursault Charmes », « Clos de la Roche », « Les Amoureuses », « Grands Echezeaux »), between 56m² and 75m², made of 2 separtaed rooms : 1 bedroom with a king size bed or twin beds and a living room with a sofa convertible in a queen size bed. They are equipped with a desk, a dressing and 1 or 2 bathrooms with bathtub and shower.

- 2 Family Suites (« Mazis Chambertin », « Corton Charlemagne »), around 50 m², equipped with a king size bed or 2 twin beds and 2 individuals beds for the children.

- 5 Suites which blend a contemporary décor with antiques. The 3 suites (« Volnay », « Pommard » et « Puligny ») built in 2013, from 33m² to 50m² are equipped with a bedroom, a living room, a dressing and a bathroom.
The 2 other suites, built by the end of 2014, are situated in a pavillon next to the Cour Saint-Félix.
« Clos des Avaux » is 42 m² and featured a double bed and a whirlpool bath.
«  Clos Parentous » is a duplex of 44 m². It features a 2m x 2m bed and a bathroom on the ground floor and a convertible sofa and a second bathroom on the upper floor. Perfect for a family!

The suites all are equipped with a NightCove system, helping you achieve the best quality of sleep through a unique lighting and sound system. Thanks to this, you fall asleep quicker and wake up more gently than with an alarm clock.






The Tempting Experience:

A slice of history


Le Cep hotel brings together a town house belonging to the Monthelie family and the Thiroux de Saint Felix hotel. You will recognise the latter by its timbered alleyways and courtyard dating back to 1570 (tastefully renovated in 2014). Walking through the yards and rooms of the hotel, you will notice little details, revealing glimpses of its history: engravings, sculptures, an old well, a dovecote… Did you know that one of the most prestigious guests who slept within these walls is none other than Le Roi Soleil, the Sun King? It is one of the staff’s favourite anecdotes. In 1658, Louis XIV, when visiting Beaune with his mother, preferred to sleep in the walls of this mansion rather than in the Hospice, the most beautiful building in town as it also served as an alms house and would have been filled with germs…

In summer the meals are served in the hotel courtyards.

Loiseau des Vignes was the very first restaurant in Europe to offer a full wine menu by the glass, listing nearly 70 wines, mostly of them really hard to find unless you are a connoisseur.
