A contemporary, chic haven of peace in Paris

A few minutes’ walk from La Madeleine and the famous shopping street of Les Grands Magasins is The Chess Hotel, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, a dream of a gentle bubble in the City of Lights. The talented duo of architects Gilles & Boissier have brought a twist to the French idea of classicism, turning black and white into the most elegant palette, adding a hypnotizing chequerboard floor and stunning murals to delight the hotel’s guests. Six floors, each with their own colour scheme, 50 rooms, and a suite on the 6th floor enjoying a view over the Opera… This little haven in the heart of Paris is ideal for businessmen planning meetings in the capital, lovers in search of an exceptional setting or simply discerning travellers in search of inspiration.

The Destination

Around the Opéra Garnier

You may have admired its elegant domes from the top floor of the hotel, but there is more still to the Opera Garnier, including ceilings painted by Chagall. A little further, Les Grands Magasins (amazing department store) and La Madeleine give the perfect excuse for a little (or a lot of) shopping. If you are looking for something really luxurious, try the jewellers of La Place Vendome. The Louvre is also nearby and we guarantee art lovers will lose track of time in its amazing collections. Indeed, The Chess Hotel enjoys an ideal location in the city…

The hotel experience


Parisian elegance reinvented: a unique décor

Outside, a discreet entrance marked by a wrought iron and glass canopy. Inside, a pointillist inspired mural by Alix Waline leads the way to lift. Indeed, you will find the hotel reception on the first floor, a symbolic way of leaving all worries behind. The door opens onto a universe of black and white, each detail polished to perfection as though it were marble. What a magnificent scene: a chequerboard tiled floor, ivory tables framed with an ebony lining, the mesmerising gaze of a giant owl painted by Victor Ash in the lobby.

Statement murals can be found on each floor, as if each were a different chapter in a book. Colour reappears in the rooms, harmoniously orchestrated: Persian or ice blue, earthy yellow, slate, chalk blue, pale grey, Burgundy… Gilles & Boissier decided to bring the spirit of the Grand Hotels back to life, yet with a 21st century slant. They drew the furniture designs themselves, choosing sleek, contemporary lines, celebrating noble materials: solid oak, Carrara white marble, linen, antique brass, granite... Bathrooms play the chessboard card with black and white geometrical patterns, canopies add a dreamlike feeling to the Deluxe Rooms and Suites… Chic and sublime guaranteed!






The Tempting Experience:

A delicious tea time


Tea time matters at the Chess Hotel. How about celebrating the Parisian way? Every afternoon, the lobby serves the now famous Choux by Popelini, a profiterole-like treat filled with crème patissière. There are five divine flavours to discover. Add a cup of Mariage Frères tea or a flute of Laurent Perrier Champagne. After all, you are in France! The hotel also offers a gourmet snacking option in the evening, should you feel peckish: sharing platters by La Maison Da Rosa, a fantastic opportunity to taste the very best of Italian, Portuguese and Spanish terroirs.
