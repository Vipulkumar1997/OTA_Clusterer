The Destination

Paris: Place des Vosges

Whether you fancy an aperitif, prefer to enjoy the view from a park bench, or rake a stroll through art galleries, the Place des Vosges is the perfect start point. This square in the Marais district, just behind the Place Dauphine is the oldest in Paris. Formerly called Place Royale, it was renamed "Place des Vosges" in 1800 to honour of the department of the Vosges, the first one to collect taxes under the French Revolution.
Georges Simenon and Colette, famous French writers, both had an apartment there as did Victor Hugo, whose house at n°6, is now a museum about his life and work.

For a nice glass of wine, try Ma Bourgogne at the n°19.

The hotel experience


A Parisian fairyland

The hotel used to be called the Lyon-Mulhouse. Back in the 19th century, it accommodated long distance travellers. Thanks to Stella Cadente’s vision, it is now a 4 star hotel, named Original, adorned with gold and silver, fibre optic, mosaics and intricate details designed to transform your stay into a living dream.
The magic starts in the reception lounge, its ceiling illuminated by multicolour luminous filaments. Cross the hall, paved with a black and white checkerboard, and you will find the breakfast room, adorned with silver leaves. Jelly fish lamps, ethereal and poetic, are the signature of the hotel and welcomes in every room. The hallway, designed as an optical illusion, will lead you to the upper floors where other fairy tales await.

The 38 rooms are distributed over 6 floors - single, double or family rooms. The very last floor is the floor of all sins, using slightly darker hues of grey and pink-beige, while the mansard walls are decorated with exclusive pictures of Stella and Claudel.
For an incredible view of Parisian rooftops, choose a room on the top floor. If you would rather enjoy a balcony, try an OR or a Forêt Enchantée room - both overlook the boulevard Beaumarchais.





The Tempting Experience:

A universe of fairy tales


Andersen, Perrault and Lewis Carroll heroes have stepped out from the fairy tale books and visited the Hotel Original! You may very well sleep like Alice, the Cheschire Cat watching over you. Or wonder, like Goldilocks, which bed to choose in the triple room under the roofs. In a Silver, Gold or White room you will immediately feel like a glamorous princess while the green sculptures and birds from the Enchanted Forest rooms will make your dreams more magical still.
