A stylish and cosy hotel

Monhotel Lounge & Spa, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a boutique hotel located within the 16th arrondissement, just a few streets away from the Champs-Elysées. It has the advantage of being right in the city yet enjoying a peaceful area. The beautifully preserved bourgeois façade of the building contrasts nicely with the contemporary boudoir decor inside, graced by designer labels such as Starck and Moooi for the lights and Eames for the chairs. With a bar, a spa and a fitness room, this multifaceted four-star hotel is equally ideal for business or pleasure stays – indeed, an ideal spot for your next trip to Paris.

The Destination

Paris, quartier Argentine

The rue d'Argentine is located in the 16th arrondissement, a chic residential area near the Arc de Triomphe. A few minutes from the hotel, the lively Parisian streets offer a large selection of restaurants and cafes, perfect after a shopping session on the Champs Elysées. Also nearby are the African Arts museum and the Ennery museum, famous for its large private collection of Asian art. The latter only opens its doors on appointment. Do ask the reception team if you need help arranging this.

The hotel experience


A Haussmann facade and a glamorous inside

If the walls of Monhotel Lounge & Spa could talk, they would tell stories of fantastic adventures set at a time when the area was still scandalous. Alain Phitoussi, returning from Argentina, stumbled upon a hotel for sale on rue d'Argentine, decided it was fate and bought it. And so the story of MonHotel Lounge & Spa started. Famous writers used to haunt the bar, once a star of Parisian nights.

The interior designer and scenographer Aurélia Santoni created a brand new atmosphere, bringing together an elegant atmosphere and high-end comfort. In the reception, you will find a desk made of Canadian lime washed wood as well as a beautiful Hannes Wettstein desktop painted red and black, all under the longing gaze of the glamorous Marilyn Monroe. Sensual portraits of Kate Moss by Albert Watson feature above the Black Corian bar top, among velvet plum chairs, statues and crystal chandeliers. The room, with its sculptural crystal chandeliers wrapped in Plexiglas, has a warm boudoir feel,

Every floor has its own vibrant colour, whether Ferrari red, coral blue, pistachio green… as well as custom vintage chairs in the hallways. The 50 spacious rooms showcase luxurious details: alcantara walls, marble bathrooms, Hastens bedding, Nespresso machines and designer furniture. Portraits of celebrities such as Nicole Kidman, Marilyn Monroe,  Obama or George Clooney add the final touch.

In early 2017 the hotel was extended to a new luxury annexe and the wellness area entirely renewed. Three new categories of rooms, Comfort, Club and Couture, have been created in the same harmonious design style. Some of them offer private balcony to  enjoy breakfast or a relaxing moment, overlooking the City of Lights.






The Tempting Experience:

Welcome to your hotel!


This is what you will hear as soon as you step in - "Bienvenue à Monhotel" - welcoming you as a privileged guest. Elsa and her team are here to bring perfection to your stay: oils for a Turkish bath, a tea bag for an herbal bath or even discounts at the bar. The team at MonHotel Lounge & Spa is at your disposal to make sure your visit is exemplary... Monhotel is yours!
