The hotel experience


The Art of living in Aquitaine

Les Sources de Caudalie was imagined by architect Yves Collet as a charming hamlet - a tribute to the heritage of the region - but also conceived as a contemporary hotel. The five house find inspiration in the area: La Bastide des Grands Crus, Le Comptoir des Indes, La Maison du Lièvre, La Grange au Bateau and L’Ile aux Oiseaux. The decoration was put in the care of stylist decorator Maxime Simoëns.
Antiques, vintage materials and luxurious hangings decorate the forty rooms and twenty one suites. Each background reflects the identity of the Aquitaine region, whether its ocean and bay, its lands or activities. The balconies and patio overlook the vineyards and the lake. You may even glimpse one of the beautiful white swans…
The Great Suite “Vent du large” is particularly lovely during winter nights, when you can settle near the chimney fire after an afternoon in the spa. Red vine baths and grapevine flower envelopments, amongst other luxuries, can be enjoyed there.
If you are coming with children or friends, the Suite Family "Au Coeur des Sources" will give you extra privacy to make the most of your stay. This suite consists of two vast rooms overlooking the vineyards and garden, as well as a large living room with its own dining room, a kitchen and two bathrooms.






The Tempting Experience:

Enjoy your trip in the vineyards


The owners, Alice and Jérôme Tourbier, found their inspiration in the "French Paradox". This concept, discovered over 20 years ago, highlights the benefits of the wine consumption against cardiovascular disease. The Vinotherapy Caudalie Spa therefore combines the virtues of vine and grape with the natural hot spring water drawn beneath the lands of the domain. The patio of the restaurant, La Grande Vigne, overlooks the lake right at the foot of the vine hills. Wine lovers will delight in the tasting proposed every Saturday by sommelier Aurélien Farouil, who knows every corner of the cellar and each of the 16000 bottles.
