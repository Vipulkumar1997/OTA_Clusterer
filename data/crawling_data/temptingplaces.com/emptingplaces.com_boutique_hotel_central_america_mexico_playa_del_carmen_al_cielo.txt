The Destination

The Tulum pyramids: a seaside archeological site

Tulum means “wall, fortification, castle,” but its ancient name was Zama, and meant “daybreak,” which you will understand when looking out at the 360° view of the Caribbean sea and horizon. It`s the only Mayan city constructed on the sea coast.
The city, built on a rocky promontory, was founded around 564 but the major portion of vestiges date after 1200. Most of the monuments had ceremonial functions. The Castillo, the temple dedicated to Venus, recalls the appearance of the Chichén Itzà temples with its staircase leading to the temple and its serpentine columns. This is the most elevated building of the site. The central figure represents the descendant God (or Dieu Abeille) omnipresent in Tulum. The archeologists have been present in the zone since 1999 and have discovered more than 100 skeletons from the Mayan culture from several ages and over fifty pots and other ruins.
We recommend that you take a walk through history in one of the principal Mayan cities of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.

The hotel experience


Ticket to paradise

The sea is the first thing you will notice when you arrive at Al Cielo. From the colorful palapas on the beach, the most beautiful beach in Mexico is so…
The reception is at the top of wooden stairs and there, a breathtaking view transports you to paradise, with turquoise water juxtaposing the white sand and the green semi-tropical vegetation.

Sensory and harmonious, the four rooms have taken the names of the four elements, symbols of vitality: Agua, Vento, Tierra, and Fuego (Water, Air, Land, and Fire). Each room has a spectacular view of the Caribbean Sea and the lush jungle that surrounds the hotel. Just wait until you can admire the sunrise and sunset from your bed, terrace, or hammock!
A bit more luxurious are the Tierro and Fuega rooms, which each feature a small lounging pool.

The two Villas on the garden, Atardecer (dusk) and Girasol (sunflower), are especially ideal for families. They are spacious and offer a terrace with a pool. La Villa Del Patron is the most luxurious with its two large bedrooms, pool, and idyllic seafront view.
Finally the grand Suite la Mar charms couples with its romantic atmosphere.






The Tempting Experience:

Cool attitude under the palapas


The palapa, a word of Mayan origin which means “pulpy sheet”, is a little open hut with a roof of dried leaves, typical of the Mexican coast. The colored palapas on the beach of Al Cielo are symbolic of the relaxing way of life that you find at the hotel. The mats in the shade of the palm leaves roofs wait for you to relax, read, sunbathe, lunch, and drink succulent watermelon juice… The romantic meals are equally available by demand, with a table, chairs, candles, and exotic flowers under the palapa. A Jaracho Trio may even come sing a Mexican serenade to you.
Green, blue, red, yellow… choosing the color of your palapa will be the only difficult question during your leisurely day on the Xpu Ha beach. To your extreme relaxation!

The Services


Ecotourism
The turtle season is from May to September. You will be able to see the turtles lay eggs in the bay, and later you will be able to help the baby turtles return to the sea, all under the eye of a biologist who will explain everything. You can even swim with the turtles on the beach of Akumal, a ten minute drive from the hotel.
Restaurant
The Al Cielo restaurant is at the hands of Mexican chef Francisco Morales Tress, who decided to settle on the Mayan Riviera after a number of experiences with cuisines from around the world. Sea paella, lobster, and local fish are all on the menu of his restaurant, which is open all day, but only by reservation can you experience his intimate and personalized side. You can choose between dining on the terrace or directly on the beach.
Spa & Wellness
Massages, done with essential local oils and tropical fruits, are available upon reservation. This is the moment to totally release yourself under a private palapa specially arranged for use on the beach.




The Activities


Excursions
Diverse excursions are organized on demand: visit archeological sites (Tulum Ruins, Coba Ruins and the colonial cities of Vallodolid and Izamal), take to the sea on the hotel boat, swim with whale sharks at the Isla Mujeres, swim in a cenote, etc.
