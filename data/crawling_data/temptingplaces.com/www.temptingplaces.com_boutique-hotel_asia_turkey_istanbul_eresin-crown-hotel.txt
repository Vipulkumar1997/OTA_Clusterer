The Destination

Istanbul, capital of culture

Hagia Sophia : Constantinople`s former Christian basilica, dating from the 6th century AD. It became a mosque in the 15th century and, ever since 1934, it is no longer a worship venue but a museum. It is one of the greatest examples of Byzantine` s architecture; its dimensions for this time period are impressive: 20m high columns, weighing at least 70 tons, 31,25m diameter and 55,6m high central dome. Its indoor decoration, its mosaics, its Porphiry columns and its cupola are of immense artistic value.

The Blue Mosque is well named as its indoor walls are covered with blue mosaic: over 20,000 handmade ceramic tiles represent various tulips, models, flowers, fruits and cypresses. Built between 1609 to 1616, it also shelters the founder`s grave, a Medersa and a hospice. Its particularity is that it is surrounded by 6 minarets, a unique case in the world.

The Cistern basilica is a huge Constantinople underground cistern, built by the Emperor Justinian in the basement of a big porch building. At the time, it had the biggest water stocking capacity in existence: around 78,000m3. The columns and the ceiling`s vaults receive a soft light, the whole creating a warm and magical atmosphere.

Strolling about the Istanbul Grand Bazar is a real pleasure. With its 4,000 boutiques and its 58 indoor streets, it is one of the largest in the world. The most ancient part dates from 1455 and it was considerably widened in the 16th century. Let this venue`s magic and the pleasure of bargaining tempt you or simply have a coffee or a mint tea break in one of the bazaar`s many cafés.

The Topkapi Palace, built on the ancient Byzance acropolis, rises above the Golden Horn, the Bosphorus and the Marmara Sea. From 1465 to 1853, it was the official main city residence of the Ottoman Sultan. Since 1921, it has been a museum: collections of porcelain, clothes, weapon, shields, Ottoman miniatures, Islamic calligraphies` manuscripts and the Ottoman times` treasures and jewels.

The hotel experience


Hellenistic, Byzantine and Ottoman accents

Entering the Eresin Crown Hotel is like stepping back in history. 49 historical art pieces await you and will transport you from the 2nd century BC up until to 5th century AD. This Museum-Hotel also showcases reproductions of the original ceramic collection of the Ottoman Empire - the original ones are at the British Museum in London - as well as a very special picture gallery consisting of 168 pieces of Byzantine and Ottoman life style impressions, made by Turkish artist Gultekin Cizgen.

The lobby is lodged in the cistern`s remains, whose beige and white walls rise to the ceiling. An impressive fish mosaic ornaments the floor in the center of the restaurant which was believed to be a part of a corridor, a court, or a religious building on the premises of the Byzantine Time 5-6 Century A.D « Great Palace ».

Stroll around the hotel and discover pillar trunks, Corinthian capitals, funerary steles and other sarcophagus details carved in the stone and representing Eros, the God of Love.

The hotel`s buiding has a lovely façade, with archway windows on the ground floor, and 5 floors. All bedrooms and suites have parquet flooring and bathrooms are equipped with Jacuzzis. Large and comfortable, they offer 1 double-bed or 2 twin beds and individual air conditioning.





The Tempting Experience:

Historical stay in a museum


Getting locked in a museum, an intriguing idea! At the Eresin Crown Hotel, the unique Museum Boutique Hotel in Turkey, you will stay at your own free will. Incredible travel sensations await across time and history, seeing 5th or 6th century AD cisterns and mosaics, the acroterium with sorrowful Eros reliefs (3rd century AD), Corinthian capitals, and finally numerous column trunks and funerary steles (2nd century BC up to 6th century AD). One must simply wander around the different parts of the hotel to realize how special and unique the place really is.
