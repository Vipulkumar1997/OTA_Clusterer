The hotel experience


Where history, culture, and design mix

Take in the scent of spices floating in the air; it’s a mix of peppers that creates a custom scent for the hotel. The décor of different centuries mix effortlessly: 18th century Venice, Art Deco, Fortuny, to create the hotel’s own original eccentric and baroque style. A historic location, the building previously welcomed Vivaldi as he once gave music lessons when the hotel was still a privately owned palace. After becoming a hotel in the 19th century, the Metropole also received Freud, Marcel Proust and Thomas Mann through its doors.
Each guestroom is unique and decorated in a different style, always with luxurious fabrics, beds and furniture from the era, as well as bathrooms in Italian marble. For a relaxing stay, a room next to the gardens is preferable. To take in the Venetian ambiance, choose a room overlooking the small Roi Della Pietà canal, and watch the vaporettos pass by into the lagoon.
Certain Deluxe and Junior Suites have private terraces, ideal for enjoying an intimate breakfast.
For the lavish vacation or a honey-moon, the most spectacular suite is the Damasco. Genuine oriental columns encompass the bed and in the center of the throne room sits a mother-of-pearl mosaic fountain bath. The three grand windows face the San Giorgio, a guaranteed regal Venetian immersion!






The Tempting Experience:

A cabinet of curiosities


The Beggiato family, owners of the hotel, features their personal collections in the hotel. More than 2000 assorted objects are dispersed throughout the hallways, lounges, and guestrooms. The hotel houses one of the biggest collections of Italian crucifixes as well as rare fans, 18th century evening bags, and postcards from precious visits. The Metropole is unquestionably a unique and exotic treasure trove facing the lagoon of Venice.

The Services


Bar
Perfect for a spritz, the menu of the Oriental Bar offers more than 30 versions of the famous Venetian cocktail! If you’re in the mood for a snack, you can find popular seasonal dishes to choose from. From October to March, the tea room offers an exclusive tea ceremony with teas from the brand Damman Frères.
Garden
For breakfast or to simply find a place to relax throughout the day, the garden welcomes you during every season, either outside or under the glass roof. Jasmine, agaves, and birds of paradise bring color and fragrant smells to this oasis.
Restaurant
The creations of Chef Luca Veritti are now haloed by a Michelin star. The restaurant is worthy of recompense for its menus that unite the traditional with the contemporary. Relish in the opportunity to try a fabulous fresh seafood soup made with 9 different types of fish and spiked with saffron, or one of our favorite desserts: Tortelli di zucca, a pastry dating back to the 15th century filled with pumpkin, lemon zest and parmesan regianno.
