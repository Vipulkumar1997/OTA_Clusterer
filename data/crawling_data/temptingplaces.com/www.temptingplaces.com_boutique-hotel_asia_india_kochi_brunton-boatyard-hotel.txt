The Destination

Fort Kochi

Like its cuisine, the city of Kochi, and more particularly Fort Kochi is a mixture. It`s the product of a rich history, the meeting point of civilizations that arrived from the 16th to the 19th centuries to conquer the treasure of the country: its spices. These cultures will guide you throughout your visit: Portuguese architecture, remnants of the British Raj, Chinese nets, synagogues and mosques ... Just look around!

The Chinese nets
They line up at the top of Fort Kochi. Introduced in 1400, these huge fishing nets framed with teak require 4 fishermen to move them.

St. Francis Church
Built in 1503 by Portuguese Franciscan friars. Although Vasco de gama was buried in Lisbon, you can still find his tom here.

Mattancherry Palace
Built by the Portuguese in the 16th century, then offered to the Raja of Kochi and rebuilt by the Dutch in the 17th century, now a museum that exhibits the cultural history of the city paintings, palanquin and sculptures ...

Jew Town
The Jewish Quarter is a lively port area located in the spice center of the city.

The hotel experience


A Charming boutique hotel: experiencing the maritime heritage of Fort Kochi

The architecture and decoration of the Brunton Boatyard`s recreates the 19th century of Kochi. Common rooms such as the lobby and the other various lounges are organized around the garden and original materials such as brick, lime, wood and terracotta tiles are used. The luxurious mahogany and teak furniture, the old boxes of spices, the "Punkha" (manual fan) of the lounge resembles the decor of a novel by Kipling, everything speaks with nostalgia of a bygone era. The maritime history of the city will follow you in all the rooms of the property: from the Dutch old maps on the walls, an anchor in the garden, and the ancient paintings in the lobby...

Push the small door toward the pool and you will find yourself in front of the port of Kochi. Swim a couple laps in the pool and admire the vessels returning to port, extend your neck a little bit you will see the Chinese fishing nets, iconic symbols of the city.

The hotel has its own pier where you can enjoy a drink or just watch the boats in the harbor.

Four-poster beds and antique furniture equip the elegant rooms in harmony with the maritime theme and the view from the balconies. Almost all of the rooms and the bathrooms overlook the Arabian Sea. Imagine taking a bath while watching the dolphins play with the boats in the estuary!





The Tempting Experience:

Historic cuisine of the families of Fort Kochi


The restaurant's chefs have been searching the city for ancestral and traditional family recipes from different communities. Jewish, Portuguese, Arabic, Kutchi and Konkani recipes were found, studied and are now served at the restaurant, The History Cafe, for the delight of gourmets!
