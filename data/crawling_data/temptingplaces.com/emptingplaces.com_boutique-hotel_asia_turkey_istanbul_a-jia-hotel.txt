The Destination

Nearby visits

The cultural and historical sites of Istanbul are easily accessible from the hotel. Istanbul is the meeting place of many civilizations, and the city has incredibly rich architectural and cultural heritage. At 5 minutes from the hotel you can visit the Hidiv Pavilion, a magnificent reminder of Ottoman history and ancient remains of Egyptian governors. In addition to its grand architecture, it now offers one of the best restaurants in Istanbul. Not far from the hotel, the Equestrian Villa, Kucuksu Pavilion, The Beylerbeyi Fortress and thePalace Rumelinet are all worth the detour.

The hotel experience


Modern day and 19th century elegance meet

With only 16 rooms, A'jia offers a quiet and intimate getaway. The architect Resit Solely created a unique setting for each room with modern design and luxurious ways to immerse yourself in a privileged world combining contemporary furniture with the elegance of the nineteenth century. A minimalist style with timeless charm. Some rooms open onto private balconies, others have a stunning mezzanine. All rooms arecomfortable and outfitted with the latest technologies. We recommend the Bosphorus Terrace Room with its huge windows that allow for incrediblebrightness and breathtaking views of the Bosphorus where you can watch the boats. Or aMezzanine Deluxe Suite overlooking the Bosporus and signed Starck bathtub! At night, the lights of the street and the town unveil balconies and terraces creating a romantic spectacle.





The Tempting Experience:

A hotel on the border of two continents


The A'jia Hotel's unique location between Europe and Asia is an experience in itself. VisitEuropean Turkey during the day and fall asleep in Asia! The hotel offers an excursion on a boat that crosses the Bosphorus. The border of two continents, a crossroads of civilizations, Istanbul promises you a memorable stay.
