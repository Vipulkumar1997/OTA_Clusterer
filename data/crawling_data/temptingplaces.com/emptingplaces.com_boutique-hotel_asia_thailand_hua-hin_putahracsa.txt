The Destination

The Beach Town Hua Hin

Two hundred kilometers south of Bangkok, Hua Hin is one of the traditional beach towns of Thailand with a fishing port, seafood restaurant, and a three-kilometer long beach. In 1920 the King of Thailand, Rama VII, had built at Hua Hin his summer palace and even today the royal family resides here part of the year. Within a thirty minute drive you will find a golf course.

Other places to visit are the floating market, a crocodile farm, and a rose garden. You may see a traditional Thai marriage or take part in a classic Thai dance. The Kwai River Bridge and his famous railroad to death is open for visits to movie fans.
Kaeng Krachan Park is available for the lovers of exotic birds as well as the architecture pundits; one of the local wonders is an over-a -thousand-year-old Khmer Temple.

The fans of a more active tourism will like the deep sea fishing and two kite surfing schools.

The list would not be complete without an elephant ride at the elephant camp and the famed Thai massage parlor of which there is no shortage in town.

Finally the Thai Cooking lessons will introduce you to all aspects of the cuisine from the choice of ingredients to the choice of local cooking techniques and traditions.

The hotel experience


A design of chic and style

The 67 bedrooms of the hotel are arranged in two zones : the first  consists of the "Ocean Bed" room types which are located on the beach side, while the other  consists of "Sand Sky", “Silksand Deluxe and Silk Sand" room types. Style and luxury perfectly define the ambience of the place highlighted with shades of chocolate, linen and white.
The green of the surrounding nature and the blue of the ocean enhance the sheer architecture. The use of local materials gives a sense of quality to the furniture and objects. Everything has been given a careful detailed and delicate thought. Each bedroom, of 44 square meters has its own private terrace with deckchairs. The private pool and Jacuzzi complete the 80-140 square meter villas. Putahracsa is charming, contemporary and serene indeed.





The Tempting Experience:

The Oceanside Restaurant


Imagine yourself at the Oceanside Restaurant: a gentle ocean breeze, the rhythm of the waves, your eyes trying to discover the limit of the horizon... This is the feel of the restaurant. Discover a refined Thai cuisine: fish and seafood for a romantic dinner.
If the Thai Royal Family comes to Putahracsa for the summer, you have a chance to see their boat with the bright lightsand  decorated masts pass across the bay.
