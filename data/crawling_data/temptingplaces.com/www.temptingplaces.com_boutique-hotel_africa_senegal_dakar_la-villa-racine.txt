The Destination

Visit Goree Island

Dakar is the port of departure for Goree Island, located just 4.5 km from the capital. There are no cars nor bikes there but pastel-toned façades: a relaxing abode away from the so busy Dakar. It is also a symbolic place for the memory of the African slave trade, and has been on UNESCO’s World Heritage List since 1978.

There are 4 museums to visit:
- The Historical Museum, focusing on prehistoric African collections
- The Sea Museum
- The House of Slaves
- The Museum of Women, which opened in 1994 under the leadership of Annette Mbaye d’Erneville. The museum pays tribute to the women of the country and reports on their daily lives.

The hotel experience


Simplicity and warm welcome, the Senegalese teranga

Teranga means hospitality, a local expression very much valued by La Villa Racine. The building could have become a set of offices but its owner, wanting to keep a family atmosphere, preferred to turn it into an elegant boutique hotel. Each room is decorated in a unique way and you can even choose a harmony of colours: soothing pink or beige, splendid ruby red, art deco style in black and white, classic grey, fantastic mauve… They do however have one thing in common: the high quality comfort of the bedding, the luxury of the materials used and the sensation of being in a cocoon. Baroque lovers will appreciate the gold leaf plating of some furniture and headboards. The choice of local artists, painters, and sculptures represented in the rooms and shared areas is remarkable





The Tempting Experience:

A net of influences


The elevated façade of the hotel could be, indeed, Haussmannian… The heavy door, sculpted in wood, recalls in turn St. Louis or Tombouctou architecture. Push it open and you will find yourself in a Moroccan styled patio, surrounded by a Senegalese wrought-iron balcony. This cultural mix is also present in the rooms: hangings made by Tissage de Nantes, printed Senegalese bedspreads, scents of Oriental Oud… La Villa Racine proves to be a world of its own, a cultural blend created by the owner, Mrs. Diouck, who hopes to help you relax and forget the outside world.
