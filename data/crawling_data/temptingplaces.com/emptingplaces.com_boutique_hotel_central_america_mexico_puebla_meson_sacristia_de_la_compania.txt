A boutique hotel with colonial charm

The Mesón Sacrístia de la Compañia, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, formerly a residence of a Mexican aristocratic family, is a tiny luxury boutique hotel located in the centre of the historical city of Puebla - declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987.

History whispers from the Mesón Sacrístia de la Compañia`s walls, while the hotel`s colonial decoration and atmosphere transports guests back to exotic 19th century Mexico. The building, antiques, and local cuisine experience promote the local culture and life-style and contribute to the preservation of the beautiful colonial city of Puebla.
The hotel is situated near to the Zócalo, Puebla`s central place, in the historical centre and within walking distance of the main monuments and highlights of this superb city, renowned for its rich and varied architecture.

Seen from the exterior, the Mesón de la Compañia is a typical Spanish house with heavy wooden doors, and mexican colors. Once in the courtyard, the colonial, meticulously restored, antiques and rustic furniture recreate an authentic 19th century Mexican atmosphere.

Together with contemporary services and amenities this boutique hotel offers an authentic, warm and luxurious guest experience.

The Destination

Puebla,

Puebla is located in the Valley of Puebla (south of Mexico), surrounded by volcanoes and snow-capped mountains, and this gives it an exceptional charm. The city is nicknamed the "city of the Angels", or "Rome of the Americas".

You should visit the Puebla Cathedral, built by Francisco Becerra between 1575 et 1649, with 14 chapels of varied styles and its two towers of 69,36m - the tallest in Mexico. One of the towers has no bells and legend has it that an underground river passes under that tower so that, if bells were placed in it, the tower would collapse...

The very nice San Juan church or the baroque and coloured Santo Domingo are also worth visiting.

Other sights are the Casa de Deán (16th century), whose interior walls are painted; the Patio de los Azulejos (1679); and also La Casa del Alfenique ("the house of the Little Poucet") which houses the regional museum and is decorated with blue, white, and red faience and baroques elements.

In the evening, stroll around the Plazuela de Los Sapos, where the antique dealers settled twenty years ago and where the numerous bars, cafes, and restaurants create a relaxed family ambiance.

12 km from Cholula which will delight those who are passionate about archaeology.

The hotel experience


A boutique hotel with traits of a living museum

A stay at this boutique hotel is loaded with history and is the ideal way to discover Puebla, heritage city and Mecca of antique dealers. The Mesón Sacrístia de la Compañia is tastefully decorated with rustic furniture, primitive tapestries, sculptures, religious figurines, and other authentic antiques. For generations the Espinosa family has sold antiques in the Los Sapos area of downtown Puebla so that explains it!

The lobby and the two lounges are true antique galleries, and everywhere, whether in the common areas or in the suites, guests will find trunks, wooden chests, and other objects that have acquired a patina through time. If you like a piece of furniture or decoration, then you can buy it (even your bed!) and have it sent home ... a very unique souvenir!  The constant staff attention complete the atmosphere and make the stay a fantastic experience.

The facades of the colonial patrician houses of the city centre of Puebla are famed for their multi-colored faience that decorates the walls from top to bottom. Thus, in order to preserve this architectural heritage, the doors of all the Mesón Sacrístia de la Compañia`s suites are framed with « azulejos de Talavera » and gold-leaf details. All the suites, though decorated differently, transpire a warm and cozy atmosphere and their chimneys and candles add intimacy and romance to recreate the colonial Mexican atmosphere.





The Tempting Experience:

Puebla through its cuisine


But the true little advantage of the Mesón Sacrístia de la Compañia is the possibility to take Mexican cooking lessons: an original way to experience Puebla through its traditional, local cuisine. The lessons will of course not necessarily make you a great chef, but are  a nice and enriching way to discover and enjoy Pueblan-style dishes.

The Chef, teaches you how to cook local and national dishes, with fresh ingredients, and using the pre-hispanic techniques of the house  ... experience history with your own hands!
