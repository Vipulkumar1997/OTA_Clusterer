The Destination

Cuenca

Surrounded by mountains, Cuenca is the third largest city of Ecuador. At 2400m high in the Andes, Cuenca has been marked by the past presence of the Incas and the Spanish. It has a historic center dating from the sixteenth and seventeenth century, and was declared World Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 1999.

Stroll in the streets and enjoy its architecture but also its parks (Parque Calderón), squares, colonial neighborhoods, museums (Museum of Religious Art, Banco Central, Casa de la Cultura, las Conceptas, Remigio Crespo Toral, Arte Moderno, Instituto de Folklore Azuayo), its cathedrals and churches (Santo Domingo, San Sebastián y San Blas).

The hotel experience


An elegant and authentic mansion

The Mansion Alcazar is an excellent illustration of the "Republican" architecture of Ecuador. Behind the front door you enter into the spirit of the "new colonial world”. Th e rooms are on two floors, distributed around a central courtyard with a fountain.

The Mansion Alcazar is located in the heart of the city and accurately depicts the historical legacy of Cuenca. Each piece of furniture of the hotel has been handmade in Cuenca. The beautiful antique furniture and fine objects d`art give a colonial style and distinguished atmosphere to the rooms. The bathrooms are all different, made of Cuenca marble, and painted by hand.

The 19 rooms and  suites are all different sizes. The single, double rooms, and suites have inspiring names such as: Lili, Nina, Chocolate, Basilica, Floral, Royal, ... and all are uniquely decorated. The Peach Room has a canopy and wrought wood bed, a beautiful antique wardrobe and a lovely coffee table. The Floral room unveils a collection of silk flowers. The Cielo master suite is hand painted and gives the impression of angels flying in the clouds.





The Tempting Experience:

The Champagne Lounge


The refined decoration and crystal chandeliers in the Champagne Lounge truly recreate the ambience of the colonial era. You can enjoy a glass of champagne before dinner at Casa Alonso…
