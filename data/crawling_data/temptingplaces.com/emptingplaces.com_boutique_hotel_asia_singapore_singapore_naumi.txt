The Destination

Singapore's must-do's

Singapore is best discovered by one`s own curiosity. Some think they can see it all in 2 days and some in 6. Try 2 weeks and chances are you will still not have seen it all.

Some of THE places to see are Orchard Roard for shopping, the Raffles Places (where the Naumi hotel is located) with Boat Quay, Little India, Balestier, Katong, Tanjong Pagar, and the Botanical Gardens with the world's most complete and amazing orchid collection.

The Museum of Asian civilizations warrants a half day, as it is one of the best museums in the region.

The Public Housing apartments are interesting sights both for their architecture as well as how they help forge the Singapore social tissue.

For the evenings Boat Quay and Clark Quay with their trendy bars, restaurants, and night-clubs are definitively the places to be.
