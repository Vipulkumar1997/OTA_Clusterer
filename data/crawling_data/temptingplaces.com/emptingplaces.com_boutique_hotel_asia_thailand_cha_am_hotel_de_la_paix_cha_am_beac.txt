The Destination

The charms of Hua-Hin and Cha`Am

The hotel experience


Luxury and design is the only motto!

Styled by the renowned Thai designer, Duangrit Bunnag, the Hotel de la Paix Cha Am Beach has a very chic design. Architectural perspective, long pure lines, refined decoration, natural raw materials, minimalist style ... this is the signature of the Hotel Cha-Am . The extraordinary lobby, the single colored outdoor pools, etc… the hotel`s unique and sophisticated style is reflected in the smallest details and even on your breakfast plate!

The rooms and villas at the Hotel de la Paix Cha Am Beach offer great privacy. The floors and walls are made of smooth, polished concrete and are accented with dark wood. The simple lines and colors of the furniture are reminiscent of Scandinavian design. The rooms feature state-of-the-art Bose surround sound systems. The bathrooms feature a very comfortable, huge bathtub, and appliances are integrated with decorative elements. You will love the “rain” showers where water flows from the ceiling, transforming any daily shower into a truly special moment!

There are 3 types of rooms:

The Horizon rooms are a fusion of modern and ancient Thai design;
The Garden Terrace rooms are very luxurious and comfortable and feature a private landscaped terrace;
The Pool Villas feature a very private garden, a terrace, and a private pool.





The Tempting Experience:

Dining under the stars in Cabanas


Located right on the beach, the Cabanas transform at night into a fabulous table for a romantic dinner under the stars. Your personal butler will take care of your every desire to make your evening unforgettable. We recommend the "signature" Thai dinner that showcases Thai cuisine modernized by the chef.
