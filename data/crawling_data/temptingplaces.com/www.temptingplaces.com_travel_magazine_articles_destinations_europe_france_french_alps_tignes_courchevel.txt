Europe’s finest ski resorts














Whether you're looking for Europe’s finest ski resorts, a festive ambiance or some picturesque snowing landscapes there is a chance that you find yourself in Tignes or Courchevel this winter.

The resort is renowned for its cosmopolitan and sporty atmosphere, ideal for adults and children alike. It is particularly praised for its ad hoc sport facilities and its direct connection to the neighboring resort of Val d’Isere.

Must stay
: Le Taos, a stunning panorama
Catching up with friends, making and sharing memories with your family: this is what ski vacations are for, a heartwarming atmosphere to look forward to. So settle comfortably in Le Taos’ lounge and enjoy it exceptional 360 ° view of the Alps. It is one of the gems of the Tignes Le Lac ski resort in Savoy. The 53 suites will take you on a gentle journey to New Mexico, a theme highlighting the elegant decoration of the rooms with a soothing mineral color palette. Add to this a wellness center, a swimming pool, a restaurant-lounge and a range of services to take care of your every wish… you might hesitate to put your skis on and leave the spellbinding magic of the hotel!

Must do
: This year the totally crazy activity is the Bun J Ride. Take a jump ski, add the techniques of bungee jumping with harnesses for safety and the zip line for the reception… Would not missed that!
