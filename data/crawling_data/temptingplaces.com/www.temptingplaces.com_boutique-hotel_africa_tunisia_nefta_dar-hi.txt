The Destination

Nefta, the desert city

Visit the small city of Nefta at the desert`s gate. Charming mosques, shadowed alleys... You will discover the local craftsmen goldsmith works in the traditional pottery, carpets and fabrics products.
Don`t miss an excursion to the oued, a giant basin of 30 m height, whose inner surface is stiff and steep, and at whose bottom, several hot water springs join together in streams. According to an ancestral irrigation process, those streams feed the area`s palm trees and groves. To fully enjoy this exclusive landscape, we have the right address: "le café de la Corbeille"!

The hotel experience


Innovative and ecologic design

The owners, Patrick Elouarghi and Philippe Chapelet, have imagined Dar Hi with the same spirit as their previous hotel, the Hi Hotel Eco Spa & Beach in Nice: multifunction, innovator and convivial. A hotel that defends sustainable tourism by being permanently in contact with the local population that has participated to the hotel`s construction.

Design, which has once more been assigned to Matali Crasset, is unique again. Once went through the entry door, you`ll find yourself in the common spaces bounded by tangy colors: blue cuisine, fushia restaurant, yellow library. Dar Hi 17 rooms offer 4 different type of rooms, in order to offer to everybody a special look towards the outside and the hotel itself. It`s up to you to choose the room type that best suits you.
Worthy of remark are the Rooms on Stilts, which offer a bow window embellished by pillows, from where you can admire the panoramic view over Nefta`s oasis. The Troglodyte rooms provided with one large bed and two single beds are perfect for families. Lastly, the Dune rooms are surrounded by sand. These open rooms look as if they have been swept together by a sand storm.





The Tempting Experience:

Your head in the stars !


Dar Hi has a futurist aspect, what about Tataouine, the planet imagined by the Star Wars film-maker George Lucas to set its saga decor? The real Tataouine is actually at a few kilometers from Nefta, in the middle of the desert, and you can go and visit this rocky phantom village which has been a world known cinema setting. Admire the sky from the hotel`s terraces, while laying down on the sand in the desert or while looking for Luke Skywalker, at Dar Hi you`ll never be too far away from the stars!
