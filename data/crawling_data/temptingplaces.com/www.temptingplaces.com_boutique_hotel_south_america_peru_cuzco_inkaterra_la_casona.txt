The Destination

The Cuzco region

In Cuzco, you can meet and mingle with the locals, discover the architecture of the conquistador`s descendants (mestizos) and the local traditions which still reflect the historical chapters of Cusco. No doubt, you will detect modern influences as Cusco is perhaps the most international city of Peru. You can visit the cathedral, the Plaza Armes, the la Mercede temple de , the Compania, the convent of Santo Domingo, and the Museum of Pre-Columbian Art.

When you stroll along the cobbled streets of Cuzco, between Inca and colonial monuments, the inhabitants who speak the Quechua language will not hesitate to come and chat to you, especially in markets. You will also find picturesque restaurants and crafts shops.

In addition , the nightlife is simply unique.

From Cuzco, you can take the train to Machu Picchu, visit the Sacred Valley of the Incas, the  fortress of Sacsayhuaman and the archaeological site of Kenko ....

The hotel experience


A luxury and cosy manor house

Built by the first Spanish conquistadors, Inkaterra sought to maintain the original ambience and architecture, echoed in its 8 suites which surround an inner courtyard and 3 suites overlooking the main Plaza. Hence, you can appreciate the patina of several eras, colonial and baroque furniture and the splendour of its Spanish heritage. Through the walls of La Casona, you can revive the splendid reflection of mixed culture and tradition, and you will find yourself following footsteps of legendary travellers who passed by here down through the ages.

In each suite, you can huddle under the duvet, on the abundant pillows, or snuggle up together in front of the living room`s open fireplace. Each suite is further complemented by a luxury bathroom in which you will find an enormous bathtub, all taken together adding up to the uniqueness of these suites.





The Tempting Experience:

A hotel in the heart of Cusco


The hotel is located in a priviledged area of Cusco forged from its varied history, in the square Las Nazarenas next to the Museum of Pre-columbian Art. A privilege which permits you to be on the foundations of the Incan town and in the heart of the city from the moment you step out of the hotel. You can easily  visit by foot the artistic neighbourhood of San Blas, and you will feel the vitality of the former capital of the Inca Empire which later became the colonial centre of Andeans and which today, is one of the most desired destinations.
