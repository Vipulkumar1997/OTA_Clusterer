The hotel experience


A multi-colored hotel in a multi-colored island

The whole resort has been finely built using local resources, in harmony with its unique destination. Everything has been designed by the hotel`s owner Sally Henzell, a theatre-set designer, who took inspiration from Moroccan, Indian and Adobe influences as well as from the Spanish architect Antonio Gaudi. All these different styles transform the hotel in a multi-colored environment which blends perfectly with the local landscape and culture.
The rooms are a combination of chic sensuality, modern luxury and artistic flair. The 30 rooms, cottages and villas, each distinct in its own way, have all an amazing ocean and garden view and large outdoor spaces which will directly plunge you in the wild nature of the island.
For an exclusive view and location we recommend the Deluxe Oceanfront Suite overhanging the water`s edge, could allow you to fish directly off the verandah. And couples have Honeymoon Suites especially addressed to them with private verandas, outside bath and shower overlooking the sea, upstairs patio with daybed and lounging area. Fridge and Ipod dock are all included in every room.





The Tempting Experience:

The ocean as your special holiday soundtrack


At Jakes Hotel guests are accompanied throughout their stay by a special soundtrack; the soundtrack of the ocean. The sound of the waves lapping the shore 24/7 will allow you to disconnect from the rest of the world for a total relax experience! Imagine a nap on the beach, a massage in a sea facing cabana or a yoga session, all framed by a special relaxing soundtrack. That`s what everybody would call a worthy holiday!
