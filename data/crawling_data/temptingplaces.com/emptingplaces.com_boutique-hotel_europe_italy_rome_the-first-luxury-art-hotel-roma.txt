The Destination

A stroll around Rome

A few meters from the hotel, you can find an authentic obelisk from Heliopolis (Egypt), right on the Piazza del Popolo. La porta del Popolo that dominates the square was constructed for the Via Flaminia to connect Rome to the Adriatic Coast.
A little higher in the city is the Villa Borghese, the largest park in Rome. A stroll there is quite extraordinary – there are lakes, temples, fountains, statues and even museums to be found.

The Piazza di Spagna is where Romans meet for a drink. The square is indeed very pleasant with lots of flowers around. The Spanish embassy and a monumental staircase there are particularly loved by photographers.
If you still have a little time, add the Trevi Fountain, Coliseum, Palatino, Pantheon and Vatican to your to-do list.

The hotel experience


Art, design, and Italian refinement

The hotel counts 29 contemporarily decorated rooms. The Double Deluxe ones (20m2) are perfect for a business or family trip, with the possibility to connect 2 adjacent rooms.

The Junior Suites (40m2) have a living room corner with a sofa. The king-sized beds have super comfortable mattresses and are lined with superior quality bedding and a feather duvet. Free Wi-Fi is available. The room is also equipped with a 42-inch LCD television (satellite), a mini-bar, a safe, an iPod station, a writing desk and a direct-line telephone.

In the bathroom you will find shower/bathtubs, scales, bath robes and slippers.





The Tempting Experience:

A private art gallery in your room


Thanks to the expert advice of Galleria Mucciaccia, the curator of all rooms and spaces at The First, the hotel is also a contemporary, lived-in art gallery.
Each room and suite is themed around one artist. Your room is indeed a peaceful cocoon but also a private gallery, for you to enjoy at leisure.
