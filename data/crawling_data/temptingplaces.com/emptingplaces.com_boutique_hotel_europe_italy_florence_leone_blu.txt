The whole history of Florence in a boutique hotel

Leone Blu, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, has been the home of the Ricasoli family for centuries, a family known to have always belonged to the entrepreneurial aristocracy of Florence. The historic residence, now an intimate boutique hotel, is ideally located near the Carraia Bridge in the city centre. The reception is in a majestic hall framed by stone pillars. The imposing staircase then leads to 9 suites, all named after the illustrious family ancestors. The decoration, signed by Pirotecnico Studio, brings a balance between the past and the present, thus elegantly combining the family antiques with contemporary details.

An exclusive address, cherished by discerning travellers, lovers of beautiful objects and Italian culture. A unique immersion in Tuscany!

The Destination

Florence

Already considered a city of art and culture, the historic centre of Florence was also proclaimed in 1982 a UNESCO World Heritage Site. From the Uffizi to the Vasari Corridor, hundreds of museums, palaces and churches await, a wonderful opportunity to discover the secrets of the city as well as its illustrious masters, Giotto, Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli.

The list of annual events include the Pitti Immagine, bringing to Florence the international jet set as well as professionals specialising in design and fashion. Another wonderful event is the Florence Youth Festival, which in turn transforms the city into an open air concert.

The hotel experience


An aristocrat family’s residence

Neither a palace nor a house, Leone Blu is a boutique hotel focusing on emotions: here, culture and architecture complement each other, hospitality bridging past and present beautifully.

In the nineteenth century, Palazzo Ricasoli Firidolfi already was a hotel: the Grand Hotel de New York. This fabulous house hosted the most famous names during their touring of Europe - Tchaikovsky, to name only one. The current name of the Hotel, Leone Blu means Blue Lion, a reference to the Ricasoli’s coat -of- arms.

Baroness Ricasoli recently trusted the renovation project to the Piero Brarda’s Studio Pirotecnico who focused on two aspects: using assets such as the family’s vintage furniture or the skylight in the lobby, simply adding modern details here and there. Maybe a vibrant touch of colour, a transparency effect and objects used in an unexpected and clever way.

Each suite is unique in its style and decor. Some are set on two floors, others display exceptional frescoes on the walls and coffered ceilings. The furniture are original and belong to the family. The views of Florence prove incredibly magical, whether featuring the street del Parione, the Piazza Goldoni or the River Arno.

If indeed, you fancy a view on the River Arno, do ask to stay in the Rinieri, Geremia, Giuliana, Giovanni Battista or Ugo suites. If you fancy a view of the city  ask to stay in the Orazio suite.

Lovers of 18th century art will appreciate with no doubt the Gisla or Pandolfo suites and their vaulted ceiling decorated with frescoes and stucco. The Bindaccio Suite, more contemporary, is highlighted with beautiful pieces inspired  by works of art of Sol Le Witt.


Another advantage of Leone Blu: its perfect location, ideal to enjoy the sun set over the San Frediano di Castello church, very romantic indeed.






The Tempting Experience:

The keys of the Palazzo Ricasoli, the keys of Florence


Baroness Maria Teresa Ricasoli Firidolfi insists on welcoming the travellers to Leone Blu herself. She loves to share anecdotes about the keys of the palace, the town, her family and how this palace has been a hotel the last 500 years while keeping both its soul and many secrets. For the length of your stay in this magnificent part of Tuscany, you will almost feel like a Florentine…
