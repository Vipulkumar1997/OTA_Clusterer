The Destination

Discover the charm of Koh Phangan

On this island of idyllic landscapes, you can go trekking to Khao Ra, the highest point of the island: beautiful and very exotic!

See the famous waterfalls of Than Sadet, much appreciated by the Thai royal family, and enjoy the beautiful beaches available to you like Thong Nai Pan Noi and Yai.

Angthong National Park, with its "Emerald Lake" is about 1h from Santhiya Resort & Spa.

We also mention the famous Full Moon Party which takes place regularly on the island several kilometers from the hotel which is an experience of its own. Note that the party will not in any way disturb the tranquility of your stay in Santiya.

The hotel experience


Elegant rooms with ocean views and teak villas with infinity pools

On arrival, you will be taken to a wonderful reception area decorated with carved wood, and you will receive a 15 minute massage while sipping on fresh coconut juice before heading to your room.

The rooms and villas are scattered around a tropical garden with banana and coconut trees, and can be accessed by small golf carts. The art of Thai sculpture is perfectly illustrated in the furniture and exotic decorations carved out of teak wood. Beds, ceilings, terraces, and decorative panels are as delicately carved as pictures and original works of art. The white cotton curtains, silk cushions, lighting, wood, coconut and incense burners invite you to discover the refinement and luxury of Thailand. In the rooms you will find silk robes embroidered with elephants with matching slippers.

Choose between the 6 categories of rooms:

The Santhiya Deluxe Rooms offer beautiful views overlooking the bay with authentic decoration (and lots of carved teak wood).
The Santhiya Supreme Deluxe rooms are located on the top of the hill overlooking the natural landscape. They are surrounded by waterfalls and have a wonderful view of the pool or jungle.
The Santhiya Hideway Pool Villa Suite is perfect for honeymoons with its private pool, outdoor Jacuzzi, and terrace overlooking the natural surroundings.
The Santhiya Sea View Villa Suite additionally offers a private swimming pool where you can relax outside while enjoying an unforgettable day on the bay! Our favorite room!
Families will undoubtedly appreciate the Santhiya Grand Villa Suite with 2 bedrooms.
Finally, experience the ultimate Santhiya Royal Pool Villa Suite where the infinity pool appears to flow into the sea!





The Tempting Experience:

The art of sculpture “scarving


The Thai architecture of the hotel is composed of thousands of details. At Santhiya Koh Phangan Resort & Spa, the carved teak wood is a delight for your eyes ... there is not a single building, statue, or piece of furniture that is not delicately carved. Thai art is also found in the hotels` kitchen where the presentation of the dishes is as important as the taste!

You can also take a course to learn the art of carving fruit and vegetables to experience this technique firsthand.
