The Destination

Etretat

This part of Normandy is called Côte d’Albatre or Alabaster coast, in reference to the colour of the high cliffs along the Channel. An underground river together with erosion caused by the sea formed the spectacular landscape of limestone cliffs in Etretat. Maupassant even compared the picturesque arch at the Porte d’Aval, which you can glimpse from the Domaine Saint Clair, to an elephant with its trunk in the water… At low-tide, enjoy a stroll on the beach or in the Valleuses, small plateaus found halfway up the cliffs. Alternatively, the path to the needle of Aval at Manneporte will take you through the beautiful Jambour valleuse.

The hotel experience


A balcony overlooking the cliffs of Etretat

A small stone path through the hills of Etretat leads the way to Donjon, originally a medieval fortress dating back to 1862 and converted into an elegant villa in 1889. The stone walls, ivy-covered turret and authentic glass roof pay homage to the historical beauty of the place. The view opens onto the sea: the Hollow Needle and the Porte d’Aval, symbols of this beautiful Normandy town, are visible through the tree line. The interior emphasises the refined spirit of the 19th century while adding a modern touch. Sit down next to the crackling fireplace in the library and enjoy the works of local authors: (Maupassant, Flaubert, Proust…) or gaze the paintings adorning the walls, works by contemporary artists of the nearby village, Domaine Saint Clair.

The hotel has 21 guestrooms, each dedicated to a different historical figure. All are equipped with either a Jacuzzi or a spa shower and each enjoys a view of either the sea or the park.

The Pierre Loti room, in the Donjon tower, is perfect for a romantic getaway with its glamorous large round Jacuzzi and a gorgeous view of the sea. For a relaxing stay, book the Junior Suite Sarah Berhardt, featuring both a Jacuzzi and a steam shower: your own private spa!






The Tempting Experience:

Escape through time


Celebrities of the Belle Epoque (whether real or fictional characters) have inspired the names of the guestrooms. Sarah Bernhardt, Marcel Proust, Claude Monet… The decoration of each room focuses on elegant hints through the colour scheme, themed objects and books. No doubt you will be in excellent company when staying at the Domaine de Saint Clair.







Classifications & Awards



Villegiature Awards - 2014
