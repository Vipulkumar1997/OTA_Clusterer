A 20 minutes drive from Cape Town, the small village of Hout Bay is located in a beautiful valley between mountains and beaches. The walking Netherlands Jan Van Riebeeck described the region in 1652 as covered with forest (which are name, `Baie des bois "in French).

Sea side, the Hout Bay beach, you can go windsurfing, and one of the most beautiful beaches called Llandudno. Mountain side, you`re spoiled for choice around you for beautiful walks, with stunning views.

You can also take a ride on the island seals (Duiker Island), where 6,000 seals are the clowns, or visit the World of Bird, "one of the largest parks in Africa with over 400 bird species and animals.

If you want to know more about the history of this region, Hout Bay even has a museum!

The port of Hout Bay is lively and there are fish restaurants and seafood freshly caught.
Every Sunday, do not miss the market for your shopping ... And for lovers of small trees, you can buy a bonsai to Bishopsford Bonsai Nursery.

The hotel experience


Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Sangoma or influence the people of South Africa

The different types of rooms bear suggestive names! Names of South African tribu for the rooms: the Xhosa against the mountain, the Sotho with their terrace and outdoor shower, the Zulu overlooking the pool and garden. Same view for sequences which themselves call Sangoma (traditional healers).

All differently decorated, the 19 rooms have retained a colonial style incorporating elements of Zulu and Xhosa chic. Designers South African "Cecile and Boyd`s" also used bright colors and beautiful fabrics to create a contrast with the stone walls of this historic building.

You will find in your room a bottle of sparkling water "Hout Bay Manor" but also all the comfort you could wish for: air conditioning or heating on the ground, flat screen TV, free WiFi, minibar ... and even a small basket to go on a picnic!





The Tempting Experience:

Lots of little touches


At Hout Bay Manor, you`ll be a pampered guest. Many little touches make all the difference: you will find on every floor of jars filled with candy licorice, marshmallows and biscuits, the children receive a box of toys and a small gift by age on arrival, pencils and watercolor are in the room if you want to try drawing ...
