The hotel experience


Cocooning under the snow

With a view of either the forest and slopes or mountains and village, the 24 rooms and 11 suites, all decorated by Tristan Auer, are highlighted by a play of soft and enveloping light. The materials were chosen for their noblesse : mirror bedside table lamps, silk lampshades, black lacquered tables, aged hardwood floors, velours drapes. The Superior Room ( 25m² ) contains a king size bed, plaid duvet, open sitting area, bathroom with bathtub, bathrobes and slippers. The Prestige Suite ( 60m²) is composed of a master room with king size bed, plaid duvet, separate sitting area, bathroom with Jacuzzi and rain shower, monogrammed bathrobes and slippers.





The Tempting Experience:

An enchanting hotel


Once upon a time in a wooden cabin under the snow... This is how you can start your stay at la Sivolière. In the lounge the fire is crackling... Comfortably curled up on the sofa, a good book between your hands, the candles twinkling...You will think to yourself that fairies have always looked over this magical place.
