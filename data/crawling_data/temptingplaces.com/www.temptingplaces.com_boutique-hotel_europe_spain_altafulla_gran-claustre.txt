A boutique hotel on the Costa Dorada, south of Barcelona

The boutique hotel Gran Claustre, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located just below the castle that dominates the medieval centre of Altafulla, on the stunning Catalonian coastline called Costa Dorada or "the golden coast".
Ideally placed between land and sea it is just 1km from the beach and 15km from the city of Tarragona, a World Heritage Site, listed by UNESCO for its outstanding Roman ruins. This 4-star hotel has retained the charm of an 18th century cloister while combining contemporary design and comfort in its 39 rooms. The gourmet restaurant and spa complete the range of services available at the Gran Claustre, an ideal retreat for a weekend exploring the southern region of Barcelona, a relaxing or romantic break in Spain.





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary early check-in and late check-out (upon availabilities)
- 15% coupon on SPA treatments

The Destination

The Costa Dorada

The Costa Dorada spans from the South of Barcelona down to the delta of the River Elbe, offering a range of activities on both land and sea. The region is proud of its wine and architectural heritage.

Seaside getaway
With its 92km of fine sand beaches and coves the region has a lot to offer. The coast owes its name to the golden colour of its sand. Altafulla, just one kilometre from the hotel, is a fantastic beach right by the medieval walled city, Creixell, Cala of the Sirens and Platja del Torn are among the most beautiful beaches in the region.

A cultural break
Tarragona has been listed a World Heritage Site by UNESCO for its precious Roman remains. The Tarragona Circus, one of the best preserved buildings in the city, was built in the 1st century BC and used for Roman chariot races and other popular shows at the time. The amphitheatre, built in the early second century, overlooks the sea.

The perfect getaway for wine lovers
The five designations of origin for Cava will simply delight wine lovers. We recommend the old terraced vineyards of Priorat and Montsant or the hilly landscape of the Conca de Barbera. The hotel offers walking or bike tours for those wishing to discover more about the region.

The hotel experience


Heritage and modern comfort

The golden-bronze façade of the Gran Claustre opens onto a hundred-year-old cloister, its architecture typical of the region. Balconies with wrought iron on the street side, galleries around the patio, heavy wooden shutters bear witness to a rich Catalan heritage. The architect draws attention to this history by playing with the transparency of glass walls, thus revealing centuries-old stones. The centre of the patio opens onto a swimming pool, perfect to dip in and cool off. The rooftop terrace overlooks the breathtaking Costa Dorada, presenting in a single glance the sea and the castles of Tamarit and Altafulla.

Each very unique, the 39 rooms are spread between two buildings facing each other. The 20 rooms within the historical side are named according to their colour: Vanilla, Sumac Asia, Coal... The 19 rooms in the new part of the hotel find inspiration in luxurious metals and precious stones: Platinum, Turquoise, Ruby, Jade...

If you wish for extra privacy during your stay, do ask for the suite with its private solarium and Jacuzzi.






The Tempting Experience:

A dinner with the chef


The Bruixes de Buriac restaurant is renowned for its talented chef Jaume Drudis’s creative cuisine but also for its kitchen, open to the guests for dinner. Each evening, a table of 6* is laid directly in the kitchen, a fabulous opportunity to admire the chef and his team at work. A unique dining experience!
* Booking required.
