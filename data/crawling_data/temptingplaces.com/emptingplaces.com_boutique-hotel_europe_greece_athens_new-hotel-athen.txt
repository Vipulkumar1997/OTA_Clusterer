A design hotel in the center of Athens

New Hotel Athens, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is the first hotel project from Brazilian designers Fernando and Humberto Campana. The large picture windows, the bamboo floors and furniture and the touches of folklore give a certain bohemian soul to this new design hotel situated in the heart of Athens. The 79 guestrooms and suites remix the local culture in a new eco-design version.The rooftop bar and the organic restaurant are definitely the new urban spot to discover the Greek capital.

The hotel is situated between the lively Plaka district, perfect for going out at night, and the national Garden, the lungs of the Greek capital. The Acropolis and its museum are within a fifteen minute walk. Other cultural treasures are accessible by public transportation such as the Benaki museum, the Cycladic art museum, the Monastiraki, or the open-air market, an inevitable part of every Sunday morning!

The hotel experience


A creative urban design

New Hotel’s name suits it perfectly! Until a few months ago, stood here the Olympic hotel, from which all of the materials for New Hotel were gathered, recycled, and reused to transform the space into a modern hotel with an atypical design. The Campana brothers involved local students in the design process as well as regional architects and artisans to create the hotel’s new modern feel. The result: a masterpiece of a hotel and a lively address to stay at.
The décor of the 79 guestrooms revolves around three themes inspired by Greek folklore. The golden silhouettes of Karagiozis, a character from Greek legends, hang from the walls and watch over you to ensure pleasant dreams. Vintage postcards from Athens are an unusual glimpse of the world of tourism. Evil eyes, usually found on amulets to ward off evil spirits, are restyled in a formation of LED lights that illuminate the room like a starry night sky.
The surprising copper sinks in the bathrooms, shaped like fragments of rock, might fool you for a modern sculpture. The welcome products are by Kiehl’s or Apivita.

One of our favorite rooms is the Superior, located on the 6th floor, which boasts a panoramic view of Mount Lycabettus, the hill which overlook the city.

The Penthouse Suite offers a 360° view of all the monuments of the city; Acropolis, Mount Lycabettus, Syntagma Square, and the Parliament building are all at your fingertip





The Tempting Experience:

A baroque renovation by the Campana's brothers


Dakis Joannou, the hotels' owner, chose the stars of Brazilian design, Humberto and Fernando Campana for their vibrant creativity. They had "carte blanche" to develop their concept on the ground of a 60's hotel. With an eco-urban perspective some materials, wooden doors, chairs were indeed re-used, from the ancient hotel, to create an exentric and contemporary soul to New Hotel Athens.
