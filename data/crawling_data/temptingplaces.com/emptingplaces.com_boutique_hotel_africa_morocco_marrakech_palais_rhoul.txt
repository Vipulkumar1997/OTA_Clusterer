The Destination

Marrakech`s Palmeraie

The legend tells of a nomad who pitched his tent in the desert. He ate a lot of dates, and thus created the palm tree grove. But we know that the Palmeraie was planted under the dynasty of the Almoravids in the XIIth century. An ingenious irrigation system of khettaras, drawing water from the depths, was used at that time so that the magic would stay.

This part of Marrakech is 13 000 hectares large and covered with over 100 000 trees. The palm grove is magical and sumptuous and it allows you to dream of the glories of the past, in the shade of the palm trees.

The hotel experience


Luxurious decor in a beautiful garden

magine a palace with columns supporting high vaulted ceilings in front of large windows, and white curtains billowing in the wind, caressing water basins where floating flower petals release their mesmerizing scent.

The lounge welcomes you with its deep sofas, armchairs, and cushions beside the fireplace. A black piano, shelves covered with bound books, and paintings of masters on the walls, give an appearance of a bygone century: a time when the reception in a palace was an auspicious moment. At the Palais Rhoul, this very much remains the case! You will feel privileged in this spacious and stylish, quiet and sweet place.

The suites and rooms offer precious treasures: signed paintings on the wall, authentic furniture, braided fabrics, artifacts from the entire world, and works of art carefully collected by the owners.

Each suite, room, or tent is incredible and unique. But to give you an idea of what you could find at the Palais Rhoul, here are some examples: la chambre des nues is a small suite overlooking the garden, with an exquisite collection of nude statues. The concubine room is a poolside room with an eastern decorative theme, a dominant color of scarlet, and objects from the Far East. The Royal Tent is a deluxe suite facing the pool where one feels like a warlord with its fireplace and fur. Finally, the Palais Rhoul Master Tent is the most luxurious; it is very exclusive with a heated pool in its VIP Park.





The Tempting Experience:

A night in a Moroccan caïdale tent!


Grandiose, romantic, fantastic... these are some words that will come to mind when you enter a tent in the Palais Rhoul. Discover an original way of experiencing Moroccan culture: a traditional Moroccan tent called "caïdale tent", deluxe, planted in the garden, for a night of dreams.
The heavy white and black linen hides a private domain with canopy bed, fireplace, large bath, indoor pool and patio. The traditional tent will become the home of your own oriental fairy tale!







Classifications & Awards






In the press



“Palais Rhoul & Spa in Marrakech is unique and majestic. It is one these extraordinary places that belong to no genre and defy any classification."

The Travelers, 2009 special-series



"ThePalais Rhoul is a sublime address where each old object has been carefully chosen and where the soft patina of Tadlak offers an atmosphere far removed from the glitz of some palaces of Marrakech.”

Marie Claire june 2009



"At the center of the palm grove of Marrakech is an ancient palace that seems straight out of the myths and legends of childhood."

Maroc Chic

The Services


Garden
The Palais Rhoul Garden is a wonderful place of freshness and beauty. The palm trees and rose garden give the opportunity to relax in the shade on a deck chair, breathing the delicious fragrances. Chairs and tables are arranged on the lawns, here and there.
Spa & Wellness
The traditional Moorish baths, in the back of the garden, is an invitation to travel: aromatic oils, traditional massages, body treatments, relaxation room ... It has 5 large rooms and a fountain. The first room, made of Syrian marble with an old brick ceiling, is the hall and also serves as a relaxation room. The second room is moderately hot and allows you to become accustomed to the humidity. The last room is used to wash and stretch over the almost burning slab.... Time seems suspended in the Moorish baths: the pleasure of the bath, beauty, body and fullness ... A traditional Sufi massage with natural essences completes a sense of well-being...
Swimming pool
The swimming pool, surrounded by vines in the colonnaded rotunda, is incredibly nice to refresh yourself on hot days. And when it is cooler, you can also swim in the heated pool.
