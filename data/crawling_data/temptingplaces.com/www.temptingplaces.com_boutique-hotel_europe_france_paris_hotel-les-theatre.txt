A boutique hotel with a theatrical staging

Set in a charming, typically Parisian building near the Grands Boulevards and the theatre district, the hotel les Théâtres, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, may look discreet but trust us, it does know how to put on a show. Fully renovated and refurbished by Elsa Bartolone and Sandrine Gouin from the Bastie agency, it will prove the perfect location to experience the artistic, festival atmosphere of the City of Lights. The luxurious touches of red velvet on cushions and chairs will remind you of luxurious music halls while the corridors, decorated with posters of successful plays, are sure to captivate your imagination. The 38 rooms are dedicated to 3 of the greatest French playwrights: Molière, Feydeau and Cocteau. After all, what could be more inspiring for a Parisian stay - whether a holiday or a business trip – than a literary twist?

The Destination

Paris, les Grands Boulevards

Les Theatres is ideally located in the heart of the Sentier, famous for its textile companies and many fashion brands having started their business here before becoming internationally famous – Kookai to name only one. It is now one of the trendy areas of Paris, featuring a fascinating mix of timeless shops and up and coming names.

- Only Bagel offers a wide selection of bagels and pastries but also organizes mini-exhibitions
- Maison Sajou, a gem of a shop, could be described as a wonderland for haberdashery lo
- The SLA concept store feels like a temple dedicated to beauty
- The Frenchie wine bar has a wonderful selection of wines, selected from passionate, little known producers.

La Bourse, the Opera, the Marais, the Grands Boulevards all lead to Les Grands Magasin (famous Parisian department stores) while theaters are within walking distance.

The hotel experience


Let the show begin

The magic begins as soon as you step in the lobby of this stunning boutique hotel, decorated in a classic café-theater style: a zinc bar, comfortable high red velvet stools, a Tief chandelier reclaimed from an old theatre create all contribute to a Belle Epoque atmosphere.

The Bastie agency put all their heart in the decor: 7 floors inspired by three of the greatest French writers, having particularly influenced his era: Molière, Feydeau and Cocteau. Each door features a quote from these famous artists, bringing their spirit back to life.

These themes are divided into 3 types of rooms: Classic, Superior and the more spacious Suites. To make the most of your Parisian stay, indulge in a room on the fifth or sixth floor! The beautiful terraces overlook the City of light, guaranteeing a memorable experience.





The Tempting Experience:

A tribute to the artists


Les Theatres is designed as a real standing ovation for three masters of French dramaturgy: Molière, Feydeau and Cocteau, each having described the society of his time through comedy, farce or poetry.

Molière plays are real classics: Don Juan, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Imaginary Invalid... The rooms, named after his most famous pieces, are framed with Versailles-worthy gilding and silk, showcasing the decadent luxury of the 17th century. After all, Molière arranged quite a few representations for Le Roi Soleil Louis XIV, the Sun King.
Feydeau excelled in Vaudeville and you will find in the rooms dedicated to his life many references to his play “Sauce for the goose”. Expect the wonderful comfort of a family home of the 19th century bourgeoisie.
The Cocteau rooms highlight the poetic world of the artist. The dominant color is an elegant “castaing" blue, in honor of the decorator Madeleine Castaing, a friend of the author. The hand-shaped Virebent lights create a parallel to his play “Beauty and the Beast”.
It is now up to you to choose the décor or well, the programme, of the evening(s)…
