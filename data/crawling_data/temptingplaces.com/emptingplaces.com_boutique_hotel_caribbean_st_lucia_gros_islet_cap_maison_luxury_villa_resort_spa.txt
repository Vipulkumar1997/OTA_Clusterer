The Destination

Gros Islet

Cap Maison is located in the region of Gros Islet, on the northern tip of the island. A steep hike to Fort Rodney and Signal Peak in the nearby Pigeon Island national park offers breath-taking views of the whole island and nearby Martinique.
Rodney Bay is a fairly touristy and international area. But on Friday nights, the locals go to Gros Islet (the town) for a lively night of soca (music and dance) and street parties. This fishing village has retained its authenticity and charm, still boasting one of the prettiest beaches on the island.

The hotel experience


22 hacienda-style villas

Cap Maison was designed by world-renowned Caribbean architect Lane Pettigrew. Each villa offers spaces that can be combined depending on whether you prefer one, two or three bedrooms.
The rooms and junior suites each have a private balcony. The villa suites all have stunning views and feature a bedroom, kitchen and lounge/dining room. Some of the suites also include a private Jacuzzi or infinity pool. The facilities will surely meet all of your expectations!

The decoration is Spanish colonial inspired - wooden four poster beds, ceramic bathrooms, white walls, wooden window shutters, wrought iron railings... An elegant atmosphere designed to let in the sea breeze and Caribbean light softly.

Cap Maison Luxury Villa Resort & Spa is also environmentally focused. By using solar heating and recycled water for irrigation, the hotel ensures that the beautiful surroundings remain untouched by its presence.






The Tempting Experience:

The Rock House perched on the cliff


If you are looking for a privileged location within the resort, it has to be the Rock House, an intimate secret gem. Walk down the staircase and you will reach a wooden platform right on the cliff, overlooking the sea. Just imagine drinking cocktails until the sun sets, enjoying an exclusive dinner, or even a massage on this terrace!
Yoga and Tai Chi lessons are also on offer early in the morning. If that weren’t enough, a small wicker basket on a pulley can be brought down with breakfast, champagne, whatever your heart desires. In a nutshell: a romantic place lulled by the sounds of the ocean and birds.
