The Destination

Tignes

Framed by the glaciers of Pisaillas and the Grande Motte, the skiing surface of the Tignes and Val d'Isère area in the Alps covers more than 300 km of trails. The resort is renowned for its cosmopolitan and sporty atmosphere, ideal for adults and children alike. It was even voted the "Most Athletic City" by the French sports newspaper L'Equipe, and particularly praised for its ad hoc sport facilities. Located in the heart of the Espace Killy ski area, the resort enjoys a direct connection to the neighboring resort of Val d'Isere.

The hotel experience


From Taos to Tignes, a hotel inspired by the Native American culture

Just as Tignes, the village of Tao in New Mexico, is surrounded by mountains, a real skiers delight. Interior designer Francine Conejero found inspiration in these snowy landscapes, their hypnotizing wildness and infused Le Taos décor with touches reminiscent of nature. You will notice references to the Native American culture: feathers in the wallpaper theme, natural materials such as soft leather and light wood, ethnic patterns. The color palette follows the soft, mineral tones found in a desert highlighted by a more vibrant hint of turquoise here and there. This ethnic-chic feel will is completed with furniture custom-made in Italy.

For an intimate stay we do recommend one of the hotel Suites. Families and groups of friends will love the comfortable Suites Apartments, perfect for 2 to 6 people. Set as either on a one level or as a duplex, they include at least two separate bedrooms, a living room and 2 bathrooms.






The Tempting Experience:

Stunning panorama, 2100 metres in altitude


Catching up with friends, making and sharing memories with your family: this is what ski vacations are for, a heartwarming atmosphere to look forward to. So settle comfortably in Le Taos’ lounge and enjoy it exceptional 360 ° view of the Alps, from the Aiguille Percée to the Grande Sassière. It’s time to relax, fully take in the landscape and chat till late in the night…
