A luxury hotel overlooking the sea

Jade Mountain, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is perched atop a hill overlooking the beach in the region of la Soufriere on the west coast of the small Caribbean island of St Lucia. A boutique hotel that is impressive thanks to its lofty bridges and balconies, rugged stone pillars reaching towards the sky and amazing swimming pools… It is not just a luxury hotel by the sea... It is a truly magical place! The suites appear to be floating out into nature with the fourth wall entirely absent. Instead you will find an oversized private infinity pool from which to embrace breathtaking views of the Caribbean. Staying at Jade Mountain will provide a feeling of being alone in the world, in a stylish and sophisticated space, where everything is tailored to provide a feeling of fullness. The location is ideally suited for couples looking to disconnect from reality and enjoy many memorable moments!

The hotel experience


Airy and sophisticated suites

The owner and renowned architect Nick Troubetzkoy fell in love with St Lucia and imagined a hotel that would immerse guests in a unique sensory experience with extraordinary comfort and breathtaking views.
From your bed you will be able to see the Pitons of St Lucia, a UNESCO heritage site, as well as the Caribbean Sea. Huge openings give a sense of communion with nature and create a feeling of floatation in space. Jade Mountain has also been designed to produce a carefully orchestrated sensory experience: the swimming-pool water flowing off the edge of the infinity pool guides the eye from the water to the sky, from the sky to the earth, from the earth to the sun and later up to the stars.
The hotel's 24 suites are called "sanctuaries" as they are designed to be areas of relaxation for guests to rejuvenate themselves. Though all suites, be they "Star," "Moon", or "Sun", follow this philosophy, they are all also very unique and different in size, shape, color and decoration. Even their bathrooms and toilets are tailor-made. The decoration features much locally handcrafted wooden furniture. Definitely their best feature is the large private swimming pool with a small terrace, built into the room itself, leading to the outside.
The 5 "Sky" suites have a jacuzzi instead of the swimming pool.





The Tempting Experience:

Infinity pools and chromotherapy


Each pool has a different color: ruby red, amber, plum, with green or blue stunning reflections. The color selection is not arbitrary as Jade Mountain works on color therapy as part of their holistic well-being concept. The therapeutic and medicinal properties of this practice rely on the principle that the human body responds to the energy levels radiated by different colors. Bright colors (yellow, red ...) provide stimulation whilst cold or pastels (blue, green ...) relax and improve sleep. So choose the color of your pool based on your energy needs and intentions!
Bathrooms are an integral part of the experience as they use the same chromotherapy technique and are in harmony with the color of the swimming pools. So let the colors continue to do their magic while you enjoy the magnificent views from your jet tub.
You'll feel privileged, floating as if in a dream …memories for a lifetime!
