The Destination

Destination Oualidia

A seaside resort almost as popular as the mythical Essaouira, Oualidia has succeeded in keeping its authentic fishing village charm. Picnics in the lagoon, fine sand beaches along the estuary, oyster-farming, the best Moroccan sea oysters and spider crabs tastings... There are plenty of things to do in Oualidia!

You will be impressed by the many local activities: walk along the rocky coast, or take the vaporetto along the lagoon. For only a hundred dihrams, boats come to pick you up on the river, to bring you up towards the lagoon`s heart, home of the oyster park, and they let you get off wherever you prefer.

Don`t miss the Saturday`s appointment: the traditional Oualidia`s souk! During this day, the city comes alive to welcome the medina`s tumult, that will make you feel like in Marrakech.

The hotel experience


Sober luxury and ecology

Built in stones as a Moorish fortress, The Sultana Oualidia, oriented towards the outside, dominates its environment. The hotel has been thought to minimize the impact on the fragile ecosystem of the region; it is in fact 100% ecologic for what concerns the water treatment.

The lagoon, the ocean, Jacuzzis and terraces seguias... water is the hotel's key element, reflected in all suites, that have been decorated with a gorgeous and elegant taste. Pink tadelakt walls, painted wood vintage furniture, aged marble floors, rose-bay wood ceilings, Régis Delène-Bartholdi paintings, canopies... Everything transmits a soft colors harmony and a warm well being sensation.
The Deluxe Suite, is definitely our favorite, with its teak terrace, brighten up by a sea water Jacuzzi and deckchairs to take the most advantage of the exceptional view over the gardens and the lagoon`s turquoise water.





The Tempting Experience:

The whole sea on your plate!


Nestled in the middle of an oyster park, on the lagoon La Sultana's restaurant, Le Plancher, makes good use of the sea delicacies available. Specialized in seafood, this gourmet restaurant offers oysters, crabs, spider crabs, turtles, lobsters, sea urchins, freshly fished, prepared with sauces of all kinds, with quality fruits and vegetables from local producers. The restaurant boasts a huge fishpond as well, guaranteeing absolute freshness on your plate.
