The Destination

Gokarna and the Karnataka

Gokarna is a small town in the south west of India, in the wonderful Karnataka state. It is renowned for its temple dedicated to Shiva. The hotel provides guided tour of the site, the village, and the temple. A boat cruise is organised once a week to visit the surrounding parasise-like beaches.
In addition to the visit of the town and the surrounding region proposed by the hotel you can continue your trip further in others places: Bidar in a remote corner of the northern Karnataka, jewel of the islamic architectural art; Bangalore where high tech is mixed to the culture in particular in the maharajas palaces, the Badami caves, the Hanuman temple. In short, Karnataka is worth the visit!

The hotel experience


Find your inner voice

“Swa” in Sanskrit means “the self” and “Swara” refers to “sound”. Therefore the hotel’s name would mean “inner rythm” or “intimate ryme”. SwaSwara hotel is an invitation to stimulate the personal expression and self-fulfilment through art activities, yoga, ayurveda treatments, and meditation sessions…
The villas are built in harmony with the surrounding landscape and the local traditions: thatched roof, stone walls with colours symbolizing the energy of earth and a minimalist decoration that encourages the spiritual retreat. Let yourself be lulled by the ocean’music and the natural sea breeze fragrance.
The rooms are spacious and comfortable villas with a private garden and a terrace at the second floor, so you can practice some yoga while enjoying the ocean view and the surrounding nature.
To respect the environment, the bathroom products are home-made and packed in lovely ceramic containers. The  lemongrass and holly basil in each villa's garden can be used to concoct your own energising herbal tea every morning.





The Tempting Experience:

“Swa” vacation: release, relax, slow down


SwaSwara invites you to an inner trip and offers a personalized program cared by yogi masters from different schools (kriyas, Yoga nidra, Meditation, and Pranayama), ayurveda doctors and naturopaths. Within a week you learn how to release, relax, to slow your rhythm down and listen to your inner voice, your “swara”. The program includes medical consultations, abhyanga ayurveda massages, yoga sessions, art classes, nature walks, boat cruise, daily cooking class with the chef and the visit of the Gokarna temple. Know yourself and know your environment, this is the way to a complete well-being!
