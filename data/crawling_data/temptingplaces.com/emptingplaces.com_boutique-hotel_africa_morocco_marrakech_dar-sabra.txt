The Destination

Marrakech, city of art

The Majorelle Garden

To complete the Dar Sabra`s artistic atmosphere nothing can be more enchanting than a Majorelle Garden tour. Created in 1920 by the artist Français Jacques Majorelle where he installed his own atelier, it has been completely renovated by the designer Yves Saint Laurent in 2000. The garden boasts today plants from the 5 continents exposed in a magical place, and to keep being loyal to the initial project, the collection grew richer with several rare species. The flora of the Majorelle garden has thereby increased from 135 species in 1999 to the 300 current species. The place boasts as well the beautiful Islamic art collection of Pierre Bergé et Yves Saint Laurent.

Marrakech Art Fair

The contemporary art fair comes back for its second edition in Marrakech from the 4th to 7th October 2012 with the participation of more than 40 international galleries. For this opus, the organizers will underline the Mediterranean and African art welcoming South Africa as guest of honor.

The hotel experience


A hotel where design and the art of welcoming blend together

The owner and collector François Chapoutot imagined a futurist oasis to shelter his impressive contemporary art pieces collection. The Dar Sabra`s building has been inspired by the works of the Mexican architects Barragan & Legorreta, creating a particular house, an out of the ordinary hotel in Marrakech, where the minimalist pureness of the lines cuts the Moroccan blue sky.

A  cow made of plants and created by Di Rosa welcomes you with an eye wink in the spectacle you`ll find in front of you. Get in... The patio will let you in an epicurean lounge with fireplace and a terrace leading towards the outside... the journey begins...
The Dar Sabra is a hotel characterized by its majestic garden and pools. The arch, by Marco Staccioli, that steps over the big pool, reflects itself into the water in a red curve like a kiss with a graffiti wall signed by the American artist Seen. A pop-rock atmosphere where each refined detail is a sign of luxury.

Genuine Moroccan, Asian zen, Precious Indian, bright Afghan, the 22 hotel`s rooms and suites all echo an imaginary journey. The traditional tadelakt walls capture the Moroccan light and perfectly blend with the modern furniture. Design and comfort alliance, precious beauty for details.. that`s what makes The Dar Sabra one of those hotels where you feel yourself like at home.

Particular attention must be dedicated to the gorgeous Villa Di Rosa surrounded by its olive trees garden and totally independent from the rest of the hotel. Two rooms, a terrace, a patio and a counter current pool complete the services of this pavilion, perfect to spend unforgettable holidays with your family or with friends taking advantage of all the hotel`s top of the range services.





The Tempting Experience:

An artistic dream, a museum hôtel


You will be charmed by the contemporary sculptures and the frescoes. François Chapoutot, contemporary art collector and owner of the property, paid tribute to the best modern and contemporary artists by exposing their works everywhere around the hotel. Rodrigo Solorzano, Erro, Guy de Rougemont, Leopold Maler ... the artists talent, is reflected on the walls, in the garden, in the rooms, and brings colors and fantasy, transforming this place in a unique and innovative concept.
