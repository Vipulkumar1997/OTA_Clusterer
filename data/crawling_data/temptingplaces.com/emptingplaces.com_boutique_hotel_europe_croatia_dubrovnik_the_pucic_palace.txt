The luxury of a 17th century mansion

Both close to the sea and at the heart of the Dubrovnik historical centre, the Pucic Palace, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is in harmony with the spirit and soul of the old town. Set in an authentic baroque mansion of the 17th century, this 5 star hotel is a mere 30 minutes’ drive from the airport and 10 minutes from the Marina. The 19 suites and rooms, overlooking the Gundulic place, all reflect the former luxury enjoyed by a noble family, in a charming and warm atmosphere. It will prove ideal for a romantic weekend or simply as a starting point to discover the wonders of Croatia.

The Destination

Dubrovnik, a pearl of the Adriatic

Located on the Dalmatian peninsula, Dubrovnik will steal your heart. Surrounded by beautiful ramparts, its shows a sea of red tiled roofed houses and a maze of alleys. This Latin and Slav city was severely damaged through time but still has monuments, churches, monasteries, palaces and fountains in gothic, renaissance and baroque styles. Quite an architectural wealth! Unesco listed the city as world heritage and helped restore its beauty. The former medieval city is now known as a masterpiece of art and harmony, mixing centuries worth of influences.

The hotel experience


Contemporary comfort and yesteryear atmosphere

So much history: a white stone facade, authentic works of art, 17th century stairs, antique furniture, olive or oak wooden floor… Yet comfort is not set aside – the building has an elevator, air conditioning and modern bathrooms with luxury Bulgari amenities… Pucic Palace provides a rare opportunity to enjoy the charm of yesteryear while enjoying the benefits of contemporary services.

The 17 rooms and 2 suites were named in honour of well-known Croatian artists and personalities.

The Junior Suite, Gundulic, refers to a famous Croatian writer of the 17th century. Its balcony opens onto the Gundulic place and the Old City. Culture lovers will appreciate the manuscripts decorating the walls.
If you are coming with children, ask for the Family Suite with its two connected rooms.
For a touch of romance, try the Senior Suite on the upper floor: the Jacuzzi really adds to the luxurious feeling.






The Tempting Experience:

Discover the local speciality: the stone soup


A stone soup for dinner? That sounds quite out of the ordinary! It is indeed a local specialty served at the Pucic Palace’s restaurant, Café Royal. This delicious dish is made with fresh local vegetables and flavoured with minerals from pebbles found in the Adriatic Sea. As this requires a freshly picked specific type of stone, it is better to pre-order. We guarantee you a memorable experience! Have your meal outside on the terrace to make it more enjoyable.
