A trendy Thai boutique hotel: hip, stylish, and ecological

Situated in an old 4-storey building, the Seven, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a trendy avant-garde Thai property with an original and stylish design. The boutique hotel was renovated from salvaged building materials and designers have created a real “vintage” and comfortable atmosphere. The hotel is ecologically-minded and, for example, uses only chemical-free and biodegradable cleaning products.

A few steps away from the Bangkok Phrom Phong BTS Skytrain station and within walking distance from the Sukhumvit area, home to an wide variety of art galleries, bars, boutiques and high-end shopping malls, this boutique hotel offers six lovely rooms sized 20 to 26sq.m. Each bedroom is individually decorated and refers to a specific Thai God`s planet.

Breakfast is served, very trendily, on a uniquely large stylish “community” table. It is the ideal moment to meet and talk to other travelers.

The Destination

Bustling City of Angels

In Bangkok, you`ll be surprised by the dynamism of the city, its inhabitants and its many contrasts. Named the "City of Angels" you`ll discover its many treasures: Wat Phra Kaew, the Temple of Emerald Buddha, traditional houses like that of Jim Thompson, Vimanmek Palace, the largest white teak building in the world, a floating market and the JEATH Museum, the famous Bridge on the River Kwai… We can not list everything because there are so many other things to see!

Walk around the streets in the middle of the shopkeepers and salesmen, pushing their carts, selling any kind of goods. Learn how to negotiate on the water, at the floating market of Damnoen Saduak.

Bangkok is also a shopping paradise. You will also find many commercial centers for shopping as well as the typical Mabukon: the famous night market of Patpong in Silom.

The hotel experience


A colour and a god for every day of the week

The Seven Hotel is the fruit of a partnership between a Thai owner, a UK design firm, a young Thai interior architect, and a Thai landscape designer. It is inspired by ancient Thai art and the deep-rooted Thai tradition of relating each day of the week to a specific god of the planets (and color). The bedrooms` walls are covered with striking specially-commissioned mural paintings representing Thai legends. In addition the rooms include authentic furniture and reclaimed antique hardwood floor. Salvaged building materials and products with no environmental impact were used for the renovation: low VOC paint, biodegradable products and a special waste recycling system has been put in place.

The Thai colors and gods accompany you from Monday to Sunday: Monday is yellow and is protected by the moon god (Phra Charn); Tuesday is made of pink, supported by the Mars planet (Phra Angkarn); Green and Mercury (Phra Phut) appear on Wednesday; Thursday is made of orange and is protected by Jupiter (Phra Pareuhat); as for Venus (Phra Suk), it is shown in blue on Friday; Saturday dons purple to escort Saturn, finally Sunday shines in red under the sun god`s rays (Phra Arthit).

The « 7th Red Space » serves as a reception, library and bar to relax and exchange with other travelers. On the 1st floor, an art gallery displays Asian based artists. The communal table, ideal for a chat, is also the place to enjoy breakfast or a signature cocktail. And the « Serenity terrace », as well as the sun deck, make the Seven Hotel a true oasis in bustling Bangkok.





The Tempting Experience:

A community and cultural minded stay


Feel the warm atmosphere of a small community in a young and trendy hotel. Each room, with a different color, represents a protecting God and will transport you into a stylish new world. Seven Hotel provides a true mix of local legends with stylish decoration for an out of the ordinary stay in Bangkok! A little notepad in the room allows you to leave a message, or a thought, to be read by the next travelers.

The Seven pays a tribute to Asian artists across its gallery, which especially presents a selection of photographs.

The hotel`s focal point is undoubtedly the library which offers a selection of international magazines. Red painted walls, fiery custom design murals, and dark wood furniture make up a stylish décor.
