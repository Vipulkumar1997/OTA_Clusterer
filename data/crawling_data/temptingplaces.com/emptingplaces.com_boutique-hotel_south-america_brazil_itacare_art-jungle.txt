The Destination

Itacare: lifestyle in a generous nature

Itacare is a charming fisherman` village situated just south of Salvador de Bahia That has preserved a convivial lifestyle in the heart of a generous and wild nature. Lush green nature, wild flora, beaches with coconuts trees, mangroves and waterfalls ... those are the ingredients of this paradise which is sunny nearly all year round.
Founded in the 16th century by the Portuguese, the city has prospered from cacao trade and whale fishing. A few of the historical buildings of the colonial era are still around and host restaurants and pousadas.

A few minutes from the hotel, surfers enjoy the best, worldly famous, spot of the area! Hills along the littoral are covered with forest and coconut trees. This makes it an ideal spot for canoeing, rafting, paragliding, biking and hiking. Lovers of untouched paradisiacal beaches will enjoy Prainha, Jeribucacu and Engenhoca. Art Jungle works with the best guides and surf schools.

Itacare also rhymes with Capoeira, a combination of dance and wrestling rhythm into a ballet where strength is combined with sensuality and harmony of movement. You can learn Caporeia at the daily Caporeia lessons in Itacare.

Finally, the Itacare nightlife is intense all year round and parties go on all night long on the beaches and in the bars. Party till sunrise in hot musical ambiance! A unique occasion to dance till sunrise in a fun and musical ambiance!

The hotel experience


Lodge on stilts or up in the trees!

Local craftsmen built Art Jungle`s lodges out of recycled wood and other local natural resources. The lodges are accessed by wooden stairs and boast great views onto the river, the islands, or the ocean. The lodges` hammocks are great to rock by the chirps of the birds or to enjoy the twinkling stars at night.
The lodges` interior is sobre are inspired by local handicraft: furniture, utensils, cushions and sheets blend rustic comfort with the surrounding nature. The hotels` water is sourced from a natural water spring and energy is supplied by the hotel`s solar panels.
Whether swimming in the pool or simply lying on the shadowed benches, Art Jungle is synonymous with peace, relaxation and lush luxurious nature.

Art Jungle closes during rain season (2.May -30.August 2017).





The Tempting Experience:

a unique biodiversity

Sited on the top of Iticare`s hills, the Art Jungle promises calmness, serenity and breathtaking views on the ocean, the rivers and the beaches. An exclusive place for a getaway in total harmony with nature!
