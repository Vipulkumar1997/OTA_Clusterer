The Destination

Casablanca: the Habous Quarter

For the Moroccan poet Abdallah Zrika, the Habous Quarter is the "most majestic of the ancient Moroccan cities."
Located just behind the Palais Royal, it is the only medina constructed under the French protectorate, between 1920 and 1940. Its architecture encompasses the classic style of the Medinas found in modern urban planning... entangled alleys, small squares and estates consisting of artisanal goods. It is in this neighborhood that we find the famous Bennis pastry store, renowned for its delicious treats!

The hotel experience


A Hotel with both legend and charm

It all started in the 1930s with the construction of a mansion as a pledge of love from an Italian entrepreneur to his wife, who he met in Morocco. The white elegant building became a luxury hotel and took on the name Doge: a reference to Italy and as homage to the restaurant owned by the family in the 70s.
Passionate about the hotel business and the decorative arts, the owners left nothing to chance, creating an authentic Art Deco décor with furnitures and objects unearthed during their travels.

The lobby sets the glamorous tone of the "Roaring Twenties" with a magnificent spiral staircase, wrought iron railing, and velvet carpets. The lighting is warm, the burgundy velour couch welcoming. The mosaic vases and "La Dormeuse" by Tamara de Lempicka that adorn the wall are just some of the details that take you back in time.
The 13 suites and 3 rooms are all unique, decorated with materials from the period while also equipped with all the contemporary comforts: Nespresso machines, flat screen TVs, and Wi-Fi connections are all offered.

The Josephine Baker suite is our personal favorite. The room recalls the music-hall star of the 20s, with a sensual and feminine vibe stemming from velvet, pastel colors, and wooden furniture.

If you would like a terrace overlooking Casablanca, the Charlie Chaplin Suite, which evokes, in black and white, the golden period of Hollywood cinema, is perfect for you.

For even more space to stretch out, choose the Ernest Hemingway Suite: a private terrace for breakfast, a fireplace in the living room, a Chesterfield Sofa...the only thing missing is a cigar and a good book to literally immerse you in the world of a great writer.





The Tempting Experience:

A hotel witness of the "Roaring Twenties"


The scent of Chanel No. 5 floats through the hallway as a wink at Ms. Chanel, a privileged witness of the "Roaring Twenties". Cultural elements from the 1920s and 30s such as paintings, cinema, fashion, literature come together at the Doge Hotel.
The rooms are each christened with the name of a famous figure of the time - Mallet- Stevens, Mackintosh, Ernest Hemingway, Jacques-Henri Lartigue, Tamara de Lempicka, Sacha Guitry, Collette, Fritz Lang, F Scott Fitzgerald, Majorelle, Loukili, Chanel, Jean Cocteau, Man Ray, Josephine Baker. All of these figures helped change the face of artistic expression. A voyage back in time...
