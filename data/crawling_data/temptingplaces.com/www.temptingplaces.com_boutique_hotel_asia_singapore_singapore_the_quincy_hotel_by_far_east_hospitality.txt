The Destination

Singapore`s must-do`s

Singapore is best discovered by one`s own curiosity. Some think they can see it all in 2 days and some in 6. Try 2 weeks and chances are you will still not have seen it all.

Some of THE places to see are Orchard Roard for shopping, the Raffles Places (this is where the Naumi hotel is located) with Boat Quay, Little India, Balestier, Katong, Tanjong Pagar, the Botanic Gardens with the world`s most complete and amazing orchid collection.

The Museum of Asian civilization swarrants a half day as it is one of the best museums in the region.

The Public Housing apartments are interesting sights both for their architecture as well as how they help forge the Singapore social tissue.

For the evenings Boat Quay and Clark Quay with their trendy bars, restaurants, and night-clubs are definitively the places to be.

The hotel experience


Ultracomfortable and unconventional …

The Quincy Hotel introduces a new style of hotel: chic, hip, ultracomfortable, practical and functional. Said differently: staying at Quincy is an unconventional experience! The swimming pool, perched on the 12th floor, offers intriguing views of Singapore through its glass walls.

The hotel floors are intimate and made up of 9 Studio Rooms. All rooms have a view of the Singapore skyline, are tastefully decorated, and are extremely functionally designed.

The contemporary decor mixes mineral materials such as natural stone, glass, and metal, with velvet fabrics that have warm tones such as red, chocolate, gray mouse and yellow mustard. Each room has a king-size bed with feather quilt, Wifi internet access, and a 42" oversized LCD TV screen to which you can connect a laptop PC. The modern bathroom, separated from the room by a large glass wall, is equipped with a bath and a separate rain shower and offers a generous selection of Molton Brown`s amenities.





The Tempting Experience:

All-inclusive luxury!


The Quincy Hotel is not your standard hotel and will meet the expectations of modern and most demanding travelers. Once you arrive in the hotel lobby you will enter a world of senses: visual design, music, and olfactory sensations.
All the hotel services are complimentary and included with your roomrate. All-Club Benefits means all guests get Club treatment, including buffet breakfast, all-day light refreshments by Dean & DeLuca, complimentary mini-bar, free Wi-Fi and complimentary 2 pieces of laundry daily (available only for 2 nights stay and above).
