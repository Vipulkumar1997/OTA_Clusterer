The hotel experience


Authentic Swahili decoration, four poster beds, terraces with ocean views …

The Lamu house is split between two traditional patrician Swahili styled buildings and has two plunge pools for guests to freshen up in. The main house, Salama, is three centuries old and was recently renovated by the architect and owner, Urko, in the finest respect of local traditions, craftsmanship and architecture so as to preserve the authenticity of the past. The walls, for example, are ancient and made of coral blocks that are particularly efficient at keeping the houses fresh.

The decoration is stylish and features Swahili antiques of Lamu and Zanzibar and Spanish colonial objects such as old copper lamps, standing clocks, or ancient pots found in the street. The antiques, the traditional Kikoi tissue, and the Mahoney furniture contrast with the coarse aspect of the walls and the atmosphere radiates an undeniable charm.

The rooms are all unique and different from each other but all are genuinely charming. Some have private terraces with sleeping beds or balconies allowing guests to observe life on shore as well as on the ocean with the movement of the traditional Kenyan dhows (sailing boats). The rooms are decorated with style, authenticity, and taste. For example, light veils dress the four poster beds and the room`s bathrooms are decorated with a lot of oriental charm.

The JUU room is perfect for honeymoons. It has a private terrace overseeing the old city of Lamu and that also gives breathtaking views over the simmering ocean. Its bathroom with candlelight is a heaven for relaxation.

The Kulia (double room), Kati Kati (twin room), Kushoto (twin or double room) and Chini (double room) also feature a private terrace and have garden or town views.

The Kiwayu (double room), Siyu (twin room), Ndau (double room), Kizingitini (twin room), all have a balcony with beautiful ocean views. Enjoy a magic breakfast with the sunlight and colour of the ocean!

The Dodori room (double) has its own private lounge and has a view on the garden, the ocean, and the interior pool.





The Tempting Experience:

Starlight dinner on an authentic Swahili dhow


The Lamu house restored 2 ancient dhows and whilst preserving their authenticity, equipped them with all modern comfort. They are thus perfect for private excursions to discover the archipel. On top, the dhows are also the dream setting for a romantic candlelight dinner served under the thousands of stars of the Kenyan sky. Enjoy the Chef`s special crayfish and crabs in an authentic setting amidst candlelight and copper lamps!
