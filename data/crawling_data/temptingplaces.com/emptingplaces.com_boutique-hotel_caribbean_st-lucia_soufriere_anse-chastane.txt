Luxury and nature

Anse Chastanet Boutique hotel, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located on the quiet southwestern coast of St Lucia with a magical view over the iconic twin volcanic peaks, the Pitons, covered with luscious greenery. Architect and owner Nick Troubetzkoy believes passionately in nature, inspiring him to create this one-of-a-kind resort. Even before ‘green’ became fashionable, he was committed to an environmentally conscious development. The 49 individually designed rooms are refined while remaining in total communion with the environment. 37 of the rooms are scattered about a lush hillside and 12 are nestled within a tropical garden at beach level. Anse Chastanet holds all the perfect ingredients for a romantic and luxurious stay in the Caribbean!

The hotel experience


Caribbean inspired

The beauty of nature is a muse for many artists who have escaped to St Lucia’s stunning scenery for hundreds of years. Anse Chastanet continues this tradition, offering a haven for local artists such as Lawrence Deligny, Peter Charlemagne and Matthew Paul. In turn, they have decorated the hotel with colorful wall murals, painted ‘sky ceilings’ and ‘flower boards’, impressive carved wall plaques and wooden sculptures.
Individual works are exhibited throughout the hotel by local and international artists, including Claude Sandoz and Peter Roesch from Switzerland, Dutch-Canadian Reina Nieland and Dominican Arnold Toulon. Their pieces are available for purchase at the resort’s Art Gallery.

Each suite in Anse Chastanet is unique and all are tastefully decorated with furniture locally manufactured from teak, mahogany, green ebony and rosewood. Madras, a fabric typical of St Lucia, adorns bedspreads and cushions in true Caribbean spirit. The Hillside Deluxe Rooms have a particularly spectacular view over the ocean and the Pitons, some including spectacular open skylights. For more luxury and originality, choose a Premium Room, not only does the sea view look like a postcard but some of them have the fourth wall completely absent, a wonderful plunge into nature!

You may notice that around one hundred stairs lead up from the beach. Do not hesitate to take the complimentary shuttle service that is available all the time to take you most of the way up the hill.





The Tempting Experience:

Discover the true Caribbean


Anse Chastanet is an ode to the Caribbean habitat, a boutique hotel that links the trees to the mountains and the flowers to the birds singing. With the atmosphere of a protected Caribbean paradise, the estate encompasses 600 lush tropical acres bordering two soft sand beaches. Most of the rooms do not use air-conditioning but traditional jalousie windows to let the breeze enter.
