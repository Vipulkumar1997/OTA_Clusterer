The Destination

Lagos de Moreno

Don`t miss this picturesque village just a few minutes drive from the Hacienda Sepulveda. Founded in 1563 by Captain Hernando de Martell, you will find many testimonies of Spanish architecture: old churches, monasteries, museums and antique shops.
Lagos de Moreno is called the Athens of Jalisco by the locals because of the large number of poets and writers who were born there.

The hotel experience


An elegant and historic boutique hotel

Th builder of the Hacienda was Juan de Sepulveda, who came from Spain and chose the location because of the fertility of the soil. The ranch was bought by the Serranos family, who still owns the property and have since turned it into a country boutique hotel. The personality and soul of the home have been perfectly preserved thanks to an eclectic mix of antiques and artifacts belonging to the Serranos family. The typical architecture with interior patios and brick arches, the surrounding countryside, the cactus and horses in the fields all add to the timeless magic of this hotel. Yet comfort is not forgotten: the hotel has Internet, TV, luxury bedding, a spa and a heated pool.

The 11 rooms and suites are decorated in the original style and have either a fireplace or a stove to warm those cold winter nights. They are decorated with authentic Mexican objects collected over the years: heavy Mayan carpets, ethnic cabinets of the 18th century, crucifixes, pictures painted by an ancestor of the owner, carved candlesticks...
To all enthusiasts of Mexican history, we recommend to stay in the Master Suite Don Toribio, named after an owner of the Hacienda. The surprise of this room is that is has a secret passage leading to the roof of the mansion and was once used to protect from the revolutionaries!
The Chula Vista Suite, with its lovely terrace will delight those who wish to rest facing a splendid view over the countryside.

If the rooster does not wake you up naturally, request a wake-up call. You can then get up to the sound of a bell outside your door gently stirred by a hotel employee.





The Tempting Experience:

Treatment with a traditional Toltec Shaman


The Spa at Hacienda Sepulveda offers an original treatment: a Toltec ritual in a temazcal. It`s a "sweating" technique originating in pre-Hispanic civilizations of Central America that was used in healing ceremonies to purify the body. The treatment lasts 3 hours and is done in the presence of an indigenous shaman.

The Temazcal

There is much to see and live in Mexico, and there is also something to try ..... the Temazcal. While in Europe, we love spas, saunas or steam baths, we do not want to miss the Temazcal experience while in Mexico

The Services


Bar
Tequila is the specialty of Jalisco state. You can taste different varieties in one of the 3 bars of the Hacienda.  A few miles to the Hacienda Sepulveda you can visit the distillery Arandas. Like wine, tequila should be tasted and enjoyed in moderation!
Restaurant
The Mamalena Restaurant serves authentic Mexican cuisine. It is located in a Troje, a beautiful vaulted cellar where corn was once stored. A romantic candlelight dinner can be served in any place of the property of your choice: restaurant, garden, by the pool ...
Spa & Wellness
The spa is located in the old hayloft of the ranch. With its high stone walls, well-being is conducive to relaxation, soft music plays lightly in the background and the candle flames reflect off the stone, inviting you to dream. You`ll find treatments made with chocolate or regional plants and a special Toltec steam bath.
Wedding
If you would like a Mexican-style wedding, Hacienda Sepulveda takes care of everything, regardless of the number of guests! The newlyweds on their honeymoon are pampered either in the Doña Barbara Suite with a Jacuzzi or the Pendejaus Suite with its canopy bed. The suites are decorated in accordance to tradition. For example the door displays a medallion bearing white flowers meant to bring happiness.
