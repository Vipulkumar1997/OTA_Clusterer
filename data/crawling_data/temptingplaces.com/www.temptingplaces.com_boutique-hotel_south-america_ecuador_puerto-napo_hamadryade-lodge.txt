A boutique hotel in the Amazon rainforest

The Hamadryade Lodge, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located in the upper Amazon, near Misahualli. The property is 64 hectares large, surrounded by lush tropical jungle, part of the Quechua community, and the Sumaco Wales Biosphere Reserve.  It was built on the site of an old gold mine near Tena, along the Rio Napo.

Those eager to discover the Amazon forest will appreciate this very unique, very chic eco-loge, built with tropical woods and stylishly decorated with an obvious respect for local cultures and traditions. Each of the 5 bungalow and 6 rooms of this boutique hotel offers incredible comfort and a modern design that contrasts sharply with the surrounding wilderness.





Tempting Advantages

- VIP regional gift (in the room)
- Complimentary Hamadryade Terrace cocktail (during 1st dinner)

The Destination

The upper Amazon

Unlike the lower Amazon, the upper Amazon has a rugged landscape with many rivers, allowing for a great diversity of activities, a very pleasant climate, and barely any mosquitoes! The port of Misahualli has become the first tourist port of the Ecuadorian Amazon in recent years. Soft white sand beaches, colorful boats, friendly monkeys and multicolored butterflies make all the fun of the destination.

The hotel experience


The Ecuadorian Amazon in luxury and with respect of ecology

Hamadryade is a nymph in Greek mythology. She lived in the woods and was born with a tree in her custody. She could not leave the tree until her death. Analogously, Hamadryad Lodge is virtually tied to the jungle for which it nurtures a deep feeling of responsibility and care.

A harmonious marriage between local cultures and modern design takes place at the Hamadryade lodge. Each bungalow is a tribute to one of the local ethnic groups: Quechua, Shuar, Cofan, and Huaorani. The decoration is inspired from these local cultures with statues, paintings, symbols, and hand-made wooden furniture crafted by these communities.

Architects Olivier Donnet and Caroline Tresse used straight lines, purity, and simplicity to seamlessly integrate the lodge into the surrounding rainforest. The spaces and volumes, for example, are designed to capture the daylight and enable natural ventilation. The colors of the bungalows are inspired by the themes of the Amazon: red earth, butterfly wings, tree leaves, wild flowers...

The bungalows are large suites that open onto nature: large windows overlook the jungle and the cool Napo River. The amenities are luxurious, including Egyptian cotton linens from Italy, real feather duvets, soft pillows, and spacious showers with natural stones... a harmonious combination that enables guests to experience the Amazon adventure in full comfort.

This charming hotel has been built to the highest standards of cultural and ecological compliance. The lodge is 100% environmentally friendly: the rainwater is collected from the lodge`s roofs, is treated with biological tanks, and fills the pool and other water stations; the lodge is 100% powered by hydro-electricity; the bathroom products are 100% organic, biodegradable, locally produced, and packaged by local craftsmen with no plastic bottles!





The Tempting Experience:

An eco-lodge ethno-lodge


The Hamadryade is not only an eco-lodge but it is also an ethno-lodge that immerses guests in the local community.

The decoration, to start, is fully inspired by the local communities. Furthermore, the local communities not only contributed to the construction of the lodge but continue their involvement in the lodge`s operations today... The owners take it one step further: they are pioneers of development programs that use tourism as a means to promote and revitalize local cultures: making guests discover Quechuas` medicinal plants, organizing rainforest excursions with a native guide ... They will help you discover the bond that links local communities to their environment, their lifestyle, and the harmony of nature.

A real Tempting encounter!
