The Destination

Jamaica's East-Coast

Jamaica's Eastern coast boasts the island`s most beautiful beaches. Moreover, just a few steps from the hotel, around Port Antonio, is where several Hollywood stars (Errol Flynn, Bette Davis, Ginger Rogers...) used to spend their vacation. It`s also famous for having been the shooting place of different films: The Blue Lagoon with Brooke Shields and Cocktail in which Dragon Bay plays the role of Tom Cruise`s bar background.

Surfing and water sports lovers will be enchanted by San Beach, as well as those who just want to laze around and enjoy tropical sand and turquoise water. Lastly, Winnifred Beach, especially busy with locals, some kilometers away from Port Antonio, recalls some movie scenes of Club Paradise with Robin Williams.

The hotel experience


A hideout combining luxury, design, and nature

The hotel's 7 rooms & villas are nestled at the end of a tiny, stone path lined with palm trees, in the middle of a tropical paradise. The property successfully blends top of the line interior design with the stunning natural surroundings. Rooms offer superb teak wood terraces facing the sea as well as state of the art technological comforts...everything has been thought to guarantee you privileged moments of relaxation!

Our first choice goes to the Mento Cabin, which boasts the typical hammock and a stunning view of the forest and sea with a special view over a gorgeous waterfall. The proximity to the paradise around you will make you feel as if you`re in the Garden of Eden.





The Tempting Experience:

A recording studio all for you


One of the most prized features of Geejam is its unique recording studio! Located in the heart of the hotel, it has welcomed many famous artists such as the Gorillaz, Gwen Stefani, and many more, to record their music. Here, you can book a recording session, choose your favorite soundtrack and record your personal hit! Equipped with top-of-the-line technology, the studio will mix your play-back and harmonize your voice with instrumental accompaniment. You can leave with your own professional album in hand!
