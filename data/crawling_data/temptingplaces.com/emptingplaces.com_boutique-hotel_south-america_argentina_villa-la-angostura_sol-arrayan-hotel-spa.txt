The Destination

Patagonian Visits around Nahuel Huapi Natural Parc

Sol Arrayan is nestled in the beautiful Nahuel Huapi Natural Parc, ideal for hiking, bike, horseback riding and picnic lovers in an extremely romantic location in the middle of nature with the lake and the Andes as background.

The hotel is located at less than one kilometer from Villa La Angostura center, a tiny typical Argentinean Patagonian village. Here, you`ll discover the local handcrafts and costumes and don`t leave without tasting the Patagonian traditional cuisine combined with the best Argentinean wines.

Only a couple of minutes drive from the hotel, discover the majestic Cerro Bayo volcano which is a must excursion. During summer time you`ll appreciate the amazing view over the Andes and the Arrayanes blooming, the Argentinean myrtle which is spread all over this magic place. In winter the volcano becomes a giant ski destination where you can practice all your favorite winter sports.

The hotel experience


An hideout hotel blending rustic and modern design

Following a modern architectural style, the Sol Arrayan hotel`structure is composed of stones and local natural wood. Fabrics and objects of the Andes are mixed with the contemporary design giving a local and flaring color to the rooms and common areas.

The hotel offers three different room categories, all of them very bright with an exceptional view over the lake. We strongly suggest the "Deck Lake View" rooms which offer an equipped terrace where you can enjoy the sun and relax admiring the paradisiacal lake`s landscape with the Cordillera as background. You`ll also appreciate the spacious Suites and their exclusive bathroom: a real private Spa with large bath tube, massage shower and Jacuzzi facing the lake.





The Tempting Experience:

A panoramic view of the Andes Cordillera


Have a cocktail at the bar or on one of the many hotel`s terraces facing the lake, admiring the amazing Cordillera`s sunsets, which make the Sol Arrayan a magic place. The calm of the water, the silence of the place and the luxury of the hotel guarantee total relaxation after full-day excursions.
