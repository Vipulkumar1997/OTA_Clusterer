The hotel experience


Sophisticated suites with inspiration from all around the world

The owners handpicked antiques themselves to decorate Tigmiza Marrakech.

Each 10 suites has a unique theme. The names themselves are an invitation to dream: Zen, Anglaise (English Suite), Majorelle (Garden Suite), Verte (Green Suite), Brute (Natural Suite), Oriental, Chinoise (Chinese Suite), Noire et Or (Black & Gold), Art Déco, Indienne (Indian Suite).

Zen will delight those in search of peacefulness. Its cream and black background, decorated with modern Chinese is designed Feng Shui style to create an uplifting energy and further serenity. Couples needing to unwind particularly love this room.

Exotic travellers might prefer Indian. Here you’ll find extravagance at every turn, highlighted with touches of gold and spiced orange. A colourful mosaic adorns the ceiling, elegant silks cover the bed and seats – like a Bollywood-style temple!

The 3 pavillons are situated by the pool among a lush vegetation. They all have a private terrace for more intimacy.

The “Village” includes fourteen tile-facades, Kasbah-like villas hidden from view by the vegetation. An authentic atmosphere while maintaining privacy.
The decoration, furnishing and interior design are a real work of art, including zellige, marble and wood flooring.






The Tempting Experience:

Time for a movie in the private screening room


The movie room of  Tigmiza Marrakech is undoubtedly a little gem, Its library lists no less than 300 DVDs. Make yourself comfortable in a red leather armchair as the red velvet curtains draw back, the screen comes to life and the room lights dims down. Let the show begin!
