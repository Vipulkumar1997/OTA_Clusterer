The hotel experience


Finding art and chic, design and luxury

The door leading to the central patio, a real antiquity from Edine with oriental details, sets the pace: Casa dell’Arte is a tribute to the Turkish art, a gallery hotel that shelters around 200 paintings of artists such as Fikret Mualla or Nuri İyem, and also sculptures and antiquities dating from the medieval era to nowadays… Twice a year the hotel welcomes international artists in residency. Thus works of art are created then exhibited in the hotel interacting with the hosts. Do not hesitate to ask a private visit of the collection!

The hotel offers twelve suites, like the twelve zodiac signs whose names match to each of them.
The neutral tones of the decoration highlight fully the exhibited works of art. Everything is art here : a ship-shaped bed, a marble bathroom, glass stairs,sophisticated lightings...
If you have always dreamt of sleeping in museum or a art gallery…your dream will come true !

Aquarius, Cancer, Gemini, Pisces, Aries et Virgo are Premium suites.
If you like starry skies chose a Dome Suite -Libra and Capricorn: the star light dome on top of the beds will be like your private sky!

The Sea View Suites, Taurus and Leo, have the most beautiful view of the Aegean sea and the Sagittarius and Scorpio suites are the most spacious.






The Tempting Experience:

The Turkish Riviera with style, hair blowing in the wind!


Think sails and blue water...The Büyükkuşoğlu family offers to rent her fleet: two luxurious sailingboats  decorated of unique works of art and a yacht, the “Lady in Red”,  made of three spacious and design cabins. You can plan your own route on the pristine blue waters of the Aegean sea or get inspired by those recommanded by the hotel, from Bodrum to Antalya for example.
The hotel also rents its three vintage cars : a convertible Ford Mustang 1967,a Corvette stingray 1973 and a Mercedes-Benz 180 1961.The turkish riviera with style!
