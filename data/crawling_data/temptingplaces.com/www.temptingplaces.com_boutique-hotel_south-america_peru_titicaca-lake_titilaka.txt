A luxury boutique hotel perched on the highest navigable lake of the world

Located on the highest navigable lake of the world, the Titilaka eco-lodge, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, has 18 suites, each with a beautiful view on the lake. The surrounding nature and the boutique hotel`s atmosphere set the tone for a peaceful and harmonious stay. 

What makes the Titilaka really unique though is its large terrace overlooking the Titicaca Lake and which is the perfect spot to enjoy the calmness of the water and to breathe-in the silence and beauty of the surroundings.

This boutique hotel is a hide-away on a small private peninsula (south of Puno) where the elements (water, air, fire, and earth) come together. The result is a sleek and contemporary styled atmosphere that mirrors the peaceful, pure, and simple way of life of the inhabitants of the region.

Luxury and modernity also echo with nature, culture, and mystic Inca culture. On top of being an exceptional boutique-hotel, the titilaka also offers a large choice of authentic excursions, all of which are included in your room rate. This makes the Titilaka hotel the ideal spot for those wanting to discover the highlands of Peru and Bolivia.

The hotel experience


18 modern and luxurious suites

All suites have beautiful views on the majestic Titicaca Lake with the ‘sunset` suites being slightly larger than the ‘sunrise` ones.

The bathrooms have airs of small spas with large bathtubs, massaging showers, and organic bathroom amenities.

The modern architecture of the Titilaka boutique hotel is complemented with touches of indigenous art. The decoration and the atmosphere of the rooms and common areas feature warm local colours and include traditional fabrics and artifacts from the Andes.





The Tempting Experience:

The terrace on Lake Titicaca


Comfortably seated with a rug and sipping an aperitif on the terrace overlooking the highest navigable lake of the world takes a mystic character. The silence of the environment, stillness of the water, and luxury of the hotel is conducive to total relaxation. Exactly what you need after a day of local excursions!









In the press
