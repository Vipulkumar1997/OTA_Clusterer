The Destination

The Maldives

The Maldives are located in the Indian Ocean, which consists of 1,199 islands of which 202 are inhabited. The capital, Malé, is the best place to experience the local lifestyle, as well as see the colorful traditional houses, markets, etc…

When to go to the Maldives ? The Maldives have two seasons: the climate is dry from December to March, wet from May to November with more wind and rain. April is known as a hotter month with really transparent water. Temperatures are an average 30 ° C.
February to April is the hottest period. Thunderstorms occur from May to November – the low season (to the exception of August).

Diving can be enjoyed all year round but the marine life is more interesting on the west side of the atoll from May to November and on the East side is from December to April.

The surfing season is between March and October.

The hotel experience


Seaside luxury

Whether on the sand or on stilts, your room at Huvafen Fushi will be the ultimate exotic experience. All 44 bungalows are contemporary in design and provide the best of modern comfort: air conditioning, large bed, minibar, high-tech Bose sound system, DVD player and iPod docking station.

Each lodging has its own private pool for extra privacy.Should you wish for direct access to the beach, we recommend a Deluxe Beach Bungalow. Numbers 9, 10, 12 and 15 are very peaceful and close to the spa – the perfect way to make the most of your stay.

If you prefer to stay right over the sea, ask for one of the bungalows on stilts. The Ocean and Lagoon Bungalows offer the utmost privacy. Ocean Bungalows have a glass floor in the living room, overlooking the seabed, a hypnotizing scenery indeed. The deck, with its own pool, is designed to give you the best sunset views as well as exceptional romantic evenings. You can relax all day on your terrace or in your private pool, yet there is more to our little paradise…

The hotel provides a whole range of activities to discover the natural beauty of the Maldives: trips from one atoll to another on a traditional boat, diving, swimming with manta rays or whale sharks, spa treatments in the only underwater spa of the archipelago, the evening’s rhythm heightened by leading international DJs.

All six restaurants at Huvafen Fushi offer a luxurious experience, with the added pleasure of being right on the beach.
Scallops, lobster, caviar… the most exquisite seafood features on Salt’s menu. The decoration is inspired by the seaside, while the open kitchen brings a contemporary spirit. The sommelier will skillfully choose the perfect wine to highlight your meal. Why not try the Champagne Menu* available on Sunday evenings? (* Booking required)
Fogliani's authentic dishes will instantly transport you to Italy while still sitting under the coconut trees! The atmosphere is casual so leave your tie – your shoes, even – aside and enjoy delicious pizzas and antipasti with your feet right in the sand!
The Umbar pool bar offers a stylish setting – giant cushions, refined snacks, signature cocktails, ideal to chill out.
The Celsius restaurant is located in a charming wooden pavilion, opening onto the beach and letting the seaside breeze in. It is perfect to enjoy the scenery and highly rated international cuisine.
Lovers of raw and healthy cuisine will delight in the Raw restaurant, serving Asian-inspired dishes with a juice bar also open in the evening, should you fancy a vitamin cocktail.
Vinum is the best kept secret of Huvafen Fushi. Imagine a wine cellar, 8 meters under the ocean with a choice of 6,000 wines including vintage gems. The ultimate luxury is to book here for a private dinner.

Imagination has no limit at Huvafen Fushi. The team can organize the meal of your dreams, be it a picnic on a beach, a gourmet dinner under the stars or near the coral reef. Choose your favorite option and let them know.





The Tempting Experience:

The underwater spa


Per Aquum Huvafen Fushi offers the very best of the Maldives: an exclusive island-hotel, a dream beach with perfect white sand, a butler at your service, the sun setting beautifully over the turquoise-colored sea every evening… and just as you thought this could not get any better, you find yourself in a unique little paradise on the archipelago: an underwater spa. This hotel wants your stay to be as magical as possible whether above or below the sea. The soothing sight of the lagoon, the tropical fish swimming by will no doubt help you to relax fully.

For 180 minutes of pure bliss, try the spa’s signature treatment: coconut and lime fragrances
followed by Anne Semonin wonder Express Radiance Ice Cubes for extra radiance and awakening of the senses.
