The hotel experience


A refined hotel with a Senegalese welcome

Les Alizés is a modern boutique hotel, but has a lodge-like feel with the interior decoration of the villas. Comfort, amenities, attention to detail and tranquility characterize the hotel`s suites and lofts.
Composed of 15 elegant, spacious suites with 1-4 bedrooms on 2 or 3 levels, Les Alizés Beach Resort can comfortably fit 8 people per suite. Each suite has 2 or 3 luxurious bathrooms, a kitchenette and a living room, making Les Alizés the ideal accommodation for a family, or even a group of friends. The exotic, refined decor will immerse you in Senegalese culture. You will be fascinated by the surrounding nature and exceptional views of the ocean and eucalyptus-scented tropical garden. The suites and lofts are just as large and wonderful as the terraces and private gardens, equipped with teak furniture for you to bask in the sun and African tranquility.






The Tempting Experience:

The sweet Senegalese life


The philosophy of the hotel is based on the respect of the tranquility and the guaranty of a quiet atmosphere. Out of school holidays time, the musical parties are replaced by the natural sound of the waves and the birds singing! The best way to benefit from the 320 days of sun per year of this serene heaven.
