The Destination

Kuala Lumpur`s must do`s

Discover a city of contrasts! Kuala Lumpur combines modern cosmopolitan lifestyle with sophistication and charms of the colonial past and persistent traditions.

Start your visit with the bustling Merkeda Square where you can see the British-styled Royal Selangor Club located opposite the Moorish-styled Sultan Abdul Samad building (1897).

The ancient Kuala Lumpur train-station, with its arches, its minarets and its dome, is a very nice illustration of Moorish architecture.

Also take a stroll in the Lake Gardens located in the centre of KL. They are really beautiful and worthwhile your time.

The Central Market, hosted in an Art-Deco building, has become a touristic market nowadays bur retains all its charm. Do walk around the surrounding streets to experience the shophouses` atmosphere.

Malaysia`s rich culture and history unfolds in the National Museum (typical Malay architecture), one of the most beautiful museums of South-East Asia.

And, last but not least, don`t leave Kuala Lumpur without visiting the famous Petronas Twin Towers and the Batu Caves - a wonderful Hindu temple!

The hotel experience


Contemporary design, exclusive services, and tropical gardens

With its 45 rooms and 60 suites,the Club Saujana Resort is the work of art of the renowned Indonesian interior designer Jaya Ibrahimn - distinguished for his quest of contrasts of styles in terms of space, interior décor, and furniture design - he calls it "an aoasis amidst the chaos".

The atmosphere of The Club Saujana Resort is sleek; the tones are warm, elegant, and sober; teak wooden floors contrast with the white marble, Terrazzo bathtubs, and redd slates in the bathrooms. The rooms feature linen bed-sheets by designer Liddel, exclusive Anore Italian toiletries and Jim Thompson signed furniture.

You will enjoy soothing perspectives of scenic tropical gardens and ponds from the Executive Club rooms (43 m²) and Terrace Suites (52m²) - the latter of which have direct access to the gardens and the swimming pool. Additionally, the Superior Suites (75m²), Deluxe Suites (88m²) and Executive Suites (122m²) feature a lounge and a living room as well as a huge bathroom with magnificent gardens views.





The Tempting Experience:

The Saujana Golf


The Saujana Golf & Country Club features 2 signature 18-hole golf courses designed by Ronald Fream: the « Palm Course », nicknamed Cobra (par 72 - 6545m ), and the « Bunga Raya Course », nicknamed Crocodile (par 72 - 5850m).

The « Palm Course » alternates palm trees and water and its hole nº2 is claimed to be the hardest par 3 of the country! Whatever your handicap, experience one of the world`s 100 most beautiful golfing resorts!
