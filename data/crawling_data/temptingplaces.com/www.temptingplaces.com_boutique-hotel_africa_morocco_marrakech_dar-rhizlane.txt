The area is green, airy, and ventilated and at the same time close to the historical Medina and Place Djelmna El Fna square, the mythical heart of Marrakech!

The hotel experience


Rooms with a 1001 nights setting

With its lovely house and residence of character, its luxury and refinement, the calmness and the coolness, the rooms, suites and Douiryas of Dar Rhizlane will immerse you in a typical Moroccan environment. Vaults, ocher briquettes walls, and floors with mosaic decorations make for a warm and welcoming atmosphere.

The names of the rooms are all reminiscent of the East and its historical roots. Flowers and petals are placed with great finesse and delicacy in the rooms and bathrooms and they tint the air with sweetness and fragrances. Traditional window shutters complete the very cozy atmosphere.

The decoration of the rooms and the common areas is ethno-chic: it successfully mixes local handicrafts with unique objects from other countries and cultures. For example: cedar wooden furniture, Venetian mirrors, stucco carvings, Berber carpets, silk and velvet draping, Moroccan chandeliers...

All rooms have a terrace overlooking the Andalusian garden or flower terrace and are luxuriously equipped with, amongst others, a fireplace and air conditioning. Feel good whatever the weather! The suites have a lounge and more.





The Tempting Experience:

A famed dining experience


The restaurant of the Dar Rhizlane is known as one of Marrakech`s best. Chef Zakia Ait Aboulahcen creates an original cuisine influenced by classic Moroccan undertones. She gives a new impetus to a modern Oriental cuisine. Cooking excellence is a family trait for Zakia Ait Aboulahcen: her mother was the head Chef of the prestigious Palace La Mamounia.

During your meal, you`ll surely have the pleasure of meeting Zakia who passes from table to table to talk to her guests and make sure they are enjoying themselves. At night the dinners are truly magical, with glittering lanterns, verrines, floating candles and photophores.

To go above and beyond, you can even take cooking classes - just ask!
