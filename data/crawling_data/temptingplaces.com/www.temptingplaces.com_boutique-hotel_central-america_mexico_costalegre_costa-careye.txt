Stylish Mexican design, soaring views, and intimacy in this boutique hotel

The Costa Careyes, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located on the Mexican Pacific Ocean coast of Costalegre. This little piece of paradise with its temperate climate, crystal-clear ocean waters and marine-life (turtles, dolphins, and more) was chosen as the site of Gian Franco Brignone`s new boutique hotel concept, offering a diverse choice of accommodation to best suit the guests` individual wishes: castles with amazing infinity swimming pools, casitas with their own stretch of private beach, or intimate bungalows for ocean-side retreats.

The Costa Careyes hotel was designed by the 3 top Mexican architects: Marco Aldaco, Diego Villasenor, and Jean-Claude Galibert. They were given the task of maximising comfort and individuality without compromising the exceptional beauty of the natural surroundings. So, whether you are staying in one of the Castles on the top of the cliffs, or in a bungalow on the beautiful beach of Playa Rosa, you will still enjoy the breathtaking, unobstructed view of the shimmering Pacific Ocean.

The Destination

The hotel and its surroundings

There are plenty of fantastic excursions to take advantage of the beautiful surrounding nature and this will keep you busy.

For the ecologically minded, take advantage of the beautiful surrounding nature (horseriding, mountain-biking, hiking, ... ) or enjoy a visit to the bird island natural reserve.

For the more sports minded, there is the Playa Aroroyo Seco for surfing, the Careyes Polo club to play (or learn) polo, diving and snorkelling, and Barra de Navidad for fishing.

If you cannot resist the need for nightlife and partying then, you can choose to travel to the city of Puerto Vallarta or try out El Cocodrilo Azul, a rustic spot on a secluded beach with a small dance floor under a palapa.

The hotel experience


Choose amongst 3 castles, 1 villa, 9 casitas, and 3 bungalows ...

The 3 "castles", ideally suited for friends or family and located on the top of the cliffs have sweeping views over the Pacific Ocean. These immense 6-8 room villas distinguish themselves by absolutely oversized (~1000m2) private circular and snake-shaped infinity swimming pools.

Sol de Oriente (see photo set #1) is yellow and circular and has made the covers of a number of magazines!
Sol de Occidente (see photo set #2) has its own private jetty and beach...
Casa Mi Ojo (photo set #3) has a small bridge that takes its guests to a small private island.
These total luxury villas are also ideal places for film shootings, fashion photoshoots, weddings, and much more ...

The villa Nido de Amor (see photo set #4) is specially designed for lovers and honeymoons ... Fully intimate, overlooking the cliffs and ocean, it also boasts its own private swimming pool, a lounge, and even an open-air dining room! Ideal for those seeking maximum comfort, tranquillity, elegance, and romance!

The Casitas de las Flores (see photo set #5) are 9 intimate ocean-facing villas that have their own private beach. These ocean-retreats are accessed through private paths amidst the lush tropical vegetation and are suited for families or for those looking for an ocean-side getaway from their hectic daily life. A casita can have one, two, or four bedrooms. All have a living room, bathroom, and fully equipped kitchen with service entrance. The casitas have two terraces to relax in full intimacy: one next to the living room and another on the roof. Some casitas have their own private plunge pool.

The bungalows (see photo set #6) have direct access to the main beach. These will certainly seduce the more romantic ones, those lovers of the ocean lullaby... The structure is simple but the intimacy and the beauty of the environment gives the bungalows this exquisite taste of barefoot luxury: when nature and simplicity combine.





The Tempting Experience:

Help save the leatherback sea turtles


Costa Careyes literally means "Turtle Coast" and is just steps away from Playa Teopa, a leatherback sea-turtle sanctuary. The Costa Careyes boutique hotel has developed a turtle nursery and protection program that has already safe-guarded 500‘000 eggs from predators and poachers.

As guests at the Costa Careyes, you can help collect turtle eggs from the Teopa beach from July to November and may even be able to release back some turtles to the ocean during the winter months.







Classifications & Awards






In the press



"At Careyes, the richness of the place is all but an image"

Julia Chaplin, The New York Times, 24 Sept 2006.



"With an eye on preservation of nature, architectural roots, wildlife and community ... Framing the locations with a mix of Mexican and Mediterranean architecture and living the tropical indoor/outdoor lifestyle created by Mexico`s top architects is part of the purchasing process"

Wendy Abrams, Vacation Homes, Spring 2005



"Careyes combines elements not often seen together, the nature, the unusual architecture, the European refinement in the dining and parties, the polo, and that it is dynamic and welcoming of the young."

Vacation Homes, Feb - March 2009
