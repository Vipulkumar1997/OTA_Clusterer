The Destination

Discover the charm and authenticity of Paraty

Paraty, a colonial city, is a true cultural and artistic center with intact traditions and is classified as a Brazilian National Heritage site. Paraty is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site candidate.

The city is full of small shops, shopping malls, cafes... you can spend the day strolling around. But it would be a shame not to enter the St. Rita Church, the oldest religious building of the city and museum of sacred art. The House of Culture also offers a nice permanent exhibition.

The view from the Morro do Forte is worth a visit!

And Paraty spans beyond the historic downtown. The city has many other activities to offer such as: swimming in one of its many waterfalls, walking on the Jabaquara beach, playing in the waves of the Trindade beach, or walking to the natural pool of Cachadaço... You can also take a boat and go diving in one of the many creeks of the magnificent bay...

The hotel experience


9 boutique suites, 9 colors to seduce you

The suites of the Casa Turquesa are cozy and boast beautiful views of Paraty: the bay, the roofs, the mountains, and the dome of the Santa Rita Church.

Each room is uniquely decorated, with it own personality and its own color. You can choose between two categories according to size: the Luxury Suites (pink, yellow, turquoise and green and the Master Suites ((white, royal blue, red, brown and green).

All suites are truly charming! On top of color and size, here are some tips to choose the room that will suite you best. The Green Deluxe Suite is the smallest, but has a unique atmosphere with pretty, old leather chairs and a painting of the artist of the Sono Beach.The bathrooms in the Royal and in the White Master Suites have a bubble-bath. The white Master Suite is very romantic and has a terrace.

Art and crafts are also important at Casa Turquesa. The Luxury turquoise Suite features paintings signed by the French artist Jacques Rey. The red Junior Suite is decorated with "bromeliads" of the English artist and botanist, Margaret Mee.

The Casa`s bed mosquito-nets are crafted by artisans in southern Bahia. In the Casa`s shop you will find Trussardi house linen, the famous Kenyan Kikoys brought to Brazil by the designer Kika Lerner, and paintings of Tiacho Baenninger, winner of the biennium of Naive Art in 1998.





The Tempting Experience:

Sailing around Paraty in a schooner!


You would surely like a trip in a baleeira, the traditional wooden fishingboat! Enjoy a visit to the bay and then stop to lunch on an island or on a charming beach.... Divers will enjoy the sea-beds and newbies can take their PADI. Casa Turquesa can arrange visits to and around Paraty and offers individual excursions on or under water - exclusively for its guests!
