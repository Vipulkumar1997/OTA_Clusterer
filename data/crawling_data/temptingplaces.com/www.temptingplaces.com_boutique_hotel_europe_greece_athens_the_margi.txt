The hotel experience


A Boutique hotel with Mediterranean charm

Let there be light!  The true blue sky, the smell of vegetation under the sun ... Enjoy all the charms of the Mediterranean at The Margi: the design is in harmony with the external environment, and with great attention to comfort the hotel works to create a warm and intimate ambiance: dim lighting, large mirrors, which reflect the warm colors of the fabrics of the Persian carpets, marble bathrooms clean and fabulous natural beauty products of Korres.

Elegant and stylish, the 89 rooms and suites invite you to feel at home in a bright house with large bay windows. You will enjoy an incomparable view of the sea, pine forest, and the courtyard illuminated by candles.
Families would share unforgettable moments in the Family Suite of subtle luxury. We also recommend the most exclusive VIP Suite, a spectacular dream loft overlooking the sea: a fireplace, luxurious dresser, a Venetian mirror and Jacuzzi overlooking the forest.

The Margi is also one of the trendiest dining destinations in the Athenian Riviera. The unique style of the restaurant Malabar which is surrounded by a pool, and the refined ambiance of bakù, offer great memories of Mediterranean cuisine.





The Tempting Experience:

Relax on the chic Athenian Riviera


The advantageous location of The Margi Hotel on the beautiful peninsula of Vouliagmeni, of the Athenian Riviera, guarantees its guests stylish and unforgettable days and nights at seaside.
