The Destination

A few days in Bangkok, city of Angels

In Bangkok, you`ll be surprised by the dynamism of the city, its inhabitants and its many contrasts. Affectionately called the "City of Angels" you`ll discover its many treasures: Wat Phra Kaew, the Temple of Emerald Buddha, traditional houses like that of Jim Thompson, Vimanmek Palace, the largest white teak building in the world, a floating market and the JEATH Museum, the famous Bridge on the River Kwai… We can not list everything because there are so many other things to see!

You will also find many comercial centers for shopping as well as the typical Mabukon: the famous night market of Patpong in Silom.

The hotel experience


A family villa

The philosophy of the hotel is entirely oriented around your well-being. The owners are former designers who strived to create a welcoming, relaxing, and refreshed atmosphere. The restaurant is renowned throughout Bangkok: the cuisine is healthy, organic, and therapeutic for the body.

The Ariyasom Villa is a perfect mix of past and present. The villa was built in 1942 and still in the hands of the original family who built it. You will enjoy the “city of angels” from your room, the garden, or the pool! In the evening, singing frogs accompany your perfect aperitif or appetizer on the terrace.

The rooms are luxuriously furnished with antique furniture, silk sheets, velvet, and fine works of art. The high ceilings, fan, and optional air-conditioning ensure they remain fresh during the day. The floor is made of teak wood, which gives a very cozy atmosphere and makes you feel truly at home! The bathrooms are equally beautiful: they are airy, spacious, and luxurious.






The Tempting Experience:

The spirit of a family house in Bangkok


The Ariyasomvilla Boutique Hotel is a hotel like no other. The hotel is a real family villa that has retained its spirit and warm atmosphere. Built by Khun Phra Charoen Visavakom Sheanakul in the 40s, his daughter, Khun Pariya, and her husband, David, wished to preserve the building and its special charm, and convert it into a boutique hotel.

Experience the heart of the friendly house when you stay in the city of angels. You will feel right at home!
