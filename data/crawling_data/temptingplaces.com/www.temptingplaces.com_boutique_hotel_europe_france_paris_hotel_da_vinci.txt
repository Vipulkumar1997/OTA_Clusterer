The Destination

Paris Saint Germain des Prés

Paris always has a few new surprises. Saint Germain des Prés prides a historical and intellectual background (Café de Flore, Luxembourg, the Saint Sulpice church…) but if you are looking for trendy addresses we would recommend the following in the area:

- Ines de la Fressange - 24, rue de Grenelle
Plates by Baan, olive oil by Château de Montfrin, Indian pareos… the designer has turned her shop into an elegant, modern bazaar. Perfect if you have very little time for shopping and love a joyful messy, a souk-chic atmosphere.

- Teatime at George Cannon’s - 12 rue Notre Dame des Champs
George Cannon, a British married to a French lady, founded his tea trading company in Paris back in 1898. Today this famous tea house offers more than 500 varieties of blends from all over the world. In this tea temple, you will find a tasting room serving light meals but also a well-being space in the basement.

- Les Jardins du Pont Neuf - Quai de l'horloge - Ile de la cite
Let’s cheat a little and leave Saint Germain for a tiny island called Ile de la Cité. There you will discover the most exclusive houseboat In Paris: Les Jardins du Pont Neuf. Order some tapas or maybe a picnic menu and watch the sun set over Paris. "Aro Mio" Riva 1962, adjoining the restaurant, can also take you cruising on the Seine.

The hotel experience


A journey in the heart of the Renaissance

This historical journey starts as soon as you step into the lift as it allows you a glimpse, through its glass walls, of a collection of drawings and sketches by Leonardo da Vinci, undisputed Master of Arts of that era.

Architect Vincent Bastie worked with interior designers Luana Bellusci and Sandrine Gouin to reflect the Renaissance theme through the 24 rooms of the hotel, each named after some of the greatest men of the Quattrocento: Botticelli, Raphael, Michelangelo, Caterina de Medici…...

You will find subtle Renaissance hints in the luxurious decoration, exquisite details here and there: an antique caqueteuse (or conversation) chair, the rounded shape of a dressing room, a Venetian lamp…
Almost half of the rooms have balconies with either a view on the peaceful patio of the hotel or on the beautiful street of the Saints-Pères.

The "Mona Lisa" is one of the most charming rooms of the Da Vinci, its terrace overlooking the hotel patio and its soothing atmosphere.

The Medici Rooms celebrate the illustrious family of patrons through which Italian artists acquired international fame. Have a look at the headboard: the fresco is modelled after one of the first works of Leonardo da Vinci, no less that "Madonna of the Carnation".

The Invention Rooms focus on Leonardo da Vinci’s scientific with the wall frescoes featuring his most famous technical sketches: flying machines, stairs, gears…

The Inspiration Rooms are a tribute to the talent of Leonardo da Vinci as a painter, reflecting his favourite colours.

The Renaissance Rooms use a specific palette of pastel colours, very popular at the time.






The Tempting Experience:

The hotel where Mona Lisa slept


The hotel has its own historical anecdote! Indeed, in 1911, the most famous painting in the world stayed a few days in the building. Vincenzo Peruggia had successfully stolen the Mona Lisa from the Louvres on August 21 and took refuge at the hotel! Ask for the Thieves room to fully enjoy the story, a favourite of art lovers.

The Services


Bar
The decoration of the Da Vinci Café finds inspiration in Café Florian, the oldest and most famous one in Venice. The patterns adorning both floor and ceiling are the exact copy of its Italian equivalent. The resemblance does not stop there: Café Da Vinci, using the very same percolator found at Café Florian, serves one of the best espressos in Paris. The superb machine features a lion, symbol of the city of Venice!

3 breakfast choices are served from 7 am throughout the day: 
The Spontaneous € 8
The Parisian: 14 €
The Farniente: 19 €
Spa & Wellness
Another surprise awaits at the Da Vinci. The basement hides a secret Relaxation Bath, decorated with intricate mosaics in similar colours to the ones used by Leonardo da Vinci to paint the Mona Lisa. Look up – the ceiling, adorned with stars is a soothing sight. Should you prefer a more dynamic activity, try the swimming pool and its counter-current system. A really magical cocoon, right in the heart of Paris!
The space can be booked through reception should you want it all to yourself.
