The Destination

Lake Takerkoust and Amizmiz Valley

Lake Takerkoust is only an half hour drive from the hotel. The walk is ideal for a family picnic, a romantic stroll, relaxing on the beach or swimming while admiring the view of the Atlas. Sportsmen can enjoy water sports: windsurfing, kayaking, canoeing, pedaling, etc...Several restaurants are nearby for a gourmet break.

The village of Amizmiz is located 45 minutes from the hotel. Do not miss the souk every Tuesday which brings together all of the Berber region who come to sell their products. Imrghach, Ait Tirghi, Tizi Mlil, and the valley of Amizmiz permit the discovery of the traditional life and customs of the Berbers in hiking from village to village.

The hotel experience


Contemporary design with a touch of Moroccan handicraft

The two partners Horst Reddmann and Philippe Taburiaux who already owned a riad in the medina were ready for a “bled” adventure when they created the Palais Paysan. After the Berber village of Akrich, you enter the 4-hectare property through an olive grove. The idea here is to offer a different vision of Morocco that is contemporary, through its polished perspective of architecture, and authentic by its decoration given to Ludovic Petit. Grey, highlighted by warm red, natural leather, painted woodwork, Moroccan tiles in the bathrooms...The Moorish tradition is respected and "avant-garded" by the geometric style, almost cubist, of the building.

The 16 rooms offer a comfortable rest in a modern setting with embroidered sheets and Berber carpeting in earth tones and gold. The bathrooms, with a bath and walk-in shower, are designed with Zellij decor. The rooms offer either a terrace or a balcony, opening up to the gardens and sublime views of the Atlas and the Jbel Toubkal.





The Tempting Experience:

A pure and silent scenery


If the name "Palais Paysan" was chosen to highlight the rural side of the hotel, “paysan” also shares a common root with the french words “paysage” meaning landscape or “dépaysement” meaning “change of scenery”. The hotel proposes indeed a 360° immersion in this minimalist landscape with all eyes on the Mount Toubkal and its eternal snow. Garden, olive grove, organic farm... sometimes desert or oasis, the natural scenery changes with each season. As per the soundtrack: the music of silence. Simple.
