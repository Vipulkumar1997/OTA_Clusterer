A boutique hotel in a sanctuary of silence and nature

The Pousada Picinguaba, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, overlooks a small fishing village, in the heart of the rainforest of the Natural Park of the Serra Do Mar (South West of Brazil). This boutique hotel is only a few miles away from the famous colonial town of Paraty.

The 10 rooms of the pousada and the villa casa verde look out on a beautiful tropical garden where you can admire beautiful flowers and colourful birds that will sometimes visit your room's balcony. The ocean view is magic, a sanctuary of silence and nature. Whether you prefer lazing around in a hammock or hiking in the woods, whether you are among friends, family or in a honeymoon, everyone will find its pace at the Pousada Picinguaba.

The Destination

Discover the charm of Paraty and of Mata Atlantica

The Pousada Picinguaba is located in between the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo and in the heart of Brazilian heritage.

The boutique hotel is close to the village of Picinguaba, which has preserved its charm and authenticity and is located in the Mata Atlantica coastal rainforest -- part of which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This rainforest has one of the richest ecosystems of the planet. You will enjoy discovering its culture, habitat, and its welcoming inhabitants.

Paraty, a colonial city, is a mere 30km away. It is a true cultural and artistic center with intact traditions and is classified as a Brasilian National Heritage site (Paraty is a candidate to become a UNESCO World Heritage Site).

40km away from the Pousada is Ubatuba. This small seaside town is the surfing capital of the coast by excellence and also has many bird watching sites.

Finally, 1 hour away of Paraty is the city of Cunha. Cunha is a stop on the gold-route, in the heart of the National Parc of Mantiqueira.

The hotel experience


Colonial architecture and primitive Amazon art

The hotel perfectly integrates with the spirit of its environment. The Pousada wanted to be simple and natural in order to respect and put forward the magic of the place. Enjoy a true break in the garden hammock, relax in the large spring water pool, and be charmed by the colorful orchids and bromeliads while listening to the song of the hummingbird.

The design of the Pousada Picinguaba is a mixture of colonial Portuguese architecture and primitive Indian Amazon art. The rooms are all unique, very simple, and decorated with works of Brazilian artists. The paintings and artifacts come from an art gallery in Sao Paulo and exhibit naturalist and naive Brazilian art.

Leave the unnecessary behind and keep only the essentials .... No technology finds its way to the Picinguaba: no TV, no phones, no internet access, no air conditioning in the rooms (the air conditioning occurs naturally through the thick walls and the vegetation).

All double rooms have a balcony where you can be soothed by the singing of the birds in your personal hammock. And if you really want to experience the calmness and space, then do not hesitate to book the bridal suite which has a Jacuzzi and a large terrace with a beautiful sea view. It is ideal for relaxing after a sea-trip or a forest hike .





The Tempting Experience:

Nature and Brazilian wild beaches


The pousada really immerses you in the heart of the most beautiful Brazilian nature. The area surrounding Picinguaba is one of the most beautiful, preserved and unknown region off the Brazilian coast. The tropical forest, falling into the sea, gives it a wild and dramatic air.

The boutique hotel faces a 3km stretch of protected beach and enjoys unobstructed views of the sea. The small beach by the Pousada is quiet and ideal for a morning bath. 20 other beaches are located within a 10-20 minutes drive. They are accessible by foot, by boat, or by car. Most beaches are completely deserted and you often will often encounter sea turtles (highly protected in Brazil). The water temperature varies with the seasons between 24 and 28 degrees Celsius.
Simply enjoying a true sanctuary of calmness and nature...

In the press



"The magic of the place is the right mix of style and hardiness. The welcome, friendly and personalized; the service, efficient and friendly; the cuisine, simple but exquisite thanks to the savour of the local products (...) give the impression of being welcomed by friends practicing the art of Etiquette: always present but never intrusive."

Marie Claire



"Few things have changed in the Serra do Mar from the first European arrival in Brazil. Water and land unite as at the beginning of the world. An authentic rejuvenating experience, four hours away from Rio"

Air France Magazine,  "The waters of the New World".
