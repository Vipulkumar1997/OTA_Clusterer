The Destination

Galle and its region

The city of Galle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is located about ten kilometres from The Fortress hotel. Well known for its fort and the colonial quarters, featuring a typical Dutch architecture, it used to be one of the most important cities of Sri Lanka, as the spice trail passed through its port. Colonized by the Portuguese then the Dutch, you can still glimpse striking houses from its rich cultural past. The fort welcomes visitors, the walk on the ramparts offering beautiful views of the city.

Fancy buying some souvenirs? Do stop at the shops on Elephant Walk, Mimimango or Barefoot. There, you will find accessories and jewellery made by local artisans and expat artists who have made Galle harbour their home.

If you prefer a lovely walk, simply stroll along the coast, admiring the city walls, until you reach the tall white lighthouse.

Diving enthusiasts can head to Hikkaduwa where there is stunning seabed to explore. Alternatively, take a boat ride on the Dodanduwa lagoon to see the local flora and fauna, which includes cormorants, kingfishers and monitor lizards.

The hotel experience


A mix of historical heritage and urban cool

The architecture of The Fortress hotel finds its inspiration in Walauwa, a typical colonial style house of the island: impressive facade, tall wooden door, gallery built around a large garden and white pillars opening towards the outside, letting the breeze through. On the garden side, the length of the pool seems to fall into the ocean as only a single wall separates the hotel from the beach. Whether relaxing on the deck or in a hammock, there is no need for the distraction of additional decoration. In front of you is the long beach of Koggala, the Indian Ocean, its fishermen and the palm trees bending in the wind. Nothing could be more soothing.

The 53 rooms and suits provide rather modern with king-size beds, luxury bathrooms equipped with a rain shower and even a whirpool for some. Wi-Fi, iPod dock, Bose surround sound, flat TV screen - this is the magic of The Fortress: an urban-cool style, unexpected in Sri Lankan seaside hotel.

If you're here for the scenery, we recommend the Ocean rooms on the first floor. You can enjoy a 360 degree view over the Indian Ocean and the beach of Koggala from their balcony.

Relaxation seekers will love the Beach Splash rooms, which have a small indoor pool.

For families or groups, we advise the Fortress Residences, offering 2 bedrooms and a private pool.

The Fortress hotel is perfectly equipped to provide a Zen experience. The spa is known throughout the country for its Ayurvedic treatments and even offers romantic treatments for two.






The Tempting Experience:

Fishing on stilts at Koggala Beach


The fishermen of the village have set up their stilts in the ocean, right in front of the hotel. They remain planted all day in the sand – their work starts early morning or at dusk. Once perched on their wooden stake, they wait patiently for the fish to appear, a fishing line in hand. Although traditional, this method is mostly used these days to present a skill to travellers and avoid the technique getting lost in time.
