The hotel experience


The Rodavento Boutique Hotel and Spa, undersigned by architect Gómez Crespo

When architect Waldemar Franco met his counterpart, Federico Gómez Crespo, they envisioned a boutique hotel that would be in total harmony with the spectacular surrounding pine forest landscape and where every suite would enjoy a breathtaking view of the private lake. The architects went at great length to preserve and enhance the natural richness of the area by, for example, reconditioning the lake. They bonded a strong link between the architecture and the environment and rather than imposing the building on the surrounding nature, raised it in the air to create a sensation of lightness and temporality.

The building`s architecture is very ornate: iron structure, wood, luminous tent-topped suites, glass, and natural materials that blend with the rest of the environment... The architects played with shapes, volumes, lights, and details to come up with a pure, functional, and extremely comfortable building that sharply contrasts yet neatly integrates into the exceptional surroundings and terrain.

The 28 exquisite suites have large sliding glass windows that open onto oversized wooden terraces from which one can breathe the fresh air and admire the view of the beautiful private lake and the 27 acres of surrounding forest. Luxury and nature blend to perfection!

The interiors, realized by Gina Parlange et Beatriz Sol, are warm and comfortable and combine natural elements such as wood or stone with the presence of water, the use of light veils, and a clever play on light and shades. The ambiance remains authentically Mexican thanks to typically mexican decoration elements such as colorful rugs or Mexican cushions.

All suites have a mezzanine so that the stay remains comfortable, even for a family of four. The bathrooms are elegant and equipped with retro-style bathtubs. The suites have a chimney place which will make you feel at home!





The Tempting Experience:

Paradise for outdoor adventurers


The adventure centre proposes a varied set of activities that fully take advantage of the beautiful site.
Some of the adventures that the centre proposes are:
- Zip-line for those who like adrenaline bursts whilst "flying" between the tree tops (safely secured by cables)
- Wall climbing: in the middle of the forest you will be able to test your climbing skills by practicing on an 8 metres high climbing wall
- Kayak: hop in a kayak, equipped with a life-jacket and explore the scenic Lake Rodavento
- Mountain Biking: lead by guides, discover the beautiful surrounding nature
- Paragliding: experience Leonardo Da Vinci`s dream in the hands of seasoned veterans and discover, in full safety and from the sky, the most beautiful and stunning landscapes of Valle de Bravo...
