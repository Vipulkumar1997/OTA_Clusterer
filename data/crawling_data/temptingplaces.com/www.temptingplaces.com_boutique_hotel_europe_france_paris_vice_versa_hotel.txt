A glamorous & playful atmosphere

Vice Versa is a boutique hotel designed and decorated by the French designer Chantal Thomass, widely known for her elegant, luxurious and playful designs. The name of the 4 stars hotel is an evidence of cheerfulness. The 37 rooms are distributed onto seven floors, each representing one of the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, wrath, pride, envy, sloth and lust. 
Ideally located within five minutes walking distance from the Paris Expo Porte de Versailles, the hotel Vice Versa is the perfect address for a business trip to Paris. The glamorous atmosphere really changes the meaning of business trip, mixing, in a contemporary way, work and pleasure.

The hotel experience


A boutique-hotel designed by Chantal Thomass

Opening the door of Vice Versa is walking into heaven. The front desk sits in a pristine white lobby decorated with large comfortable chairs to sit and relax. A perfect way to forget the vibrant city life and dive into a cozy cocoons

Seven floors leading to… seven sins. The designer Chantal Thomass was right inspired for her first hotel’s project. Throughout the hotel, you can find her glamorous, chic, and also palyful style. She designed all the furniture and decorative items such as the lamps, the wallpaper and the fabric patterns, all with a great attention to detail. A completely tailor-made décor!

The lobby and its honesty bar represent heaven. However, hell is not forgotten and his located in the basement, which displays colors of fire and a beautiful hammam.

Would you resist Gluttony and its sensual bed round as a macaroon? The candy-coloured cushions, the funny lamp shaped like teapots hanging above the bed, a cupcake chair, and sweets boxes all is made in this room to tempt you !

Greed is such a bad behaviour… but not here! All banknotes, dollars, shillings, and Belgian francs are for you! Bedside tables have locks to hide your treasures and the armoires resemble safes.

The Wrath floor displays a harmonized passion for red and black. Patterns of revolvers found on the carpet, lightening on the armoires, and a graffiti poster of Marie-Antoinette for a rock’n roll kind of Wrath !

Pride is represented as a majestic palace, an atmosphere of Etruscan glitz with gold marbled floors.

Envy is the most Parisian floor, inspired by the shopping addicts  and their desire for fashion goods. Jewelry, perfumes, shoes, everything Parisian is at your fingertips!

Sloth invites you to daydream in a bucolic setting. It's times to enjoy the passing time by lounging under a sky-blue ceiling and gaze at the flight of multicolored butterflies on the walls. Peaceful.

Lust is the top floor decorated in brilliant black and pink colors symbolizing pleasure. Suggestive female silhouettes adorn the walls. The ceiling decorated with mirrors, bodice laces on the carpet and lamps, and lace-patterned headboards all evoke sensuality.






The Tempting Experience:

Choose your sin!


If Vice Versa's lobby is paradise in its bright all-white decoration, know that the seven deadly sins will escort you to your room. With humor, Chantal Thomass developed a playful and chic hotel. Here is your chance to give up your guilt. You will enter into a universe where sin becomes a source of joy.
Greedy, jealous or arrogant? Every sin is allowed at Vice Versa and you may choose your room of sin*!

*Your choice of theme depends on hotel availability and is not guaranteed
