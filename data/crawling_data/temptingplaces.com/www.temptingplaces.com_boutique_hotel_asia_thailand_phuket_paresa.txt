A boutique hotel hanging on a sea-cliff

In Sanskrit "Paresa" means the Heavenly Heaven. Member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, this magnificent contemporary boutique hotel is located near Kamala, to the west of the Phuket Island, and is perched up on top of the cliff that offers a spectacular view of the Andaman Sea. A feast for the eyes is the best description of this Eden: the architecture and interior design are inspired by the styles of Southern Thailand. The 49 suites and villas are in the middle of the tropical forest, overlooking the sea-cliff and turquoise ocean. This is a perfect romantic gateway in an elegant and serene atmosphere.

The hotel experience


The Andaman sea: a view into eternity

Light, ocean, space are the three words to describe the forty-nine suits of Paresa. Through the giant window bay pour in light and a breath-taking view of the Sea of Andaman. The architectural  minimalism and the traditional South Thailand style forge a powerful alliance here, with wood and stone as the building materials of choice. The vast space of the suits, from140 to 660 square  meters plus the private terrace, gives the living quarters a serene intimacy. The biggest villas add to this an overflowing pool that merges with the blue of the ocean.





The Tempting Experience:

Dining under the stars


Relax by the ocean wave, imagine a romantic Thai dinner above the optic-fiber lightened pool. Experience the abundance of light reflected in the water, the infinity before you, after you and in you…
