The quintessence of elegance in a Parisian boutique hotel

Hotel Keppler, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a discreet and charming Parisian boutique hotel, located in the famous “Golden Triangle” area, only a few steps away from the Champs-Elysées. Sheltered from the surrounding bustle, this neo-classical building reveals a refined and sophisticated interior signed by the French designer Pierre-Yves Rochon. The 39 elegant rooms and suites (some of which offer a terrace and views over Paris) blend classic and contemporary styles with a French touch. Every single detail has been carefully thought to make you experience the intimacy of a private Parisian mansion-house. 
Hotel Keppler is an exceptional address, perfect for a business stay or as a starting point to explore Paris.

The Destination

Paris : the mythical Champs-Elysées

Within walking distance from the Keppler, is Baccarat, half way between a gallery and museum.  There you can learn the techniques used by this prestigious brand of crystal glass, discover their dazzling and exceptionally styled glass sets and objects.
The “Grande Dame” of Paris is of course a must on your to-do list. The Eiffel Tower, built for the World Fair in 1889, remains the symbol of the City of Lights. Many rooms at The Keppler offer a lovely view of that icon but nothing beats taking the lift to the tower’s second floor. An amazing 360° panorama of Paris awaits!
You can also walk to the Arc de Triomphe on Place de l’Etoile a few minutes’ walk from the hotel. The construction was ordered by Napoléon 1st in 1806 but only was completed in 1836. It now shelters the gravestone of the Unknown Soldier. Take the time to go to the very top to enjoy the view over the Champs-Elysées to the Concorde obelisk.
On the Champs-Elysées, the most mythical avenue in Paris, you will find a great choice of cafés, restaurants, and shops to accommodate all tastes. There are bars, pubs and nightclubs should you want a lively evening. If you prefer a very Parisian experience, try the Lido: the world famous cabaret is sure to wow you.

The hotel experience


Service, luxury and an intimate atmosphere

Conceived by the talented designer Pierre-Yves Rochon, the Keppler brings together black and white colours with sophisticated fabrics and textures. Fireplaces, high moulded ceilings, alcoves, glass roofs, antiques, delicate engravings… These refined French touches, enhanced by splashes of vibrant colours, are sure to steal your heart. Black undertones are contrasted with bright colours: flaming red in the Traditional Suite, sun-yellow in the Executive room or even cranberry in the Standard room.

The rooms located on the upper floors enjoy a balcony or a large terrace with an amazing view over the City of Lights and even… the Eiffel Tower.

Dark wooden floors, black leather, hand-made Turkish rugs, moulded ceilings…all these elements compose a refined, fascinating decor. The bathrooms are no less original: black and white marble and walls lined with traditional French Jouy tapestry or antique engravings. Subtle lighting adds to the relaxing atmosphere.

A rare luxury, a conservatory gives the opportunity to enjoy a little garden all year long – perfect place for a cup of tea.





The Tempting Experience:

A private Parisian mansion


The elegant furniture and sophisticated décor of the Keppler introduce you to a private Paris atmosphere. Although a few steps from the Champs-Elysées, its location perfect to make the most of Paris, this boutique hotel will prove a peaceful haven when you want to relax.
