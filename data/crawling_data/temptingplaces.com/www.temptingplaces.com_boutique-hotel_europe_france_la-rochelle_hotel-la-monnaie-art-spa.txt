The Destination

La Rochelle

La Rochelle is only 3 hours away by train from Paris, and is easily accessible by flight from London and Geneva. The city of Charente Maritime is rich of history and heritage buildings and is also set in a romantic seaside and port atmosphere. A stroll on the paved streets from Minage to the lighthouse, a light break at the terrace of a café, an half-hour shopping spree in the trendy stores, and a fragrant tour in the colourful market… no reason to get bored at La Rochelle!

The hotel experience


A hotel and an art gallery

The architecture, signed by Philippe Lucazeu, highlights the historical atmosphere of this former mansion with a creative and innovative aestheticism. Always echoing with the present and the past, the contemporary furniture mixes with the white walls which could indeed retrace the history of the city. All the hotel is habited by works of art, selected by the owner Sylvette Lebeau. The paintings stand alongside the digital pieces, the bronze or the resin sculptures from various talented artists : Hélène Jousse or El Peon in a subtile mix of styles.

The 36 rooms and suites are made in a designed and comfortable way with a view on the patio or on the garden. The colours are discrete, the white omnipresent and like in all other hotel’s area, works of art decorate them.






The Tempting Experience:

The Happy Few Spa: exclusiveness and privacy


The spa at La Monnaie combines exclusiveness and wellness in a warm and private atmosphere*. One  or two hours of total idleness, alone or for two. The 2 hydro-massaging tables on waterbeds offer a special water jets progressive massage to choose along 12 programs according to your need (Low back, zen attitude, tired legs, reviving…). The transparent jacuzzi** pool is unique in France and is accompanied by a set of relaxing bright scene based on chromotherapy such as in the sauna and in the showers. Traditional massages are also available on request in rooms (ayurveda, californian, hot stones, etc).
*by reservation only and at extra charges
**jacuzzi is closed till end of 2016. We apologize for any inconvenience.
