A design and wine hotel in Portugal

The minimalist décor of the Brazilian designer Márcio Kogan invites each visitor to experience a serene stay, harmoniously complemented by a spa Caudalie.The luxury of the 22 guestrooms and suites lies within the details, the regal materials such as wood and stone… Beauty in all simplicity.

- 10% coupon on SPA services
- Complimentary upgrade (upon availabilities)

The hotel experience


Homage to Alentejo

All the decorations are homage to the natural beauty of the region. The designer was inspired by local noble materials such as light wood furniture and slate for the bathtubs for example. Distinguished pieces have a touch of refinement such as the George Nakashima bank. Essential contemporary technology: Ipad and Ipod docks as well as Bose surround sound systems in the ceilings of the 10 Sky View suites.
The 10 Sky View suites offer not only a unique view of the starry sky but also a outdoor terrace featuring a fireplace and two private patios
The 12 exclusive land residence villas each have their own private vineyard and offer not only two bedrooms and a Jacuzzi, but the possibility for guests to make their own wine.





The Tempting Experience:

A suite with a view of the stars


Alentejo is one of the least polluted places in Europe; the atmosphere there is pure and the clear skies offer a magnificent view of the stars. The idea came from the designers of the hotel who created suites with retractable ceilings that offer the most beautiful view of the stars from bed. Beautiful dreams are guaranteed!

The Services


Bar
The bar is situated close to the outside patio under a pergola. Enjoy the central fireplace while having a drink or a slice of homemade bread.
Restaurant
Chef Miguel Laffan’s wish is to reinterpret the Portuguese identity within his kitchen. For this reason, he has chosen biodynamic and organic agriculture in season and from the region. The Portuguese history is marked by long journeys where one could find a menu of inspirations from all over the world. Each dish is accompanied by a wine from the region, or from the hotel owner’s own private vineyards.
Spa & Wellness
The AND spa is 800 m2 of serenity and vinotherapy! Turkish baths, heated pool and spa treatments inspired by the distinguished Claudalie grape program. Leave your troubles behind and surround yourself with the scent of essential oils that fill the space and try a unique treatment experience: a cabernet exfoliation or a honey and wine wrap.




The Activities


Oenology
For those who are passionate about Oenology courses, visits to the caves and wine tastings can be organized.
