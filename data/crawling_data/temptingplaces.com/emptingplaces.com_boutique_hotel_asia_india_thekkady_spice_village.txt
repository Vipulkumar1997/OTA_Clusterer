A boutique hotel centered around authenticity and natural wellness

The Spice Village, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a boutique hotel located in Thekkady, 190 km away from Kochi, after an amazing drive through the lush and misty hills of Kerala. This area is famous for its tea, spices and also its wildlife, elephants and tigers that you might encounter in the Periyar Park. The 52 villas at Spice Village were built and decorated with simplicity using local materials.
More really means less here: no air conditioning and no TV to be in harmony with this tribal region. An amazing stay for modern travelers who are looking for authenticity and natural wellness.

The hotel experience


A boutique hotel in the middle of the rainforest

You will discover the Spice Village between the trees such as a plant growing naturally on a bamboo, teak or honeysuckle forest. You will have the impression to be in a middle of a primitive jungle, but in reality the forest surrounding the Spice Village is the brainchild of a single man, A. W. Woods. He worked for the British government in the 30's and his passion for nature and the local ooralie tribe culture of the Kerala mountains, led him to settle down on this land and to built his house, which is now the Woodhouse Bar of the Spice Village, and an arboretum.

The 52 individual bungalows with verandas offer modern comfort while respecting the environment and local culture: hot water by solar panels, traditional palm roof, local wooden furniture and tiled floor. The song of the 50 species of birds of the Spice Village will replace the TV with enchantment!
You can choose between Standard Villas or the big Deluxe Villas, both of them have an outdoor terrace to enjoy the beautiful Kerala evenings while benefiting the smell of lemongrass and cardamom.





The Tempting Experience:

A historic bar


The Spice Village Bar is the former home of the creator of the place: W. Woods. In addition to enjoy delicious cocktails or play snooker, you can admire the many historical photos displayed on the walls. You`re invited to a fabulous journey through time at the era of the great British Empire. You will have the impression that Winston Churchill, who used to smoke his cigars here, just left the room... For the record, Churchill made his cigars, the famous "Black Tigers", tailor-made by the family Fan Thompson`s from a nearby village in Tamil Nadu.
