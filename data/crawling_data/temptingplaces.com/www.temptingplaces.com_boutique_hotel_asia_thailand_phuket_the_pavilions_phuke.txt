The Destination

Enjoy Phuket

Phuket is one of the most popular destinations in Thailand. The main attraction is all the beautiful beaches with their fine sand and crystalline water. The Pavilions, Phuket is sited near the tranquil Layan Beach that extends throughout the historical rice paddies on the island and through some wet fields where you can see the buffalo roam and splash about.

But apart from this, Phuket is also full of activities.

Sportsmen can enjoy walking, canoeing in Phang Nga, or scuba-diving in the most beautiful spots in Thailand at Christmas Point and Elephant Head.

Khao Phra Thaeo, located at the tip of the island, is one of the most interesting National Park regions. Do not forget to try out elephant trekking!

The nightlife is very lively in Phuket. To get away from the crowd, you can simply go to Cape Promthep to admire the sunset, and try-out the local cuisine. Walking through the Phuket Town night market is lovely.
