The Destination

Discover the jetset charm of Buzios

This former fishing port has become the St. Tropez of Brazil, and has become THE place to be for its beaches and its nightlife. The peninsula was made famous by French actress Brigitte Bardot in the 1960s -- she even has a statue in the main street: Rua des Pedras.

Armação dos Búzios, simply called "Búzios", is an 8km long peninsula surrounded by islands, and boasts over 20 beaches from all styles.

This charming city with its typical narrow streets is also a mecca for cuisine in Brazil. There are plenty of restaurants to indulge yourself.

The Búzios Golf Club attracts players from around the world. Its 18-hole course was designed by Pete and Perry Dye who chose to preserve the natural environment and who enhanced the geographical features of the terrain to test the performance of the players.

An ideal place for diving, the crystal clear waters of Búzios are also a living aquarium.

Do not forget to visit the house do Sino, an typical buziana construction of the past centuries, and the Church of Santana from the 16th century.

The hotel experience


Brazilian designers and unique rooms with magnificent sea views

The Insolito Boutique Hotel is housed in a building designed by the famous Brazilian architect Otavio Raja Gabaglia -- the father of the Buzios "jet-set" allure. Of Mediterranean inspiration, the hotel is perched above the sea and offers fantastic sea views.

The 20 white rooms, decorated by Emmanuelle Meeus de Clermont-Tonnerre, are real colorful works of art! The rooms each have beautiful sea-views and feature Trussardi bathrobes and sheets, luxury Sealy mattresses and Karsten Zero Twist towels.

Choose amongst 4 room categories, each with different room sizes and some with or without terrace. Themes set the room appart but all categories are hyper comfortable and boast luxurious amenities.

Some of our favorite picks are:

Casa Cultura Negra that portrays the black Afro culture in Brazil;
Outeiro da Gloria that has an azulejos signboard creation of Laura Taves which symbolizes the presence of the azulejos technique in Brazilian religious art;
Moda that reveals sketches of Brazilian designers, catalogs of the cariocas brands, and dress-shaped lamps crafted from tin cans;
the Orfeu da Conceição Suite that relates the works of french writer and film director Marcel Camus who shot Orfeu Negro in Rio for which he subsequently received the Palme d`Or at the Cannes Film Festival and an Oscar for the best foreign film.





The Tempting Experience:

Stay in a work of art and pay tribute to Brazilian culture


Emmanuelle Meeus de Clermont Tonnerre was fascinated by Brazil and designed the Insolito Boutique Hotel as an art exhibit. A true curator, she assembled a unique collection that pays tribute to the Brazilian culture.

The artworks are not only displayed in the rooms but also and in the common areas such as the living room with a Pigmento Ovo table and a beautiful rustic wooden sofa signed by Elma Chavez.

The recycled rubber mats are designed by Cecilia Machado and, in the context of a social responsibility, were crafted by prisoners of Muzambinho and of Nova Rezende. We`d also mention the photos of the anthropologist Claudia Andujar, the stickers of André Diniz and of the young Brazilian designer Juliana Llussa.
