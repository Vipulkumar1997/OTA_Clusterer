The hotel experience


A historical village on the water

In a space so calm that you will notice the sound of the herons and the lapping of waves when boats are passing, it is difficult to imagine that this was the starting point of the spice trade years ago. All canals, ponds, rivers are connected by bridges. Wallk over the banks and enjoy the full experience of the backwaters. The Coconut Lagoon is a luxurious village on the water, constructed thanks to the wonderful skills of the local artisans. The Kerala architecture uses natural materials like wood, clay, palm leaves and copper medals. Those of you with an eye for detail will notice the tiny elements that come together in a elegant, minimalist style: the stylized work of the old beams, copper elements adorning the doors, glossy wooden piers ... Very old tactics that have been refurbished to meet the present style. No two villas are identical! You can be sure to sleep in a unique place, a historical villa offering luxury contemporary comfort.

Three type of house are available:

Heritage Bungalows: detached villa situated in a garden along a canal. With a lounge and small terrace.
The Heritage Mansions, which we recommend for families, are independent duplex villas with 1 bedroom and a lounge fully furnished with antiques.
For a romantic getaway, couples will appreciate the Deluxe Pool Villas. Independent villas with a private pool and a hammock on the terrace to relax while listening to the birds of the lake.
The bathrooms are "open air" decorated in a Kerala style to enjoy a shower under the stars in complete privacy.

The freshness of a coconut, the sweetness of a polished wood, the rustle of the air passing through the blinds, the flapping wings of a butterfly, the sweet smell of an orchid - Coconut Lagoon is a paradise for the senses.





The Tempting Experience:

Sleep in an open air museum


All the buildings of the Coconut Lagoon are authentic `Therawads,` typical family houses of this region of southern India. Abandoned, they were saved from destruction, dismantled, and shipped here for a second life. The lobby, for example, is a house from 1860 that belonged to a Brahmin family from a nearby village. In the traditional Nalukettu style, the house consists of four wings arranged around a central courtyard. The heritage is thus preserved in a traditional manner as well as in a spirit of sharing with travelers, who can enjoy the Kerala art of living and sleeping in an open air museum.
