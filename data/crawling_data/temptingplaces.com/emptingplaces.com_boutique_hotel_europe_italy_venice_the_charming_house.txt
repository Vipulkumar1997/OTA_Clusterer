Works from the Pinault collection are exhibited.
The Venice Biennale is one of the most prestigious art events in the world. Founded in 1895, it welcomes every two years at different sites of the city artists, painters, dancers, musicians... Get ready, the 56th Biennale will be held from May 9 to November 22, 2015.

The hotel experience


The art of a contemporary Venice

Chiara Bocchini, The Charming House's owner, hoped to offer a different Venetian stay, an intimate experience coupled with modern comforts with an emphasis on contemporary art. The architect Mauro Mazzolini thus creating the three addresses combining sleek lines and avant-garde furniture. The contemporary collection of Italian artists, with works by Raimondo Galeano and other favorites such as Stefania Orrù or Gianni Tarli, adorns the walls. In DD724 the full library of art books complete the atmosphere in the mood of the times.

For the 3 addresses, choosing contemporary decor complements a palette of neutral colors, highlighted by red and orange. The games of lights in LED and candles give each room its shimmering charm. Technological comfort is not forgotten: flat screen TV, DVD player, iPod dock, Nespresso machine, chromotherapy bath and internet access.

DD724 opens up to a view of the gondolas navigating the Rio Torreselle and Giudecca Canal or directly on the lovely garden of the Palace and Peggy Guggenheim Museum. Exposed beams and fireplaces give the rooms their elegance.

Near the DD724, DD694 overlooks the Rio Torreselle canal and the Campiello Barbaro Square. The suite offers an independent stay with its kitchenette.

The 3 suites of iQs have views of the Rio di Santa Maria Formosa in the district of Castello. As in a large palace, the entrance is through the private jetty on the channel. Breakfast is served in the rooms.






The Tempting Experience:

One hotel, three addresses


Charming House offers three gorgeous places to discover Venice: DD724, DD694, and iQs. The reception is at DD724, in Dorsodouro on the Rio Torreselle Fondamenta Venier dei Leoni. You will then be led towards one of the outbuildings. The DD694 is in two streets down this same mythical neighborhood of Venice so appreciated by Peggy Guggenheim, the high priestess of 20th century art. iQs is in a different area: Castello, in the heart of the most emblematic monuments such as the Doge's Palace and the Bridge of Sighs. Three ways to appreciate the current tempo of the ancient city.
