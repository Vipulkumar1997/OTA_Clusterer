A refined boutique hotel overlooking both garden and sea

The contemporary facade of L’Agapa Hotel, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, overlooks Perros Guirec beach in Brittany, situated by the famous Pink Granite Coast with its beautiful pastel tint.

Stunning Agapanthus flowers, symbol of the Côte d’Armor area, fill the garden side of the hotel with colour, inspiration for its name. The sea-facing side offers a grandiose view over the local beach, known as Trestraou. The first five star hotel of the region, the property’s 45 rooms combine comfort, wellbeing and a luxurious setting. L’Agapa also offers a gourmet restaurant and a Nuxe spa, making it the ideal retreat for an outdoorsy, relaxing or romantic weekend in Brittany.

The Destination

Perros-Guirec and the Pink Granite Coast

The Pink Granite Coast is situated in the Côtes d'Armor region, between Perros Guirec and Trébeurden in Brittany. As you can guess, the name was inspired by the extraordinary geology of these cliffs, displaying a very unique granite with pink hues. To see “La vie en rose”, wait for the sun to set when they will be at their most magical. We highly recommend a visit to the Mean Ruz lighthouse or the Pointe du Skewel, a small out-cropping with particularly beautiful rocks sculpted by the sea, making some of the best postcard views of the area.

You can also set sail and take a trip to the Sept Iles! This natural site located 7km from Perros Guirec houses a unique variety of bird life. With more than 20,000 breeding pairs and 27 species, it is actually the largest reserve on the French coast. Boats leave from the beach of Trestraou just in front of L’Agapa.

Lovers of historical heritage and culture will adore the Chateau de Kergrist, situated in Ploubezre (15km from Perros Guirec). This mansion showcases architecture typical of the Renaissance period in the region, while its facades were added a little later, in the 17th and 18th century. It remains a private property to this day, one part being open for tourists to enjoy.

The hotel experience


A contemporary take on the coastal feel

L’Agapa is built around smooth lines, steel, glass and granite - a rather distinctive architecture compared to the usual classicism favored by seaside hotels. Inside, you will find a sleek décor with geometrical designs, art deco style, realised in elegant materials: copper, marble, mahogany, granite. One particular square pattern, acts as leading thread throughout and was discreetly integrated in choosing the curtains, bed coverings, tiles, glass, the shape of the furniture, even on the swimming pool mosaic. Haute-couture black and white fashion can be found throughout the hotel, blending with the high tech features available in each room: home theater system, “Touch me” lamps, home automation, media hub… You can, from your bed, control the intensity of the lights, the position of the curtains or even answer the various phones in the room. The ultimate sense of comfort!


The 45 rooms are divided into three areas: The Agapa and two villas, Désirade and the Eden Roc.

The Agapa is the main building. To reach the rooms, you will step into a cinematic elevator screening a Charlie Chaplin movie. On the fourth floor, the Altitude suite offers a magical view of the bay.
Désirade has ten rooms, all with a sea view, some of which enjoy a private terrace facing the sea.
The Eden Roc villa is situated on a slightly lower level which can be reached via a quaint garden staircase. Its two rooms also enjoy a sea view.





The Tempting Experience:

Sea as the most beautiful show


You will not find any paintings adorning the L’Agapa. There is no need for them, look all around: the garden, the beach, the sea make a view the hotel is proud of, a natural décor evolving through the day, always slightly different. The large windows become murals which could rival the most famous masters, the terrace a living picture.
