The Destination

The Algarve, off the beaten track

The extreme south of Algarve escapes from crowded beaches of the Faro area. This region has preserved its authentic side and the Atlantic breeze, especially in summer, is always welcome! Here are 3 visits not to be missed:

Mount Foia. Peak of the Algarve at 902 m, green region popular with hikers with sweeping views over the plain to the sea
Caldas de Monchique. A spa dating from Roman times and rebuilt around a typical little village. The water is fluoridated and has the properties of a "love potion" according to the legend!
Cacela Velha. A typical beach village with whitewashed houses.

The hotel experience


Contemporary luxury for the whole family

One would think that Martinhal Sagres Beach Family Resort Hotel is married to the sea that it becomes a part of the natural landscape. The architecture is organic; simple and contemporary lines honor  noble materials such as wood and granite of Monchique.

The 37 rooms and suites, decorated by the British designer Michael Sodeau, echo the natural surroundings with an emphasis on local materials such as wicker and cork, pastel colors and plant forms of furniture. Luxury is found in modern details: Ipod docks, Nespresso machines, Wifi ... All rooms have a balcony or terrace to enjoy the magnificent ocean views.

The Terrace Rooms are in the ground-floor garden. The terrace`s sun loungers are perfect for a nap in the sun. The Beach Rooms, more intimate, are built away from the main building. The huge bay windows open onto a terrace or balcony facing the ocean. It`s the perfect room to fall asleep to the sound of waves.

The 2 Beach Suites have the most luxurious loft bedrooms and elegant lounges, opening onto terraces made of teak. Families will enjoy the adjacent Beach Room for a comfortable stay.





The Tempting Experience:

Living at the end of the world in the most secret part of the Algarve


The Martinhal Sagres Beach Family Resort Hotel has a unique location on the southern tip of Europe. Between the ocean and cliffs, it offers a breathtaking panorama of Finistere. Standing on your terrace, hair flying, it is a unique experience to find yourself privileged at the top of the world, like the caravels of the fifteenth century prepared to explore the planet ...
