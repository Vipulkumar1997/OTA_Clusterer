The Destination

Parisian galleries on the Champs Elysees

The Champs Elysées, or "Les Champs" as it is often called, remains the most mythical avenue in Paris. It connects the Place de la Concorde to the Place Charles de Gaulle. You can walk straight down or visit the many side streets. From Le Marianne, you simply need to walk through Gallery 66 on rue de Ponthieu.

The Lido Arcades, probably the most famous gallery, opened in the 1920s and stands out from other galleries of the era by its exceptional 15 metre width. It almost exclusively relies on artificial lighting. Its name comes from the prestigious cabaret act who settled there in 1929.
76-78, avenue des Champs Elysees - 59, rue de Ponthieu

La Galerie des Champs Elysées was entirely redesigned by architect Jean Nouvel, thus regaining its former elegance while taking on a contemporary edge. In this gallery is H&M;’s world flagship store, almost 2,800 square metres in size.
82-88, avenue des Champs-Elysées

The hotel experience


A hotel designed as a private residence

The owner, Mr. Assant entrusted this classic Haussmann building to architect Vincent Bastie and decorator Charles Zana. Their mission? Transforming it into a 4* boutique hotel, while retaining the charm of a Parisian private residence. Le Marianne embodies this renewed vision of the "boutique hotel" with its arty decor while making the guests’ welfare a priority. Charles Zana pays tribute to the great masters of Italian design – a field in which he is a true expert. Both fabric and furniture have been chosen with fine taste and attention to detail.

In the entrance your gaze is drawn to the majestic golden brass chandelier by artist Johanna Grawunder as well as by the luxurious Pozzano marble reception desk. The color scheme is sober - anthracite and celadon - to better showcase vivid works of art including a painting by Bernard Frize, from the owner’s personal collection.

The breakfast area opens onto a patio and its skylight, a pleasant feature in the city center.

Art remains ever-present, including the lift, covered with a golden mesh, the work of textile artist Sophie Mallebranche.

The three room categories, Classic, Superior and Deluxe, have been designed as perfect living spaces complete with bespoke interior design, a seating set (consisting of a three-legged-table, a comfortable club chair and a leather ottoman set in brass) as well as a marble bathroom with Pascal Morabito toiletries. The materials used are luxurious, the finishing touches to perfection. Leather and velvet appear in shades of mustard and petrol blue. Finely veined gray flooring has been chosen and carpets added around the bed. The headboards are nicely decorated with patterned fabrics: diamonds, dots or stripes giving each room its identity. Photographs taken by Julien Mignot adorn the walls, adding a contemporary touch. The rooms also offer Airplay technology, enabling you to connect tablets and smartphones to the TV via Bluetooth.

On the 4th and 5th floors, the four connecting rooms overlooking rue Paul-Baudry are ideal for families.





The Tempting Experience:

The perfect Parisian dream


Le Marianne is a lovely mix of little details that define the most beautiful Parisian addresses. The Haussmannian architecture, symbol of the Greater Paris, proves very popular with travelers. Even the address, "Baudry street”, pays tribute to the classical painter Paul Baudry, who embellished the interior of the magnificent Opera hall at the request of Napoleon III... The Parisian fairies really have blessed Le Marianne hotel, helping it best reflect the soul of the City of Light, its history, its culture.
