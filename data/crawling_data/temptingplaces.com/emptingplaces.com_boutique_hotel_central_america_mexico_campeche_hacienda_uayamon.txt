A boutique hotel and a beautiful 18th century heritage hacienda just off Campeche

The Hacienda Uayamon, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is an 18th century colonial house of the Mexican south-east region of Yucatan. It is conveniently located close to the walled city of Campeche - UNESCO world heritage site. In the 19th century, this hacienda and its plantation had become one of the pillars of the regional economy. Recently restored into a luxury heritage boutique hotel, it has successfully preserved the romance and cachet of the old stones but combined it with luxury, comfort, and personalised services and attentions.

Scenic gardens with lush vegetation, aired terraces, 10 large rooms and 2 suites with private terrace and private plunge pools ... this haven of peace is ideally suited to relax after a busy day of sightseeing in Campeche or the surrounding relics of the Mayan civilisation and colonial past.





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary neck & shoulders massage for 2 persons (Length: 15 min)
- 25% coupon on SPA treatments

The hotel experience


An authentic colonial plantation reinvented into a beautiful heritage boutique hotel

The objective of the restoration was to preserve the spirit and leverage the architectural elements that made up the particular personality of this Yucatan hacienda into a modern, charming, luxury boutique hotel.

Some areas of the colonial plantation were re-imagined such as the main building`s room that was redesigned into a nice swimming pool with crumbling, roofless stone walls and topless pillars. Two suites have been created in what was the hacienda`s hospital. The other ten rooms, spread around the plantation, were former workers` quarters that have been restyled into luxurious and intimate places - ideal for couples.

Be they suites or rooms, all are styled with state of the art modern comfort and are adorned with flashbacks from the past: notice the large hooks, sticking out of the thick stone walls, used to span the cotton-woven hammocks? These hammocks allow guests to sink into a comfortable and relaxing Mayan sleep!

The colonial villa is spacious and has a large bedroom with oversized wrought iron bed, a bathroom with shower and bathtub, a superb "day bed", and an exquisite private terrace and private plunge pool.

The colonial suite, located in the old hacienda hospital, has a large bedroom, lounge area, and its own private terrace and plunge pool too!

Hacienda Uayamon preserves the environment and promotes the local community by using recycled water to irrigate its gardens or to grow its own fruit and vegetables. The owners also helped initiate the World Haciendas Foundation, which supports henequen rope-making communities in the Mexican southeast.





The Tempting Experience:

A lesson of style signed by Jaya Ibrahim


The design of the hacienda`s interior was imagined by the notorious Indonesian interior architect, Jaya Ibrahim, and this touch gives the Hacienda Uayamon its uniqueness.

We spoke to Jaya Ibrahim who told us that when he initiated the project, he carefully reviewed the styles of the period in order to make sure to reshape the hacienda whilst preserving its authentic Hispanic style. He has imagined a renovation that re-establishes the luxury of the colonial times when rich plantation owners and industrial barons lived and instituted their lifestyle. Thus leveraging the old elements and mixing them with modern contemporary touches. Jaya Ibrahim`s preferred room is the library.
