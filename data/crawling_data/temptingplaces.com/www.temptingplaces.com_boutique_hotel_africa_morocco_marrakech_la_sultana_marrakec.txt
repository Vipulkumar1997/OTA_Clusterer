The Destination

Bahia Palace

The most beautiful palace of Marrakech is undoubtedly the Bahia Palace, accurately named the “Palace of the Beautiful.” Built in the nineteenth century, the palace was a gift from the Grand Vizier for his favourite harem—a “mad” Easterner. Ten hectares of indoor gardens and fountains with 160 rooms of subtle ornamentation make this walk of “Arabian Nights" one not to be missed.

Note: The royal family often stays here, therefore not all of the palace is open to visitors.

The hotel experience


A Charming Stay in a Magical City

La Sultana Marrakech is situated directly in the golden triangle of the red city, only 100 metres from the Royal Palace and near the Bahia Palace and the famous Jemma El Fna Square. The famous Palace of Arabian Nights, a riad of bewitching charm, evokes mystery and magic… all eastern fantasies that suit the magnificent palace. Around every riad more of the forgotten splendor of Marrakech unfolds for those willing to look.

Each of the 28 rooms and suites are authentically decorated with luxury and sophistication. Here the authentic heritage and modern luxury echo each other in perfect harmony for the guest; bathrooms with marble floors, chimneys in each room, an extensive collection of authentic art, carved and painted ceilings, precious woods, along with tadelakt, central air conditioning and heating, satellite TV, and high speed internet access. These amenities combine to accurately reflect the blend of old and new in this magical city.

If you would like extra space, choose the Junior Deluxe Suite, a luxurious suite of 45 square metres with a private balcony.  As for a room with the best lighting, you should consider the Deluxe Suites of the riad which overlook the pool for pristine panoramic views.





The Tempting Experience:

The entire world in a Palace


La Sultana consists of five different riads, each with its own uniquely theme décor. When passing through from one to another, prepare yourself for a voyage around the world. The reception is in the Riad Almohade, full of earthy tones and natural themes that continue around the pool, reminiscent of a Moroccan oasis. Riad Saadia is a postcard view of Imperial Fez complete with authentic warm colours.  Continuing through the Riad Bahia, the pure white theme present in this riad reminds one of a pristine and luxurious beach. The Riad Shéhérazade is an ode to Africa and its exotic wildlife. The journey finally ends at Riad Sabah, designed with red and blue colours to bring one`s thoughts all the way to Mexico. Be prepared for a beautiful and authentic journey!
