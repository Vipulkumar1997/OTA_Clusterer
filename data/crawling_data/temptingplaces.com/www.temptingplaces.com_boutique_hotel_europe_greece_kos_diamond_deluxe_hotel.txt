The hotel experience


An oasis of glamour and design

The charm of the Diamond Deluxe Hotel begins in the entrance hall. The staircase seems to float on top of the beautifully polished marble and tiny diamonds sparkle throughout the lobby, adding an air of elegance.
The 110 uncluttered, elegant rooms and suites are scattered around the pool. Whether your room has a view of the ocean, the pool, or the countryside, the interior decoration draws from traditional elements of the island. The frequent use of the color white helps to create a spa-like environment and also serves as an invitation to the sun. Rooms have either king beds, round beds, or canopy beds. All rooms are relaxing spaces, which offer flat screen TVs, satellite, massaging baths, and a terrace.





The Tempting Experience:

Open sky design paradise


A decidedly contemporary hotel, the Diamond is the signature work of Marcel Wanders, a Dutch design icon. You can`t miss his horse lamp from the Moooi label, produced exclusively for the Diamond in gold. The Italian Edra chairs, magnificent sculptures, chandeliers, chairs, and modern wallpaper create a luminous and avant-garde aura.
