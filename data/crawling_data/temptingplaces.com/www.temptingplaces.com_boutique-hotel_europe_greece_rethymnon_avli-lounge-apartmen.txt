The Destination

Réthymnon: a charming Cretan city with interlaced alleys

It is so easy to get lost in Réthymnon, but also so nice! Alleys unpredictably criss-cross each others, so much so that you will enjoy wandering along the ancient walls and the city`s shops. The city centre is at the top of the peninsula where a soft breeze of fresh air blows. Everything blends to perfection for you to appreciate this antique city, undoubtedly the best preserved of Crete.

The hotel experience


9 unique suites with Jacuzzis

Each suite in AVLI`s Venetian mansions has a unique and stylish interior design. Colors and styles depict the local architectural tradition enhanced with modern comfort.
Stone walls, wooden ceilings and comfortable sofas are all warm elements that intensify the sophistication of the disposed antiques. The suites have an original, extravagant detail: a Jacuzzi located in the bedroom or in the bathroom. Water is a richness in Crete and the Jacuzzi is great for enjoying energizing baths.

The Suites are classified in 2 categories: the Lounge apartment which pay homage to a unique architectural style based on the 15th century atmosphere and the Candy Suites colourful and with a décor inspired from candy, jellies, small cakes, lollipops and cookies ! Like in a child dream !





The Tempting Experience:

A unique enoteca


More than 460 wines, from Greek producers, quietly lay in AVLI`s cave, one of the biggest in Greece. Cretan lords used to stock their grapes 500 years ago in this same cave.
The cave`s interior design is magnificent and eclectic in style: wooden walls, Venetian arches, contemporary metal candelabras, a fountain... Candles and a soft lamp top it off for a very cozy dinner. You may enjoy a wine tasting for 2, 25 or 100 people in the AVLI`s cave.
