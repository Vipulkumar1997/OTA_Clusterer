Sea, surf and gastronomy on a Balinese island

The Indiana Kenanga, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located on the small island of Nusa Lembongan, separated from South Bali by the Badung Strait. A boat ride will take you to this little paradise by the sea – you are just half an hour from Sanur, an hour from the airport. The island promises an authentic experience complete with relaxation and surfing, which Indiana Kenanga seconds with the warmest welcome and refined gastronomy, prepared by the French chef Clement Fouqueré. The elegant decoration of the 14 suites and 2 villas, together with 2 pools and the wellness centre, make of this seaside hotel the perfect retreat for couples and families alike. Guests will get to experience the real charm of Balinese life

The Destination

Nusa Lembongan

The little island of Nusa Lembongan is located off Bali, less than thirty minutes from Sanur by speedboat. Expect beautiful white sandy beaches! The waves in selected spots attract surfers from all around the world. The place also is known for its seaweed farming, the latter being exported to Japan and China.

The west coast of the island is framed by a long coral reef while the north coast and surrounding islands have similar but smaller reefs. The main leisure activities count surfing and scuba diving with manta rays.

Exploring the lush mangrove forest is a real must, as is visiting the neighbouring islands of Nusa Ceningan (which you can reached via a bridge) & Nusa Penida.

The hotel experience


The Bali of yesteryear and contemporary luxury

The island of Nusa Lembongan reflects what Bali used to be: a peaceful haven away from the hectic pace of the world. Traditions are central to the daily life of the seaweed gatherers and fishermen. You will not see any car around: bikes and scooters are the preferred means of transport. The Indiana Kenanga boutique hotel was built respecting the local customs and Balinese architecture: carved wooden doors, bamboo roofs, woven silk curtains...
The 14 suites and 2 villas are set in a tropical garden facing the beach. The decoration, signed by the French owner Veronika Debise, has a soothing yet voluptuous vibe, the beautiful fabrics, once mixed with local objects, adding a contemporary dimension to the rooms. Luxury is there, in discreet touches: every single detail is of importance.

The luxury suites all open onto a private garden. They are spacious and fully equipped for two persons.
Families or groups will really enjoy the villas. Each is composed of 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchenette and a private pool, ideal if you prefer to be independent during your stay at the hotel.

The wellness area (120 m2) is the ideal place to find peace or indulge in an amazing massage, surrounded by scents of ylang-ylang and sandalwood. It is harmoniously complemented by a yoga room.
You would have two beautiful swimming pools to choose from, truly wonderful locations to swim or simply to relax in the sunshine by the water.

The two restaurants (one being a real gourmet experience) add to the exceptional qualities of Indiana Kenanga, comparable to much bigger hotels in terms of service and comfort.





The Tempting Experience:

Gourmet French cuisine on an Indonesian island


A Balinese massage, cocktails on the beach at sunset... The atmosphere of Indiana Kenanga is definitely enchanting but what will make your stay unforgettable is Fouqueré Clement’s exceptional cuisine and this from the very first taste, right at breakfast! His signature? A real savoir-faire, generous plates, local products and a creative menu combining French and Asian influences.
Clement Fouqueré is a passionate cook, a quality inherited from his grandmother who gave him a love for flavours and the traditions in gastronomy. He mastered his cooking techniques by learning from the greatest French chefs – like Eric Fréchon from Le Bristol Restaurant in Paris, with no less than 3 Michelin stars. Also a surf fan, Clement Fouqueré has the deepest respect for the surrounding nature, transcribing these emotions, this magic in his dishes.
