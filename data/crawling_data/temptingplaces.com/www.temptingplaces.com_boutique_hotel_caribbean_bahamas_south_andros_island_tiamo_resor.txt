An eco-chic hotel in the Bahamas

Tiamo, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a 5-star hotel located on South Andros Island, Bahamas, one of the best dive sites in the world. You thought paradise was lost forever? This hotel found it for you. The creek, the private beach and the lush vegetation, everything looks like a piece of Eden. The 11 villas are built on stilts in the pure Caribbean fashion. They are perfect to just breathe, sit back on a deckchair and relax in the shade of palm trees while admiring the pristine water. Then going on an excursion in the mangrove seems like "the thing to do". Tiamo is a place full of wonders that nature lovers, divers and honeymoon couples will not be able to get enough of.





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary welcome glass of champagne
- Complimentary early check-in and late check-out (upon availabilities)

The Destination

Discover the capital of the Bahamas, Nassau

Covering most of the island of New Providence, Nassau, the capital of the country is not limited to pristine water and white sand. It also offers a large variety of cultural activities for the whole family.

The catholic cathedral Saint-Francis Xavier: the very first catholic church in the Bahamas which was erected in 1886.
The Pirate Museum of Nassau: a place where you`ll learn more about pirates of the Caribbean.
The Balcony House Museum, right in the middle of a 20th century city, you`ll turn back time on your visit of this 18th century architectural wonder.
John Watling Distillerie provides visitors with free guided tours presenting the history and heritage of the Bahamas. Come find out how rum is traditionally made!
Fort Charlotte. If you have time to visit just one fort, visit this one. Built in 1788, it is the largest and it has the most beautiful view over the island and the harbour.
The Bahamas National Art Gallery. Located in a 19th century mansion recently restored, this museum houses the national collection of Bahamian pieces of art.

The hotel experience


The charm of  the tropics

At Tiamo resorts, preserving the idyllic environment is a priority. The villas are built on stilts in a typical Bahamian style in order to ease the circulation of the air. Local and natural materials have been preferred, pine and straw roofs ensuring that the rooms are kept perfectly fresh. The interior is minimalist and elegant with light-colored hardwood floors and shades of blue and white that mix perfectly with the landscape`s natural tones.
Tiamo is a real cocoon under the tropics where everything makes you want to relax. The private terrace in each villa is the perfect place to just lie back, read and contemplate the ocean.

Honeymooners will more likely enjoy the Exclusive Pool Villa which was built away from the others and has its own direct access to a private beach.

To get the full experience of this tropical ambiance, the Island Breeze Villa is built in the Bahamas`s most typical fashion: open walls, no windows, and no AC. Enjoy the fresh air of the Bahamas at its best.

Families (children 12 and above) will rather opt for the Bird`s Nest Villa. It is a large house with 3 en-suite rooms and a beautiful sitting room overlooking the Caribbean Sea. It is the perfect place to sit together after a day spent fishing, waterskiing or just doing nothing.





The Tempting Experience:

Going fly fishing


Fly fishing amateur? Tiamo resorts offers activities of bonefish fishing, for beginners and experienced "fishermen". The bonefish is one of the fastest, most combative fish known to man. Catching one is quite the challenge! At Tiamo, bonefish are caught for sport only. Any bonefish you may catch is released in order to preserve the diversity of this rare environment. Other edible fish can be caught and then cooked by the chef who will serve it to you later at the restaurant.
