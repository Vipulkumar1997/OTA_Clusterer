The hotel experience


Idyllic, luxurious, stylish, unique...the Majlis offers the very best of Lamu!

Majlis is an Arabic term that signifies the part of a house that`s used to host and entertain friends. It`s around the concept of welcoming and luxury comfort that the decor of The Majlis boutique hotel has been built. The different styles of decoration, both local and contemporary, magically coexist to create an exclusive world. The white dominates but is sprinkled with warm colors of local wood, such as mule. The touch of color is noticeable in the hotel through chairs, cushions and various works of art scattered throughout the hotel. The atmosphere is serene luxury.

Each of the 25 rooms is unique and customized: traditional high ceilings with exposed beams, armchairs embroidered with multicolored pearls, wood carvings, contemporary paintings and sculptures. The suites, Superior, Deluxe, Junior and Royal are located in 3 villas, each having a veranda that opens onto the beach and a terrace with an astonishing view over the Ras Kitau bay. The natural resources of the islands were used for the construction so that the villas naturally blend in the surrounding landscape.

Doors, beds, lamps and furniture are hand-carved by local artisans and recall the Swahili culture. The Majlis highlight all the local arts as well as contemporary artists. Armando Tanzini has left his mark with a superb golden elephant head majestically adorning the living room and paintings by Julian Schnabel and Yago decorate the walls.





The Tempting Experience:

Enjoy the sea!


In this exceptional Lamu Archipelago, the sea remains the best way to relax and explore the surroundings. The Majlis organizes excursions on their own dhow Takwa, an authentic traditional sailing boat. You can also dive and snorkel to discover the exotic marine life. Most athletes will choose water skiing, kayaking, windsurfing or kite-surfing. Calm and clear sea, long sandy beaches, mangroves, it is a paradise for sea lovers and it is also the opportunity to meet with charming wildlife: dolphins, sea turtles and even whales during their season.

The Services


Art & Culture
Artists in Residence (AIR) is a space dedicated to creativity and culture since 2002. It acts as a hub for international artists to live, to meet, to work and to discover India. AIR is much more than a link between the East and West though. It encourages artists to experiment with different media. The residence is open to any idea, art, and nationality. AIR encourages the use of local resources and the work with local craftsmen. Projects are open to artists who want to create and participate to the development of this unique open space, for 1 to 3 months.
Bar
The terrace lounge bar is situated on the first floor of the restaurant and is the ideal place to sip a cocktail while watching the sunset. Another bar is located near the pool.
Ecotourism
Preserving the environment of the island of Manda is an eco-friendly gesture respected by the team of The Majlis. Solar energy is used, rainwater is collected and local materials and products are used. The hotel is also certified by NEMA (National Authority for Environmental Management in Kenya).
Kids
At the Majlis everything is provided for the children`s entertainment. Meals and accommodation are superb, activities are organized on a beach club under the watchful eye of professional instructors and the swimming pools are of course monitored.
Restaurant
The Majlis restaurant, impressive with its 14-meter high ceiling, utilizes local architecture in local Kenya wood, a makuti roof (palm thatched leaves) and a panoramic view over the bay of Ras Kitau. It serves excellent cuisine, a mixture of domestic and international food products. You will enjoy freshly caught fish dishes, Italian food and also Japanese sushi made by a Japanese chef.
Spa & Wellness
