The Destination

Les Baux de Provence and the region

Les Baux-de-Provence is a typical village of the Provence-Alpe-Côte d’Azur region. Its location, at 245m altitude at the summit of a rocky plateau, offers exceptional views on the valley and the Alpilles region.

Deemed as one the the Most Beautiful Villages of France, Les Baux-de-Provence is a preserved site where one can roam without the disturbance of cars. You will find here all the charm so particular to the provençal villages: small squares, shaded terraces, narrow streets lined with boutiques. You can also explore the castle and the citadel, both dating back to the 10th century.

Saint-Rémy-de-Provence is 8 kilometers away. The small village, renowned thanks to paintings of Vincent van Gogh, is appreciated nowadays for its enchanted setting and heritage.

Arles, 16 kilometers from Baux-de-Provence, contains remarkable monuments from Antiquity, like its ancient theater, its arenas, or its Roman circus. Due to its significant heritage, Arles is classified as a city of art and history and its monuments have been registered on the UNESCO world heritage list since 1981. The city is animated all year long with traditional parties and events like the election of the queen of Arles, the Easter Feria, and also numerous festivals.

The hotel experience


A family country-house nested in the heart of Alpilles

The story of Benvengudo starts in 1967 when Maryse and her husband, Daniel Beaupied, Michelin-star Chef de Cuisine at the Riboto de Taven, built an authentic family hotel in Les Baux-de-Provence. When their daughter, Carole, and her husband Viktor, took over, they decided to perpetuate the heritage by bringing their personal touch, upgrading the hotel to modern and luxury standards, whilst preserving the provençal traditions and especially the family soul of the establishment.

The four star hotel, imagined akin a large house, is composed of several buildings and built in the white stones of Les Baux. The Benvengudo is authentic and travellers feel at home in the 19 rooms, 6 Côté Jardin suites, 2 Petite Maison suites or in the Grande Maison suite.
Room are all uniquely decorated with delicate hues and soft shades of beige. Colourful paintings of Yves Boussin, a local artist and friend of the family, adorn the walls. Villa Alys lamps and the contemporary furniture, signed Grange and Flamant, contrast with the antique Provencal furniture, sourced at local antique dealers. Grohe faucets, Pierre Frey and Casal curtains and fabrics, Garnier Thibault linen, refined oak wood floors… Only the highest quality materials were sourced with particular care to the quality of the finishings and small details.

At the restaurant Chef Thomas Voisin, who worked at prestigious establishments such as Hotel Les Bories in Gordes and the restaurant L’Ekrin in Méribel, proposes a modern provencal cuisine. Inspired by the savours and fragrances of the region, the Chef recommends the zucchini flowers soufflé with basil, zucchini marmalade, emulsion of locally produced olive oil (signature dish), or red mullet of the Mediterranean, seared in olive oil, fine basil ratatouille, tender saffron potatoes and bouillabaisse soup… To finish, why not try “La Découverte” : a pineapple compote in aged rum, with a light passion fruit cream, pineapple sorbet and a soft biscuit in with olive oil of the domain.

Appreciate the idyllic surroundings of the Mediterranean garden with its hidden nooks to evade and indulge, the refreshing pool, the bar to take an evening drink before enjoying the restaurant… The hotel also has a pétanque court, as in a novel of Marcel Pagnol.






The Tempting Experience:

An endless summer in Provence


A stay at the Benvengudo is a microcosm of Provence. A field of lavender under the midday sun, the shade of the olive trees, the melody of cicadas during an afternoon snooze, sheets of white linen delicately drying in the breeze, sounds of laughter from those playing pétanque, aromas of dishes simmered in rosemary and thyme..., It is the carefree time of long sunny days. The time of vacation in the South. A painting by Paul Cézanne.
