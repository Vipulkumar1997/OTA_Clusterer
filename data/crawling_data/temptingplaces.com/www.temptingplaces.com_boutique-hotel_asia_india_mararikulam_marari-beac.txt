A boutique hotel in an authentic tropical paradise

The Marari Beach Hotel, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, consists of 62 villas nestled in the middle of a vast coconut grove near Mararikulam Beach. This area of the Malabar coast, along the Arabian Sea, is famous for its endless beaches, sparkling water and the sweetness of the locals. The villas are built in harmony with nature, imitating the style of the local fishermen huts with roofs made of palm leaves and wood. Ideally located 50 km from Kochi and 15 minutes drive from the backwaters of Alleppey, this boutique hotel is a very nice stop for a few relaxing days on the beach but also to explore India in its complete authenticity.

The Destination

The Kerala beaches

The Kerala beaches are the winners of the National Geographic Traveler ranked as 1 of the "10 paradises of the world" ...You should travel there quickly before the whole world invades this beautiful place!

Mararikulam
Mararikulam Beach, more commonly called Marari, is deserted except in the early morning and evening when the fishermen come and go with their nets. It`s a postcard beach with white sand, palm trees and authentic village. Perfect for lovers of relaxation.

Kovalam
Located 16 kms in the south of Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), Kovalam has been a popular seaside resort since the 30s. Formerly a popular beach for hippies, it has become a Western tourists Mecca for Ayurveda. A beach for those who enjoy a lively atmosphere.

Cherai Beach
With its 15 kilometers of white sandy beach, Cherai Beach, 30 km from Cochin, is named "The Princess of the Oman Sea". This is the place to swim with dolphins or enjoy the cuisine of the sea.

Varkala
Located on the north of Thiruvananthapuram, Varkala Beach is still a calm and relaxing beach. She is known for its cliffs falling into the sea and lined with small shops. It is a beach "overlooking" the most beautiful sunset of Kerala!

The hotel experience


A Kerala hotel in harmony with nature

At the Marari Beach you will be welcomed by the varelpu, the traditional Kerala welcome with coconut milk as an offerings and the aarti (copper lamp) bewitching scents. Follow the paved road to get to your house through a maze of lotus ponds and coconut trees rustling in the breeze, the beach is a few steps away ...
All the bungalows were built following the model of the Mararikulam fishermen homes, combining comfort and authenticity. To the traditional palm-roof was added a cement foundation to maintain the indoor temperature cool and keep insects out. The decoration is simple but it has all the essentials to spend a comfortable stay in an environmental friendly manner. The bathroom is "open air", typical of the Kerala architecture while enjoying modern facilities. Another local touch is the terrace and the tap in front of each house to clean your feet before entering, those are the habits of the local fishermen. Live barefoot at Marari Beach!

For even more privacy we recommend you to stay in a Deluxe Pool Villa, the 20 and 17 being the closest to the sea. Surrounded by a wall these bungalows have a private outdoor pool and 2 terraces to meditate at sunset.

Protecting the environment is the leitmotif of the Marari Beach. The philosophy is to use a maximum of local products, using solar energy, training staff in order to benefit the community, promoting the cuisine of the region, etc.. Most vegetables and fruit served in the restaurant are from the organic garden. No chemicals are used and the local plants and oils are used against insect pests. Gardeners use compost to fertilize the land. If you have a green thumb you can participate in the harvest and even plant trees!





The Tempting Experience:

Ancestral journey in the heart of a fishing village


The Marari Beach respects the local lifestyle, rather than a white sandy beach and an exotic spot, the hotel fits itself easily in the Maraikulam community. You can watch the ancestral carousel fisheries at the end of a day on the beach. The noise, colors and the movement have remained the same for the past 100 years... all in harmony.

The Services


Bar
The beach bar offers fresh seafood every night, caught during the day and cooked on the barbecue. You can be served a `Panchamrutam` which is a local drink made from honey, coconut milk and spices.
Private beach
Laze on the beach or near the pool, doing nothing is the philosophy of the house!
Reading & Movies
At the clubhouse, a colonial building built 200 years ago, you can watch the only TV in the hotel or read a wide selection of international press and books.
Restaurant
The Malabar Coast is full of various fish and seafood. Local gastronomy is thus based on seafood: crabs, shrimp, lobster, shark, mackerel, octopus, and more are on the menu of the Chakara restaurant. The specialty of the region is the fish curry, a mix of seafood and spices, creamy and slightly tart. The secret lies in the cooking method: a clay pot simmering on a wood fire. Traditional Kerala music often invites itself under the veranda of the restaurant.
Spa & Wellness
To relax completely trust the professionals of the ayurveda center. The doctor, heir to a long line of Ayurveda practitioner, has 34 years of experience. The center offers a wide range of Ayurvedic therapies, their specialty being the lower back. All products are manufactured locally and some treatment rooms have an open wall in order to enjoy all the natural elements such as the breeze and birdsong. Yoga classes and pranayama are organized on the beach in the shade of coconut trees to restore your inner peace.
