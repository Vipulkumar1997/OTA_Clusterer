The Destination

Discover the charming island of Koh Samui

At the heart of this tropical paradise, you will without a doubt appreciate its lush vegetation, waterfalls, and Buddhist temples.  By trekking, motorbiking or driving, you will encounter the smiling and friendly inhabitants of this island!

Take advantage of the 5 islands in front of The Sunset Beach Resort & Spa Taling Ngam to spend the day on pristine beaches, go snorkeling, or discovering the bird`s nests.

Go to the site of Hin Ta & Hin Yai to admire the strange rock formations. For discovering animal life, we recommend the Butterfly Garden as well as crocodile and snake farms.

Don`t forget to take a walk in the village of Huathanon to visit an ancient teak house built there over 150 years ago.

You should not leave the island without seeing its temples; the most famous one is the Wat Phra Yai. But you can also see Wat Khunaram where you will discover the mummified monk and Wat Samret where there are innumerable small statues in the chapel.

And of course we cannot forget to mention that Samui is a very popular place to go diving.  It is the best place to discover the fabulous underwater world!

The hotel experience


A relaxed stay with great sea views

The Sunset Beach Resort & Spa Taling Ngam is an authentic hotel whose philosophy is simple: no constraints for guests. The staff is at your service to make your visit customized to your desires.

The design of The Sunset Beach Resort & Spa Taling Ngam is a mixture of ancient Chiang Mai arts and more contemporary elements. The rooms are luxuriously equipped for your comfort. The concept of an in-room bathroom with Jacuzzi tub in the Sunset Jaccuzi rooms works very well.

There are 3 types of rooms to choose from:

The Sunset Jacuzzi Room has a jacuzzi in the room and a magnificent sea view. During summer you will be able to see the sunset directly opposite your room.
The Garden Villas have one room, a small swimming pool, an outdoor bathroom, and even a jacuzzi!
The Beach Front Pool Villas have their own swimming pool, 2 bedrooms, and a bathroom with direct access to the beach.





The Tempting Experience:

The most beautiful sunsets of Koh Samui


The Sunset Beach Resort & Spa Taling Ngam is located on the former estate of a Buddhist monk, Luang Por Ruam, who chose the setting for its pristine landscape and dazzling sunsets, the most beautiful of the island, and very suitable for meditation.
He thereafter stayed in Burma, where he lived as a hermit and died alone. His body was found mummified (which is very unconventional with the humid climate) and his body is still exposed at the local temple.

This story testifies of the spirituality of the The Sunset Beach Resort & Spa Taling Ngam which makes the place perfect for meditating while watching the sunset!
