A hotel on the nicest Mauritius beach

The beach at Trou aux Biches is certainly one of the most beautiful in Mauritius. The Sakoa boutique-hotel, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is lucky to benefit from the natural beauties of the northern part of the island, 20 minute-drive from Port St Louis. The 16 spacious rooms are nested in delightful bungalows, with sea view or garden view, offering cosiness and refinement. Sakoa is a hotel filled with charm that provides all the ingredients for successful vacations: a warm-hearted staff at your service, catering with Mauritian hints, a sea-view spa, water sports… All of this on a sparkling white sand beach to enjoy a romantic or a family seaside getaway.

The hotel experience


Mauritius natural charms

The Sakoa hotel promises some delightful relaxing moments: music of the waves, the soft air whispering by the bay windows, the cocktail served on the beach, the evening candlelit atmosphere… The warm decoration is the one of a private house with furniture hunt all around the  world such as the sublime  front door from India.

Each room is different by its unique decoration. Elegant and spacious, with a terrace or a balcony, they are distributed in seven bungalows. Six rooms have a sea view, and the eight others offer a view on the wonderful tropical garden.
The families will appreciate the Suites that can welcome two adults and two children. Some of the family rooms are also adjacent.
A particular care is brought to the honeymooners with dedicated romantic rooms.

The hotel staff is involved every day for the island’s respect with water recycling and desalination's actions for instance. No endangered specie is served in the restaurant’s menu.






The Tempting Experience:

The art of wellness by colours


The “Wellness Oasis” spa, located in front of the sea, is an invitation to let go. The treatments are practiced according to the Mauritian Seven Colours philosophy in order to harmonize the body’s energies by the ancestral power of touch and taste. Products based on 100% natural essential oil with sweet exotic fragrance let you totally relax… to the sound of the Indian Ocean.
