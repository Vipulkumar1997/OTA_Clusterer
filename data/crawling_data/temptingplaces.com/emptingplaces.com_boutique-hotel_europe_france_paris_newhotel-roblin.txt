The Destination

La Madeleine, Paris

The 8th arrondissement, in which the hotel is located, is a fantasy-filled neighborhood in central Paris. Within a five minute walk, you can find everything a traveler would ever need: culture, food, and shopping. It is also a two minute walk from the Madeleine metro stop which gives you easy access to the entire city. Amongst our favorite places in the area is the Pinacothèque art gallery which you cannot miss. For foodies, there is Fauchon, a treat for gourmands with at least three locations close to the hotel. For a more US flavor found on this side of the Seine, you can find a burger or some cheesecake at Bread & Roses located at 25 rue Boissy d’Anglas.

The hotel experience


A family affair

The design of the Newhotel Roblin hotel is a product of two families joining forces: the Antoun family, owners of the NewHotel group, and the Flamant family, famed luxury designers. Mr. Antoun and his daughters, Caroline and Camille, had the desire for the hotel to have an intimate atmosphere, and they were seduced by the authentic values of the Flamant label. An elegant facade, vintage wood and brass elevator, moldings, Empire fireplaces… You are definitely in Paris, surely not in a museum but like in a homey Hotel particulier. Past the reception desk you will find the lounge which, like in a house, is the cosiest and warmest place. Relax in an armchair next to the fire, with a warm drink and a magazine.The room is filled with a variety of books, sculptures, colorful butterflies, a unique "cabinet de curiosités" atmosphere in harmony with contemporary lights that brighten up the alcoves and provide a one of a kind feel to the space.The guestrooms have different accents according to 4 Parisian neighborghoods. The style is modern and cosy with a combination of exposed beams and brass lamps, fine materials like leather and wood, chic tartans and flower or toile de jouy wallpapers.The style throughout the hotel is intimate yet inviting. Fans of timeless Paris will be enchanted by the Junior Suites or the Superior Suites, each with Empire fireplaces. Whereas travelers with an artistic soul will love the two suites that have a loft-like feel and may even dream of becoming artists themselves!





The Tempting Experience:

A stroll through Paris


4 neighborhoods emblematic of Paris are expressed through the 6 floors of the hotel. Exposed beams and graphic black & whitedécor give an artistic touch to the top-floor Canal St Martin suites. Fine materials like leather and tartans wool fabrics lend a literary atmosphere to the rooms inspired by St. Germain. “Velvet Flower” wallpapers and leather armchairs represent the Marais with a vintage allure. Finally the cristal light, the “toile de jouy” wallpapers and velvet upholstered headbords tell all about the charms of the XVIth arrondissement. The rooms are named Place des Vosges, Avenue Foch or Rue Montmartre… Neighbourhoods maps cover the corridors’ walls. This is such a pleasant stroll in Paris without leaving the hotel!
