The Destination

The Piton valley

The Piton valley on the southwest side of Saint Lucia, one of the Windward Islands, is recognized by UNESCO as a world-heritage site of unequivocal beauty. With the backdrop of the majestic peaks, it is certainly the most tranquil location on the island. The isolated beach and luscious vegetation make an ideal destination for relaxation, but also for activities such as scuba diving, snorkelling, kayaking, hiking and bathing under the waterfalls… Probably the closest you can get to actual paradise.

The hotel experience


The architecture of an ancient sugar plantation

Sugar Beach’s domain extends onto an immense tropical forest that once held a sugar plantation. The colonial style adds charm to the reception and three restaurants, with a contemporary twist added through paintings and sculptures from the owners’ private collections.
The accommodations are divided between elegant villas, luxurious private cottages and immaculate bungalows lining the beach. White is “the” colour of Sugar Beach. A symbol of purity and charm, you will find in every space, diffused by the cheerful creole paintings and the exotic flowers.

The rooms offer high wood-panelled ceilings and furniture made of pale local wood. All rooms boast a plunge pool and butler service.
For a magical view, go for a Superior Luxury Sugar Mill room. Situated on the first floor, they have a rooftop terrace in addition to a plunge pool and their own private walled garden.

Looking for more intimacy still? The Luxury Villas are the ideal choice. Situated on the upper levels and further away from the more public areas, they have a stunning view of the gardens or the sea.

The Superior Luxury Villa category, with their 79 sq m interiors and 23 sq m exteriors, is a perfect match for families.






The Tempting Experience:

The Cane bar and its collection of the best rums in the world


The Cane Bar has risen to the considerable challenge of collecting the best rums in the world to share with the hotel guests. Settle comfortably in one of the cosy armchairs and get set for an amazing tasting led by a professional “rummelier”. You will be an expert on Old Havanas, Lava Flows and other rum-based cocktails prepared specially for you.
