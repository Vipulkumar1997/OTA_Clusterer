The Destination

Discover the delights of Samui

At the heart of this tropical paradise, you will without a doubt appreciate its lush vegetation, waterfalls, and Buddhist temples. By trekking, motorbiking or driving, you will encounter the smiling and friendly inhabitants of this island!

Take advantage of the five islandslocated nearby Ban Sabai and spend the day on pristine beaches, go snorkeling, or discover bird`s nests.

Go to the site of Hin Ta & Hin Yai to admire the strange rock formations. For discovering animal life, we recommend the Butterfly Garden as well as crocodile and snake farms.

Don`t forget to take a walk in the village of Huathanon to visit an ancient teak house built over 150 years ago.

You should not leave the island without seeing the temples; the most famous one is the Wat Phra Yai. But you can also see Wat Khunaram where you will discover the mummified monk and Wat Samret where there are innumerable small statues in the chapel.

And of course we cannot forget to mention that Samui is a very popular place to go diving. It is the best place to discover the fabulous underwater world!

The hotel experience


A genuine physical and spiritual retreat

Situated on one of the most beautiful islands in the world, the Kamalaya was built around an ancient cave temple where hermit monks lived and meditated.

The Kamalaya is a place of meditation and spiritual retreat to help you find your vital energy through 3 main ways: a unique location in harmony with nature, meeting other people around you (therapists, other clients...), and holistic well-being to reconnect the body, mind, and heart. This is why doctors and a team of specialists will take care of you by building a customized program. Whether your objective is to lose weight, to stop smoking, or simply to recharge your batteries, a personalized program will be offered.

The framework of Kamalaya is idyllic, you will be delighted by the cottages with thatched roofs scattered around the property. The night lighting gives a magical atmosphere with fireflies gently passing from tree to tree. The villas and rooms on Kamalaya are enchanting and elegant. Works of Asian art blend harmoniously with modern elements to create an elegant and comfortable environment. You can even choose from 10 different types of accomodations.





The Tempting Experience:

Letting go and rejuvenating yourself


The objective of Kamalaya is to ensure that all guests feel well and rediscover themselves. Nature, silence, and peace are the catalysts of the process. John and Karina, the hotel owners, met in the Himalayas and both have an extraordinary personal view that is shown through the Kamalaya. John shared the retreat of Buddhist monks for 16 years and Karina studied Asian traditions for 22 years and is a doctor of Chinese medicine. This couple makes Kamalaya glow and infuses it with energy.

Learning how to find yourself, knowing how to change, feeling the effects of aromatherapy, enjoying the simplicity of the essential, and releasing your emotions will create a unique and unforgettable stay at Kamalaya.
