A boutique hotel located on wine Route 62

The Excelsior Manor Guesthouse, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a boutique hotel located alongside the famous wine "Route 62". A typical Victorian mansion, it is located in the middle of the Excelsior vineyards, 2 hours from Cape Town.

The farm of origin has been restored to revive its glorious past early twentieth century when it prospered with the vineyards, the horse-breeding, and the culture of ostrich feathers required for the decoration of the haute couture hats. The spirit of elegance transpires in the 9 luxury suites, decorated with antique furniture and combining Victorian and the Cape`s Art Nouveau style. The Excelsior Manor Guesthouse is perfect to intimately and privately enjoy a beautiful natural setting combined with the charm of an old mansion and the delights of wine tasting.

The hotel experience


A Victorian mansion with views of the vineyards and mountains

The Excelsior Manor Guesthouse offers magnificent views over the surrounding vineyards and the Langeberg Mountains. The garden with its centenary trees and the old roses labyrinth is a haven of peace. Near the southern facade of the mansion, you can enjoy the beautiful blue swimming pool with panoramic views over the vineyards and mountains.

The rooms are luxuriously appointed with commodes, armchairs and antique bed. The wooden floors are covered with Persian carpets to make the atmosphere even cozier. The beds are comfortable with embroidered cotton sheets and pillows. All rooms overlook the garden and vineyards.







The Tempting Experience:

Taste and bottle your own wine!


The manor is ideal for tasting the wines of the property. Small golf carts are available to explore the vineyards, go on a picnic, or simply to go admire the sunset. You can also visit the wine-caves and above all, bottle your own wine which you can label with your personal name!
