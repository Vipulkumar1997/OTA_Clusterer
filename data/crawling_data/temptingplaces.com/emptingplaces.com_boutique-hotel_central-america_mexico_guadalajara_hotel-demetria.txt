The Destination

Guadalajara

Guadalajara is Mexico`s second largest city. It`s the state capital of Jalisco and is one of the cultural, social and economic centers of the country. It`s nicknamed "La Perla del Occidente" or Silicon Valley for its Mexican business and IT industries and "La ciudad de las Rosas" for its colonial architectural beauty. The past and present blend in Guadalajara where trendy bars are as popular as churches. Monumento a los Ninos Heroes Hospicio Cabanas, and the University of Guadalajara are among the many monuments to visit.

The Lafayette area, where one will find the Demetria Hotel is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city and has tree-lined streets and houses of the nineteenth century. It`s part of a proposed renewal of the city and has become, through the implementation of many cafes, restaurants, galleries and designer boutiques, the neighborhood in which to be seen.

The hotel experience


An Ultramodern Concept

Demetria Hotel is the newest and most innovative concept hotel of Guadalajara. Its ambition is to be the spearhead of the new hip neighborhood of the city. Fully interacting with the local art scene, it proposes a modern vision of  accommodation in a tower of glass and concrete. The teak terrace and swimming pool on the 5th floor offer a breathtaking view over the city.

The 39 rooms of the boutique hotel have a custom layout. The different shades of gray from floor to ceiling mix with luxurious wood furniture and ethnic fabrics bed linen. The huge windows brighten the decor. Yet, it maintains its minimalist, Zen-like ambiance.

The technology services available are sophisticated without ignoring comfort: free access to WiFi, iPod docking station, shower / tub with "rain", remote control to adjust the room temperature and air conditioning. A turndown service is offered in the evening, as in the best luxury hotels.





The Tempting Experience:

Adjacent to the hotel, in a house designed by Mexican architect Luis Barragan, is another gallery where guests can purchase the works of artists from Jalisco. Demetria Hotel has chosen to display a selection of Mexican folk art, textiles, terracotta, jewelry, glassware ... all styles are sure to please connoisseurs.
