The 32 villas are all luxurious and exclusive and the hotel design reflects a graceful fusion of Classic French and Asian architecture. High-end service, comfort and total luxury, and the by gone charm of this heritage landmark makes the Mansion a privileged address for travellers seeking comfort and aesthetics.

The Destination

Experience Shanghai differently

The Shanghai art museum is one of the most innovative state-owned museums of China. It welcomes the Shanghai biennial and its permanent collection gives a very interesting perspective on 20th century Chinese art.

The Moca Shanghai, opened in 2005, is installed in the ancient glasshouse of the People Square park renowned for its fantastic site and notably the centrally located artificial lake that is flowered with water lilies. The Moca Shanghai hosts art exhibits of contemporary Chinese and European artists.

M50 and Suzou creek are the spearheads of the city`s cultural engagements: the community host artist studios that also have the function of small art galleries.

The Hongkou neighbourhood, the ancient war-time Jewish ghetto, is atypical of Shanghai.

The French concession and the Bund are relatively well protected from rogue land promoters and are the perfect places for a nice stroll, cultural exposure, and interesting shopping. The people`s park (People Square) is also the starting point of the Bund and close to the Nanjing Donglu shopping area.

The hotel experience


An elegant and refined Golden age decoration

The boutique villa was originally built as the club house of Du Yue-Sheng, China`s most powerful syndicate boss. A notorious godfather figure, he is known to have become rich through the opium industry which he later combated when he entered politics.

The walls of the Mansion Boutique Hotel whisper the charm and refinement of Classic French decoration with Asian influences: imposing chandeliers, flowered vases, ancient mirrors, velvet and wooden couches and armchairs in pure thirties style, Art Nouveau lamps, ancient photographs on the walls, carpets on the ground. The ambience transports guests back to the golden 1930`s.

The rooms are very spacious (minimum 32m²) and are all uniquely designed and laid out. They include oriental king-size beds, armchairs with ottoman fabric, silk cushions, and ancient tiles. The bathrooms are hyper luxurious with marble floors and countertops, separate Jacuzzi baths, high pressure full body showers, Japanese-style combination toilet/bidets. The decoration is sober and an example of pure elegance. You will also be able to take advantage of Hermès products in the beautiful bathroom. The rooms also have a fully equipped business desk with 3 in 1 printer/fax/scanner and wireless high-speed Internet access.





The Tempting Experience:

A taste of Shanghai's golden 1930's


Stay in a magnificent heritage landmark that was once owned by one of Shanghai`s most notorious opium dealers ... velvet atmosphere, the ideal setting to discover the « Paris of the Orient ».
