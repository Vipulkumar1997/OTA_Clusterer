3 best hotel breakfasts

The best of hotel breakfast in Paris, Brazil and Bali












Breakfast is considered to be the most important meal of the day even when you're travelling. No more craving, we selected 3 boutique hotels with breakfast to die for...

The Chess Hotel – Paris, France

Where to have a sublime buffet breakfast in Paris? At The Chess, a few minutes’ walk from the famous shopping street of Les Grands Magasins in Paris. The buffet is generous with local delicacies, of course fresh bread, danish and pastries and the teas by Mariage Frères.
It is a pitty but if you don’t have time for the fabulous full hotel’s breakfast, you would enjoy the express breakfast with hot beverage, fruit juice, bread and danish pastries with butter and jam at only 10 euros. Not oly breakfast but also tea time matters at The Chess Hotel. How about celebrating the Parisian way? Every afternoon, the lobby serves the now famous Choux by Popelini, a profiterole-like treat filled with crème patissière. There are five divine flavours to discover.

Pousada Picinguaba – Paraty, Brazil

Where to have a breakfast with a sublime view? At the Pousada Picinguaba which overlooks a small fishing village near Paraty. Fresh ground coffee and local fruits are served, luxury and simplicity.

Indiana Kenanga Villas – Bali, Indonesia

Where to have the perfect French breakfast in a Balinese exotic island? At Indiana Kenanga, a little paradise on the small island of Nusa Lembongan, where French chef Clément Fouqueré will serve you generous plates, local products for a very creative breakfast.
