A hidden luxury boutique hotel

The Domaine de Verchant, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a rather unique boutique hotel, a luxurious haven among the vineyards, just a few miles from downtown Montpellier. Hidden amid a grove, at the end of a driveway lined with oak trees, this secret place will help you forget all about the outside world. The decor blends the atmospheric antique stone of the estate with contemporary furnishings.
With French chef Damien Cousseau’s delicious menu in the restaurant and a carefully designed spa combining pampering and fitness, Domaine de Verchant plays a real ode to the senses… Only welcoming a few lucky people at a time, this boutique hotel is perfect for romantic escapes or a vacation in the Languedoc Roussillon region.

The Destination

Montpellier

Deep in the Mediterranean, Montpellier is the capital of the Herault and Languedoc-Roussillon region. The city lies on a major route joining Spain and Italy, right between seaside and mountain attractions. Finding reasons to visit will not be difficult: there are over 70 estates from the sixteenth to the twentieth century to see, including the oldest medical university in the Western world still in operation, medieval streets lined with shops, beautiful beaches... Montpellier is also very rich in museums, festivals, haute cuisine and renowned wines.

The hotel experience


A design hotel and spa

Built on the ruins of a 14th century building, Domaine de Verchant found inspiration in the "Folies Montpelliéraines", elegant country houses built in the area by wealthy merchants in the 17th century. The owners, Chantal and Pierre Mestre, aimed to create an intimate, luxurious atmosphere while drawing inspiration from wine culture and the surrounding vineyards. The very talented designer Raymond Morel made their dream come true.

The reception area, brushed in shades of aluminium, is framed by a row of pink and orange armchairs by Ron Arad, all under a beautiful vaulted ceiling... Expect the very best: the charm of the extraordinary, the elegance of design and the patina of age.

Signature pieces from the finest contemporary designers (Poltrona, Jacobsen, Moroso, Casa Milano, Nanimarquina) were handpicked to decorate the 26 suites and apartments. A delicate balance to achieve: elegance had to be reached without giving the feeling of being in art gallery. Domaine de Verchant focuses on comfort, aiming to be a home away from home where dinners can be enjoyed in a beautiful lounge opening onto the outdoor pool.
The rooms, all different, excel in comfort and innovation: TVs embedded in the wall and facing the bath tub, state-of-the-art computers, heated mirrors and floors, Starck whirlpool bathtubs, showers that rain down gently from the ceiling, as well as a home automation system.

The Deluxe suites, complete with a terrace to enjoy the view and the fresh wafting scent of the vineyards, are a little paradise. Both the Danae and Neige d’Avril suites will delight lovers with their round bed and double bath with a hydro massage option. Simply divine!






The Tempting Experience:

An epicurean getaway in the heart of a vineyard


Surrounding the mansion is the Verchant vineyard, sixty thousand feet of grapevines over 42 acres, which you can see from the suites and hotel terraces. The grapes selected are of the Bordeaux variety (Syrah, Grenache, Petit Verdot) as well traditional whites like Roussanne and Vermentino. Tastings of the wines produced are available throughout the year.
Let the experts guide you through the many wines of the region. Matched with the restaurant menu, prepared by Chef Damien Cousseau, Le Domaine de Verchant Hotel promises an exceptional epicurean journey.
