More than a hacienda: a boutique hotel full of history

Hidden in the countryside, this boutique hotel is an ideal place to alternate relaxation, romantic moments, and the discovery of  Maya civilisation with its archaeological ruins, cenotes (natural underground reservoirs) and remains of the colonial pasts: convents, villages ...

Southeast Mexico is culturally and environmentally very rich: every civilisation has left its mark, be it in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, the Yucatan tropical forests, or in its natural reserves. Stopping at Hacienda Temozon is the perfect way to catch a breath in a house resurrected from the splendours of its past and renovated with taste. It provides a luxury experience equalled only by modern palaces!

The Destination

The Yucatan close to Mérida

You should of course explore the various and mythical cenotes of the Yucatan - there are plenty around and all are special!

Yaxcopoil, a neighbouring colonial hacienda, will show you the local traditions and life on a 17th century plantation.

Within close driving distance are: Mérida, heritage city founded in 1542; Oxkintoc, one of the oldest cities of Yucatan; and many Puuc style ruins like Kabahm, Sayil, Labn and Uxmal.

Nature lovers will be charmed by the reserve and biosphere of the fishermen village of Celestun.

Finally, get lost in the intricately connected caves of Calcehtok or on the convents route built after the arrival of the Franciscans in 1524.

The hotel experience


From colonial plantation to luxury boutique hotel …

Looking down at the shimmering swimming pool and beautiful surrounding gardens it is hard to imagine that Hacienda Temozon had been a plantation since 1655 and that, barely a century ago, it was still Yucatan peninsula`s most active producer of henequen fibre for rope-making!

Thankfully, the renovation has preserved the 16th century Yucatan «belle époque» colonial style and what were once key areas of the hacienda`s mini-society (the pharmacy, schoolhouse, playing room, etc) have been reinvented as boutique hotel bedrooms and suites. The names of the rooms have not changed and the transformation has taken great care to preserve the typical Mayan architecture elements such as the high ceilings, heavy wooden double-doors, tiled floors, and sprawling iron beds. The rooms also feature soft, coloured-cotton hammocks as an authentic Mayan alternative to mattress-based sleeping.

The rooms have a large ceiling ventilator and air conditioning, but the best way to freshen up is to dip in the expansive swimming pool. Or, if you have decided to stay in a suite, you may prefer to use your private plunge pool located next to your suite`s terrace and private garden!

A special mention goes to the presidential suite (the «casa del Patron» which was the master`s suite and features a lounge, an oversized room, and bathroom with a Jacuzzi made from Ticul stone. The suite terrace is equipped with beautiful teak furniture and the private swimming pool is installed in the hacienda`s old water tank!

The stylish renaissance of the hotel goes hand in hand with the promotion of local craftsmanship and traditions: the hotel has built workshops on-site where you can see furniture, textiles and other artisanal items being assembled - a flashback to the hacienda`s industrial past.





The Tempting Experience:

A mythical cenote (natural underground reservoir)


Cenotes are natural underground reservoirs formed by the dissolution of rock, which creates a void under the surface. They are numerous in the Yucatan peninsula due to the chalky and rocky soil. Often filled with very pure water, the region of Chichén Itzá has a vast system of cenotes and underground tunnels linking them together.

Hacienda Temozon is lucky enough to have its very own cenote. It is utilised for its freshness and for its secrecy, nearly mythical and legendary attributes... hence the Hacienda`s spa is fortunate to be able to offer ancestral massages in the cenote and guests can also enjoy a romantic dinner in a truly unique place!
