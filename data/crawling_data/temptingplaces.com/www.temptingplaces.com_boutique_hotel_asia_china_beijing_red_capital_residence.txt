A boutique hotel in a unique traditional pekinese house

Located in a courtyard house in the historic district of Dongsi, the Red Capital Residence, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, exudes the exceptional past of Peking (Beijing). The area was witness to the historical and political intrigues of the Qing Dynasty.

After 1949, siheyuan styled courtyard houses became the private residences of the privileged, Beijing's powerful elite. The Red Capital Residence has managed to preserve the elegance and exclusivity of this period. The decoration of the boutique hotel has Beijing-Chinese influences but preserves the authentic original style of the building.


One of the 4 suites of the Red Capital Residence will undoubtedly suit you. If you're travelling with your loved one then check-out the concubines' suites. And if you're in Beijing for business or just for visiting you'll find a very personal and unique place to enjoy your stay.

The hotel experience


A tribute to Mao and refined Chinese antiques

The 5 rooms overlooking the inner courtyard have nothing to envy to their capitalist sisters! They are at the cutting edge of modernity but each is loaded with history. Imperial doors open up on walls covered with satin fabrics, ceramics, and boudoirs beds from the Qianlog and Tongzhi periods.

Chinese screens hide the tiled bathroom with a delicate wall of light. The bathrooms are modern with nice showers and western toilets.

Each suite has a theme that refers back to a historical period.

Enter Mao`s presidential suite and travel back in time! It is said that Mao took major decisions in his bedroom ... The suite has black and white pictures of his family, his favorite books, Mao's original Art Deco desk-lamp, and an incredible gallery of Mao memorabilia (portraits, paintings, ceramics).

Right and left to Mao's suite are the concubines` suites with opium beds draped with silk and decorated with Qing Dynasty antiques.

The other, Author, is dedicated to the famous writers inspired about China.





The Tempting Experience:

Beijing like in the 50's


The Red Capital Residence pays tribute to the revolutionary chinese period of the 1950's through decorative elements such as small red books, posters, and Maoists propaganda items. Most of the furniture comes from the Chinese Central Office of the 50's.... Passing the doors of the courtyard will give you the impression of entering the home of one of the Maoists leaders. Chinese antique furniture, silk fabrics, and the art of small details in every corner of the house complete the decoration to make it all but kitsch. The atmosphere is intimate, authentic, and very exclusive.
