The hotel experience


A boutique spa resort that balances between tradition and luxury

Architecturally inspired by the "forbidden city" of Hue, the resort emanates a strong connection to Vietnamese heritage and tradition. This unique character and charm is carried through all aspects of the hotel. From the lobby to the resort grounds to the villas and even to the spas, delicate white, purple and dark wood colours create a special kind of Vietnamese serenity.
Nature, too, has a strong but peaceful presence at Fusion Maia. Intertwined with the architecture, bamboo and the tranquil greens of Vietnamese botanicals soothe your eyes and mind, just as the Fusion Maia spa will soothe your soul.

Each villa has a private pool and private garden for more intimate relaxation. Lavish king-sized beds, contemporary and stylish décor, TV in the bathroom, a coffee machine, wifi and Ipod docks are also included. To enjoy a remarkable ocean view, choose a Beach Villa, complete with an iPad and DVD player.





The Tempting Experience:

The only spa at your beck and call


At Fusion Maia Da Nang Resort, be pampered as you recharge your batteries. Maia Spais  the highlight of the resort,set in tropical gardens with swimming pool and waterfall. Relax with a steam massage in a hammam, take a yoga or breathing class and meditate freely. The resort’s spa, one of the biggest in Asia offers you a wide range of spa treatments and therapies, included in the price of your stay (2 treatments guaranteed per person and per day, and more upon availability). Laughter yoga, meditation, manicures, pedicures... all are available at no extra cost. Why resist the luxury!
