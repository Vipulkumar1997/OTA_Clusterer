A boutique hotel on an island in Brittany

La Désirade, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is a lovely 3-star hotel located right in the centre of Belle-Ile, an island in Brittany, 45 minutes away from Quiberon. The “longères” (the island’s typical two-storey houses) bring an “authentic” side to the experience. Comfort is of course a priority and you can also enjoy a heated outdoor swimming pool, a spa and local cuisine in the restaurant. The 28 rooms and 4 suites overlook a vast garden. With the seaside a few kilometres away, the hotel is a perfect stay for families. You can sometimes feel the ocean’s spray as a gentle caress on your skin… You will feel wonderfully at home here.





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary welcome champagne glass or homemade cocktail or Belle-Ile beer

The Destination

Belle-Ile-en-Mer

“I like to come on this picturesque island every year to admire nature in its wild and great beauty. There, I can gather new strengths in order for my creative spirit to find inspiration”, explained Sarah Bernhardt. Need we say more?

On top of its unmistakably wild beauty, there are 5 must-sees on Belle-Ile-en-Mer:

- The paths to walk all around the island.
- “Les aiguilles de Port-Coton”, needle-like rocks which immortalized by Monet in his paintings.
- The property of Sarah Bernhardt - she indeed bought a small fort here in 1893 and spent every summer on the island up until 1922.
- Le Palais, the capital of the island, right in the centre of Vauban`s fortress.
- The lovely harbour of Sauzon.

The hotel experience


Connecting with nature

Close to the rocks of Bangor, La Désirade is sure to win you over. The pastel colours and the harmonious mix of materials melt any leftover stress away. No matter what time of the day it is – the hotel always makes you feel on holiday.

The 28 rooms and 4 family suites are shared over 6 different houses. Panelled walls, hardwood floors, windows with blue shutters, a garden where to sit in the shade of eucalyptus and fruit trees: peace definitely prevails here.





The Tempting Experience:

A local hotel in touch with the present


“He who sees Belle-Isle doth see his isle” wrote Chateaubriand. That feeling of proximity is precisely what the owners of La Désirade, Mr and Mrs Rebour, wanted to share with the visitors setting foot on their island. The chef of the restaurant is very fond of fresh and regional products, relying on local farmers to supply the kitchen.

Both owners are involved with French charities: Téléthon, Restos du Coeur... To quote them: “In this place, we have chosen to leave superficiality behind. We wanted to focus on what really matters: your well-being and making you feel at home."
