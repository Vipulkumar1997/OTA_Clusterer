A boutique hotel with the luxury of an aristocratic colonial hacienda

The Hacienda Santa Rosa, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, located in Mérida (Yucatan), started off as a small agrarian farm and by 1910 had grown into an industrial, 364-man plantation. From this peak, the activity declined and the hacienda was recently reinvented into a stylish 19th century «belle époque» luxury boutique hotel. The 11 rooms and suites are as if designed by a local colonial baron with their mix of traditional decoration, comfort, luxury, and intimacy.

Hidden in the country-side`s lush tropical vegetation, the Hacienda Santa Rosa is the ideal place to doze-off at the poolside, in a traditional cotton-woven hammock or to enjoy intimate romantic dinners. But it is also a perfect base to discover the nearby Mayan civilisation with its ruins, its mythical cenotes (mythical underground cavities), and it`s heritage colonial convents, villages, ...

- Complimentary neck & shoulders massage for 2 persons (Length: 15 min)

The Destination

Sites in the neighbourhood of Mérida city

You should of course explore the various and mythical cenotes of the Yucatan - there are plenty around and all are special!

In close driving distance are: Mérida, heritage city founded in 1542; Oxkintoc, one of the oldest cities of Yucatan; and many Puuc style ruins like Kabahm, Sayil, Labn and Uxmal.

The nature lovers will be charmed by the reserve and biosphere of the fishermen village of Celestun.

Finally, get lost in the intricately connected caves of Calcehtok or on the convent route built after the arrival of the Franciscans in 1524.

The hotel experience


When bygone luxury meets modern comfort

When the restoration started, the hacienda Santa Rosa`s foundations were in good condition and the architects were therefore able to preserve the original charm and character of this colonial cottage.

The result is a boutique hotel with rooms that feature very large bathrooms, high ceilings, heavy wooden doors, tiled floors, and thick stone walls that have been painted in the vibrant and local Yucatan colours (yellow, orange, and blue). The rooms and suites are dispersed across the colonial plantation, true to the original plans.

In the hacienda Santa Rosa, every room has its own personality and charm and is always decorated with a fresh bouquet of flowers to pep up the atmosphere.

The villa Maya, unique in its style, is a large isolated villa with a special "Hanging Bed" that allows invites guests to experience a Maya sleep! The villa has its individual terrace and private plunge pool.





The Tempting Experience:

A botanical garden with 239 species


The botanical garden of the hacienda Santa Rosa is nestled in the hacienda`s fruit-tree plantations and displays an impressive collection of 239 different plant species spread out over 9200 m² of gardens.

The objective of the garden is to keep a living illustration and taxonomy of the various plants, Maya names, and uses. This information is conveniently summarised in the hacienda`s catalogue.

The garden is specialised in medicinal plants with a collection of 166 different types of medicinal plants organised in 4 sections (dermatology, digestion, breathing diseases, and other health issues). A special allotment is allocated to botanical research and more than 50% of the 23 Yucatan palm tree species are grown at the hacienda. Finally, the garden also produces 30 kinds of edible fruits and vegetables which can be found in your plate at the restaurant!
