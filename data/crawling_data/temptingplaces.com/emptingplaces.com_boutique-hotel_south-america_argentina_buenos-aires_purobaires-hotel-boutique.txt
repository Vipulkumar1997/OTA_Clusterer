The Destination

Palermo Soho district or the heart of Buenos Aires

Palermo Soho is a corner of the Palermo Viejo neighborhood and located around the Plaza Serrano. It is a lively area with plenty of shops, galleries, restaurants, bars, and theaters to enjoy.

The atmosphere emulates a "boho" vibe and attracts young and dynamic people of the Argentinean upper middle-class, as well as an abundance of tourists. The traditional low houses have been refurbished but maintain a chic Bohemian atmosphere.

From this district of Buenos Aires you can visit the huge "Palermo park", the" Japanese Garden" or the "Zoological garden".

Also do not miss to visit the "Museo Evita" dedicated to Evita Peron, and the "Museo de Arte Latino Americano" of Buenos Aires (Malva), one of the best museums of the city with, among others, works of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo.

The hotel experience


Chic interiors and bright stylish rooms

Comfort and style combine with the bright interiors to create a modern ambiance with overtones of white, designer furniture, and stylish decorations such as crystal chandeliers and lamps.

The eleven rooms are all different in size and color. Sunlight pours through the large windows overlooking the balcony or street-side patios. Large, luxuriously designed beds with orange, beige, and red comforting fabrics create a cozy and extravagant room atmosphere.

We particularly recommend the Baires Suite with its hydro-massage bath overlooking the private terrace.





The Tempting Experience:

The perfect combination of business and pleasure!


The Purobaires is a design boutique hotel with uniquely personalized service. It conveniently offers excellent "business" services whilst allowing guests to enjoy the luxurious and relaxing setting of the sumptuous hotel. The Purobaires features state of the art technical equipment and the staff will gladly help organize business venues including lunches, dinners, and outings ... The Purobaires provides for a perfect setting to combine work and relaxation.
