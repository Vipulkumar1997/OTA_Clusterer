A boutique hotel in perfect harmony with nature

The Dune Eco Village & Spa, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is like an Eden on earth, eclectic and colorful. At the heart of a lush 35 acre park, it features a generous organic garden, a 700m long sand beach, and everything needed to take care of the body and soul according to traditional Ayuvreda rites.

Each of the 36 bungalows and bedrooms presents a unique architecture, style and decoration for a particular experience. The result is surprising, sometimes eccentric, in a zen and green environment.

The boutique hotel is fully committed preserving the environment. As an example, recycled material from Southern Indian colonial houses, Chettinad palaces and Kerala planter`s mansions have been used for a significant part of the building. The hotel also chose not to equip all bungalows with air conditioning (fortunately, there is still a refreshing sea breeze!). Solar energy, low energy consumption light bulbs, and waste water treatment complete this ecological commitment.





Tempting Advantages

- Complimentary meditation course
- Complimentary Yoga course
- Complimentary visit of the village

The Destination

Tourism : ancient temples and futurist city

12 km South of the Dune lies Pondicherry, a French colony until 1954. Testimonies of the French presence remain such as the consulate, the Alliance Française, the Lycée Français, the Ecole Française d`Extreme Orient and some of the street names. You can also walk along the beach road. Also to visit: the Sri Aurobindo ashram with its garden, the church of Sacré Coeur de Jésus built in 1700 by the French missionaries, the charming temples and mosques, and the Pondicherry Museum.

Auroville (Dawn City) is an experimental town hosting 2000 people of 35 different nationalities, from mixed social origins and class. This utopian concept is the realization of the dream of Mirra Alfassa, a French disciple of Sri Aurobindo, known as “The Mother”. You can visit the lush gardens as well as a permanent exhibition about the project`s history and philosophy.

To the North, on the way to Chennai, the ancient Pallava port of Mahabalipuram is well worth a stop. The main attractions of this famous archeological site of South India are granite sanctuaries from the 7th century including a shore temple, the 5 rashas (stone chariots), and many sculptures.

To the west, the road leads to Gingee, famous for its ancient fort set amongst a landscape of granite (6km perimeter) built in the 13th century.

50km further, West, you reach Thiruvanamalai, famed for its very large and ancient temple and its sacred hill called Arunachala and symbolizing the element fire. At the foot of this hill, lived one of the greatest seers of India, Ramana Maharshi.

The hotel experience


An atmosphere fit for all

Spread over 35 acres of lush nature, facing the sea, the Dune Eco Village & Spa has been designed to take care of the body and the soul. Each bungalow`s spirit is reflected by its architecture, its construction materials, and its decoration. Eclectism is the master word! For example:

Studio Penthouse: a small house perched on the 1st floor of a building on stilts, surrounded by vast greenery and a terrace. It boasts 360° panoramic views over the sea and the whole property. It also features a jacuzzi for relaxing moments.

Bamboo House: It has woven bamboo mats that serve as wall partitions, bamboo furniture, and is built with a palm-tree leaf and casuarina wooden roof. The bamboo house is very charming and authentic.

Bay Watch House: It is a tower house perched on a sand dune with a first floor room, ideal for honeymooners. You will enjoy fantastic, unobstructed views from the canopy. Flaming red colors are used in the bathroom and for all wooden ceilings and walls. A magic place for a romantic stay.

Beach House: A beautiful oceanview house with an open garden bathroom in the middle of the coconut plantation. An ideal hide-away to enjoy moments of happiness!

Flex House: is enclosed by illuminated printed material with a surrealist picture collage. The house has a unique and personalized atmosphere with an ocean view, an outdoor lounge, and a private garden.

Granite House: has an outdoor path edged with granite columns as well as carved pillars with royal blue bases inside. It is reminiscent of the vast open granite structures built by the local kings for the pilgrims to sleep and rest on their way to the temple festivals. This very exclusive house has a mystical atmosphere and a private garden with a pond.

Pop house: a traditional indigenous house on stilts with thatch roofing. The atmosphere is a mix of an Indian Bollywood movie and pop culture: furniture covered with Legos, huge dices to sit on, walls with variously sized holes in them… A unique and curious universe for a very colorful stay.

Nawabi House: a traditional indigenous house on stilts covered by thatch roofing. It has a particularity: the traditional semi-closed wooden bed is covered with pictures. Bollywood atmosphere guaranteed!

Tower House: voted Best Honeymoon Suite in India by the magazine « India Today ». It is a very scenic duplex house, 50 feet high, overlooking the Bay of Bengal and the entire region. The house has a jacuzzi in the bedroom, a private balcony, Venetian blinds, and is painted with shimmering colors. The atmosphere is designed for a wonderful lovers stay.





The Tempting Experience:

A trip to the inner core of the body, mind and soul


You are at the heart of the practice of natural and traditional medicine of India: Ayurveda. After a treatment you will emerge refreshed and released from all tensions; a pure soul of Paradise!
