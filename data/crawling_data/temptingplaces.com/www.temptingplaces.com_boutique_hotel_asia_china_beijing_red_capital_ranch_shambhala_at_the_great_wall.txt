The Destination

The charms of the Great Wall of China

Symbolic, the Great Wall is the touristic spot to be visited in China. More than 6000km long, it was the Emperor Shihuangdi (under the Qin Dynasty) who ordered to connect disparate areas of the walls together in order to fend-off Mongol invasions. A hundred thousand workers worked for more than a century to build the 10 meters wide and 15 meters high construction.

At the Red Capital Ranch, you`ll have the chance to discover a real part of the Great Chinese Wall, full of history and schielded from the hordes of tourists. You can then go on beautiful hike-trips from the hotel. For wild landscapes, you can also go to Mutianyu that has a cable-cart that is open every day.

Jingshanling, is one of the best sites to see beautiful watchtowers. From there you can do a 4h long walk to the small town of Simai whilst exploring the beauty of the wild landscapes of China.

Bada Ling, 70 km from Beijing is one of the most touristic sites and has a small piece of fully restored wall from which you can see magnificent views on the mountains. At the bottom of the monument, you can discover a documentary about the history of the building but also a museum that recently opened its doors.

The hotel experience


An ecological hotel respecting the art of Feng Shui

Hidden between the mountains, the Red Capital Ranch is a jewel inspired by the classical architecture of the Qing Dynasty hunting lodges. The buildings are built with stones and gray bricks and include numerous reconditioned elements such as old doors and windows salvaged from the demolition of old Chinese houses.

The warm decor of the hotel immerses guests into a traditional Tibetan atmosphere with a color palette combining green, orange, and red, and old furniture painted with traditional Tibetan decors. The owner has personally overseen the integration of everyday objects, like this old cart in the park, and antiques, such as statues, nestled in every corner of the hotel.

Each villa is individually decorated but always inspired by Mongolian, Chinese and Tibetan culture. The design and architecture integrates the 5 Taoists elements of wood, fire, earth, water, and metal. The rooms comply with the rules of Feng Shui and are even named according to an element (water, wind, fire ...). A statue representing the spirit of an animal (lions, tigers, horses ...) adorns each room in order to protect it. The bed and furniture of the rooms are traditional and the Qing Dynasty decorative elements the set the tone of the atmosphere.





The Tempting Experience:

The Chinese Great Wall, privately !


The Red Capital Ranch has a private access to the Great Wall of China where only customers of the hotel go through. This part of the wall is not only more private, but also it has not been restored and therefore offers a much more authentic experience. Equipped with good walking shoes, you can easily reach the guard towers and do an exploration of the wall.

Treat yourself to a picnic with champagne on the top of the wall and enjoy the majestic view and sun-set!
