The Destination

The gates of Fez

Fez has always been considered the cultural and spiritual capital of the kingdom of Morocco with Idrissids, Alawites, Andalusian and Jews having left their mark. A stroll in the city historic gardens, souks and palaces does, indeed, feel like travelling through time. An amazing way to visit is to walk around through its iconic doors and gates:
Bab El Guissa opening onto the mosque Bab Guissa.
Bab Ftouh, on the road to Taza, leading to thermal baths of Sidi Harazem.
Bab Jdid, the nearest gateway to the souks.
Bab Boujloud, accessing the two main streets leading to the souks of Al Attarine (spice and henna market). This will also take you to the Moulay Idriss area. There you can see the mausoleum of the founder of the city, the tanneries of Guernize and Blida.

The hotel experience


The luxury of privacy

Karawan Riad provides the very best of contemporary comfort: air conditioning, heating and Wi-Fi, combined with the elegance of a customized service and remarkable decor. The 7 suites are spread around the open roof patio, perfect as a meeting point or simply to enjoy a cup of tea while reading the paper in peace.

The decoration chosen by the owners and the young designer Stéphanie Lanskin is an eclectic mix of colours, textures, prints, local materials and antiques bought in all corners of the world. Its elegant, bohemian atmosphere will prove particularly soothing and relaxing.

The renovation work was entrusted to local craftsmen so that Moroccan techniques could be respected whether for the details of a zellige or the particular colour of a coating. A particular focus was brought to the lights, staging them with care to highlight the hotel natural beauty.

ZEPHYR is the smaller of the first floor suites is ideal for single travellers. An immense, carved plaster wall is the star feature, combined with a palette of soothing ocean blue hues. A stone bathroom is located at mezzanine level. But the secret of this room is an intimate terrace overlooking the medina that provides views all the way across the Minaret of Moulay Idriss to the Merinides… You feel in the heart of Fez straight away.

SUHAILI is connected to the LAAWAN suite by a walled garden. It comprises a compact little network of rooms that starts with a small office space and leads into a step-down bedroom. A keyhole arch leads to a cosy lounge, itself opening onto an intimate plant-filled terrace, one of the best spots in the riad to sneak away for a late afternoon siesta.

LAAWAN shares the same floor as SUHAILI. It is perfect for families or groups of friends. Zelliges in pistachio colour give it its pep and charm comes from the large bath basin carved in stone. The windows overlook the garden.

CHERGUI is the most grandiose of all the suites with its collection of large carpets, its many damask pillows and its art works on the walls. Its large windows and its balcony overlook the patio. The grey stone-tiled bathroom is equipped with a walk-in rain-head shower and th window overlook a vertical garden. Divided from the bedroom with keyhole arches and moshrabia details, the studio has an ample writing desk, delicate pierced brass lanterns, a picture wall featuring portraits of Amazigh women and a hidden mezzanine lounge accessed by a hanging staircase.

HARMATTAN evokes the mysterious and exotic atmosphere of ancient Morocco. Built on a palette of snowy whites and jewel-bright reds, this playful space is filled with trinket: a wall of glass lanterns, a white leather writing desk, a dark crimson Persian rug, classical calligraphy. The corner balcony overlooks the courtyard, the perfect hideaway from which to watch riad life unfold.

DZHARI is the most contemporary of the suites. Its two corner balconies overlook the patio. A shower area on oyster-grey stone inset with dark teak strips is separated from the bedroom by embroidered drapes. On the mezzanine is another seductive bathroom with black marble floors and even a love seat. The bed floats on an under-lit cedar platform, framed by elegant beige drapes. The living area features an antique carved wooden niche ideal for snuggling up with a book or sip a cup of tea. This room has its own bio-ethanol fireplace for extra comfort as well as a private, lushly planted terrace.

Tucked away on the roof terrace, DEMANI is the most intimate of the suites. Its terrace, scented by roses, is a magical spot for a romantic breakfast. Two arched windows opening onto a vertical garden give a refreshing sense of green to the room. The decoration evokes a trip through Africa with skins on the floor and beautiful animal wooden sculptures. Simple terracotta bejmat in the bedroom contrasts with the more sumptuous looking oiled bejmat in the living room. The piece de resistance in this room definitely is the three-foot deep, sunken stone bath guaranteeing a luxurious moment of relaxation.





The Tempting Experience:

The very soul of Fez


The owners of Karawan Riad fell in love with Fez many years ago and wanted to share their passion for the city with their hosts. They created this bubble in time where the past joins the present through paintings, objects and books each reflecting the story of this magnificent city.

Luxury here is also in slowing down, taking the time to see and listen to this city which has witnessed the heyday of caravans. There are many sides to discover:  Imperial, Andalusian and African Fez... Its tolerance of many cultures, bringing out the very best in each, will touch your heart. The perfect location for Karawan Riad, the home for all travellers! The hotel name, indeed, is inspired by the Persian word "Kerwan": "Travelers cross the desert together".
