A boutique hotel where sky meets sea

The Xaloc resort, member of TemptingPlaces boutique hotels collection, is located on the island of Holbox and if this name does not sound familiar to you, it is because it is an island preserved from mass tourism!

The Mayan island off the Yucatan peninsula is a well kept secret... Formerly a pirate hide-out, it is still a hidden piece of paradise: nestled in the protected area of Yum-Balam, the island and its nature are yet untouched by men: the roads are still sand paths, golf-carts, bicycles, or horseback riding are the primary means of transportation, people walk bare-foot, and local fishermen preserve nature by respecting ancestral traditions.

Imagine transparent water, kilometres-long white sand beaches that fade away into the 42 km of mangroves along the coastal area, air so pure and clean that seeing the stars at night is an easy task...

On the island of Holbox, the sweet rhythm of nature sets the tone and guests are totally detached from the frenzy of the outside of the world.

The Destination

Just next to the Maya`s source of juvenility

The Holbox Island is separated from the mainland through a lagoon named Yalahau. In Maya language, « Yal » signifies "water" and « Ahua » means "king".

« el Ojo del agua » ("the eye of the water") is located next to the mainland and is a small water stream that, according to the mythology, is source of youth. The Mayas dug the source with jade stones which were subsequently taken by the Spanish to build the first monastery of Boca Iglesia.

The hotel experience


A boutique hotel that respects its environment

Juan Felix, the owner and architect, has made his dream come true! For 9 months, he painstakingly built this getaway and its 18 small huts, all constructed in traditional style, with local resources transported by boat, and fully hand-crafted.

The circular bungalows have a 7 meters high palapa-thatched roof and wooden walls. They have been designed for optimal guest comfort and well-being as well as the respect of nature and traditions.

From your typical Yucatan hammock on the private terrace of your bungalow, you can breathe the freshness of the ocean. Air conditioning, mosquito net, and the peacefulness of nature will ensure pleasant nights.





The Tempting Experience:

The romance of virgin nature


Lovers of nature and romance have found their destination at the Xaloc Resort: observe fish through your snorkelling mask, swim with whale sharks, view whales, and watch birds: pelicans, pink flamingos ...

In short: experience immersion with nature !
