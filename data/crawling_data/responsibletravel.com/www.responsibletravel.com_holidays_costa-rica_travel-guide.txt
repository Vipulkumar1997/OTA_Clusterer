Costa Rica travel guide

This tiny Central American country is big on biodiversity - and adventure. Costa Rica brims with life on land and at sea, with monkeys, birds, sea turtles and dolphins at virtually every turn. Tourism is well developed here, and you'll find idyllic lodges, fantastic naturalist guides, ziplining, cycling and easy to traverse roads - find out more in our Costa Rica travel guide.

Costa Rica travel guide


2 minute summary




This little country is an adventure playground on an enormous scale. Adventurers can negotiate its rain and cloud forests on foot, horseback, mountain bike, hanging bridge or 200m-high zip line, for a true birds eye view of the monkey-and-macaw-filled canopy. Water babies can surf, snorkel and scuba off the coast, or kayak, rappel and raft along the inland rivers  past soaring volcanoes, bubbling geothermal pools and postcard-perfect waterfalls.

But Costa Ricas biggest selling point is not just that it has plenty to offer  its that its all been done right. From its comfortable, carbon neutral ecolodges and long-standing conservation areas covering almost a third of the country, to the excellent tourist infrastructure and focus on safety and wellbeing, Costa Rica is a perfect taste of Latin America without the need to speak Spanish, journey for days to remote jungle lodges or sacrifice comfort for glimpses of wildlife. Its all good, clean fun, and your biggest travel trauma will be realising you cant discover all of its attractions in a single trip.




Costa Rica is...

the
"Switzerland of Latin America"
,
with no political stability and no military.




Costa Rica isn't...


an undiscovered wilderness
. Tourism is well established, English widely spoken and there are as many beach bums as birders.

Underrated








Turtle conservation

Sea turtles nest on Costa Rica's Pacific and Caribbean coasts throughout the year. However, not only are they endangered, but their eggs, meat and shells are still taken for food or to sell. Volunteering - either for your whole trip or as part of a longer holiday - really makes a huge difference to survival rates, as you protect the adults, the eggs and hatchlings from predators - human or otherwise.

Pacuare

The primary rainforest of this nature reserve was once something of a hidden gem, but travellers are wising up to its true value. Pacuare River has grade II-V rafting, while rapelling and zip lining reveal different perspectives of the jungle. The superb lodge works closely with local communities, and eco-friendly bungalows offer a carbon neutral stay. The fun begins before you even arrive, as the only way in is by raft.

Tico culture

With little evidence of its pre-Colombian inhabitants and tourism focusing heavily on wildlife, you could be forgiven for forgetting that there are humans here at all. But this country has been so beautifully preserved thanks to its people, and from the Creole-speaking Afro-Costa Ricans of the Caribbean, to the Bribri of the Talamanca Mountains and the rural coffee farmers, theyre all well worth getting to know.

Caribbean coast

Its hard to get away from it all in a country this compact and popular, but the largely undeveloped Caribbean coast may just be the answer. It lacks the beach resorts of the Pacific, but if rustic bungalows, reggae and a laid-back vibe are your thing, youll be right at home. The Afro-Caribbean culture extends into the music, dance and coconut infused cuisine, and the unspoiled beaches are backed by rainforest.




Rated








Tortuguero

Begin your adventure by boat  the only way into this remote region, famed for its wildlife and particularly the green turtles that gave it its name. Peak nesting season falls from July-Oct, but you can hike and canoe through the verdant Caribbean forests most of the year, looking out for otters, howler monkeys, manatees and sloths around the rivers and lagoons. Tortuguero is also well set up for families.

Wonderful wildlife

Plenty of countries have astounding wildlife, but rarely have they preserved it so carefully for decades  and few offer so many ecosystems in such a tiny space as Costa Rica. Sightings are so superb here as there is simply nowhere for the creatures to run. Turtles, quetzals, howler monkeys, sloths, caiman, otters, dolphins take your pick of iconic species, and dont forget your binoculars.

Arenal Volcano

Of Costa Ricas 16 volcanoes, Arenal is the most famous, and it was once its most active. Lava flows have ceased in recent years, but the national park still has much to offer. Cross suspended walkways and traverse nature trails through the forest to discover birds, howler monkeys, cascades and barren lava fields, then revive your achey legs in the thermal baths. The little town of La Fortuna is a convenient base.

Family travel

With the possible exception of the Galapagos, which is both costly and remote, you could argue that Costa Rica is the most enticing destination for family travel in Latin America. Safe, tiny, with superb facilities and widely spoken English, this is ideal for even the youngest of travellers, while the mind blowing menu of adventure activities will keep older children busy for weeks.




Overrated








Manuel Antonio

We recommend stopping by this beach  just so that you really appreciate the fact youre staying elsewhere. Although the surrounding national park is incredible, Manuel Antonios fame and proximity to San José mean that more people head here for the beach than the wildlife, and youll have to endure the noise that comes with that. Numbers are capped; but at 600-800 per day, youll barely have space for your beach towel.

Tamarindo

This former fishing village is now one of the countrys most hyped hotspots, thanks to its reliable surf, direct airport access and abundance of hotels, restaurants and all night parties. Pebbly Playa Grande is unlikely to inspire anyone other than surfers, and the town is bordering on overdevelopment  Westerners dominate and the lack of Tico culture appears to be a big selling point. Tamarindo National Wildlife Refuge, however, is worth a visit.

Active Arenal

Costa Ricas most restless volcano spewed lava for over four decades, but since 2010 it has been taking a well earned break. Visitors wont see the lava or ash rising from its peak, and as its peaks is often shrouded in low cloud, it can be a bit of a disappointment. So dont come for the volcanic views  or photographs  but for the still-superb activities, including hiking, zip lining, rafting and canopy tours.

Self defence

In 1948, Costa Rica decided that the military was overrated and abolished the army, navy and air force. The country has local police forces only, and no heavy weapons, tanks or warships. In Costa Rica, peace comes first, and rather than being greeted by military officials, foreign dignitaries are greeted by schoolchildren. This is a particularly symbolic move for a tiny nation in a volatile region.





Food, shopping & people


Travel like a local with our Costa Rica travel guide



Eating & drinking in Costa Rica




The national dish is
gallo pinto
, the
staple of black beans and rice.

The humble
plantain
multitasks
like few other fruits. Thinly
sliced and deep fried, it makes a
tasty, salty-sweet snack called

chifles
. Mashed, refried plantains,
called
patacones
are filling and delicious.

Casado
refers to a set lunch in local restaurants, usually consisting of gallo pinto, plantains and salad  plus beef, fish or pork.

The tropical climate makes this paradise for fruit lovers. Fresh juices are ubiquitous and cheap; we recommend creamy
guanábana
, also known as soursop.






Costa Rica is home to
5 percent of the planets diversity
 despite covering just 0.03 percent of its surface. This includes 1 in 10 of the worlds butterfly species.





People & language




Costa Rican people are known as Ticos. Most are a blend of European and native roots, but indigenous communities number around 60,000; the Bribri, Kekioldi and Cabecar live in the southern Caribbean region, growing cacao trees and making roofs from palm fronds. Ranches along the dry north Pacific are the cowboy culture hub, while the Caribbean coast is testimony to the wave of Jamaican immigration.

Afro-Costa Rican creole is known as
"Maketelyu"
from the phrase make I tell you.


"Soda"
is not a drink  its a basic café selling economical set meals.


"Pura vida"
is not just a greeting  it also means "good". So if asked ¿como estas? You can reply ¡pura vida, gracias!




Gifts & shopping




Youre sure to sample
Salsa Lizano
, a savoury condiment present on every Tico table. Its slightly sweet, slightly spicy  and tastes great with everything. Be sure to pick up a bottle before you leave.

An hour away from San José,
the little town of Sarchi is an artisan-filled shoppers paradise.
You can pick up wood and leather rocking chairs that fold down into a box, traditional ceramics from the region of Guanacaste, and colourful masks and jewellery.

Oxcarts
 known as
carretas
 were used to carry coffee across the mountains. These were brightly painted, reflecting the region their owner came from  and have now been recognised by UNESCO as
heritage
symbols.
Miniature
painted oxcarts
are a truly
Tico souvenir.

A brief history of Costa Rica




The Spanish governor in 1719 described Costa Rica as the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America. Today, few would recognise this country  one of the wealthiest in the region  from his description. As if further proof as needed, Costa Rica in fact means rich coast  a far more accurate name for this tiny gem of a nation.

Costa Rica can be viewed by tourists today as the intersection between Western and Latin American culture. But historically, it was the meeting point of Andean South Americans, Aztecs from the north and the seafaring Caribs from the east. But all of these people fell under the rule of Spain when Costa Rica joined this mighty empire in 1524. Isolated from the regional capital in Guatemala and lacking gold and silver, few resources were poured into this land and the well-to-do settlers found themselves having to tend their own crops without the enslavement or oppression of the local population. This created an unusual kind of rural democracy, a premonition of the egalitarian society that Costa Rica would become centuries later.

Costa Rica finally gained its independence in the 1820s, but thanks to its remoteness, it only learned this a month later. However, once it was discovered that coffee grew exceptionally well in this climate and volcanic soil, the country gained a new value. Landowners were given free saplings as an incentive to maximise production; coffee soon comprised 90 percent of all the countrys exports. But although there was money to be made, Costa Ricas progressive government maintained its democratic stance by imposing high taxes on plantation owners and exporters, which in turn was reinvested in free education for all.

The same care was not invested in the environment, however, as forests were cleared to make way for coffee and bananas, but as coffee prices plummeted in the 1970s, people began to view the forest in a different way. Rather than making money from exporting things from the land  could we not make money by importing people to it? What was once seen as a barrier to wealth generation was now seen as the very source of that wealth. Costa Rica became a leader in the worlds environmental movement almost by accident, as income from tourism surpassed that of coffee and bananas, and the country moved to conserve swathes of cloud forest and rainforest, coast and ocean. Tourism here for the most part is considered ecotourism  yet there are concerns that in future it may become a victim of its own success. Though profits remain largely in-country, resulting in poverty levels dropping from 50 to 20 percent, there are concerns about the rights of local communities who still depend on the land for their survival. Additionally, sustainable tourism by its very definition has a limit to how big it can grow; with over a million visitors per year sensitivity is needed. Costa Ricas past has turned it into a model for responsible tourism; its future could reveal what happens once that ideal has been achieved.
