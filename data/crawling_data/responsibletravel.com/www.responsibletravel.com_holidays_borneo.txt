Borneo holidays
Tours & holidays in  2017 & 2018

Despite having opened up greatly to visitors in the past few decades, Borneo holidays remain a road less travelled. Sabah and Sarawak are now well equipped for visitors, boasting wildlife sanctuaries, world-class dive resorts and mountain treks. But to get truly lost in this remote island, its worth heading into Indonesian Kalimantan, whose jungles must be navigated by river and where landscapes and people remain largely untainted by tourism.

The people both in Borneo and on the Indonesian Islands ( Bali and Flores) were happy and smiling all of the time and their natural hospitality was very impressive. I loved the boats trips on the Kinabatagen river and all the amazing bird and animal wildlife and Paul really enjoyed the early morning treks in the Tabin Wildlife reserve and captured photographs again of an amazing and unusual selection of wildlife.

The river cruises at Abai Lodge was the most memorable. Seeing so many of what we were told was hard to see, especially the elephants, and doing the safari with a group of people with great sense of humour, including the guide.

Borneo tailor made holidays, wildlife & beaches





From
£2,765
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Difficult-there were many.  Seeing a wild Orangutan, just outside the cave at Gomantong, close up and "posing" for us, or rounding a bend on the Kinabatangan river to see 30-40 pigmy elephants of all ages on the bank.  A set of  experiences rather than just a holiday.

Elizabeth Barratt
Every spotting of the orangutans, gibbons, birds, lizards, or even pigs was delightful. My husband and I adopted an orphaned Orangutan At the Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary. All along the way of our safari, the guides told us how we would recognize the child Orangutan. I spotted her immediately when she came out for the 4 pm feeding.

Memorable parts?
Seeing orang-utans in the wild at Kinabatangan, and in the semi-wild at Sepilok, and seeing a herd of elephants cross the river at Kinabatangan seeing Deer Cave and Clearwater Cave at Mulu.
Tips?
I don't really think the beach resort at the end was necessary to unwind. Don't worry about the clothes you bring.

Memorable parts?
Arriving at Bako National Park (via an exhilarating boat ride), wading on to the un-spoilt beach and then seeing hibiscus monkey's swinging through the 
trees.
Tips?
Malaysian Borneo, centered around Kuching, is a brilliant way for families with younger children to get a taste of all tha the country has to offer. Nothing is 
more than an 40 minute drive from the delightful city - jungle, orangutangs, monkeys, frogs and stunning beach.
Local benefits?
