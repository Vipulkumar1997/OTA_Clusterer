Last minute holidays
Tours & holidays in  2017 & 2018

Who doesnt love to be a little spontaneous? And yet, with schedules and hectic social whirls many of us are losing an ability to just pack and go. The travel industry doesnt always make it that easy either, with information overkill on the internet when it comes to late availability holidays. Our last minute holidays policy aims to awaken that dormant adventure seeker within, and make the get up and go as smooth a journey as possible. Don't panic!

Chile adventure holiday





From
£2,849
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
I fell in love with Patagonia and in particular our time in Torres del Paine. It's absolutely stunning!
Tips?
Don't expect to have much free time for independent exploring, it's an action packed itinerary.
Local benefits?
Yes
Overall rating?
This was my first trip to South America and going solo I was a little nervous. It was great to be part of a group and explore Chile together. Even though the 
itinerary is action packed everything is organised...

James and Aasta and wonderful hosts. Aasta is an amazing vegetarian and vegan cook. The breakfast is the best I have ever tasted in any hotel.  Their 
recommendations for eating out were perfect. James has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the walks in the area and is willing to assist you at all times.

Jordan holiday, a week in Jordan





From
£859
excluding flights

Full holiday details




I really liked the variety. There were days visiting sites and museums, mixed with a couple of days at the Dead and Red Seas, together with a day in the desert.  In particular I enjoyed the group leader, who clearly cared about giving us a good experience, and who entertained and educated us in equal measure.

Jerdash Roman ruins was quite intact and impressive. But the most memorable were Petra, the walk along the Siq, and seeing the Treasury, and the Monastery. They were fantastic. Hiking up to the cliffs of Petra and the views were outstanding.

Ferdinand Rullan
The most memorable moment was Petra (of course) and the camel ride at Wadi Rum (it is an optional but well worth it!). Our local tour leader was excellent (knowledge of history and kept us entertained during our bus journeys), the group blended well (the best so far), trips well organised and plenty of shopping opportunities.

Cambodia small group tour, a food adventure





From
£855
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
There were so many! The walks through food stalls, the cooking lessons, the impromptu stops of the bus to get more street food and going to a BBQ with locals at Siem Reap.
Tips?
Its a jam packed itinerary so if you need lots of downtime, it's probably not for you.
Local benefits?
Yes
Overall rating?
It was really great. The only recommendation I'd have is to add in an Angkor beer tour in PP.

Iran small group tour, Journey to Persia





From
£2,399
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
The stunning architecture. Tomb of Darius. Meeting the Iranian people.
Tips?
Try not to fall asleep between cities. You'll miss so much.
Local benefits?
Maybe in the two small villages we visited. Certainly driving around in a bus does not help the environment.
Overall rating?

Halong Bay and Angkor Wat stick out just a bit above the rest of the places we visited.

Don't hesitate to book. Just go! It was amazing. The operator uses local transport, including trains. The hotels were small businesses and not part of large world wide chains. Our group was a mix of ages from 20 year olds to over 60's so it is suitable for all wanting to experience India.
