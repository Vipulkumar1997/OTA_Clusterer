India holidays
Tours & holidays in  2017 & 2018

India holidays are a magical menagerie, an escape into the exotic and a means of breaking down all our western conventions and presumptions. The Golden Triangle, Delhi, the Taj Mahal and Jaipur offer palaces, princes, mughals and mystery. However, beaches and waterways further south present more relaxed alternatives with the trails in Ladakh an absolute must for hikers. Go one step off the tourist trail, and it will feel like a million miles.

An amazing way to get an insight into the many sides of India. Trains are a brilliant way to see the countryside and talk to Indian people. The tour company was the most helpful travel company I have ever dealt with and I highly recommend using them.

There were so many memorable moments it was brilliant. Seeing tigers and leopards, staying in the most amazing room at Nadine's Haveli, travelling on the sleeper train visiting the elephants at Jaipur, the holi festival in Jaipur, the living fort at Jaisalmer, the camel ride, meeting so many lovely friendly and helpful people.

Graham Meadows
Very hard to choose from so many truly wonderful and diverse experiences.  Generally, we'd say the unexpected opportunity to meet - and to spend some real quality time getting to know and learning from - a variety of local individuals was  especially gratifying. Truly outstanding and quite unusual.   Stimulating, challenging, and fun.  Extensive opportunities to explore an incredible variety of stunning historical and cultural sites.

Seeing tigers in Ranthambore National Park- yes two less than twenty feet away. I had no expectations of seeing so to come across one resting beside the track who was then joined by another was amazing.

Don't hesitate to book. Just go! It was amazing. The operator uses local transport, including trains. The hotels were small businesses and not part of large world wide chains. Our group was a mix of ages from 20 year olds to over 60's so it is suitable for all wanting to experience India.

The most exciting part was not on the original programme.  We asked Rajat to give us somewhat more nature and less culture. He arranged for us to spend a day and two nights in a resort on the Kabini Lake, across from the Nagarhole 
National Park.  On a boat safari at dusk, amidst myriad birds and beasts,  we saw a male tiger emerging muddily from the river, slinking into the jungle.

The people we met was the most memorable - ALL of them lovely- friendly, genuine, generous. This applies to local s we met, in addition to those employed in the industry. Every single day was memorable and exciting. No exaggeration! Maybe I would have to say the Houseboat was the highlight though.

Liz Naylon
This was definitely a 4-star holiday!...By far the most memorable part for us was the houseboat cruise on the back waters. Two nights on a barge - we loved the leisurely pace as we moved slowly along the rivers, giving plenty of time for watching birds and also watching life as lived alongside the river.

The most memorable moment was staying at the lodge, in the buffer zone, listening to the night around a bonfire with wonderful snacks and a gin and tonic, then visiting the local villages on a walk the following day. The jungle safaris were amazing particularly the elephant back experience and of course seeing the tigers.

The houseboat on the 'backwaters' was the most memorable. Excellent.

It is hard to pick out just one memorable monet but we loved the tea plantations - the rolling hills, the vast sea of green, the windy roads, the spices nearby and the history of the sector.

Actually seeing the tigers that we went to see was memorable - and very much more besides. A porcupine was a special  unplanned and unexpected bonus. Faultless. A complex programme which was perfectly choreographed - and enjoyable to excess.

Memorable parts?
The homestays were particularly enjoyable, allowing us some insight into everyday life in a way that can be difficult to experience as a tourist. Our hosts were warm, genuine, entertaining and thoughtful people who put a great deal of effort into ensuring that we got the best from our trip. It felt very sad each time we had to move on! Also, Keralan food is wonderful, though 3 home cooked meals a day can have a serious impact on your waistline (perhaps we should have refused...

The most memorable moments were Ranakpur Temple, wandering the streets of Bundi and visiting the Hindu temples there with the guide. It was a fantastic and rewarding experience which I will not soon forget. It really opened my eyes to a lot I didn't know about Indian culture and history...

Memorable parts?
There were many memorable experiences - our rickshaw ride through the Dehli markets was definitely a highlight....what a culture shock!  The noise, smells, heat and totally manic traffic dodging around cows in the streets is imprinted on the memory.  Seeing the rural life in Rajasthan was amazing - how the locals live in their mud houses, working on the land by hand, and how friendly the people were to us.  Staying in a Maharaja's palace was an experience.  Seeing the Taj...

Memorable parts?
We traveled as a family and moved every couple of days so ever day brought something new and was memorable. What was exciting about this holiday was learning about other cultures and meeting people living in a variety of different ways. But as a family, the favorite experience was riding an elephant.
Tips?
Take plenty of hand sanitiser for when you are out and about and some toilet rolls too. Food is very cheap, eat out! Don't eat at the Sandesh Prince hotel in...

Memorable parts?
The Taj Mahal has to be the most iconic visit. Having to get in the queue for the 6 o'clock opening was "different", but really worth it. Back to the hotel in time for breakfast AFTER visiting the Taj is something I shall be slipping into most conversations I have in the near future!  Next was the 3 days in Jaipur where I felt like a princess being waited on hand and foot. Bed tea was lovely and sipping gin and tonic while watching a charming puppet show could have been part...
