Responsible tourism



Responsible tourism: Solar eclipse holiday in Argentina 2019



Show More


Environment
In order to ensure we protect the environment and minimise our ecological footprint we recycle in our UK office and use recycled ink cartridges. We also minimise our waste by limiting the number of holiday brochures we print. Instead, we refer potential customers to our online resources and send most of our holiday information via email.
We also provide pre-departure information including environmentally responsible travel advice, such as carrying reusable drinks bottles, as plastics are hard to recycle in remote areas and have a negative impact on natural environments.
We always recommend overland travel using local transportation as opposed to short domestic flights where possible, however due to the vast distances covered during this trip flying is unavoidable. In this itinerary, the route from Mendoza to San Juan and Bella Vista will be travelled in a comfortable mini-van, as opposed to flying.
We work with environmentally conscious hotels where possible. This itinerary can include a stay at the InterContinental hotel in Mendoza, which is part of the Green Engage Program to manage the environmental impact of its guests.
Community
In order to ensure we have a positive impact on local economies and provide socially responsible holidays we only use local suppliers, which helps keep the money generated through tourism within local communities through employment of local guides, drivers and reps.
In this itinerary, you will be travelling in a small group, chauffeured by a local driver in a mini-bus. Rather than using national coach-hire agencies and tour buses, this helps provide jobs for small businesses. It also gives your trip a more personal touch.
We also always recommend locally-owned restaurants and hotels where possible, aiming to support local communities and give tourists the opportunity to travel like a local. We provide customers with a list of recommended restaurants tailor-made to their destination and dietary requirements but with a focus on family-run restaurants.
In this itinerary you will attend a local traditional tango show, and your city tour will take in cultural sites of interest in the city often overlooked by tourists. These can include street art spots, and for those who are interested we can organise interactions with local artists.
