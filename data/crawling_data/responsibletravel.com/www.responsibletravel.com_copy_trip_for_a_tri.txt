Trip for a trip
Every time you book one of our holidays and opt in we will organise a day trip for a disadvantaged child from a developing country. We took 20 children who live close to Angkor Wat in Cambodia, but have never visited, on a guided tour of the temples. Some children who live near game parks or the sea have never seen any wildlife or the ocean ...

We hope others in our industry will copy us and by 2020 we can give one million disadvantaged children a great day out.
