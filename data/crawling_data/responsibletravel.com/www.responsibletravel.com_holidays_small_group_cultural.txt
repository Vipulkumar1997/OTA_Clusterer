Small group cultural holidays
Tours & holidays in  2017 & 2018

Sometimes we want to travel but either through timing or a lack of shared spirit, its just us that shows any willing when it comes to making things happen. Going on holiday is the same and if youve got a cultural adventure in mind but no one who wants to go with you then why not find a few people who will? Small group cultural holidays to places like Morocco, Croatia or Mexico do happen; its up to you to find out more.

The most memorable part of the holiday was walking around Barkhor Square in Lhasa seeing people on pilgrimage from various regions of Tibet.  The people were very friendly and even came to shake our hands and say hello. The holiday was absolutely fantastic.  The Tibetan landscape is stunning and the monasteries and temples are fascinating.

The highlights for me personally were a visit to the D.T. Suzuki Museum in Kanazawa and the visit to the O Torii Gate on the island of Itsukushima, where deer roam freely. The whole two weeks were a whirlwind of amazing sights,  sounds and experiences.

Cambodia small group tour, a food adventure





From
£855
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
There were so many! The walks through food stalls, the cooking lessons, the impromptu stops of the bus to get more street food and going to a BBQ with locals at Siem Reap.
Tips?
Its a jam packed itinerary so if you need lots of downtime, it's probably not for you.
Local benefits?
Yes
Overall rating?
It was really great. The only recommendation I'd have is to add in an Angkor beer tour in PP.

Jordan holiday, a week in Jordan





From
£859
excluding flights

Full holiday details




I really liked the variety. There were days visiting sites and museums, mixed with a couple of days at the Dead and Red Seas, together with a day in the desert.  In particular I enjoyed the group leader, who clearly cared about giving us a good experience, and who entertained and educated us in equal measure.

Jerdash Roman ruins was quite intact and impressive. But the most memorable were Petra, the walk along the Siq, and seeing the Treasury, and the Monastery. They were fantastic. Hiking up to the cliffs of Petra and the views were outstanding.

Ferdinand Rullan
The most memorable moment was Petra (of course) and the camel ride at Wadi Rum (it is an optional but well worth it!). Our local tour leader was excellent (knowledge of history and kept us entertained during our bus journeys), the group blended well (the best so far), trips well organised and plenty of shopping opportunities.

It is hard to pick out a highlight as it was all highly enjoyable. The overnight train from Moscow to St Petersburg was memorable as was seeing Lenin in his mausoleum lying in state. Local guides were very good and informative about Russian history and contemporary Russia.

Iran small group tour, Journey to Persia





From
£2,399
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
The stunning architecture. Tomb of Darius. Meeting the Iranian people.
Tips?
Try not to fall asleep between cities. You'll miss so much.
Local benefits?
Maybe in the two small villages we visited. Certainly driving around in a bus does not help the environment.
Overall rating?

Swimming in the Blue Eye and walking over the pass from Theth to Valbona. I loved the holiday, the only down side was that perhaps we tried to pack in too much for the short time we had available.

Morocco Atlas & Sahara 4WD tour





From
US $2,600
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
The whole trip was memorable and exciting. We experienced the Sahara in all it's glory,  the majestic High Atlas, gorges, high mountain passes and tiny villages where the local people live and work in the fields as they have done for centuries. The itinerary was full of highlights. The time spent in the desert was  particularly memorable. Most tours take you to the edge of the Sahara late in the day so you can 'overnight' there and then you are taken back to 'civilisation'...

Bhutan was amazing. We loved the culture, the slow pace and Tigers Nest was the highlight, we loved the hotels, the food and the tour was superb. Our agent in Kathmandu, and our tour operator was excellent.

Tiger's Nest Monastery .. it was the place I was most looking forward to visiting, and was every bit as good as I hoped. However, all of Bhutan was magical .. it's a such a remarkable, pristine country, comparatively untouched by mass tourism. From the moment of landing in Paro valley (it felt like the wings of the plane almost clipped the mountains!) it was an amazing experience.

Flying into Bhutan over the Himalayas and then the sharp right to get down into the narrow valley to line up with the runway. Exciting, definitely! I loved the greenery, the steep valleys and sometimes roaring rivers.

Seeing tigers in Ranthambore National Park- yes two less than twenty feet away. I had no expectations of seeing so to come across one resting beside the track who was then joined by another was amazing.

Don't hesitate to book. Just go! It was amazing. The operator uses local transport, including trains. The hotels were small businesses and not part of large world wide chains. Our group was a mix of ages from 20 year olds to over 60's so it is suitable for all wanting to experience India.
