Responsible Travel Guarantee

Your holiday is fully protected with Responsible Travel


We are ABTA
members and your money is secure when you book through us. In the highly unlikely event that either us or one of our holiday providers fail, resulting in you not being able to travel, you will be fully refunded.  In addition, we are here to help if you are unsatisfied with your holiday.

How it works
When you book your holiday through us you pay our supplier - the holiday company or accommodation provider - directly and your contract is with them.   We still protect you and cover both our failure and that of our suppliers - read more details about our
Responsible Travel Guarantee
and not too much small print. If Responsible Travel should fail then
ABTA
will step in to make sure you are fully protected. We really don't think you'll need this but the cover is reassuring.

How we ensure you won't need this protection
We've been in business since 2001 and booked holidays for over 100,000 customers. We choose the holiday companies and accommodations we work with very carefully and we monitor our customer's experience via our customer reviews to ensure they are delivering outstanding holidays. We have been working with most of these holiday and accommodation providers for many years and they have proven track records regarding the quality of their holidays. If you are not completely satisfied with your holiday then you do have to speak to the holiday or accommodation provider first, preferably early on whilst you are actually on holiday to give them the best chance to fix any problems. If you need any further help then please do contact us and we will do our best to help sort things out so that everyone is satisfied.
