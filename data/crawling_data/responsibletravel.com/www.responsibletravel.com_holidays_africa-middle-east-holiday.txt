Africa holidays
Tours & holidays in  2017 & 2018

Think golden sunsets silhouetting the long necks of giraffes picking leaves from trees, and wild landscapes extending as far as the eye can see. As much as this is Africa holidays personified, todays Africa is so much more. From the exotic madness of Moroccos souks, to the ancient wonders of Egypt, the endless rippling dunes of the Sahara, or your first eye-to-eye sighting of a gorilla in Uganda, Africa is an intoxicating melting pot of experiences.

The incredible wildlife viewing opportunities was the highlight. The passion for conservation shown by the guides and the safari camp employees.

Laura Johnston
Sitting in an open safari vehicle, surrounded by around 20 elephants, one of which was so close it would have been possible to touch its trunk. Also, having 14 days in which to learn more about the wildlife and ecology of the Kruger area. Opportunity to see the 'Big 5' plus many of the 'Small 5' and the 'Ugly 5'.

Our trip took in 5 different areas of South Africa and every single part of it was unforgettable. We spent 3 nights in the northern Drakensburg, 3 nights in The 
Battlefields and 3 nights on safari in Thanda, KwaZulu Natal. Then went on to 3 nights in Cape Town and 2 nights in Hermanus. Every single aspect of the

The whole adventure was a brand new experience for us so its very hard to pick the most memorable part, the first time seeing all the wonderful flora and fauna, every safari trip ... If I was pushed to pick the absolute favourite part then it was the stay at the  Mwagusi camp , a truly magical experience.

Painting holiday in Moroccan desert





From
£875
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
Visiting the desert, the wonderful Adobe accommodation nearby, the fantastic locations for sketching and the visit by camel riding off into the sunset in the sand dunes and staying overnight in a Nomad's Tent to watch sunrise.
Tips?
Please dress warmly if booking for March, as even though the sun shines, it can be quite cold.  Take lots of photos - locations for sketching are very inspiring. Absorb the atmosphere.
Local benefits?
We stayed in local accommodation....

Morocco Atlas & Sahara 4WD tour





From
US $2,600
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
The whole trip was memorable and exciting. We experienced the Sahara in all it's glory,  the majestic High Atlas, gorges, high mountain passes and tiny villages where the local people live and work in the fields as they have done for centuries. The itinerary was full of highlights. The time spent in the desert was  particularly memorable. Most tours take you to the edge of the Sahara late in the day so you can 'overnight' there and then you are taken back to 'civilisation'...

We enjoyed the whole experience but particularly enjoyed the Chobe River trip, because we saw such a variety of wildlife at close quarters. The plane trip over the Okavango Delta was also a highlight because it gave a wonderful overview of the area.

The Okavango Delta was incredible, but so was Victoria Falls, Etosha game drives, Dune 45 - and of course the quad biking!  All of it was terrific! I absolutely loved every minute of it!

Full holiday details




There were many memorable moments. Camping in the Okovango Delta was amazing, and the walks around the delta meant that we could get really close to some animals without disturbing them. The sunset cruise on the Chobe River enabled us to see loads of elephants taking baths and they weren't bothered at all by our presence.

A marvellous holiday that exceeded expectations in all areas! Most memorable was the incredible wildlife in both Selous and Ruaha national Parks, plus the coral reefs we saw around Mafia Island - truly spectacular. Lack of other tourists was a major plus.

Everything was wonderful. The setting perhaps captures most of it - staying in beautiful places in the midst of the national parks and conservation areas, where the animals were everywhere (from in camp to close by during game drives).

Fantastic! Amazing! Awe inspiring! The trip of a lifetime! Our most memorable moments were our interactions with the local people. Even though we booked this safari to see the Serengeti, we also wanted to make sure we spent an equal amount of time visiting and getting to know the people of Tanzania. We will forever hold in our hearts how warm and inviting everyone was.

Fantastic. It was the perfect family holiday with a 12 year old and 14 year old. 
Always plenty to do, loads of variety, but never rushed.

This is by far the best holiday I have ever been on, and I've been on quite a few! Nothing beats the natural untouched beauty of Africa, but it was the beauty of 
the people that helped us feel at home that I will remember most.

Excellent - if you want a friendly open hearted place to stay and learn to dive then I couldn't recommend it more highly.

Do not hesitate to book this holiday! The people are fantastic, the place is beautiful and the more relaxed nature of the area due to its more remote location made for a far more relaxing holiday than you would have at other resorts in the region
The whole operation was centred around local people and the local economy. We were actively encouraged to reduce our environmental impact and respect the environment which we were lucky enough to see

Everything was fantastic but the most memorable part was the diving. We went 
diving every day and saw lots of coral and fish. Staying with this operator was also 
very relaxing. They looked after us wonderfully, everything we wanted was 
provided and nothing was too much trouble.

It is really hard to decide of many of the memorable and exciting experiences 
on this holiday which one stands out the most for me. Everyday it seemed that I saw something different in the bush, unexpectedly two male cheetahs appeared one morning, then there was the cheetah with her cub, there were rhinos and rhino babies, one interesting experience for me personally was a close encounter with an Assasin Bug(reduviidae, heteroptera).

Although the Churches, Museums and Palaces were stunning and memorable the aspect that made the most impact was meeting people in different parts of Ethiopia and gaining some understanding of how they live.
