Malaysia holiday, 14 days





From
£1,028
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
The visit to Georgetown, Penang was one of the most memorable.  We enjoyed the guided bike ride around the ethnic areas and avoiding the traffic was a 
challenge! Noordin Mews was a very pleasant place to stay. The visit to the tea plantation and factory was special as was the guided walk in the 'mossy' cloud 
forest. The canopy walk In Taman Negara was also a challenge but disappointingly no animals were seen, well a couple of leeches and a butterfly.

James and Aasta and wonderful hosts. Aasta is an amazing vegetarian and vegan cook. The breakfast is the best I have ever tasted in any hotel.  Their 
recommendations for eating out were perfect. James has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the walks in the area and is willing to assist you at all times.

Being in an amazing part of the world, with a group of like-minded people, hiking through woods, wild water swimming, swimming in a waterfall, visiting an island monastery. My son and daughter both loved the off-road trip with the land rover, jumping from a village bridge into a river, seeing Golden Orioles and Hoopooes was another highlight.

Cambodia small group tour, a food adventure





From
£855
excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
There were so many! The walks through food stalls, the cooking lessons, the impromptu stops of the bus to get more street food and going to a BBQ with locals at Siem Reap.
Tips?
Its a jam packed itinerary so if you need lots of downtime, it's probably not for you.
Local benefits?
Yes
Overall rating?
It was really great. The only recommendation I'd have is to add in an Angkor beer tour in PP.

Memorable parts?
There were many, I would pick Ninh Binh as a fantastic example of Vietnamese landscape. My kids would probably pick the Vespa adventures tour in Ho Chi 
Min City and my wife the Surnise Hotel in Hoi An.
Tips?
I would suggest to have an idea of the itinerary and the type of trip and then contact a tour operator with a strong knowledge of the country. Tips are invaluable if travelling for the first time there. I also found extremely useful having a local guide and...

The people both in Borneo and on the Indonesian Islands ( Bali and Flores) were happy and smiling all of the time and their natural hospitality was very impressive.

We were a small and delightful group. The boat was cozy and comfortable, the landscapes and cloudscapes, sublime; and the day trips and hikes, especially our visit to Iona and its sacred and ancient abbey were vitamin C for the spirit.

The walks (Amalfi coast and Capri) in a landscape as rocky as green (with flowers).We stayed two nigts in Capri (which is really preferable in comparison with a normal day tour to Capri - it gives you the freedom of some walks outside the mainstreams).

Climbing the 'Singing Sand Dunes' (Khongoryn Els) at sunset was amazing! It was a big effort to make it to the top, but we were rewarded with once-in-a lifetime views over the vast sand dunes and Gobi Desert while mother nature turned on a spectacular pink and purple hue.

The place as a relaxed elegance about it and many of the visitors had been there before.  The meals were beautiful and the cooking lessons had the right balance of watching and participating. The visits to the local towns were relaxed and each place chosen was memorable.
