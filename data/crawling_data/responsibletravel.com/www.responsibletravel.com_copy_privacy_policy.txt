Privacy Policy
We are committed to providing you with the best information on responsible travel, and to protecting your privacy.



We will only collect information from you that we require in order to provide you with the most relevant information for your interests.
We email you with three different types of communication:

Transactional emails - automated based on enquiries made through the site
E-magazines - Last Minute / Special Offers / Holiday Ideas
E-magazines - personalised, following what you have recently viewed or enquired about on the site

All our e-magazines contain an 'Unsubscribe' link offering you the opportunity to decline to receive further information if you so wish. Or, email
rosy@responsibletravel.com
and we will unsubscribe for you.
We will not sell or lease your details to any other party. If this policy is changed at any time in the future we will notify all members by e-mail, and provide you with an opportunity to opt out of this release of information if you so wish.


Changing or cancelling your e-magazine registration

Please read the rest of our privacy policy. If you would like to amend your contact details please e-mail
rosy@responsibletravel.com
with both your old & new details. If you would like to opt-out, or would no longer like to receive our e-magazine we will be sad to see you go but please either follow the unsubscribe link on the e-magazine or e-mail us at
rosy@responsibletravel.com
with this instruction.


Information collected by Responsible Travel

You do not need to enter any personal information to use Responsible Travel. If you decide to use the site to request information from a member of Responsible Travel we will capture your e-mail address, and either your telephone number or address depending on what information you have requested. This information will be passed to the tour operator or accommodation owner member from whom you have requested information in order for them to reply to your request. If you use the site to send trip or accommodation details to a friend, we will add you to our e-magazine mailing list. If you have requested information through the site or are on our mailing list we may use this information to target adverts on third party sites such as social media. Users may opt out of seeing these adverts by changing their settings within their social media accounts.

We use cookies across the site to gather information about what pages users visit on Responsible Travel. In addition to using this data to improve the site (see below), we use this information to serve relevant follow-up emails to act as a reminder of what you have viewed and to suggest similar holidays you may be interested in. You can opt out of these by clicking Unsubscribe on the email. Once unsubscribed you will not receive any further follow-up emails when browsing the site. However, you will receive both e-magazines and transactional emails following any enquiry you make through the site, and will continue to receive e-magazines unless you unsubscribe from these separately. You will automatically be re-subscribed when you make any subsequent enquiry. It is not possible to unsubscribe from transactional emails.

Sharing of data with our partners

If you request information from one of our tour operator or accommodation owner members we will pass on your contact details to them so that they can reply to your request. On occasion we will also pass this information onto to other members who offer similar packages enabling you to have options for your holiday. We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of our members. Responsible Travel will provide aggregated, anonymous data to advertisers, our members and other third parties.
