Top 10 European adventure breaks

Find out which tours have made our European adventure breaks top 10 as well as the best times to go, and direct links to other relevant trips and travel guides. We think small group adventures create far less impact on the environment, especially when compared to larger alternatives. Our adventure holidays are also designed for travellers looking for an exciting cultural experience as well as providing financial benefit to communities living in remote regions away from tourist hot spots.

Top 10 European Adventure Breaks


pedals, paddles & pure adrenaline



This is your chance to get active outdoors as you explore remote regions of Europe that go way beyond the typical tourist trail. European adventure breaks will usually take the form of a small group experience with fun and camaraderie as high on the agenda as safety and expert guidance. Dive in; jump off; descend; ascend; pedal; paddle; ride; glide  whatever you do, dont let anything stand in the way of your next European adventure holiday.




1. Kayaking holidays in Croatia




Theres nothing like the Croatian coast to put paddles through their paces. Sublime secret coves and see-through shallows surround an exciting collection of inhabited and deserted island archipelagos, making a sea kayaking holiday in Croatia really hard to beat.

3. Cycling holidays in southern Italy




Cycling as part of a small group from Palinuro in Cilento National Park to Positano, Amalfi and Minori, is one Italian job that you wont want to miss. Daily distances of 40-60km, and a couple of +1,000m ascents and -1,000m descents, make the sea views all the more rewarding.
