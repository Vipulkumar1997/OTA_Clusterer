Winter holidays
Tours & holidays in  2017 & 2018

For those who dont want to join the piste posse, the traditional ways of enjoying winter holidays are becoming hugely popular again: cross country skiing and snowshoeing off the tourist trail, husky sledding, taking in the Northern Lights or mountain winter walking with crampons to get a grip. Because in winter, we dont all have to do the downhill thing to get a grip. Sometimes we just want the simple joys of Stopping by woods on a snowy evening.

delightful.

It was outstanding, we were a group of 5 ladies and we wanted a challenge and something out our comfort zone, and we got that. We were all so proud of what we did, it was hard work, but it wouldn't have been a challenge had it not been.

The most memorable moment was travelling through the snowy wilderness with only the sound of the dogs paws and the sledge. Standing on a frozen lake (-20 degrees C) watching the northern lights and learning to understand and care for my husky team.

Snowshoeing in the French Alps





From

The husky dog sledding, the ice climb, the snowshoeing itself, being out in such a beautiful environment! And our companions too - the other four people in the party were lovely, and we all got on very well together - enough in common to bond yet different enough for good conversation!

In terms of the most exciting part, it has to be the ice climbing...not part of our original plans but I'm so glad it was suggested. Slow down and enjoy your stay in what really is an undiscovered part of the Alps.

Memorable parts?
All of it! It was wonderful. We all loved different activities. I enjoyed the reindeer sleigh ride and the husky sledding while my 8 year old preferred the thrill of 
the snowmobile ride! The cross country skiing and snowshoeing required more skill than we expected. However, the scenery for every activity was stunning 
and definitely the star.

The outstanding scenery and unique landscapes which greet you at every turn. Whale watching was possibly the most exciting especially as it was on the last but one day of their season. The Humpbacks, Minkes and white nosed dolphins put on quite an active display  for us.

The trip to the wilderness cabin was great fun. Really enjoyable to be able to spend the night out there. Chopping wood, fetching water from the well and a 
traditional wood-fired sauna were all part of the fun. It was a fantastic week. Our guide, Janne, was great. He went the extra mile to adjust things to suit the mix of people on the tour and local conditions.

Winter family holiday in Slovakia, High Tatras





From

excluding flights

Full holiday details




Memorable parts?
The whole thing was excellent. My children loved learning to ski and the dog sledding, but I think my favorite was the winter walk on New Years day.
Tips?
Snow would probably be better during the February Half term - but if you want to book at Christmas it is still fantastic, you just might need to be more flexible.
Local benefits?
Slovakia is a fantastic destination, but it is not as well marketed as other countries. I feel that our visit supported our guide...
