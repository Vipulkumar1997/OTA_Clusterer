East

Cambridge, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Essex, the East of England provides a wide range of experiences ranging from home counties gentility to a glimpse of the coast in Essex.  Cambridge brings the kind of timeless elegance you would expect from an educational hub, while Bedfordshire makes you believe you’re a thousand miles from major cities despite its proximity to London.  As good fortune would have it, the variety of spas to visit in the East is equally diverse, perfect for all visitors and occasions.
