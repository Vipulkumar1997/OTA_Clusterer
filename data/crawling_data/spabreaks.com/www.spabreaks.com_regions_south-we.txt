South West

Home to some of the most picturesque landscapes and rugged
        coastlines in the UK, the South West of England is peppered
        with picturesque villages, historic castles and monuments,
        and breathtaking landscapes. From Wiltshire’s Stonehenge,
        to the Eden Project in Cornwall, there is plenty to see and
        lots of activities to enjoy amongst the rolling hills and
        the high seas of this beautiful part of the world.
