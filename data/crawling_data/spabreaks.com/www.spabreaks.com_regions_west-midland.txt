West Midlands

One of the West Midlands’ best known sons is arguably the
        most famous name in literature, so a visit to
        Stratford-Upon-Avon including The Royal Shakespeare Theatre
        is well worth the effort when you’re in this part of the
        world. However, that is only the tip of the iceberg in a
        region that flourished during the Industrial Revolution and
        today is home to a wealth of activities for the whole family
        to enjoy!
