North West

From Manchester to Merseyside, the Peak District to the
        Yorkshire Dales, the North West of England is characterised
        by dramatic landscapes and diverse cities that have attracted
        tourists in all their leisure and entertainment-seeking forms
        for years. North Wales remains a treasure trove of things to
        see and do in the castles, gardens, mountains and rivers it
        has to offer.
