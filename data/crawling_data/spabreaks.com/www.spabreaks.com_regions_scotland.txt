Scotland

Think of Scotland and thoughts of whisky, tartan, shortbread
        and some of the warmest welcomes around will not be too far
        behind. Throw in some of the country’s finest golf courses,
        breathtaking coastlines, interesting historical sites, and
        picture perfect shopping districts and you have a recipe for
        an unrivalled mini-break!
