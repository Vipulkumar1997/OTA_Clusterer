About Us

All that you need to know about us

Ranked number two in 2012's Fast Track 100 published by The Sunday
          Times, there are three things that separate Spabreaks.com from all
          other online spa booking experiences: product, people and pioneering
          ideas.  Operating in the UK and abroad, we offer low cost spa days
          and holidays for singletons, hen parties, groups and everyone in
          between as well as bootcamps, spa and theatre packages,
          recovery retreats, and special offers exclusive to our site!  So take
          a look around and find out which one suits you!








Who are we

Having first launched the website in 2001, Spabreaks.com is now the largest
            Spa Travel Company in the UK catering to every individual and eventuality.
            We also pride ourselves on a number of industry firsts, setting the bar that
            little bit higher and offering customers that little bit more.


Who you're talking to

Staff have first-hand experience of venues and between our phone lines (open
            Monday-Saturday) and our online service, customers can book 24 hours a day,
            seven days a week.


Competitions

As a little extra, we run regular competitions which have previously included a £2000
            makeover with a celebrity stylist; and a meet and greet with former X Factor winner,
            Shayne Ward … think of it as the proverbial chocolate on your hotel pillow.


The Hot Tub

Spreading our well-honed spa knowledge, our blog – The Hot Tub – is updated daily,
            alongside our Facebook page and Twitter feed.  Featuring reviews, health trends and
            interviews with the likes of Miss Piggy and Shayne Ward it proves that there is a lot
            to be said when it comes to health!

Famous friends

It's not just us who are fans of spas and Spabreaks.com in particular,
        here’s what a few of our friends have to say on the matter!




"I love the cucumber slices they put over moi's eyes. I have no
            idea why they do that, but it's nice to know that food can make you
            more beautiful. And if cucumbers are so great, imagine how much better
            you’d look with a box of bon-bons on your kisser?"

Miss Piggy






"If you're in a relationship, guys, believe me, you need to go to
            a spa!"

Shayne Ward,
Former X Factor Winner






"I am a huge spa day/break fan … I love it and feel it is
            something I can still enjoy so much despite my injury."

Claire Lomas,
Fundraiser







"It's important just to stop – some people are just go go go, but
            it's important to have time out … spas have a way of smelling nice and
            making you feel like ‘Yeah!"

Lemar,
Singer/Songwriter








Don't take our word for it!

Here's what are customers have to say about us




"I would definitely book through your company again, as the whole
              process was very straight forward and really well organised."

Carolyn
who went to St Mellons




"You were just the right balance of chatty and organized. I wish you
              could have continued to help me, as I felt you listened and
              understood my requirements."

Sonia
who went to The Belfry




"I would just like to say that the sales consultant at Spabreaks.com
              was incredibly helpful and could not do enough for me and left me
               with a really positive view on him and the company."

Pete




"I feel compelled to email you to say what a fantastic service I
              have received from one of your team.  I have had the pleasure of
              using your service on several occasions and on each occasion I have
              been blown away by her friendly "nothing is too much trouble"
              attitude."

Jayne,
who went to Bannatyne
              Hotel and Spa in Hastings East Sussex








A great partnership

This is what our partners say about working with us!




"I found the team exceptionally attentive and realised very quickly that
              there was no other spa provider for me to pursue. My business has
              increased by 126% in two months thanks to the specialised support and
              guidance offered by the senior Spabreaks.com team. It continues to be
              a pleasure to work with such a professional and well balanced company."

Simon Barker,

"De Vere Village have now been working with
                Spabreaks.com for over 16 months and in that time we have seen a huge
                impact in our business, the team are friendly, professional and always
                putting the needs of the customer first. Spabreaks.com are our leading
