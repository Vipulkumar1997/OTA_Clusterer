Ideas & Inspiration




Three's Company


We know that a spa experience for two can make for a very nice
            day or break, but sometimes three really is company! So we've put
            together a selection of spa packages for three, to make pampering
            with friends even easier!

Tribute and Party Nights


Looking for relaxation and excitement all rolled into one?
            Look no further with our Tribute and Party Nights offering you
            a range of classic shows including '80s revivals, Soul and Motown,
            comedy nights and more, and the best part is you can then relax
            and put your feet up in the spa to recover from all the dancing!

Group Spas


Whether it's a hen do, birthday celebration or just an excuse to get together for some quality
            time with your squad, our spa venues cater for groups of all shapes and sizes. Take a look here
            at our packages designed for groups of 6 or more including spa days and afternoon tea, movie
            nights in or party nights out.
