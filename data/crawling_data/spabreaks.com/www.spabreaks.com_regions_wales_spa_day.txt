Wales

From the remote beauty of the Brecon Beacons to its Celtic
        history and its rugged beaches and mountains, Wales is one
        of the UK’s most picturesque locations. Ideal for walking
        breaks and a chance to really and truly relax and unwind,
        it’s also filled with cultural attractions and a lively
        atmosphere in its cities, including Cardiff where retail
        therapy is very much on the agenda.
