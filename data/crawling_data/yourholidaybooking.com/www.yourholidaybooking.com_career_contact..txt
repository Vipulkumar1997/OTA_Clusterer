Testimonials

I have been a homeworker for the ‘Your Holiday Booking’ group of companies for nearly 20 years and have found their commercial deals with tour operators to be exceptional.

They also have a great administration and management team who work incredibly hard to ensure that any problems are dealt with immediately.

I have been lucky enough to attend Company Conferences all over the world and have greatly expanded my travel knowledge through these trips. In addition to conferences I have joined FAM trips to Dubai, Mauritius, Spain, New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Northern Cyprus, Dublin, Venice, Amsterdam, Cairns, Kos......and a few that I can’t remember......what a fantastic industry we work in!

I am based in Lanzarote and love the flexibility homeworking brings, working in the UK or Overseas – it works…!

I enjoy travelling to discover new places, for me the perfect holiday is staying in a location for 1-3 days then moving on. I love to travel like a local, seeking out the real destination, not just the tourist resorts. My experiences on my own holidays are passed onto my clients, which sometimes inspires them to booking similar holidays.

In 2014 I completed my first Ironman event, swimming 3.8km, cycling 180km then running a marathon of 42km to cross the finish line within 17 hours. At the time of making the decision to become an Ironman, I was just an average swimmer, who didn’t own a bike and hated running! It was quite a challenge and I learned that if I put my mind to something, I can do it.

I’m also a foodie, I love discovering new restaurants, my other hobbies include photography and social media. As you can see homeworking gives me the perfect work life balance, come and join me!

I have been in travel over 20 years, starting a local independent where I became a manager. I specialise mainly in the European market including extensive knowledge of our own product hotels in Greece and the canaries. I take care of my clients from the moment they enquire for a holiday until the day they return home. Being Independent gives me the flexibility to search for the right holiday, and being there when my clients need me including evenings & weekends. I receive round the clock support from my Management team which gives me the confidence to do my job knowing my bookings are in safe hands.
