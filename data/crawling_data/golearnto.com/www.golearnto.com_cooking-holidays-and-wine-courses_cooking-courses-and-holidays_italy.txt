Cooking Courses and Holidays in Italy




We’ve travelled across Italy from Veneto to Puglia to curate an eclectic mix of cookery holidays all taught by inspiring Chefs with a passion to share and a story to tell. 
Whether you’re looking to perfect your pasta making, how to cook a tip top tiramisu or merely aspire to the sybaritic pleasure of gathering fresh tomatoes from the garden and simmering them up into a sauce bursting with flavour, a cooking holiday in Italy with GoLearnTo.com lasts a lifetime.
"
We had a fantastic time. Very friendly, helpful and accommodating. We really felt part of Tuscan life and had fantastic advice of local places to visit and excellent restaurant/cafe recommendations. We loved the cooking and wine tasting and have brought back with us a wealth of knowledge we plan to share with others. Plus we'll be doing plenty of cooking for all our friends and family. Fantastic trip!

Buon appetito
Italians embrace food as an essential way of life: something to savour and to spend hours revelling in alongside good company and fantastic views.
Italian food is so much more than rich gelato, hearty pastas and savoury pizzas (though those are great, too).
Cooking holidays in Italy draw you into the depths of Italian flavours and the complexity of the dishes – and likewise the culture – proving why Italian food is the most-copied cuisine in the world.
Go learn to expand your knowledge of flavour combinations and allow your creativity to flourish, understand the elements of local ingredients and be daring and bold with them, and – most importantly – share stories and a glass of wine with other passionate cooks over a meal you’ve prepared together.
And with local chefs, fourth-generation cooks and Italian artisans showing you the way around the kitchen, you’ll return with new skills and satisfied tastebuds.
Where to experience cooking courses in Italy
Go just to explore one of Italy’s diverse regions, or combine your Italian cooking classes with another hobby or passion like painting, horse riding, hiking, yoga or learning to speak Italian.
Cook with a stunning view of the Bay of Naples on an Italian cookery course in Sorrento or discover the seat of the ancient Roman Empire with one-day Italian cooking classes in Rome.
Find the freshest ingredients in the enticing food markets of Bologna or learn to cook among the canals of Venice or the stunning villages near Lake Garda.
Or, traverse Italy’s most iconic food and wine regions.
In Tuscany, let the sun-baked hills and local Tuscan flavours inspire your creations (and wander the romantic streets of Florence while you’re at it!) or head to charming Puglia or Umbria to discover serene settings, regional delicacies and palate-pleasing local wine.
Cooking courses should always feel this inspiring.
Whatever your tastes, you can find a cookery holiday in Italy to indulge your inner chef and a group of like-minded people to experience it with. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our Italian cooking holiday guests?
Fervent foodies, beginners who struggle to roll fresh dough, lifelong chefs – everyone is welcome in the kitchens of our Italian cooking schools.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities on cooking holidays in Italy, from solo travellers to couples to friends. Some love local, seasonal food, others are simply looking for a getaway that blends relaxation with life-enhancing activities (and excellent meals).
All that’s required is a passion for food, a love of learning and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of cooking holidays in Italy are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
