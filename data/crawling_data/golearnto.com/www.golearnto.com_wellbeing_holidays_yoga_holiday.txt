Yoga Holidays




We’ve searched the globe to curate an eclectic mix of yoga holidays and yoga retreats which are relaxing and revitalising with inspiring teachers in glorious locations. For an innovative take on a yoga retreat, why not combine with Pilates, detox, weight loss, scuba diving, cooking, meditation, horse riding, painting, surfing and hiking for a holiday with a difference.

I now know what people mean when they say life changing as I too have experienced it at Jo's retreat. It's not a once in a lifetime experience as I will be back next year!

Stretch your perspectives
Yoga is about more than just poses and breaths.
It’s about expanding your mind and letting your tension go, challenging your body’s abilities, strength and flexibility while focusing only on the present moment, and – most importantly – sharing laughter, stories and a healthy meal after a rejuvenating yoga session together.
Hands-on yoga holidays let you experience all of that in breathtaking destinations around the world.
And with professional yoga instructors and lifelong yogis leading your practice in spots only locals could find, you’ll return with renewed energy and incredible memories.
Practise your vinyasa flow along the beautiful coast of Spain or in the sun-baked hilled of Italy, perfect your downward dog on yoga holidays in the tranquil French countryside or on the beaches of Greece, or go off-the-grid on an eco yoga retreat in Portugal.
Further afield, connect with slightly more exotic surroundings on a Turkey, Malta or Morocco yoga retreat, or escape to Thailand or Costa Rica and leave your worries thousands of miles behind.
Yoga holidays with a twist
If you’re looking to practice more than just yoga, combine your yoga holiday with another hobby or passion.
Trade your yoga mat for a surfboard on a surf and yoga retreat, or spend your morning in the studio and your afternoon in the saddle with yoga and horse riding. Mix in a touch of healthy eating on yoga and cooking holidays, or learn the Spanish for ‘extended triangle pose’ during a Spanish and yoga retreat.
For a more creative option, blend colours and poses with painting and yoga or find the perfect angle for your next headstand on yoga and photography holidays. Or to keep it all wellbeing-focused, simply add in some Pilates.
Wherever you roll out your mat, you can find yoga holidays that free your mind and help your stress fade alongside others who are passionate about yoga. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our yoga holiday guests?
Spiritual souls, those who can barely touch their toes, lifelong yogis – everyone is welcome in the studios and homes of our yoga retreat hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from solo travellers to couples to friends. Some are escaping the madness of their 9-to-5 lives, others are looking to reset their bodies or reach weight loss goals. Others still have never executed a Warrior II pose, while some just want a holiday with plenty of beach time, a bit of exercise and a glass of wine.
All that’s required is a passion for relaxation, a desire to be your best self and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of yoga holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
