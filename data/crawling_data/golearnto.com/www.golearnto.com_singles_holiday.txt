Singles holidays - bored of the usual solos holidays? Be inspired


































Singles Holidays


Solos holidays with
NO single supplements





We offer game-changing solo travel. You won’t find a tour bus, a cruise ship or a forced 'singles' excursion here. We offer the innovative, the magnificent, the inspirational. Holidays in anything from photography to cooking. Yoga to horse riding. Surf camps to jewellery making. Perfume making to painting and much more.

Our guests are solo travellers looking for something more. People in their 20's right through to their 70's. Those with enthusiasm for life who share a common interest. If you have a passion for travel and are intrigued, come join us for a holiday less ordinary.
Let's change the world of singles holidays forever.

What our solo guests say...




The holiday was really wonderful. Caroline and Adam are amazingly nice people who really care about their guests. They are experts in their field and impart their knowledge with patience, humor and flexibility. The welcoming, down to earth ambiance is more than relaxing - it's restorative. As a single traveller I was never made to feel uncomfortable or out of place. Without reservation I recommend this holiday.
L Jordan, UK:
Jewellery making and cooking holiday in France.






What an amazing week we all had! Well organised and professional, Julie and Kevin are to be congratulated for making 16 strangers into good friends in less than a week. The food was great, the sun shone and the accommodation is first class. Roll on next spring!
S Waterman, France:
Luxury boot camp and detox retreat in Spain.






I had a lovely time... I went by myself made great friends and did actually learn how to surf... which some people thought wouldn't happen!
