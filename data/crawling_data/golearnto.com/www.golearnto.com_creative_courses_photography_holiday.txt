The best week's holiday tuition course I have ever attended. Pam and Paul were outstanding hosts and tutors!

Photography holiday, France

I can't think how Alberto and Sue could have made this holiday any better. Perfectly organised; one-to-one tuition tailored to exactly what I wanted, excellent accommodation and meals; an ideal mixture of busy and relaxing.

Change your perspectives
Photography is about more than just having a camera.
It’s about expanding your focus and letting your creativity flourish, finding the perfect angles, subjects and light sources and willing to be daring and bold with them, and– most importantly – sharing laughter, feedback and a glass of wine with others after a day of shooting stunning locations together.
Hands-on photography holidays let you experience all of that in breathtaking destinations around the world.
And with professional, local photographers leading you off the tourist trail and helping you capture your holiday through a lens, you’ll return with new skills and one-of-a-kind photos.
Go learn to maximise various light sources on the sunny coast of Greece, get shutter-happy in the bustling medinas of Morocco or bask in long exposure of diverse jungle life and quick pace action shots while on photographic holidays in Costa Rica.
Set up your tripod in the fresh air of France’s countryside, record every pixel of the mountains, hills and sea in Spain, or point your camera at eccentric street life, world-class architecture and spectacular landscapes on photography holidays in Italy.
Photography holidays with another angle
Experience the moments you’re capturing by combining your photography courses with another hobby or passion.
Learn the Spanish for ‘snapshot’ on language and photography holidays in Spain. Focus your mornings on yoga breaths and your afternoons on new subject matter on yoga and photographic holidays.
Take action photos from your surfboard on photography and surfing holidays Costa Rica. Or plate a delicious meal and then frame it in the perfect shot on cooking and photography courses in Morocco.
Wherever you point your camera, you can find photography holidays that free your creative side and indulge your inner artist alongside other passionate photographers. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our photography holiday guests?
Expressive souls, beginners with their first digital camera, experienced DSLR photographers – everyone is welcome in the darkrooms of our photography holiday hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from solo travellers to couples to friends. Some have built careers around photography, others are keen to escape the 9-to-5 and spend time doing their favourite hobby.
All that’s required is a passion for creativity, a desire to learn and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of photography holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
