Location overview
Set in the heart of Gascony in SW France, this 19th Century farmhouse is surrounded by 50 acres of private unspoilt meadows. Although this is a rural retreat with fresh organic farmers' produce all around, the bustling picturesque towns of Nérac and Condom are close by. This is the perfect location for a fun relaxing holiday experience.
