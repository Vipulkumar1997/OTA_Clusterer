Wine courses and wine tasting holidays in France and Italy


































Wine Courses




We love wine. No question. Red, white, rose and sparkling, we want to try them all. Never will we utter
‘Don’t open a bottle on my account’
or,
‘I couldn’t possibly taste another Bordeaux.’

"
Thoroughly enjoyed this experience. Our teacher was wonderful and entertaining and very knowledgeable. I learned a lot about Barcelona and the market and Catalan culture and had fun too. Highly recommend this.

We love wine holidays
We love wine. We love learning about how our wine is made, from grape to bottle and we love it even more when our guests come back from our wine tasting courses having discovered the real taste of a place.
We’ve searched the globe to curate an eclectic mix of wine holidays that are as magnificent as the people that go on them and the people who host them.
Sommeliers who inspire. Sommeliers who can make a meal by matching it with wine. Wine producers who a story to tell and a passion to share.
Taste delectable wines from France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Go learn to match wine with cheese. Discover the growing process and learn how wine is made from vine to bottle.
For the more adventurous wine tasters, combine horse riding with wine tasting. Olive oil sampling with wine tasting.  Cooking lessons and wine pairings and of course, the ultimate twinning of wine and cheese.
Go. Try a wine tasting course that will grab you by the taste buds and jolt your senses.
This
is what a wine tasting holiday should feel like.
Who are our wine holiday guests?
Solo travellers. Friends. Couples.  Fathers and sons. Mothers and daughters. Those with enthusiasm and a love of fine wines. Interesting types. People who love to learn. People of all ages and nationalities who refuse to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our wine tasting holidays last a lifetime. Come and join them.
What do our guests think?
It’s not the done thing to boast. So you won’t find us crowing about how amazing the wine is. Nor how good the sommeliers are, or the fact that the accommodation is pleasingly comfortable and characterful and the company wonderfully convivial. We prefer to let our guests do the talking.

The instructor, Lionel, was amazing.  He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and fun!

If I could give a 10 star I would! From the first time that I arrived I was made to feel at home. I went only knowing wines that cost no more that €2, that has now changed for the good as now I understand what a wine is all about and the understanding of what you should be looking for in a good wine.
