What our guests had to say…

Georgia from London, UK, travelled September 2016, said:

“My holiday was fantastic. I don’t think I have ever felt as healthy, relaxed and in tune with myself as the week I spent here. The team are lovely and knowledgeable and the level of tuition is unbeatable. The island and town itself have interesting places to visit and great restaurants.”

“All teachers were excellent and I have truly enjoyed every lesson. Food was also excellent and the talk given by Jo very informative and helpful. All your staff ( teachers, kitchen staff, cleaners, drivers) are very polite, kind and helpful. It is obvious that they like working and it creates relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Congratulations.”

You can find Meghan living in London, drinking American coffee and eating any Thai food or sushi you put in front of her. Hailing from the barren, snowy lands of North Dakota (that's just north of South Dakota), she still calls the pavement a 'sidewalk,' and constantly gets mistaken for a Canadian because of her Midwestern accent.
