Learn Spanish in Spain




We’ve travelled across Spain from San Sebastian to Valencia to curate an eclectic mix of Spanish language holidays that are as magnificent as the people that go on them and the linguists who teach them. For a quirky take on a Spanish course, why not combine Spanish lessons with yoga, horse riding, cooking, tango dancing, flamenco or surfing? This is what a Spanish language course should feel like.
"
I had a wonderful time in Valencia. I was extremely nervous being 60+ with all the students in my class under 25 yrs but was very motivated, was pleased with my listening skills and, at A1 level, happy with how far I went in a week. Would love longer if work permitted!

Habla Español

Spanish and English share around 2,000 similar words, making it one of the easiest foreign languages to learn for English speakers.
And what better place to learn Spanish than where this romance language began?
Spain – with its wild beauty and diverse cultural regions is ripe for exploration. And with a Spanish course equipping you with lingo, the locals will (almost) think you’re one of them.
Learning Spanish in Spain means challenging your mind, embracing the nuances of a new culture and language and being willing to make mistakes. And – most importantly – it’s about sharing laughter, conversation and a glass of wine with other students and locals – without the stuffy classrooms or piles of homework.
And with professional tutors, local teachers and native speakers helping you perfect your pronunciation, you’ll return with a broader vocabulary and worldview.
Where to learn Spanish in Spain
Go just to explore one of Spain’s diverse regions, or combine your Spanish courses with another hobby or passion like photography, dance, surfing, cooking, horseriding or kitesurfing.
Learn the Spanish for ‘hang ten’ while surfing the big ones in laid-back Fuerteventura, San Sebastian or Nerja. Put on your dancing shoes and say ‘bailamos’ in Seville. Practice rolling your r’s in the quiet Andalusian countryside.
Wander the enticing cities of Granada or Valencia or converse over tapas in the bustling centres of Barcelona or Madrid. Taste a perfect paella in Salamanca or party all night in Ibiza, waking just in time for your morning Spanish lesson.
Spanish immersion holidays
To accelerate your learning, try a full Spanish immersion holiday. Move in with your teacher for a week and become part of the family. Speak the local language from the moment you wake until you’re dreaming in it, too.
You’ll see the results: a one-week Spanish immersion holiday equips you with as much language learning as four weeks in a classroom at home.
Learning Spanish should always feel this natural.
Whatever you choose, you can find Spanish holidays in Spain that expand your mind and indulge your inner linguist alongside other passionate students. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our Spanish language holiday guests
Keen linguists, beginners who’ve never uttered more than ‘hola’, multilingual speakers – everyone is welcome in the classrooms of our Spanish language schools.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from singles to couples to groups of friends. Some have spoken Spanish all their lives, while others just want to escape traditional classroom settings and inspire their minds.
All that’s required is a passion for learning and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of Spanish language holidays in Spain are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
