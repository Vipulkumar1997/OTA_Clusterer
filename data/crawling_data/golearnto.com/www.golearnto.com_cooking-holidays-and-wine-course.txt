Dishing up new flavours and experiences
Get ready to roll up your sleeves, tie on your apron and absorb the delicious aromas, textures and flavours of a new local cuisine.
Our hands-on cooking holidays drop you right in the action – here, Michelin-starred chefs teach you to prepare 5-course meals, fourth-generation cooks share their secret family recipes and local chefs help you select the freshest ingredients from the village market.
Go learn to properly knead pizza and pasta dough in Italy, fillet freshly-caught fish in Greece, create locally-sourced paella and tapas in Spain, sip regional wine over duck confit on a cooking holiday in France, or incorporate more exotic recipes in far-off Thailand or Mexico.
Sharpen your knife skills, refine your patisserie baking or take part in the olive harvest. Learn the art of butchery, cheese making, wine aging and more. Or simply add to your repertoire of recipes – be they vegetarian, gluten free, meat-loving or something else.
Whatever your tastes, you can find a cookery holiday to indulge your inner chef and a group of like-minded people to experience it with. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our cooking holiday guests?
Self-proclaimed foodies, beginners who struggle to boil an egg, lifelong chefs – everyone is welcome in the kitchens of our cooking schools.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, travelling solo, as part of a couple and with friends. Some love local, seasonal food, others are partial to a good glass of wine (or three).
All that’s required is a passion for food, a love of learning and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of cookery holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
