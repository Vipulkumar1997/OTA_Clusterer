Singles language holidays in France, Italy, Spain & more


































Singles Language Holidays




We don’t do the usual solos language courses. We don’t do stuffy classrooms. We don’t do uninspiring teachers. We don’t do the tourist trail.  Instead, we offer the innovative, the magnificent, the inspirational. Want to speak like a local but don’t fancy spending your holiday stuck in a classroom? Combine lessons with activities; surfing, yoga, dancing, cooking, horseriding and the chance to hang out with locals. Now you’re talking.
"
I would highly recommend this holiday, not only did I learn so so much but I also made new friends and was introduced by locals to an absolutely wonderful city. An amazing adventure, I would recommend it to anyone :)

Wonderful holiday from start to finish; one week was just not long enough. Trip advice and support from golearnto staff excellent, school first class and lady I stayed with in Paris first rate. Thoroughly enjoyed whole stay; will be going again and hopefully for a longer stay next time.
