Cooking Courses and Holidays




Virginia Woolf had the right idea when she said 'One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well'. We love food and we love it when our guests come back from our cooking holidays excited about their culinary future.
"
An all round great experience learning the cuisine within its context. The open air kitchen has an amazing view over the valley to the mountains beyond. The village is safe and charming. Everything is cooked from scratch using local produce bought that day in the market. Loved it!

Uncover the real taste for a place
Cooking is about more than just food.
It’s about stretching your knowledge of flavour combinations and allowing creativity to flourish, understanding the complexity of local ingredients and being daring and bold with them, and -- most importantly -- sharing a laugh and a glass of wine with others over a meal you’ve prepared together.
Hands-on cooking holidays let you experience all of that in breathtaking destinations around the world.
And with Michelin-starred chefs, fourth-generation cooks and local artisans showing you the way around the kitchen, you’ll return with new skills and satisfied tastebuds.
Go learn to flambé, sauté and purée in the charming French countryside, try your hand at tapas on cooking holidays in Spain’s majestic Pyrenees or use the day’s freshest catch in your Mediterranean meals while on Greece’s coast.
Spend your cooking holiday in Italy’s Tuscan hills rolling out traditional pizza and pasta dough, or add exotic dishes to your repertoire in beachy Thailand or fiery Mexico.
A la carte cooking courses
If you’re looking to sharpen more than just your knife skills, combine your cookery courses with another hobby or passion. Spend the morning in the saddle and the evening in an apron on a horse riding and cooking holiday.
Perfect your downward dog and your baking ratios on cooking and yoga retreats. Or improve two arts during painting and cooking holidays or language and cooking experiences.
Whatever your tastes, you can find a cookery holiday to indulge your inner chef and a group of like-minded people to experience it with. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our cooking holiday guests?
Lifelong chefs, beginners who struggle to chop an onion, fervent foodies – everyone is welcome in the kitchens of our cooking schools.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from solo travellers to couples to friends. Some love local, seasonal food, others are simply looking for a getaway that mixes relaxation with life-enhancing activities.
All that’s required is a passion for food, a love of learning and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of cookery holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
