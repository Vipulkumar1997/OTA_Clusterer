Learn Italian in Italy




Italian. Ti amo! A romantic language. Music to our ears. Rub shoulders with the locals and pick up vocabulary in cafes and squares, in art galleries, museums, at local markets and while choosing which flavour of gelato to devour.
This
is what a Italian language course should feel like.
"
It has been a great experience; the host family was very welcoming and made me feel at home, needles to say the food was incredible. At the school classes were well organised, teacher explained well. The cooking classes were a pleasure.

Parla Italiano
Italian and English share similar Latin roots (and multiple similar words), making it a great language to learn for English speakers.
And what better place to learn Italian than where this Romance language began?
Italy – with its rustic charm and diverse regions – is bursting with culture awaiting discovery. And with an Italian language course equipping you with lingo, the locals will (almost) think you’re one of them.
Learning Italian in Italy means embracing the nuances of a new language and culture, challenging your mind and being willing to make mistakes. Most importantly, it’s about sharing laughter, conversation and a glass of wine or a cappuccino with other students and locals – without the stuffy classrooms or piles of homework.
And with native speakers, professional Italian tutors and local teachers helping you perfect your pronunciation, you’ll return with a broader worldview and vocabulary.
Where to learn Italian in Italy
Go just to explore one of Italy’s diverse regions, or combine your Italian language courses with a cooking or wellness experience.
Discover the stunning Italian Riviera during an Italian course in Sorrento or roam the sun-baked hills of Tuscany. Wander the art-filled, romantic streets of Florence or explore the seat of the ancient Roman Empire -- Rome.
Trade your books for an apron and whip up some pizza, pasta and other classic Italian dishes during an Italian and cooking holiday, or spend your mornings in the classroom and your afternoon at the spa on an Italian and wellness retreat.
Italian immersion courses
To accelerate your learning, try a full Italian immersion holiday. Move in with your teacher for a week and become part of the family. Speak the local language from the moment you wake until you’re dreaming in it, too.
You’ll see the results: a one-week Italian immersion course equips you with as much language learning as four weeks in a classroom at home.
Learning Italian should always feel this natural.
Whatever you choose, you can find Italian courses in Italy that expand your mind and indulge your inner linguist alongside other passionate students. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our Italian language course guests?
Keen linguists, beginners who’ve never uttered more than ‘ciao’, multilingual speakers – everyone is welcome in the classrooms of our Italian language schools.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from singles to couples to groups of friends. Some have spoken Italian all their lives and want to brush up on their skills, while others just want to escape traditional classroom settings and inspire their minds.
All that’s required is a passion for learning, a desire to see Italy and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of Italian courses in Italy are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
