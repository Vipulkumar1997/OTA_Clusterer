Learn Spanish




We’ve searched the Spanish speaking globe to curate an eclectic mix of Spanish language holidays to inspire. Rub shoulders with the locals and pick up vocabulary in cafes and squares, at the beach, the local markets, in museums, art galleries and while tasting some local tapas.
This
is what a Spanish language course should feel like.

Absolutely one of the best vacations I've ever taken. I love traveling alone and this was certainly top notch. Definitely left feeling like I got every penny worth. The staff and teachers were super accommodating and helpful and extremely knowledgeable. Props to Tanner and all the instructors!

Now you’re talking
Learning Spanish is so much more than just vocabulary and grammar.
It’s about challenging your mind and embracing the language of a new culture, leaving no verbs, adjectives or gerunds unspoken even if you make mistakes, and – most importantly – sharing laughter, conversation and a glass of wine with other students after class before exploring the local area together.
Hands-on Spanish holidays let you experience all of that in breathtaking destinations around the world – without the stuffy classrooms or piles of homework.
And with professional tutors, native speakers and local teachers helping you perfect your pronunciation, you’ll return with useful skills and a broader worldview.
Head to the origin of the Spanish speaking world and learn Spanish in Spain. From the relaxed islands of Fuerteventura or Ibiza to bustling Barcelona or Madrid to serene Andalucia or scenic Granada or San Sebastian, you can discover the nuances of every corner of this diverse country.
Go farther afield and master the local lingo of tropical Costa Rica or the Dominican Republic on multi-activity Spanish holidays. Or practice rolling your r’s in fiery Buenos Aires or beautiful Ecuador.
Spanish holidays with added flair
If you’re looking to combine more than your verb tenses, add another hobby or passion to your Spanish courses.
Trade your pencil for a spatula on a cooking and Spanish language holiday, or spend your morning on the waves and your afternoon learning how to say ‘hang ten’ en Espanol with a Spanish and surf retreat.
Volunteer with children, learn the steps of a passionate tango, learn to windsurf or kitesurf, practice your yoga poses or work on your camera angles with multiple activities that can be combined with learning Spanish.
Whatever you choose, you can find Spanish holidays that expand your mind and indulge your inner linguist alongside other passionate students. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our Spanish language holiday guests?
Keen linguists, beginners who’ve never uttered more than ‘hola’, multilingual speakers – everyone is welcome in the classrooms of our Spanish holiday hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities in Spanish language courses with singles, couples and groups of friends. Some have spoken Spanish all their lives, while others just want to escape traditional classroom settings and inspire their minds.
All that’s required is a passion for learning, a willingness to boldly try something new and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of Spanish language holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
