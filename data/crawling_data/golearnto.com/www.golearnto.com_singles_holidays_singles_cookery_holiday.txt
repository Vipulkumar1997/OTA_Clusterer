Singles cookery holidays in France, Italy, Spain, Greece & more


































Singles Cookery Holidays




We’ve eaten our way around the globe to curate an eclectic mix of cooking holidays that are as magnificent as the singles that go on them. You can learn anything from knife skills to foraging. Patisserie to pizza making. Butchery to raw food. Olive harvesting to pasta making. Mussel harvesting to paella. Go, take in every sight, sound and smell like a greedy child.
This
is what cookery holidays should taste like.

From start to finish the host Rita and her partner Alex could not have made me more welcome. Location was stunning, lessons fantastic and the wine glass never empty. Thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend.

Who are our cooking holiday guests?
Independent travellers. Those with enthusiasm and a love of local, seasonal food. Beginners who struggle to boil an egg to more advanced cooks. Interesting types. The culinary-minded who love to learn. Those partial to a good glass of wine or three. People of all ages and nationalities who refuse to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
What do our guests think?
It’s not the done thing to boast. So you won’t find us crowing about how amazing our Chefs are. Nor how good our service is, or the fact that the accommodation is wonderfully comfortable and characterful, the food delicious and the wines delectable. Mum’s the word. We prefer to let our guests do the talking.

I had a fantastic week at the Odyssey, and would not hesitate to recommend this cooking week to anybody. Great food, sublime weather and extremely hospitable people.
