Pilates holidays & retreats in inspiring places


































Pilates Holidays




Thank you Mr Joseph Pilates for inventing the truly wonderful thing that is Pilates. Anything that aims to develop a leaner, suppler, toned body along with a calmer, more relaxed mind works for us. We’ve searched the globe to curate an eclectic mix of Pilates retreats with inspiring teachers to relax, revive and restore. For an inspiring take on a Pilates holiday why not combine it with yoga, boot camp fitness or personal stylist sessions?
"
Beautiful venue, amazing food, fantastic teachers and wonderful caring staff. I had a wonderful holiday just for me and I felt very self indulgent which was exactly what I needed.

Refresh your routine
Pilates is about more than just core and muscle strength.
It’s about finding the limits of your willpower and pushing beyond them, seeking calm and focus in the midst of distractions, reshaping your body’s idea of fitness, and -- most importantly -- sharing laughter, successes and failures over a glass of wine with others after a revitalising session on the mat.
Hands-on Pilates holidays and Pilates reformer retreats let you experience all of that in breathtaking destinations around the world.
And with professional teachers, local instructors and lifelong practitioners leading your Pilates classes in locations only locals know about, you’ll return with renewed energy and incredible memories.
Tone your body overlooking the sea on Pilates reformer holidays on the exotic islands of Thailand. Combine yoga and Pilates with plenty of relaxation -- or a luxury bootcamp holiday -- by the coast in Spain. Or, head to France’s stunning countryside to get away from the stress of daily life on a Pilates retreat in the serene Dordogne region.
Pilates holidays with a twist
If you’re looking to improve your overall wellbeing, combine your Pilates classes abroad with another wellness-focused passion.
Work on your strength and your flexibility with yoga and Pilates holidays. To calm your mind, add some meditation to the mix as well. Or enhance your routine with several types of exercise on a luxury boot camp holiday or fitness and Pilates retreat.
Wherever you choose to roll out your mat, you can find Pilates holidays that equally energise your body and relax your mind alongside others who are passionate about Pilates, too. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our Pilates retreat guests?
From those who can barely touch their toes to lifelong Pilates students – everyone is welcome in the studios of our Pilates holiday hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from solo travellers to couples to friends. Some are escaping their 9-to-5 lives for a bit, others are looking to reach weight loss goals or simply reset their bodies.
Others still have never executed a Pilates reformer pose, while some just want a holiday with plenty of beach time, a bit of exercise and a glass of wine.
All that’s required is a passion for relaxation, a desire to be your best self and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of Pilates holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
