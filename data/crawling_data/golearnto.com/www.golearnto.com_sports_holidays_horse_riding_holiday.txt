Horse riding holidays in Spain, Portugal, Italy & Morocco


































Horse Riding Holidays




Explore the world on horseback. Trot, canter and gallop across deserted beaches, through pinewood forests, over breath taking mountains. We've searched the globe to curate an exhilarating collection of horse riding holidays that are as magnificent as the people who go on them and the riding instructors that host them.  For an innovative take on a horse riding holiday, why not combine it with wine tasting, Spanish lessons, yoga, cooking classes or spa treatments?
"
Booked at short notice, but all the service was provided - it was fantastic! The horse riding was great - the horses cater for all levels and are in great condition. The route and food were fantastic, as were the guide and the group. Just what we needed!

Horse riding adventure in Essaouira, Morocco
Such an amazing trip, with memories I'll treasure forever. Fantastic accommodation, food, company and the horses and scenery were just fantastic. Highly recommended.

Unbridle your free spirit

Horse riding is about more than just the horses.
It’s about embracing your spirit for adventure and freedom, learning to handle and trust your horse and earn its trust in return, and -- most importantly -- swapping laughter and stories over a campfire or a glass of wine after a day of horse trekking through incredible surroundings together.
Hands-on horse riding holidays let you experience all of that in breathtaking destinations around the world.
And with professional equestrians, lifelong riders and local guides sharing their knowledge of the best trails and techniques, you’ll return with new skills and one-of-a-kind memories.
Go learn to ride a horse through the sun-baked Tuscan countryside, work and live on a ranch while horse riding in Spain’s Sierra Nevada mountain range, or canter through private chateaux estates in Dordogne, France.
Gallop over the Moroccan sands while horse riding on the beach, discover quaint villages and untouched trails horse riding in Portugal’s countryside, or trot further afield in the Costa Rican rainforest.
Horse riding holidays with added fun
If you’re champing at the bit to experience more than just horse riding, combine your riding holiday with another hobby or passion.
Trade your stirrups for a spatula on a cooking and horse riding holiday, or spend your mornings in the saddle and your evenings stretching your sore muscles on yoga and horse trekking holidays.
If you want to test your mental and physical limits, pepper your horse riding holidays with some Spanish lessons.
Whatever your hopes, you can find horse riding holidays that indulge your inner equestrian alongside other passionate riders. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our horse riding holiday guests?
Canter, trot, gallop, from the saddle, in the saddle, horseback, stirrups, giddy-up, unbridled, chomping at the bit, rein in, skittish, harness, blaze your own trail
Equine lovers, beginners who have never mounted a horse before, experienced riders – everyone is welcome in the schools and ranches of our horse riding holiday hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages from around the world, from solo travellers to couples to groups of friends. Some have ridden all their lives, while others are keen to test the therapeutic promises that horse riding can bring (and escape their 9-to-5 lives).
All that’s required is a thirst for adventure, a desire to learn and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of horse riding holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
