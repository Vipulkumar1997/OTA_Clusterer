Cooking Courses and Holidays in Spain




We’ve travelled across Spain from Barcelona to Seville to curate an eclectic mix of cookery holidays all taught by inspiring Chefs with a passion to share and a story to tell. 
Whether you’re looking to perfect your paella, how to cook a delicious plate of gambas or merely aspire to the sybaritic pleasure of picking fresh tomatoes and blitzing them into a gazpacho bursting with flavour, a cooking holiday in Spain with GoLearnTo.com lasts a lifetime.

Clive and Maki were fantastic. They made us feel really welcomed and were very hospitable throughout our stay with tips on what to see and where to go. The cooking lessons were great - Clive is a font of all knowledge! It is definitely worth going on the olive oil and fino tasting if you can.

Buen provecho
The Spanish embrace food as a way of life: something to savour and to spend hours revelling in alongside good company, late into the evening.
Spanish food is so much more than paella, tapas and sangria (though those are great, too).
A cooking holiday in Spain draws you into the depths of Spain’s flavours and the complexity of its dishes – and likewise its culture – convincing you that it stands equal to its more popular Italian and French neighbours.
Go learn to expand your knowledge of Spanish flavour combinations and allow your creativity to flourish, understand the complexity of local ingredients and be daring and bold with them, and – most importantly – share stories and a glass of wine with other passionate cooks over a meal you’ve prepared together.
And with fourth-generation cooks, lifelong Spanish chefs and local artisans showing you the way around the kitchen, you’ll return with new skills and satisfied tastebuds.
Where to experience cooking holidays in Spain
Go just to explore one of Spain’s diverse regions, or combine your Spanish cooking courses with another hobby or passion like horse riding, wine tasting or learning to speak Spanish.
Find the freshest ingredients in the enticing food markets of Barcelona on a one-day cooking class or learn the nuances and distinct regional flavours of Basque cooking during a weeklong stay along the alluring Spanish coast in San Sebastian.
Take to saddle before hitting the kitchen in the infamous Andalucian hills on a horse riding and cookery holiday in Iznajar. Or, wander the romantic, historic streets of Granada on a Spanish language and cookery course in this iconic Spanish city.
Cooking courses should always feel this inspiring.
Who are our Spanish cooking holiday guests?
Fervent foodies, beginners who struggle to boil an egg, lifelong chefs – everyone is welcome in the kitchens of our Spanish cooking schools.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities on Spanish cookery courses, from solo travellers to couples to friends. Some love local, seasonal food, others are simply looking for a getaway that mixes relaxation with life-enhancing activities (and excellent meals).
All that’s required is a passion for food, a love of learning and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of cooking holidays in Spain are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
