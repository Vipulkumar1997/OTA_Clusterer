Feel the rush
We love sport. We love an adrenaline rush. We live for the thrill of it. You won’t hear us complaining about getting up at sunrise to surf the morning waves or cleaning the sand from our saddle after an adrenaline-charged gallop on horseback along the beach.
We’ve travelled the globe to curate an eclectic mix of exhilarating and revitalising sports holidays. From Zumba and fitness holidays in France to surf and yoga in Morocco. Surfing the big ones in Biarritz to horseriding and wine tasting in Bordeaux. Scuba diving in Dahab to sailing the Whitsundays in Australia.  For a quirky take on a sports holiday, try a macho gladiator fighting course in Rome or learn how to ride horses like a cowboy in Australia.
Accommodation ranges from sociable, eco-friendly camps to luxurious hotels for the more discerning sports enthusiast. Whatever your comfort level, we’ve got the place for you.
From Portugal to Australia. National parks in Spain to surf beaches in Morocco. From the dive paradise that is Dahab to the shabby-chic of Biarritz.   Wherever you choose, we’ll get you away from everything except for your passion for sport.
And, for an innovative take on a sports break, combine scuba diving with yoga, boot camp fitness with Pilates, horseriding with yoga, surf and yoga and more.
Who are our sports holiday guests?
Active types, beginners who’ve never ridden before, adrenaline junkies -- everyone is welcome in the schools of our sports hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from solo travellers to couples to friends. Some want to escape the confines of their 9-to-5 jobs, others devote their lives to active pursuits. Others still have never seen the ocean, much less surfed it, while some just want to prove that they can do whatever they set their mind to.
All that’s required is an abundance of energy, a zest for life and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of sports and active holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
