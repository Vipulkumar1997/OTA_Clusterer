Learn to talk the talk
Get ready to roll your r’s, order coffee in a foreign tongue and immerse yourself in cultures and languages that transform you into a multilingual storyteller.
Our immersive language courses put you at the heart of the action – here, stuffy classrooms and piles of homework are replaced with inspiring settings, mealtime chats with your host family and real-life vocabulary lessons as you rub shoulders with locals in squares, cinemas, museums, markets, cafes and bars.
For added flair, you can even combine language lessons with local activities.
Concoct pasta dishes with a side serving of Italian lessons in Tuscany. Learn Spanish for ‘hang ten’ while surfing the big ones in Fuerteventura or San Sebastian. Put on your dancing shoes and say ‘bailamos’ in Buenos Aires or Seville.
Sip wine and nibble cheese as you learn French in France, cook a tasty tagine on your Arabic course, or capture Costa Rica through a lens while you take on Spanish and photography before challenging your body and mind with a Spanish and yoga holiday.
To accelerate your learning, try a full immersion holiday. Move in with your teacher for a week and become part of the family. Speak the local language from the moment you wake until you’re dreaming in it, too.
You’ll see the results: a one-week language immersion holiday equips you with as much language learning as four weeks in a classroom at home.
Language learning should always feel this natural.
Whatever your goals, you can find a language course to indulge your inner linguist, as well as a group of passionate learners to experience it with. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our language holiday guests?
Complete beginners, fluent speakers, inquisitive minds – everyone is welcome in the classrooms of our language schools.
You’ll meet people of all ages from around the globe, travelling solo or with friends. Some love culture and know language is the key to unlocking it, others are professional singles looking to get a leg up in business. Others still are university students needing to pass their exams or expats brushing up on their skills.
All that’s required is a desire to learn and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of language courses are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
