Singles Creative Holidays




We’ve travelled the globe to seek out the quirky, the rare, the ultimate escape and the inspiration for a singles creative holiday that will last a lifetime. From photography to painting. Jewellery making to Flamenco dancing. Mosaic making to belly dancing. The seductive tango to the firey rhythms of the Flamenco guitar. For an inspiring take on a creative holiday, why not combine photography with surf, jewellery making with cooking, painting with yoga and more.
"
Barbara's painting course was fantastic! The course was great, Barb really helped me improve my painting with her intuitive, informal teaching style. Paleros was magic - my hosts shared real village life and showed me a truly lovely part of the world. I've come home with new skills and new friends.

Game changing singles creative holidays
We offer game-changing solos creative holidays. We don’t do contrived. We don’t do manufactured excursions. We do the tourist trail. Instead, we offer the innovative, the magnificent, the inspirational.
We love a great photo. We love to dance. Music is our passion. We love to paint, to draw, to daub and wield a palette knife. We love crafts and we love creating something new.
Surround yourself with light, colour and striking scenery guaranteed to inspire. From the rural idyll of the Dordogne to the beaches of Andalucía. Tuscany to Turkey. From the colourful medinas of Morocco to the tropical rainforests of Costa Rica and more.
If the sparse side of solos creative holidays doesn’t appeal, you’ll be pleased to hear that our accommodation ranges from luxury countryside retreats to quirky artistic lodges. Singles can share a room or pay extra for a private room.
Who are our creative holidays guests?
Solo travellers. Inspiring people. Frustrated creatives keen to escape the 9-5. Enthusiastic, sociable types. Beginners to the more advanced. People of all ages and nationalities who refused to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
What our guests say...

I feel a very luck girl to have experienced the sights and sounds of Essaouira as well as receiving the coaching from Darren to be able to record this with my photography. His local knowledge and technical skills are excellent. There was more information than I could take in - homework for me.
