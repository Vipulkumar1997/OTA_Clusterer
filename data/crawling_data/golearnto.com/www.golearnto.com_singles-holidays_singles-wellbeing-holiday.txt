Singles Wellbeing Holidays




We’ve searched the globe to curate an eclectic mix of singles wellbeing holidays which are indulgent, relaxing and revitalising. From rejuvenating yoga to a purifying detox. Uplifting
Pilates
reformer sessions to luxury boot camps. From raw food retreats to the 'I just want a bit of yoga, beach time and a glass of wine' holidays. For an innovative take on a wellbeing holiday, combine
yoga with surfing
, boot camp fitness with personal styling sessions,
yoga plus horse riding
and more.

Excellent experience. Nikki tailored the learning specifically around me so I had a great introduction to many areas including meditation and the Chakra's. I was made to feel very welcome in the hosts home and enjoyed delicious home cooked veggie dinners.

Game changing solos wellbeing holidays
We offer game-changing solos wellbeing holidays. The innovative, the magnificent, the inspirational. From Thailand to Turkey. Rural Spain to balmy beach-side yoga retreats. From mountain-side retreats in Italy to the warm seas of Dahab. Whatever you choose, we’ll get you away from everything except your passion for wellbeing.
If the sparse side of solos wellbeing holidays doesn’t appeal, you’ll be pleased to hear that our accommodation ranges from luxury countryside retreats to quirky beach lodges and all offer enticing levels of comfort and character. Solos can choose to share a room or can pay extra for a private single room. Many holidays have private single rooms for no additional cost.
Who are our singles wellbeing holidays guests?
Independent travellers. Inspiring types. Singles with enthusiasm and an unquenchable thirst for living life to the full.  People of all ages and nationalities who refused to be boxed in. People from their late 20's to 50's and beyond.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of independent travellers have already discovered that our wellbeing holidays last a lifetime. Come and join them.
What our guests say...
It’s not the done thing to boast. So you won’t find us crowing about how amazing our singles wellbeing holidays are. Nor how good our service is, or the fact that our tutors are inspiring, the massages blissful, the food delicious, the accommodation wonderfully comfortable and how infectious the laughter is. Mum’s the word. We prefer to let our guests do the talking.

It was the most amazing holiday. The training was hard, but the encouragement we received was superb. Would definitely go again. Try it, you may surprise yourself.
