I really enjoyed my painting holiday at la Salle, St Puy. The hosts could not have been more welcoming and helpful, the house is beautiful and the food delicious. The learning experience, with the tutor was excellent - my aim was to improve my range of painting skills and I felt I achieved my aim. I am hoping to return next year and would not hesitate to recommend this course to people of all painting abilities.

Create your next masterpiece
Painting is about more than just colour.
It’s about expanding your techniques and letting your creativity flourish, intertwining mediums, motifs and styles and willing to be daring and bold with them, and -- most importantly -- sharing laughter, feedback and a glass of wine with others after a day of capturing incredible surroundings together.
Hands-on art and painting holidays let you experiment with all of that in any medium -- from watercolour painting, acrylics and oil paints to pastels, pencils and more -- in breathtaking destinations around the world.
And with professional artists, lifelong painters and local artists helping you as you fill your canvas, you’ll return with new skills and one-of-a-kind souvenirs.
Go learn to paint the contrasting landscapes of the mountains, hills and coasts of Spain, find the perfect light source along the beaches of Greece or wield your palette knife under the sunny skies of Cyprus.
Spend your painting holidays in Italy interpreting eccentric street life, world-class architecture and captivating scenery or sketch and paint en plein air in the rolling French countryside. Sit, scrutinise and appreciate the view for longer than it takes to snap a photo.
Painting holidays with added flair
If you’re looking to mix more than your paint colours, combine your painting courses with another hobby or passion.
Trade your paint brush for a spatula on a cooking and painting holiday, or spend your morning perfecting your downward dog and your afternoon working on your brush strokes on painting and yoga retreats.
If you’re an all-round artist, pack your pencil case and your paint set for a drawing and painting holidays in Italy, France, Spain or Greece.
Wherever you set up your easel, you can find painting holidays that free your creative side and indulge your inner artist alongside other passionate painters. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our painting holidays guests?
Expressive souls, novices unsteady with their brushes, experienced artists – everyone is welcome in the studios of our painting holiday hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, with painting holidays for singles, couples and groups of friends. Some have devoted their lives to their art, others are keen to escape the 9-to-5 and inspire their minds.
All that’s required is a passion for creativity, a desire to learn and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of art holidays and painting courses are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
