Refocus your energy
Get ready to roll out your mat, tie up your trainers and absorb the health benefits of sunshine, serenity and stretching your body and mind.
Our relaxing wellbeing holidays surround you in equal parts tranquillity and action – here, personal trainers motivate your workout on the sand, professional yoga teachers help you perfect your downward dog and expert perfumers share how to concoct an intoxicating sensory blend.
But our wellness retreats and fitness holidays aren’t just for your body. They’re a chance to escape your exhausting daily routine and leave your busy schedule and stress at home. If devoting time to your overall physical and mental health has taken a backseat, a retreat allows your wellness to take centre focus.
That’s why we’ve specifically chosen only the most inspiring destinations for our wellbeing holidays.
From fitness holidays in the Tuscan countryside to luxury detox retreats on the coast of Spain to yoga retreats as close as France or as far-off as Thailand or Costa Rica, you’ll be able to connect with nature and rejuvenate your spirit.
Whatever your needs, you can find a wellness holiday that gets you away from everything except your passion for wellbeing. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our wellbeing holiday guests?
Fitness buffs, those who have never been keen on exercise, lifelong yogis – everyone is welcome in the studios, gyms and homes of our wellbeing hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from solo travellers to couples to friends. Some are escaping the madness of their 9-to-5 lives, others are looking to reset their diets or reach weight loss goals. Others still have never lifted a dumbbell or executed a Warrior II pose, while some just want a holiday with a bit of exercise, plenty of beach time and a glass of wine.
All that’s required is a passion for relaxation, a desire to be your best self and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of wellbeing holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
