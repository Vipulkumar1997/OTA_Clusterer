Get your adrenaline fix
Surfing is about more than standing up on your board.
It’s about testing your limits and redefining your comfort zone, practicing new techniques and willing to be daring and bold with them, and -- most importantly -- laughing at your blunders and sharing feedback and fun with others after a day in the waves together.
Hands-on surf holidays let you experience all of that in stunning destinations around the world.
And with professional, local surfers showing you the best surf spots and helping you build confidence on your board, you’ll return with new skills and a renewed zest for life.
Go learn to surf the year-round swells of Fuerteventura and the Canary Islands, hang ten on Europe’s westernmost beach in Baleal, Portugal or try a surfing holiday on France’s best beach.
Further afield, embrace the laid-back lifestyle and excellent waves of surf holidays in exotic Morocco, dip your board into the Indian Ocean while surfing in Thailand or test the tropical breakers in Costa Rica.
Surfing holidays with an added rush
If you’re looking to activate your muscles and your mind, combine your surfing holiday with another hobby or passion.
Learn the Spanish lingo for ‘cowabunga’ before maneuvering the local waves on Spanish and surf holidays, take photos from your surfboard and the beach by combining photography and surfing, or spend the morning balancing on your yoga mat before balancing on your board in the afternoon during surf and yoga holidays.
Whatever your passions, you can find surfing holidays to indulge your active side, as well as a group of like-minded people to experience them with. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our surf holiday guests?
Active types, beginners who’ve never ridden a board before, adrenaline junkies -- everyone is welcome in the surf schools of our hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from solo travellers to couples to friends. Some devote their lives to chasing waves, others simply want to escape their 9-to-5 jobs for awhile. Others still have never seen the ocean, much less surfed it, while some just want to prove that they can do whatever they set their mind to.
All that’s required is an abundance of energy, a willingness to learn and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of surf holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
