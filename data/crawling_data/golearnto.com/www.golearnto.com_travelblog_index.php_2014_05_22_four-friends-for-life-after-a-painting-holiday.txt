Four friends for life after a painting holiday

Four women from across the globe have become friends for life after a
painting holiday
; now they meet up once a year somewhere in the world to share in their passion for painting.

Helen of Australia, Jean of America, Lisa of Switzerland, and Fiona of Glasgow met on a painting holiday two years ago in Languedoc – the group hit it off so much they decided to all go back again last year.

“We have become close friends, we have lots of laughs, we all like to do a bit of painting.” Helen said.

“I guess the common bond was getting together to do painting, and we all got on so well. We were all travelling solo so everyone was happy to meet up again.”


The group all have varying degrees of experience painting. Jean; the eldest in the group has been painting a long time, Helen has a fair bit of experience where as Fiona and Lisa are fairly new to it.

The painting course in Languedoc run by our tutor Sally was a hit among the women.

“It was terrific, really nice people, Sally is a great cook too!” Helen said

Before heading back to Languedoc last year, the women first went to stay with Lisa for a week in Switzerland.

“That was a great trip. We stay in touch in between holidays as well, and even more so when we’re organising our painting holidays, it’s a lot of fun,” Helen said.

For Helen their first painting holiday had been her first trip overseas alone – but has now become one of many.

“I wasn’t really nervous travelling on my own, my children are working, my husband’s working. He’s not interested in travel himself but he’s happy for me to go.”

This year the group decided to go somewhere new, so after perusing the
GolearnTo.com painting holidays
they decided on our popular painting break near Cadiz, Spain.

The women are heading there in September this year and are busy planning trips around the region.

And as for next year? Painting in Italy is on the horizon for this painting quartet!

Sally originates from New Zealand. She’s been here three years but we still can’t tell the difference between her a’s and e’s. Sally eats an alarming amount of fruit and is an enthusiast for marine-life documentaries. She's also been on more GoLearnTo.com holiday than we can count from surfing, yoga, cooking and photography.
