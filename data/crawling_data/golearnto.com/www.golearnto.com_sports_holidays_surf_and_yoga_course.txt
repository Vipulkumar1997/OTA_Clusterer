Redefine your limits
Surf and yoga have always suited one another.
Like two opposing forces, surfing is about testing your limits and willing to be daring and bold, while yoga is about refocusing your mind and balancing your body.
A surf and yoga retreat combines adventure and serenity over shared laughter, glasses of wine and interesting stories in the company of others who spent the day with you catching waves and de-stressing your soul.
And with professional surfers, lifelong yogis and local teachers helping you build confidence on your board and your mat, you’ll return with new skills and a renewed zest for life.
Go learn to surf the big ones in Fuerteventura before clearing your mind during a yoga class overlooking the ocean. Practise balance poses in exotic Morocco and embrace the chill surf vibes as you balance on your board. Or head to far-off Costa Rica for tropical surf yoga retreats in the jungle.
Whatever your style, you can find yoga and surf holidays that free your mind and indulge your active side, as well as a group of like-minded people to experience them with. Never settle for ordinary.
Who are our surf and yoga holiday guests?
Active types, those who can barely touch their toes, lifelong surfers or yogis – everyone is welcome in the studios and schools of our surf and yoga hosts.
You’ll meet people of all ages and nationalities, from singles to couples to groups of friends. Some are looking to escape the madness of their daily routines, others have devoted their lives to chasing waves and living balanced lifestyles.
All that’s required is a passion for having fun, a desire to learn and a refusal to be boxed in.
Is this you? It looks like you.
Thousands of people have already discovered that our eclectic mix of surf and yoga holidays are as diverse as the people who go on them. Come and join them.
