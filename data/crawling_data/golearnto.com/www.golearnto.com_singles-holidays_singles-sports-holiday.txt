Game changing solos sports holidays

Whatever you choose, we’ll get you away from everything except your passion for sports.
If the sparse side of solos sports holidays doesn’t appeal, you’ll be pleased to hear that our accommodation ranges from luxury countryside retreats to quirky surf houses. Singles can share a room or pay extra for a private room.

What our guests say...
It’s not the done thing to boast. So you won’t find us crowing about how amazing our holidays are. Nor how fit our instructors are, the beaches superb, the accommodation pleasingly comfortable and how infectious the laughter is. Mum’s the word. We prefer to let our guests do the talking.

I had a marvellous time in Essaouira, trying to improve my kitesurfing. When the wind failed, surfing was fun and horse-riding was awesome. I warmly recommend this holiday to anyone who wants to take up the fun challenge of kitesurfing! Good winds!
