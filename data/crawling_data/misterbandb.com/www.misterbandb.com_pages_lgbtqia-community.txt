LGBTQIA community deserves to feel welcome



While the idea for misterb&b came from our CEO’s experience as a gay man, it’s been important since our launch that ultimately misterb&b extends its service of providing trusted and welcoming stays to the entire LGBTQIA community (Lesbian, Gay, Bi, Trans, Queer, Intersex, Ally).



We began with gay male travelers to allow us to build our services and reach critical mass with a focused audience. As we achieve success we will reach out to all parts of our community.



Diversity and connecting the global LGBTQIA community has always been in our DNA. That’s why we will partner with LGBTQIA events like the
Gay Games 2018
.



Everyone in the global LGBTQIA community deserves to feel welcome wherever they go!
