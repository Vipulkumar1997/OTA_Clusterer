Voices from our community of hosts




Rob

Host since May 2015

Alex & Richy were awesome guests and were very nice and respectful of our home. We had the pleasure of going out with them for dinner and drinks and ultimately we made great friends. They are the kind of guys that make hosting with misterb&b a delight.





Takuyia

Host since July 2015

Darien was a great guest and very easy to get along with. I very much enjoyed our dinner tour together and can absolutely recommend spending time with him and hosting him.
