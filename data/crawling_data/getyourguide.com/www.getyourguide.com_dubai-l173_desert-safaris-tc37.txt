Choosing the Perfect Dubai Desert Safari


These days
Dubai
might be better known for its jaw-dropping skylines and lavish attractions, but its golden desert remains as unmissable as ever. Here's how to make the most of your safari visit.












Wildlife


With gazelles, wildcats, monitor lizards to be seen, the Dubai desert can match any savannah for wildlife sightings. Try a falconry experience for the ultimate in animal close-ups.












Camel Rides


Camel rides make for a great hands-on Dubai Desert Tour. Most desert safaris include a short ride, but you can definitely opt for a tour with extended riding time.












Food


Budget safaris (meals included) are available, but it's worth it to spend a little more if possible. You'll get authentic, local cuisine and hospitality that makes you feel like a VIP.












Extreme Thrills


Thrill-seekers are spoilt for choice with the dune-bashing, quad-biking, sand-skiing, and dune-buggy rides offered on various safari tours. Not for the faint-hearted!












Time of Day


Can't handle the heat? Experience the desert by night. The evening tours offer breathtaking beauty and a unique stargazing experience.






Planning Your Visit




What is Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve?


With Dubai's rapid expansion, the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve was founded to protect the natural landscape and endemic wildlife from overspill. It is located in the southeastern corner of the Emirate of Dubai and covers 87 squared miles of land. Some safaris are allowed to take you out to these pristine dunes.



How hot does it get?


Dubai summer temperatures average at 106ºF (41ºC), and often get a lot higher than that. Temperatures are more comfortable between December and March, but you might have to contend with irregular spurts of rain.



Can you camp?


In some places it's possible to camp, but unless you're extremely experienced, we wouldn't recommend it without being accompanied by a knowledgeable guide. Fortunately, there are several overnight camping safaris available.



What is a desert safari?


What can you really expect on a safari tour? More than you may realize! This is your chance to drive over dunes and participate in a variety of traditional desert activities: camel riding, sandboarding, trying shisha, authentic cuisine, henna tattoos, and local entertainment.

What People Are Saying About Dubai








This was an amazing experience! Highly recommended.


Compared to the desert safari we did last year with another tour operator, this was definitely the better one. Our driver John, was superb at this job and his customer care was fabulous. No trip to Dubai would be complete without a trip to the desert.

Do not miss this! It is so much fun! :-)


We enjoyed this desert safari so much!!! We heard about it from a friend and so glad we were able to experience it. It was well organised, our guide Ansar was so helpful! He is not only a very experienced driver, but photographer and entertainer at the same time. Everything was perfect, the quad ride, the sand boarding and camel ride. The BBQ was really nice and the 2 dancers were amazing too. I wish I could go back now!

We have received excellent service, Oceanair is a highly professional organization. Our guide was Ilyas, he has been very kind, professional driver, we felt safe during the whole safari. He has made his best to entertain us, he made beautiful and extra photoes of us at the sunset and has assisted us to feel entertained.
We would like to thank ILYAS for the beautiful evening, I highly recommend him and Oceanair for booking such an exciting safari tour!!! :)

Phantastic trip into the desert with a perfect driver


Our driver Mansoor was the best. He was not only an experienced and secure driver. He also was very friendly and kind. He told us a lot about Dubai and the U.A.E. during the drive to the desert camp. During the afternoon we drove through sand dunes, did some sand surfing and camelback riding. We finished the day with a spectacular evening in a desert camp were we had a barbecue, shows and many more things to do. We really enjoyed the tour and - again - Mansoor, our perfect driver and host.
