Top 10 things to do in Vienna


Vienna still bears the hallmarks of historic opulence, proudly displaying some of the most exquisite architecture in Europe, as well as many of Austria's top attractions. Here are the best things to see and do between your sausage and schnitzel!












Hofburg Palace


Vienna's ornate
Imperial Palace
was the center of the Habsburg dynasty's power for seven centuries! Visit its chapel on Sundays for High Mass to see the Vienna Boys' Choir perform.












Schönbrunn Palace


The picturesque grounds of
Schönbrunn Palace
, the Habsburgs' former summer home, boast a gloriette, palm house, zoo, and even artificial Roman ruins. Few tours offer so much bang for your buck!












Albertina


Home to the most valuable collection of graphical illustrations in the world, the
Albertina
is located on the grounds of the Hofburg Palace, making it the perfect follow-up tour!












Vienna Rathaus


The Neo-Gothic town hall is one of the city's most famous landmarks, but the administrative building also houses the historic Rathauskeller – one of the best restaurants in Vienna!












Vienna State Opera


The
Vienna State Opera
is home to one of the world's best and most prolific opera companies. You may well go on every day of your trip and never see the same show twice!












Madame Tussauds Vienna


Visitors to this established family favorite can mingle with some of the most famous figures on the planet. At the
Madame Tussauds Vienna
you may also discover few Austrians you might not recognize!












St. Stephen's Cathedral


From the huge church bells in its tower down to the famous bodies in its catacombs, the unmissable
St. Stephen's Cathedral
stands out as one of Vienna's best sights.












Leopold Museum


Located in Vienna's Museumsquartier, the
Leopold
exhibits one of the largest collections of modern Austrian art, including famous works by Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt.












Mozarthaus


Mozart only lived in this house for three years but, as
Mozarthaus
is his only surviving residence, its central location makes it perfect for this comprehensive exhibition on his life and works.












Jewish Museum


The
Jewish museum
offers insight into the eventful history of Jewish life and culture in Vienna. It's actually spread across two locations: Dorotheergasse and Judenplatz.






Planning Your Vienna Visit




How many days?


You could see the sights of Vienna in three or four days but, if you can, it's worth booking longer in order to fully experience its exhibitions, concerts, and highbrow cultural life!




How to get around?


Vienna's public transport network is excellent. With buses, trams, trains, and relatively new metro lines, hiring a car will be more hassle than it's worth! Taxis are affordable and the city's bicycle friendly too, so consider renting two wheels for your stay if you've got the legs for it!

What People Are Saying About Vienna








Absolutely fabulous and loads of fun. Strudel was Delicious.


Great atmosphere, the "baker" a young girl of 15 years of age did a superlative presentation.

Pleasant if the weather is nice and doesn't include tastings.


When I booked the tour, it was not clear to me that we would NOT be going inside for tastings.i was expecting a historical tour but with stops INSIDE various cafes with small tastings of coffee and something small on the side. For that reason we skipped lunch. Instead we were told that the tour is only about history and we would be outside the whole time. The guide was accommodating and we did go inside and bought our coffee and a snack. Overall the tour is interesting but it's a HISTORY tour NOT cafe tour.

Very good concert in an elegant setting.


It was a sold-out concert, even my seat was in the back, could hear clearly and enjoyed the evening, a memorable Vienna event.

A great way to learn about this fascinating city


Our guide was very knowledgeable and made the tour interesting and humorous. He cleverly adapted the information to make it relevant to all members of the group as there were many different nationalities. This was a great way to start our short trip to this lovely city and gave us lots of ideas for the next few days.
