St. Petersburg's 7 best things to see and do


While Moscow has the bulk of Russia's history, St. Petersburg is its most exciting destination. With a young population and ever-growing cultural landscape, the city is bathed in a unique light and laid-back vibe. See our sightseeing highlights.












Saint Isaac's Cathedral


Visit the
largest Russian Orthodox cathedral in the city
, where you can learn about the religion and history of this important landmark. Entry plus audio guide is 350RUB.












State Russian Museum


With the
biggest collection of fine art in St. Petersburg
, this attraction is a hit with art lovers, though is often quite quiet. Enjoy the work of Russian artists of the past.












Nevsky Prospect


The
main street in the city
, this bustling thoroughfare offers beautiful buildings, bridges and squares. Best enjoyed as a walking tour, with opportunities to shop along the way.












Winter Palace


This opulent building is perhaps
the sight the city is most proud of
. With more than 100 rooms, highlights include the gilded Armorial Hall. Visit at night for a pretty picture.












Mariinsky Theatre


Ballet and opera are the
cornerstones of St. Petersburg's classical culture
, and the best on offer takes place here. The season ends in early August and begins in late September.












Peterhof Palace


The garden fountains (check dates) and golden statues are the real stars of the show at this
extravagant palace
, although some of the lavish interiors must be seen to be believed.












Hermitage


A vast museum housed in the Winter Palace,
the Hermitage
is perhaps the jewel in the city's tourism crown. The stately rooms bear many artistic treasures; leave hours to explore.






Planning Your St. Petersburg Visit




Getting around


The St. Petersburg Metro is a good way to get around the city, particularly in winter, when it can be bitingly cold. Tickets are available at the stations from the toll booths, and a smart card that you can top up is the easiest option if you're staying more than a couple of days.




Do I need a visa?


Most international visitors to Russia will need a visa, so check well before you travel and apply early to avoid disappointment.




What is the weather like?


It's said the weather in this city has character - in others words, be prepared. By Russian standards, it doesn't get too cold - never really below minus 10 degrees - and in the summer highs can reach 30 degrees. However, a jacket and umbrella are always handy to have in your luggage!

Best time to visit

It's more expensive to visit in the summer months, but this is by far the best time. The temperatures are warm and the days are the longest, so you may get to attend the White Nights celebrations!

What People Are Saying About St. Petersburg








Wonderful tour to really understand more about the Hermitage


Great tour! In 3 hours, I feel I saw a lot of the Hermitage and not miss anything important, while never feeling rushed. I learned so much about the history of the building and St Petersburg through the explanations with the paintings and interiors. Also about European paintings, my guide (I’m sure I am misspelling her name, Valeria) was very knowledgeable and often had stories about how they ended up in the hermitage. The 3 hours flew by and I think having this tour made the museum so much more manageable. Afterwards I stayed a few more hours, not getting lost once.

guide's command of English and knowledge excellent.


Our guide's English was very good and clear to understand . She gave us a good overview of the collections, and an excellent introduction to the history and scope of the material in the museums. we needed this clear introduction to give us a framework into which to fit more detailed plans for future visits. a very professional service. thank you Pauline
