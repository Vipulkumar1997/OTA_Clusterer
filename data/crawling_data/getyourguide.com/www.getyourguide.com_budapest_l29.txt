Top 10 things to do in Budapest


Coveted by both the East and the West for millenia, Budapest's rich blend of culture, art, and architecture will leave you thoroughly charmed. Here are 10 of best things to do in the united cities of Buda and Pest!












Szechenyi Thermal Bath


With indoor and outdoor pools served by two different thermal springs, the
Szechenyi Thermal Bath
in Budapest's City Park forms the largest medicinal bath in Europe.












Hungarian Parliament Building


Not to be outdone by its Neo-Gothic façade, the interior of
Hungary's parliament
boasts stunning frescoes, statues, and stained glass mosaics, as well as the Holy Crown of Hungary!












Chain Bridge


Considered a wonder of the modern world upon its completion in 1849,
Chain Bridge
was the first to span the city's Danube river, eventually uniting Buda and Pest as one city.












Andrássy Avenue (Andrássy út)


Flanked by Neo-Renaissance mansions,
Andrássy Avenue
, the city's main shopping district, is a World Heritage Site lined with cafés, restaurants, museums, and theaters, as well as luxury boutiques.












Hungarian State Opera House


Perhaps the most impressive landmark on Andrássy Avenue is Budapest's ornate opera house. Inside it's equally divine, and the world-class performances aren't bad either!












Matthias Church


A turbulent history has seen the
Matthias Church
undergo several incarnations, yet with its magestic dimensions and ornate style, it remains a star of Buda's Castle District.












Fisherman's Bastion


Named for the guild of fishermen that once defended Buda's Medieval riverbank,
Fisherman's Bastion
's dramatic views have made it one of Budapest's most visited attractions.












Buda Castle


The
Buda Castle
complex dates back to 1265 and housed the Kings of Hungary right up until 1918. Budapest's largest and most famous sight cannot be missed. Literally!












St. Stephen's Basilica


Named in honor of Hungary's first king,
St. Stephen's Basilica
's outstanding beauty stands in stark contrast to the right hand of St. Stephen kept among its relics!

House of Terror


The
House of Terror
is not simply a museum but a memorial to the victims of the fascist and communist regimes analyzed within its exhibits.






Planning Your Budapest Visit




When to go?


Budapest attracts a lot of visitors at the height of summer. However, with its sights spread all over the place, the city absorbs large influxes of tourists better than most. Still, the best time to visit is probably early or late summer when the weather's not too hot to enjoy the thermal baths!




How many days?


Even just seeing the sights could fill a long weekend in the city quite effortlessly. If you want to experience Budapest's best baths, museums, and nightlife then start thinking about at least a week!




How to get around?


Budapest is served by an extensive public transportation network. The Millennium Underground is the second oldest underground railway in the world (after London's Metropolitan Line)! Tickets must be bought before boarding, and are available at metro stops and newsstands. But be warned: a standard single ticket doesn't allow you to change between lines, so ask about special tickets if your journey requires them.

A fun night with outstanding performers in a beautiful old theatre.


I really enjoyed this evening. The musicians were outstanding and fun whilst the dancers were equally talented. I gained a great insight in to traditional Hungarian folk music/dance.

I would have liked to see a bit more dancing, not at the cost of the music though.

I took my teenage child who also enjoyed it.

A good night out and close enough to the Danube to have a lovely stroll by the water before or after the performance and the bar opposite the theatre does lovely mojitos and smoothies!
