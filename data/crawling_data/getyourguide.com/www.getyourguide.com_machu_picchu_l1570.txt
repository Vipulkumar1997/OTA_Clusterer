Top 5 things visitors often miss at Machu Picchu


Peru's Machu Picchu is the scenic site of many secrets. In fact, nobody really knows what the Incans even used it for! Here are a few tips to help you make the most of the mystery.












The hiking trails


You can walk up to Machu Picchu by foot if you're fit enough. The strenuous climb reveals numerous overgrown trails, many of which are now being opened for public tours.












The earthquake-resistant bricks


Peru is prone to earthquakes and the building blocks of Machu Picchu have been cut precisely enough to simply shake off the threat of tremors!












The underground engineering


An estimated 60% of Machu Picchu's construction is underground. Its deep foundations and efficient drainage systems never fail to impress historians and archaeologists alike.












The secret temple


Machu Picchu may have been a site of religious pilgrimage. Supporting this is the Temple of the Moon – a shrine beautifully carved into a cave on the far side of Huayna Picchu.












The excellent but poorly located museum


Want more insight but can't stand crowded museums? You're in luck! Few tourists follow the long dirt track to the Museo de Sitio Manuel Chávez Ballón, but they really should!






Machu Picchu: Our Tips




When to go?


The best time to visit is as early as possible if you want to see the site from Huayna Picchu – the highest peak of the two, and the one offering the most breathtaking views. Only 400 visitors are allowed up each day, so queues begin forming long before dawn!

It's also worth noting that although rainy season is officially from October to April, the sky can burst at any moment!




How to get there?


The PeruRail train from Cusco takes 3½ hours from Cusco to Aguas Calientes, the town at the foot of Machu Picchu (recently renamed Machu Picchu Pueblo, both town names are used). Train tickets sell out quickly so make sure you book with weeks to spare! The hike from Aguas Calientes takes about 90 minutes, otherwise expect long waits for the busy buses, despite the fact that they depart every few minutes from 5:30AM onwards.





Good to Know






When to visit

Open from 6:00AM to 5:00PM daily.





What is the price?

Tickets cost 126 soles, which is about $45.





Will I need a guide?

Absolutely! Might be worth it to check out our best-selling tours.





How to get there

Machu Picchu can be reached from Aguas Calientes by foot or bus.





Additional tips



Get there early to make sure you can go up!

The hike is strenuous and rainstorms are frequent.

Easy, fun, and an enriching experience all handled by professionals!


This was my 1st time to Peru, and without any knowledge of the area, culture, or of how to get around, the guides and local staff made it so much easier to navigate.
They also provided fun facts and enriching information throughout the tours which gave me a deeper appreciation of the sites and locations visited.

Well organized and great staff. Would highly recommend!
