On the GetYourGuide Platform users have the chance to find and book tours, activities and experiences all over the world. The online offer comprises guided tours, cooking courses, sightseeing tours by bus, river barge trips, tickets for entry to sightseeing locations and other services. The offers are placed online by a range of local Suppliers around the world (hereinafter referred to as “Suppliers”) with whom the respective contract for tourist services is concluded (“service agreement”). The Suppliers’ services can be accessed via the GetYourGuide Platform and bookings can be made.

1.2 GetYourGuide Deutschland GmbH approaches both, consumers and companies. For the purposes of these General Terms and Conditions, the following applies:

b. A “company” is a natural person or legal entity, or a partnership, which is performing its commercial or independent activities by concluding this contract (Section 14, paragraph 1, BGB).

c. The “user” denotes a natural person, unless this person has been explicitly registered with GetYourGuide Deutschland GmbH as a legal entity. The actions and omissions that take place during the registration of a legal entity are allocated to a natural individual, unless they are carried out within the framework of their power of attorney for the legal entity.

These General Terms and Conditions apply to any use of the GetYourGuide Platform, such as via the internet and apps.
