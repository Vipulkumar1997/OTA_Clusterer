5 reasons to visit SeaWorld Orlando


SeaWorld Orlando is one of the US' most renowned theme parks. Though it's most famous for its aquariums and water shows, it also boasts an array of other attractions, including rides. Here are the best reasons to splash out on a visit!












Signature Shows


SeaWorld's classic aquatic displays remain one of its key draws. Witness the majesty of dolphins, killer whales, and other creatures performing at one of 3 arenas!












Kraken


The mythical Kraken terrified sailors for centuries, but meeting it must have been a paddle in the shallow end compared to this intense rollercoaster! Leave valuables in a locker!












Sky Tower


As old as the park itself, the retro observation tower offers a seagull's view of the entire theme park from over 120 meters up!












Wild Arctic


This flight simulator takes you through the perils of North Pole exploration, but if that's not enough you can also meet the animals themselves on the Wild Arctic Up-Close Tour!












Shark Encounter


SeaWorld offers the opportunity to get up close with many creatures from sea lions to penguins to baby dolphins, but there are many you'd probably prefer not to feed!






SeaWorld Orlando: Our Tips




What are the opening times?


SeaWorld Orlando is open daily from 9:00AM. Closing times vary depending on the season, holidays, and special events. More information can be found on [their website] (seaworldparks.com/seaworld-orlando), where you can also check the events program to help decide on the best time to visit!




What to wear?


Prepare to get wet if you don't want to miss out on much of what the park offers! Consider bringing two pairs of footwear (flip-flops or water shoes and sneakers) and alternating depending on which part of the park you're visiting. Lockers are available for a small fee so you don't need to carry all your belongings with you. Dress casually and comfortably and don't forget to wear sunscreen!





Good to Know






When to visit


The park opens at 9:00AM but closes at varying times throughout the year.






What is the price?


Tickets start at $75, with many packages available.






Will I need a guide?


There are various tours available around (and over!) the Orlando area.






How to get there


The I-4 and FL-528 freeways both lead to SeaWorld. Directions vary depending on where you stay.






Additional tips


You may want to bring a waterproof camera along for the day. | To avoid mealtime crowds, visit a restaurant while shows are happening. | Temperatures can get hot, so map out the cooler attractions in the park to beat the heat.








What People Are Saying About SeaWorld Orlando








Best way to get around International Drive area


This is the best and cheapest way to get to attractions, shops, and restaurants around International drive. The only negative thing is that the trolleys don't stop at Universal Studios. But if you. plan on going here's what we did. You can get off the trolley at stop #5 ( International Drive and Universal blvd ). Accross the street there's a Four Points hotel that sells Universel tickets and offer free to and from Universal Studios shuttle service. So just buy your tickets there and take the shuttle to Universal and back and then use the trolley to return to your hotel. One note, The last shuttle leaves at 11 am from the Four Points to Universal so make sure you get there before or you will have to take a taxi at around $10.

Great activities, rides, and shows and low crowds!


If you are tired of the crowds of Disney and like animals then Sea World is a nice alternative. Clean park, accommodating and friendly!
