Very knowledgeable tour guide and great sights


Excellent tour guide. Very informative. Well worth the money. Saw some great sights in the snow and ice and ended with a nice hot dip in the secret lagoon.

Great tour, fab guide, clean coach with big windows for great views


Tour ran like clockwork. Picked up from bus stop 2 & taken in minibus to our coach for the day which was clean, with big windows to take in the spectacular views enroute.
Day paced well to see everything, but not too rushed. (We had only 3 days to see Iceland) Tour guide (Elun) regaled us with some great Icelandic stories & myths! Had lunch at geyser, lots of choice and served quickly despite being busy. Expensive of course. Great value tour for all the family (age 8,15,45 & 50!)
Highly recommended.

A great all encompassing tour of some of the nicest waterfalls&views;!


Had a great guide who gave us some interesting info on Iceland's history. The tour shows you most of the best spots to snap pics - good to do at the beginning of your trip. You only get 15-20mins to snap shots and about an hr at the geysirs, so bear this in mind if you are looking for a more leisurely tour.
