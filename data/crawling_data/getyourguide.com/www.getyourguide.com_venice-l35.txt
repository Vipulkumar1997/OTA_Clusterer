Top 10 things to do in Venice


Few cities offer such a wealth of beauty, charm and history as Venice. With so many incredible sights on offer, choosing can be a daunting task. Let us help: here are 10 essential stops that belong on the itinerary of every visit to The Floating City.












Grand Canal


The
Grand Canal
is Venice’s main boulevard – made of water! Hop on a waterbus, taxi-boat or an iconic gondola and float past the gorgeous historic buildings lining the canal banks.












Doge’s Palace


The wow-factor of
the Doge’s Palace
's majestic marble exterior is only exceeded by the treasures held within – history buffs and aficionados of classical art will never want to leave.












Saint Mark’s Basilica


The opulent
Saint Mark’s Basilica
is arguably the jewel in Venice’s crown. With its multi-leveled domes, intricate facades and stunning mosaics, it’s a marvel of Italo-Byzantine architecture.












Bridge of Sighs


When riding a Gondola with your loved one, make sure to pass
the Bridge of Sighs
– Venetian lore vows that a kiss under the bridge will grant couples eternal love and happiness.












Piazza San Marco


This gigantic public square is the centerpiece of Venice. Napoleon was so taken by the beauty of the architecture, he called
Piazza San Marco
“the drawing room of Europe.”












Rialto Bridge


The
Rialto Bridge
is the oldest and most ravishing bridge across Grand Canal. Get up early to beat the crowds and enjoy the spectacular views at your leisure, you won’t regret it.












Lido di Venezia


Take a breather from the touristic bustle and visit the charming
Lido di Venezia
. A short boat ride from the center, it’s where some of Venice’s best (and cheapest!) restaurants are hidden.




Teatro La Fenice


You don’t need to be an opera enthusiast to be blown away by the sumptuous
Teatro La Fenice
, one of the most important and renowned venues in the history of the art.












Torcello


Quiet and picturesque, the island of
Torcello
is perfect for a relaxing day trip. Make sure to visit the charming basilica and admire the amazing views from its bell tower.




Gallerie dell’Accademia


The
Gallerie dell’Accademia
contains some of the most illustrious examples of Venetian art. The mere size of the paintings is awe-inspiring – be warned, you may leave with a crick in your neck.






Planning Your Venice Visit




Save money on transport


The way the city is built, you’ll find yourself using the waterbuses (“vaporetti”) a lot more than expected. These trips can eat into your savings if you’re not careful. Bundle tickets are a great way of avoiding nasty surprises. The price of a 12-hour ticket is roughly equivalent to 3 singles and the relative cost keeps dropping for longer periods (tickets are available for up to a week).




Counters are your friends


Eating and drinking can be very expensive in Venice. Bars and restaurants generally charge more for sitting at a table, so a great way of cutting costs is opting for the counter instead. Surcharges vary with some restaurants charging up to 500% in the busiest tourist areas!




Enjoy the view


The view of the entire city from atop the bell tower on Piazza San Marco, which costs 8 EUR, is one of Venice’s most popular attractions. An insider tip is heading over to San Giorgio Maggiore – the view is arguably better and the privilege only costs 3 EUR.

Excellent tour & tour company very helpful when we were late for tour.


This was a great tour that lasted around 5hrs. We saw Murano where we had a glass making demonstration. My friend and I missed the start of the tour due to some transport issues. We were so pleased when the company organised for a small boat to collect us and take us to meet the rest of the group. Due to us coming a little late to Murano we missed seeing the historic church but we did get the full glass making demonstration which was great.
Then on to Burano - with some Proseco to enjoy along the way - where we saw the colourfullly painted houses on the island & had a traditional lunch which was very tasty. So despite our very late start & the foggy weather my friend and I had a great time. Many thanks to Gian Lucca our guide for the day who was very engaging and full of information. Thanks also to Ludovico who collected my friend and I in the small boat and took us to meet the tour on Murano. The company’s willingness to accommodate us was very much appreciated.

Fab romantic gondola ride through the quiet canals of Venice.


Do not miss this opportunity to treat your loved one to a private romantic ride though the quiet and not much travelled canals of Venice. Also include is a short trip on the Grand Canal. Great location only 2 minutes from St Mark’s Square. Considering it’s Venice great value for money. You cannot visit Venice and not do a Gondola ride.

A lovely way to enjoy the beautiful scenery in Venice


The meeting point was difficult to find so we missed our time spot. However, the organisers let us join the afternoon tour (and others had rearranged to other days). We were sat with others in the gondola but that was absolutely fine - once your gondola sets off, you're too busy admiring the scenery to notice those around you! It was very enjoyable.

Passionate guide but the tour did not include the Dorsoduro part.


Without being informed and with no apologies whatsoever instead of the combined Accademia and Dorsoduro Tour that we had paid for we were only guided in the Accademia. Our guide who was very knowledgable and did a fanbtastic job was not informed either so we were left without any explanation.
