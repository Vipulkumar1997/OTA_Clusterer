Top 10 things to do in Dublin


Perhaps it's been Dublin's history of hardship that has made it a breeding ground for poets, playwrights, and musicians alike. The city's vibrant culture is unmissable, but here are some its liveliest and most beautiful places to visit!












Guinness Storehouse


The
Guinness Brewery's
multi-storey exhibit offers a fascinating insight into the black stuff's history and brewing methods. And yes, there's a complimentary pint at the end of it!












Dublin Zoo


The
Dublin Zoo
hosts creatures great and small from across the globe. Even if you're not with kids, it's worth going just for the daily talks and feedings!












National Gallery of Ireland


The
National gallery of Ireland
boasts a worthy collection of paintings from Europe and the US, but go for the excellent ensemble of Irish paintings. Entrance is free!












Phoenix Park



Phoenix Park
is one of the largest walled city park in Europe, it's big enough to envelop many of the city's attractions, such as Dublin Zoo, the Wellington Monument, and the Magazine Fort.












Kilmainham Gaol


Kilmainham was where the leaders of the Easter Rising were executed. If you're interested in the country's fight for independence then the "
Irish Bastille
" is a must-do!












Christ Church Cathedral


The
Christ Church Cathedral
is worth a visit any day of the week, but try to catch its enchanting choral evensongs on Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday.












Dublin Castle


This complex of structures from various eras forms a
very odd castle
indeed. The gardens behind it were once home to the Dubh Linn (dark pool) that the city was named after!

Croke Park


Hurling, Gaelic football, and rugby: Ireland revels in sports that few other countries understand. Still, land
Croke Park tickets
to any of the major games and you'll be smitten for life!

Aviva Stadium


It's not all about Croke Park if you're looking to soak up some of Ireland's sporting pride. The sleek
Aviva Stadium
hosts most of Ireland's international rugby and soccer matches.

National Museum of Ireland


From bog men to Bronze Age gold to weaponry dating up till independence, the National Museum is a fundamental look at Ireland from all angles.






Planning Your Dublin Visit




Best time to visit?


Ireland isn't exactly known for its splendid weather, but the best of it generally makes its token appearance at the end of summer (September-ish). If you're looking for an excuse to don a silly hat and swig Guinness, the St. Patrick's Day parade is on March 17th.




How to get around?


The Irish are world-renowned for their terrific sense of humor, and nowhere is this more evident than in Dublin's public transport network! There are 2 unconnected tram lines and trains mainly serve the outer rim of the city. The bus network is extensive but a tough nut to crack for visitors (see dublinbus.ie). The good news, however, is that most of the sights are just a short walk from each other in the heart of the city!




How many days?


You could see the sights of Dublin in a day or two, but remember this is a city of exemplary museums, exciting music and sports events, and enticing modern restaurants. Book a week to delve into its best kept secrets!

So fun and a great experience during my Ireland visit!


Super fun and worth my time during my short stay in Ireland. Gavin was such a great tour guide and knew how to keep us tourists entertained. I loved the spots we stopped at and had the right amount of time during each stop. The Cliffs of Moher is truly a must see when visiting Ireland.

Tour was great but the comfort on the bus was not.


The tour was fantastic, but the coach seats were very uncomfortable. Considering that the tour was a lot of driving and lasted 12 hours, I would highly recommend that you use a different coach provider. I traded seats with my travel companion to see if that would help but we both found the seats to be uncomfortable and used our jackets and scarfs to try and mitigate the problem to no avail. We chose the seats with more leg room near the rear door of the coach but that might have been the reason the seats were worn down. Maybe other seats on the bus were less used. As for the tour itself, it was very nice and well organized. The scenery was worth the trip and hiking on the causeway was great.

Easily found where to board the bus and driver very welcoming.


We found the boarding stop easily and asked the driver for the nearest stop to where we were staying. When we got up to get off the bus the driver then gave us more directions to the hotel which we were very grateful for as it was quite late at night.
