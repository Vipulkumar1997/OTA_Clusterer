The most famous prisoners in Alcatraz history


Alcatraz is home to a Civil War military garrison, seabird colonies, and the West Coast's oldest working lighthouse. But if its walls could talk, they'd give a whole lot away about some of America's most dangerous criminals. Here's a quick overview!












Al Capone


Perhaps the most famous gangster of all time, Capone eventually ended up in cell 181 where, by most accounts, he was unable to cope with prison life.












Robert Franklin Stroud


The "Birdman of Alcatraz" actually became a respected ornithologist at his previous prison, Leavenworth. Alcatraz wouldn't let him keep animals!












Mickey Cohen


Harvey Keitel won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Cohen in "Bugsy." It was a fitting tribute to a man who invented every Hollywood mobster cliché!












James "Whitey" Bulger


Before he was one of America's most feared crime bosses, the notoriously brutal Bulger spent three years in Alcatraz. The bogeyman of Boston is currently incarcerated in Florida.

Frank Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin


In 1962, these three cracked an intricate plan thought to be the only successful Alcatraz escape attempt. What happened to them after that is anyone's guess!






Alcatraz: Our Tips




How to get there?


You can only reach Alcatraz by ferry, which sets off from Port 33 on the Embarcadero.




Best time of year to visit?


Alcatraz gets quite foggy during the summer months, so you'll experience the best weather at the end of spring or beginning of fall. May and June are ideal for bird activity.




Best time of day to visit?


It only really matters if you want to spend the whole day there, in which case you'll obviously want to get there as early as possible! There are a limited amount of people allowed on the island, which keeps crowds from getting out of hand - so be prepared to wait.





Good to Know






When to visit

Ferry departures from 9AM daily.





What is the price?

Ticket prices vary, from $30 for adults.





Will I need a guide?

Experience Alcatraz as part of a hop-on hop-off tour of other San Francisco sights like the
Golden Gate Bridge
, and save money - there'll be a guide giving you all the information you need for every destination.





How to get there

As Alcatraz is an island, the only way of reaching it is by ferry. You can do this on the F line of the Muni (bus).





Additional tips



The island has some steep hills, so make sure to wear good walking shoes.

Bring a jacket or sweater - it can get chilly near the coast!

Alcatraz tour and GoCar excellent, just a little problem


The Alcatraz tour was perfect, we collected the tickets the same morning at Pier33 and we attended the tour straight away. The GoCar experience was funny. We just had a problem with the GoCar company and the activities included. Although it wasn't my fault, the GoCar company didn't deal with that and they were rude to me.
Once returned home, I emailed the GetYourGuide company asking to clarify the problem we had and they explained to us it was a problem related to the update of the description page. They offered us a nominal refund.
I recommend this combo anyway!

Alcatraz was good but you need 4 hours to do it properly.


Great location but the birds ruin it. Faeces everywhere as its illegal to move them on from this registered wildlife sanctuary. Do something about this as it really puts a downer on the experience. The smell is that bad!!!!

Covers a lot when you don't have much time to explore


The Alcatraz cell tour is a real must if you have a morning to spare in San Francisco.
