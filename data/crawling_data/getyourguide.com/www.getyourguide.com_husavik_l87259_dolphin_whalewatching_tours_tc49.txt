What People Are Saying About Husavik








Amazing humpbacks! a little crowded but great experience


We went on this trip for my 40th birthday with my mum too. The host was excellent, very friendly and with useful information. The boat was a bit too crowded but we still had a great time. Amazing to see three humpback whales and so special to have this intimate encounter with these gentle giants. Hot chocolate and cinnamon bun was excellent and much needed! Take snacks and water with you, dress warm and take travel sickness tablets beforehand if you need them.

Fabulous trip - we saw many humpback whales and loads of puffins


Husavik is the right place for whale watching. we saw 5 whales for extended periods not just glimpses. North Sailing was very flexible - changed our date. Good warm clothes handed , not too many people on-board so we could see well. Very knowledgeable guide. And nice calm weather :-). Cocoa and buns was a nice ending to one of our best experiences in Iceland

Great experience, stunning setting, brilliant guides,


Arriving in Husavik to see the snow capped mountains on the other side of the bay, and an array of different boats in the harbour made for a very special setting. The boat was spacious enough to move around, even when full, and very warm overalls were provided. We had a beautiful calm day and saw many humpback whales and dolphins, sometimes very close to the boat. The team followed them, but moved on from some whales after a while to look for others (which I thought good, so as not to distress them). The guides (Natalia and Teresa) were very knowledgeable and looked after the guests well. Nice warm hot chocolate and doughnut cakes... we had a great morning!
