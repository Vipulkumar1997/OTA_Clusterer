Get to Know Van Gogh: Musee Van Gogh


If you’re anything like us, when you hear Van Gogh, you think Starry Night and sliced-off ears. When in Amsterdam, head to the Van Gogh Museum to get to know more about his life, and prepare to be dazzled by his best works, featured here.












The Potato Eaters 1885


Van Gogh viewed this painting as proof that he could be a good figure painter. He wanted to depict peasants as they really were, and deliberately chose ugly models.












The Bedroom 1888


Born in the Netherlands, Van Gogh moved to Arles, France in later years, seeking refuge from drinking. He painted his bedroom in his home, the Yellow House, while recovering from an illness.












Sunflowers 1889


The post-impressionist artist created two series of sunflowers for the purpose of decorating a room in the Yellow House for his fellow painter and friend, Gauguin.












Irises 1890


Van Gogh struggled with mental illness, and painted irises while living in an asylum in France before his death in 1890. He brought emotion to life in his flowers and still lifes.












Wheatfield with a Reaper 1889


Van Gogh painted a series of the view from over the wheatfield from the window of the asylum: the scene after a storm, with a reaper, in autumn, and with spring flowers.

What People Are Saying About Van Gogh Museum








Ticket was great but museum disappointing


Having the mobile ticket was excellent. You bypass the long lines and you’re in the museum in less than 3 minutes. However, the museum is anti-climatic. The pieces were not plentiful. You cannot take pictures inside - very lame. It was very crowded too. The flow from one exhibit to another resulted in crowds congregating in front of pieces and you end up seeing the pieces from afar. Not a good museum for the price.

No travel to Amsterdam would be complete without van Gogh


The museum was fascinating and filled with the stunning works of Vincent van Gogh. The museum details the life of van Gogh through trials and tribulations. I would highly recommend a visit to the museum for anyone travelling to Amsterdam.

Unbelievably wonderful - worth every penny!!!


Great experience, wonderfully set up, never knew how prolific he was - the staff were friendly and cheery - even when they had to remind people not to take photos.

Nice tour with both activities near one another.


Saves you a bit of money doing this tour and some time in the line. I liked that both activities were near each other and easy to get to.
