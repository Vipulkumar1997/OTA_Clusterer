What to do in Florence


Florence is the soul of Tuscany, and it brims with the influences of the Renaissance. You'll discover a myriad of architectural wonders and a profusion of exquisite artwork, all of which culminate into one cultural masterpiece of a city.












Uffizi Gallery


The
Uffizi Gallery
is the city's top museum, and the place to see Botticelli's stunning "Birth of Venus." It's also wise to book your entrance ticket in advance to avoid waiting in a long line.












Accademia Gallery of Florence


Michaelangelo's "David" stands in the center of the Tribune and rightfully so. Classical music lovers will also enjoy the exhibit at the
Accademia Gallery
's Museum of Musical Instruments.












David


It's Florence's, if not the world's, most famous statue, and people have been admiring "
David
's" chiseled physique since its unveiling in 1504.












Palazzo Vecchio


A replica of "David" at the entrance of the
Palazzo Vecchio
indicates his original position here until 1873. The renowned Hall of Five Hundred is a part of the building's museum section.












Piazza della Signoria



Piazza della Signoria
has plenty of statuary, with the gallery of the Loggia dei Lanzi, the equestrian statue of Cosimo I and the Fountain of Neptune, who slightly resembles Cosimo.












Florence Cathedral


Known as
il Duomo
, the view from the Gothic cathedral's iconic, red-brick dome offers a sweeping panorama over waves of the city's terracotta rooftops amid rolling, Tuscan hills.












Florence Baptistry


Dedicated to the city's patron saint, John the Baptist,
Florence Baptistry
in white and green Prato marble boasts an inner dome with lavish, golden mosaics.












Church of Santa Maria Novella


It may appear ordinary from the outside, but it's the grandeur within that makes the Church of Santa Maria Novella well worth the visit. Its cloister also provides some moments of serenity.












Ponte Vecchio


Pastel-colored apartments upon shops selling art, jewelry, and souvenirs line the city's oldest and most unique bridge
Ponte Vecchio
over the Arno River. It's picture-perfect day and night.












Pitti Palace


Stroll across the Ponte Vecchio to the former Medici family residence. The
Pitti Palace
houses five museums, such as the Museum of Modern Art and the opulent Palatine Gallery.






Planning Your Florence Visit




How long should you stay in Florence?


A minimum of four nights will allow you to see the top sites without rushing from one to another. Give yourself a week or more for a full Renaissance immersion.




Getting around the city


The heart of Florence is compact, and you can easily explore all that the city has to offer by foot. The historical center is a UNESCO Heritage Site, and traffic is restricted from entering. If you're planning to rent a car for a trip around Tuscany, you'll have to park outside the "Limited Traffic Zone." Consider 15 euros extra per day for a parking garage space, since free parking is a rarity.




How expensive is Florence?


Keep in mind the entrance fees for the all the top sights, including the majority of churches. Although it's free to enter the Florence Cathedral, you'll have to buy a ticket to go up the dome for the breathtaking views. Restaurants in Italy also add a service fee called "pane e coperto" (literally "bread and cover"). It's an extra few euros charged per person seated at the table, but it's not a tip for your server.

It was a nice way to learn a little about the area.


We had a lovely morning cycling about, it was very easy cycling, we didn't cover much distance, it nice to learn a bit about the buildings etc. Had a few stops to try small things to eat, nice lady tour guide, felt very comfortable with her and the small group we were with.

Amazing sights and Cinque Terre is a stunning location


Alex was a great guide, full of information on each sight/town but was also happy to let you wander on your own. I would definitely recommend going on this tour, if you get Alex it is definitely a bonus!! He handled public transport issues on the day very well and kept calm in what seemed like a tough situation.

Great guide with good time keeping ; enjoyed lunch & weather was great


We had a great time with my friend '; loved the villages visited and the boat ride was great, I think the four visited were sufficient otherwise we would have been rushed.All was done as per our expectation; our tour guide was patient and gave clear instructions;enough time was spent at each village.
