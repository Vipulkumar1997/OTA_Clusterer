Where to go in Spain



Spain, with its rich history, beautiful vistas and delectable food, is a traveler's dream destination. Start your adventure in
Madrid
, capital of the country, with a private tour of the
Prado museum
or the
Royal Palace
. Take a walking tour, sip on wine and nibble tapas, then enjoy the scenic landscapes just outside the city.

In dazzling
Sevilla
, southwest of Madrid, visitors can see the amazing
Plaza of Spain
by day and then head to an entertaining and energetic
flamenco show
at night. Climb the
Giralda
for magnificent views of the entire city, or take a boat tour down Sevilla's famous river.
On the tropical island of
Mallorca
, enjoy the stunning views and picturesque countryside by train, on horseback or on foot. Take a boat ride then
swim
and
snorkel
to your heart's content on this delightful island.

Last, but certainly not least, make time to see the truly unique city of
Barcelona
on the northeastern coast of Spain. While there, get a real feel for the city by taking a biking tour to see attractions such as the legendary
Sagrada Familia
, still under construction after over 100 years, and the
gothic quarter
, which simply cannot be missed.

Enjoy all the adventures Spain has to offer, from
whalewatching in Tenerife
to
diving in Ibiza
. Visitors to Espana find treasures galore.
