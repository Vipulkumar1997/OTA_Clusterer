See the Burj Khalifa: The Best Views and Photo Spots


The most breathtaking view in Dubai is from the top of the Burj Khalifa, but how do you take a photo that illustrates just how tall the world's tallest building is? Here are our top five spots in Dubai for taking amazing photos of this architectural giant.

Palm Islands


The
Palm Islands
are the two artificial islands off the coast of Dubai. You'll get incredible views across the marina, looking back at the city.












The Dubai Mall (Waterfall Entrance on the Lower Ground)


From the Waterfall Entrance on the Lower Ground level of the
Dubai Mall
, the world's biggest mall, you get two views at once: the Burj Khalifa and the romantic Dubai Fountains water show.












Jumeirah Beach


Jumeirah is known as the Beverly Hills of Dubai. This public beach stretches along the south coast from the junction of The
Palm Jumeirah Island
.












The Address Downtown Dubai


Most lounges inside this luxury hotel offer brilliant vistas of the Burj Khalifa. We suggest afternoon tea on the Risala terrace, or drinks in the Neos sky lounge (on the 63rd floor).












Safa Park


Located 3 kilometers from the Burj Khalifa, this green space offers a dose of tranquility within the city -- and unique photos looking back across the lake, towards Dubai's skyscrapers.






Burj Khalifa: Our Tips




How do you get a great picture of the Burj Khalifa?


Be patient and get creative. The Burj Khalifa is so tall that it will look out of proportion compared to almost everything else in the city! This gives you a serious chance to go on a photography mission, and a really fun excuse to explore all that Dubai has to offer (perhaps with an organized tour!).




How do you buy tickets for Burj Khalifa itself?


Once you've taken an incredible photo, make sure you go to the At The Top observation deck inside Burj Khalifa and celebrate. Tip: Buy a Skip-the-Line ticket in order to avoid up to 1.5-hour wait times.




When is the best time of year to go to Dubai?


The summer season will be cheapest, but it will also be incredibly hot. From November to April, the temperatures will be plenty warm for the beach without being too overwhelming. One additional planning tip: the holy month of Ramadan (when many Dubai locals will be fasting from dawn until dusk) has a big impact on the city's tourist hotspots.





Good to Know






When to visit

Hours vary from season to season, but the At The Top observation deck is usually open from 12:00PM - 9:30PM daily.





What is the price?

The prices vary based on time of day, ticket time, and additional tour options.





Will I need a guide?

If you want one, of course! Whether you want to explore the city of Dubai, or specifically learn more about the architecture from the At The Top observation deck at the Burj Khalifa, there is a helpful tour guide to suit your needs.





How to get there

The Burj Khalifa is located in the heart of Dubai. Standing high at 163 floors tall, you won't be able to miss it.





Additional tips



FYI: The average wait time is 1.5 hours for tickets purchased at the door.

Make a note that the month of Ramadan will affect attraction opening times. Plan ahead when making travel plans to Dubai.

amazing experience with ridiculous behavior


Burj khalifa is amazing experience but I suppose to that prices for taken pictures by your employees are really ridiculous and that is really not apropriate for such a huge and proud building. In addition when the ticket is expensive enough

Sunset from the Burj Khalifa was a magical experience.


A must do when visiting Dubai. We took the 4:30 trip up and the highlight was watching the sun go down over the coast towards Jumerah.

Excellent efficient service and thoroughly enjoyable


We went in November and by booking with GYG we were able to pre-book the time for our visit (11.30am) and although we arrived in plenty of time at 9.30am, initially to just look around the area before going up the tower, we were allowed to do so immediately as there were no queues. We then spent over 2 hours on levels 124/125 with splendid views all around the city from both indoor and outdoor vantage points and there was no time-limit to how long we could stay there. The number of people did increase as time passed but not to the point where it became too overcrowded. Yes, some people might want to just quickly go up to take photos without anyone else in the way and then come down, but so might many others and you just have to wait your turn for the opportunity - and that is no fault of the company. This is certainly a "must do" when in Dubai and even if there are queues there is still plenty of information about the Burj's history and construction to look at whilst doing so.

Best of the Best. Number one in every category!


Number one in every category! The one thing that I love about Dubai is they have the best of everything. They are number one in every single category. And this building is no exception. Not only is it the tallest building in the world, has the fastest elevator in the world, the best views in the world, and the hospitality by the staff is unmatched. I would recommend this hotel 365 days out of the year, and even twice on Sunday. For the price to be able to experience something like that is unbelievable. Everyone on this planet should have an opportunity to be able to see this building at least once. To be able to experience the elevator ride, take a panoramic view with the city, have high-quality pictures taken of yourself for memories. Even the souvenirs are breathtaking. You get to bring home some of the statues of the actual hotel itself and a few other things to make your memories worthwhile. Don’t forget to get a picture of yourself next to the I love Dubai sign! Till next time!
