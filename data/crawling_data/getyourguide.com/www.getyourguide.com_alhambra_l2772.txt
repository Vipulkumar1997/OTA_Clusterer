5 Lovely Highlights of Alhambra Palace


Granada's Alhambra Palaces, built for the court of the Nasrid dynasty, date back to 889AD. So much history means there's quite a lot to learn. So, where should you start?












Alcazaba Military Fortress


This former stronghold is the oldest part of the complex, dating back to the 13th century. It protected the Muslim settlers of Andalucia from the Catholic Crusaders.












Generalife Gardens


Once the summer residence of the sultan, the palace is surrounded by lush vegetation in the gardens (now enjoyed by visitors in the present day!).












Courtyard of the Lions


View the main courtyard of the Nasrid dynasty's regal home, and take a step back into medieval Mediterranean times. Book a night tour to see the illuminated beauty of it all.












Hall of the Two Sisters


Named for large marble stones in the floor, this central hall boasts carefully-crafted lighting and intricate detail. Pause, and imagine the sultana and her family that lived here.












Albayzin


The palace is located in the
Albayzin
neighborhood. Find a winding side street in the town, and stop to take beautiful photos of the Alhambra from afar.






Alhambra: Our Tips




When can I visit?


The palace is open all year, except for December 25 (Christmas) and January 1 (New Year's Day).




What are the opening times?


The open times are divided into morning tickets (8:30AM to 2:00PM) and afternoon tickets (2:00PM to 8:00PM). Entry to the Nasrid Palaces is allocated per half-hour time slot. Tickets for the night visit to Nasrid Palaces are valid from 10:00PM to 11:30PM.




What should I wear?


There is no dress code for the palace, but be aware that some other Catholic establishments in the city may require arms and legs to be covered. And remember to stay in the shade and drink lots of water!




How do I get there?


Public transport (line C3) will take you right to the ticket office. Alternatively, you can walk. There are a few different routes from the city center (about 800m each). The most serene, beautiful, and historically interesting is the road from Plaza Nueva. The route will take you up the Cuesta de Gomérez, through the Gate of the Pomegranates, and into the tree-lined avenues that lead to the Alhambra.





Good to Know






When to visit

The palace is open all year, except for December 25 (Christmas) and January 1 (New Year's Day).





What is the price?

The adult ticket prices start at €14.00, and booking in advance is highly recommended.





Will I need a guide?

You may be interested in an expert's narration while you try to take in the architecture, room by room.





How to get there

Public transport (line C3), car, or on foot from the city center.





Additional tips



This attraction is free for children under twelve years old, but booking is still required.

Entrance to the Nasrid Palaces is allocated per half-hour time slot. Don't be late!

excellent guide and the headsets meant everyone could hear the guide


the Alhambra is a must-see place, we stayed on after the tour and explored further. The only way to appreciate the history and scale is with a guided tour

Thought we would ditch, ended up loving it!


I will be honest: We hadn't planned ahead and the Alhambra was sold out when we checked the night before. We bought these tickets at the last minute b/c I REALLY WANTED to go in, and we had every intention of finding an appropriate place to ditch the guide and go on our own.

She was awesome. We loved our guide and stayed with her and the group throughout the entire tour. The pace was perfect, she provided enough time for photos, made the Alhambra come alive with interesting facts, answered questions, and did a great job. In effect, she made our entire experience significantly better. I'd do it again!

Great tour, but there was no need for skip the line


If you are going on a weekday during the day there might not be a line depending on the time of year you go. Either way having a tour guide for La Alhambra is a must, and our tour guide was was great
