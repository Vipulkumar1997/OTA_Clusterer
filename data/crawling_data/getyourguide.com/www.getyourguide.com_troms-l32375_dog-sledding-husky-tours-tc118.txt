What People Are Saying About Tromsø








Tremendously enjoyed the activities with the dogs!


It was a great dog-sledding experience with beautiful scenery. We were provided with warm clothes as well, so no worries about wearing inappropriate pants or shoes! We got the chance to cuddle with husky puppies and other sled dogs. And the activity was round up with nice soup and tea.

Great fun - glad I was sitting in the sled!


I thought I had booked for 2 people to sit in a sled with a musher, so I was rather surprised when we arrived to be told that we were both booked to share the driving of a sled. Luckily my friend did all the hard work and I sat in the sled the whole time......it was great fun. We were lucky with the weather - blue skies, sun, crisp snow, beautiful scenery. The dogs were very friendly and we were able to stroke the puppies. Everything was well organised- the body suits we were lent were very warm - and the reindeer soup and cake was welcome after the morning in the fresh air. I would definitely recommend this to others for a great half day activity.
