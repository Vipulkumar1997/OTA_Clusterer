Ten Things You Need to See in Barcelona


Good football team, great beaches, delightful tapas, and dreamy architecture. There's just nothing bad about Barcelona, the Mediterranean seaside captial of Spain's Cataluyna region. Here are a few can't-miss attractions to put on your itinerary.












Sagrada Familia


Your Barcelona trip isn't complete without a visit to the
Sagrada Familia
(named a minor basilica by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010), dreamt up by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.












Passeig de Gràcia


Heading north from Plaça Cataluyna,
Passeig de Gracia
is the richest street in the city. Look up as you walk -- you won't want to miss the architecture along this road.












Camp Nou


If you're a fútbol lover, you'll be heading to
Camp Nou
. Spain's biggest stadium, seating over 99,000 fans, has been home to the Fútbol Club Barcelona since 1957.












Casa Milà (La Pedrera)


Known as "the stone quarry," Gaudí's ambitious
Casa Milà
is one of the most famous buildings from the early 20th century Catalan Modernisme (Art Nouveau) period.












Casa Batlló


From 1902 to 1906, Gaudí remodelled a perfectly ordinary apartment building for Josep Batlló, a textile tycoon. Tour the inside of the
Casa Batlló
to get a glimpse of Gaudí's incredible detail work.












Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC)


The
national Catalan museum of visual art
is housed inside the very regal-looking Palau Nacional, which sits high atop Montjuïc. Go for the art. Stay for the park and the views.












Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter)



Barri Gòtic
, located in the Ciutat Vella district, is the heart of Barcelona's old city. Explore its romantic, tiny alleys -- the perfect setting for lazy tapas and great photos.












Montserrat Mountain


Consider a daytrip to see the Catalan landscape. An hour's train journey from Barcelona,
Montserrat
is most well-known as the site of Benedictine abbey, Santa Maria de Montserrat.












Plaça del Rei


The "
King's Square
" is a 14th century square inside Barri Gòtic. The square and its Palau Reial Major, Cataluyna's royal palace, paint a picture of Barcelona's medieval history.












Museu d'Història de Barcelona (MUHBA)


The
City History Museum
conserves Barcelona's historical heritage, dating all the way back to Roman ruins. The museum is located in Plaça del Rei.






Planning Your Barcelona Visit




How many days should you spend in Barcelona?


There are plenty of fun things to do in Barcelona -- especially if you're also planning on partaking in the infamous nightlife scene. In three full days, you could visit all the major Gaudí sights, as well as the
Picasso and Miró museums
. You could also stay for a week or more. As for what to do with your extra days? Well, you'll have plenty of time to spend at the beach, visit the nearby village of Sitges, or go shopping in the Gothic Quarter.




What's the best way to get around town?


Barcelona is a wonderful city to explore by foot. You can easily stroll from La Rambla to the beach and then back to the Gothic Quarter in one afternoon. The city is pretty flat, so biking is an excellent option. If you love transportation, we suggest taking a trip to Tibidabo, the 1890s amusement park that overlooks the whole city. You'll take the metro, a tram, and a funicular -- and a ferris wheel ride, if that counts!




Which tours are the most fun?


We're glad you asked! From hot air balloon rides to bike tours to all-access guided walks of Gaudí masterpieces, there are a dozen options to spice up your Barcelona tourism. A lot of the architecture-based sightseeing is enhanced by the history and descriptions that a guide can offer you.

Best time to visit

Barcelona is a beach city at heart, so it's most lively in the summer. If you want to experience Barcelona at its best, schedule your trip around the festival of Sant Joan, or the "night of fire." Each year on June 23, the city celebrates with bonfires and parties until dawn.

What People Are Saying About Barcelona








Jordi was an excellent guide to this magnificent place.


I have only positives to say about the Sagrada Familia (an absolute must see in Barcelona) or our guide Jordi. Be sure to go up the tower for a wonderful view of Barcelona and close ups of the outside of the cathedral. The only tip I will give is to try to take a single language tour. Our group had mostly English speakers, but the guide had to give the whole tour in both English and Spanish for the few people in our group who did not speak English. I would not do a bilingual tour again unless it was the only option.

Worthy of the money and getting up at chill 7am


Ana is a fantastic guide! My friend and I had a really wonderful time there chatting and visiting La Pedrera with her! The view is soooo nice with less people getting into your scene, try it if you fancy doing photography. Also without people flooding in and with a nice, passionate and welcoming guide, you can see more places than usual tours at Casa Milà and ask whatever questions you have regarding this fantastic house.
我们的导赏员Ana是一个很热情的人，而且对于米拉之家非常了解。早上虽然有点冷有点困，门票也有点贵但是真的很值！因为人少所以基本可以和导赏员看完整个米拉之家的所有角落，而且因为是guided tour所以可以问问题，更好地去了解。喜欢摄影的伙伴儿们更可以试试看，因为人少所以非常好拍。之前有没看好的地方想在导赏之后继续看可是可以的。总之很推荐！真的玩得非常开心！

One of the best tours during our trip around Europe


We got a very enjoyable day. Places were gorgeous, like postcards. Guides were very professional and knowledge. In general very good organized with not wasting times. We loved the first village; the boat was very relaxing and was nice to see the fishes on the bottom of the boat. Very informative the last visit at Greek and Roman city.
It was a first class tour and absolutely recommended.

Excellent tour guides and accommodations


Our tour guide was Carol, and she was excellent. Very energetic, friendly, and a great guide on the history, geology, and most importantly... the wine.

We would recommend this tour to anyone and everyone. We were very appreciative of a wonderful day.
