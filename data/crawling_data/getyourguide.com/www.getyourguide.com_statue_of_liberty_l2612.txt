The Best Views of the Statue of Liberty


A symbol of freedom in the New York Harbor, the Statue of Liberty will give you a thrill the first time you spot her, whether you catch a glimpse from land, hop on a cruise, or get up close and personal on Liberty Island. Enjoy the view!












From the Staten Island Ferry


You can’t miss the ferry terminal next to
Battery Park
. Free, running every 30 minutes, and offering perfect views of the Statue as it passes, this is a 25-minute iconic boat ride.












Cruises to Liberty Island


Visit the lady herself. Boat tours take you to Liberty Island, where you can climb inside the Statue of Liberty. There’s also a chance to stop at
Ellis Island
on the same trip.












Sightseeing Cruises around New York Harbor


Cruises tour New York’s harbor, offering the best views as they sail past. The best way to see the Statue of Liberty at night is on a fancy dinner cruise.












From Red Hook, Brooklyn


If you want to stay on land, head to Red Hook - a great neighborhood with views of Lady Liberty from the end of Van Brunt Street or from Louis Valentino Jr. Pier and Park.












From Battery Park and Lower Manhattan


If you want to stay on land, and in Manhattan, enjoy views of the Statue of Liberty from the southern tip of Manhattan while strolling along the harbor through Battery Park.






Statue of Liberty: Our Tips




The Best Time to Visit the Statue of Liberty


The best time to see the Statue of Liberty is on a sunny day. A rainy foggy day on the harbor isn’t ideal, but the good news is that the sun shines bright in New York all four seasons of the year. A brisk sunny winter day with a bright blue sky is as New York as a hot steamy summer evening.




Where to Get the Ferry


Ferries leave directly from Battery Park ferry terminals if you’re headed to Liberty Island. If you want to cruise around the Statue of Liberty instead, you can find boats that board at any number of stops along the Hudson River in Midtown, Downtown, or in Battery Park.




How Long Is the Tour?


Cruises can be as short as an hour, or you can book some of the best Statue of Liberty boat tours in the evening, with a three-hour dinner cruise along the waterways. Seeing New York City’s lights and the Statue of Liberty at night is pretty majestic. Alternatively, you can easily see both Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty in one 3-hour tour.




Where to Buy Tickets


Buy tickets online to avoid the hassle of lines. Keep in mind that if you are going to Liberty Island, take only a small bag. You will be screened by security during admission and backpacks and other large items are not allowed. Pack a snack too!

What People Are Saying About Statue of Liberty








Tour was great and made seeing Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island


Tour was great and made navigating travel on boat. dealing with lines, crowds so much easier. Only issue was when we arrived at Battery Park there were multiple people from tour company (s)? that told us to go to the boat when we were actually trying to find the book store to meet tour so it was a little confusing.

I enjoyed it! we visit all the places that were on my list


It was a good experience, I had two days only in New York, and with this trip I succeeded to visit all the most important places.
The guide is special, you will not feel bored, and you will learn about the places you are visiting.
Good time for taking photos, enjoying the places and be back on time.
The group was small, about 9 people, I had a good time.

So informative and entertaining! Well worth the price!


Evan, our tour guide, was full of spunk and energy and knew a treasure chest of history and information. He kept everything on a very comfortable pace with everything smooth-sailing. He made the tour exciting and I learned so much. My appreciation has come to another level for the history of NY and the immigrants that came over and made this country a lot of what it is today.

Reasonable trip, guide could have been better


Whilst the actual trip was enjoyable we thought the trip actually included the 9/11 museum - so were disappointed that it didn't. The guide we had whilst knew a lot about Ellis Island left us on our own at the Statue of Liberty whilst other trips their guide accompanied them and took them around the museum there explaining an awful lot more about the Statue, we only found the museum by chance and others missed it completely, which was not good
