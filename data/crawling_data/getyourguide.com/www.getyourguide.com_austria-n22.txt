Where to go in Austria



The beautiful city of
Vienna
, the capital city of Austria with a rich musical history welcomes you. Enjoy a memorable
Mozart
concert at the Golden Hall of Musikverein or the Vienna State Opera. For a close-up of all that Vienna has to offer, start your day with a guided bicycle tour and follow that with a guided photographic expedition of the city. The Imperial Vienna tour takes you along the Ringstrasse to the City Park, Opera House, Parliament, Museumquarter, Hofsburg, and more plus you can do some shopping if you like.

Visit the magical city of
Salzburg
and take a tour of the Mozart family home. Attend a Mozart dinner concert at the Stiftskeller concert hall which transforms into a magnificent dining hall. The Salzburg city tour that encompasses both the old and new sections of the city including the Fortress Hohensalzburg is not to be missed. Exploring the art and architecture of Salzburg at your own pace is easy on a flexible on-and-off bus and walking tour. Mountains surround the beautiful scenery where the movie
The Sound of Music
was filmed, this is an unforgettable tour for everyone.

Not far from Salzburg is
Innsbruck
, gateway to hiking and skiing adventures in the Tyrol region. The Gundolf family entertains everyone daily with authentic
folk music
plus Tyrolean songs and dances.
