The 10 Best Things to Do in Dubrovnik


Dubrovnik is a must-see city! Set against a backdrop of a cobalt blue sea, the old town walls have protected its architectural treasures in a pretty package for centuries. Once visiting this gem on the Adriatic coast, you'll promise to return again.












Stradun


Paved in limestone that shimmers like water in the sunlight, the
pedestrian street
from the 11th century runs through the heart of the old town and is popular day and night.












Dubrovnik Cathedral


Dedicated to St. Blaise, today's 18th-century
Baroque structure
stands on the site of previous cathedrals. A gold-plated arm, leg and skull of the saint are in the treasury.

Dubrovnik Synagogue


Located on Ulica Žudioska (Jewish Street), it's the
world's oldest Sephardic synagogue still in use
and dates to 1408. It's also the second oldest in Europe, the one in Prague is the oldest.












City Walls of Dubrovnik


The construction of the
wall
to encircle the city started in the 9th century. It underwent further enhancements, including the addition of 15 forts, in the 15th century.












Lovrijenac


Built upon a rock 121 feet above the sea, the
fort
dates to the early 14th century. The inscription over the entrance reads: Freedom is not sold for all the gold in the world.

Mt. Srđ


For a stunning view of Dubrovnik's waves of terracotta rooftops punctuating an endless, azure blue sea, take the cable car up to this mountain top rising over 1300 feet.












Trsteno Arboetum


The lush botanical park in the town of Trsteno boasts a Renaissance residence, Neptune Fountain, and aqueduct. The two Oriental Plane trees at the entrance are 500 years old.












Koločep


Also known as Kalamota Island, this
tranquil spot
is a quick trip from Dubrovnik. Enjoy a dip in the crystal clear waters or a paddle by kayak through the Blue Cave.












Lokrum


With boat service every 30 minutes from Dubrovnik,
the island
is a great getaway for the day. There are hiking trails, plenty of peacocks wandering around and places that serve lunch.












Korčula



The island
is famous for its white wines and some say the birthplace of Marco Polo. Blessed with great architecture and history - the town of Korčula will certainly enchant you.






Planning Your Dubrovnik Visit




How many days to spend in Dubrovnik?


You can see the major attractions within the walled city in two full days, but consider Dubrovnik as a base to explore the surrounding area on some day-trips. This option also allows you to enjoy spending more time in the old town in the evening.




Getting around


You'll only need your own two feet when visiting the attractions in the old town. At first it may seem like a complex maze to navigate, but it's fun to explore. You'll find one side of the Stradun is flat, while the other side is steep in parts. Buses 1A, 1B and 1C run regularly between the old town and the main bus station.




Where to stay in Dubrovnik


Staying within the old town is an ideal place to be, but suggested areas outside the city walls include Lapad and Ploce, the later being a bit hilly with nice views over historical Dubrovnik.

Best time to visit

The cruise ships and 'Game of Thrones' fans flood the city from May to August. Its best to visit during the late Spring when you can wander the city freely and the weather warm but not yet at peak heat. Keep in mind the boats to the islands are infrequent during the off-season.

What People Are Saying About Dubrovnik








The tour was very great for the cost; glad I didn't buy it on ship.


Eventhough I do not not watch Game of Thrones, the tour was more of a sightseeing tour for me. 2 hours was more than enough time for me. The castle and buildings were beautiful and I loved the sights in Croatia.

Fantastic day trip, excellent guide... a MUST do!


The day trip to Bosnia & Herzegovina is a must do. We were picked up on time and immediately started our road trip to Bosnia. Kruno is an excellent guide... absolutely world class! From the first greeting, he was warm and welcoming. He made all the guests feel comfortable with his safe and careful driving. He allowed us all more than enough time at each stop to enjoy all that was on offer. Kruno entertained us all with interesting stories and history on Croatia and Bosnia sharing his knowledge on all the areas we visited plus more. Even though we were only in Bosnia for a day, with this tour and all the villages you visit, you will feel as if you've emerged yourself in the country. Kruno points out the "local" things you can do; eat and drink so that you get the full experience. The drive was amazing with lots of beautiful scenery ... the Dalmation Coast and beautiful Bosnian countryside - vineyards, mountains and valleys. Mostar is a fascinating town to visit! 5 stars!

Well organised trip, with some behind the scenes stories


A well planned route through the locations, with great pictures from Game of Thrones shown by our guide, to help us visualise the place in action. Our guide had worked on the show, so was able to give us some really detailed information on the making of the programme. Lots of opportunity to take pictures in the settings, and some history of Dubrovnik thrown in for good measure. Would recommmed.
