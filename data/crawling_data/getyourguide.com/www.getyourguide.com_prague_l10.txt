The 10 Top Attractions in Prague


Despite its relatively small size, the Czech capital of Prague is jam-packed with magnificent sights, each endowed with a long and varied history. To make the most of your visit there, make sure to include these 10 attractions in your itinerary.












Vltava River


The
Vltava River
cuts across Prague's centre. Jump aboard one of the many tour boats and take in the wonderful sights on both sides of the river while sipping a delicious Czech beer.












Charles Bridge


600 years old,
Charles Bridge
is one of Prague's most iconic landmarks. Beautifully decorated with rows of 30 baroque-style statues, it's a perfect spot for a romantic stroll.












Old Town Square


The
Old Town Square
in Prague offers a charmingly eclectic mix of architectural styles spanning several centuries – undoubtedly one of Europe's most beautiful sights.












Prague Castle


The largest ancient castle in the world, as well as one of the most gorgeous,
Prague Castle
has been home to all the different Czech heads of state ever since the 9th century.












Prague National Theatre


The
Prague National Theatre
is a resplendent neo-Renaissance building on the banks of the Vltava River, magnificent both inside and out, is often singled out as the finest achievement of Czech architecture.












Jewish Quarter (Josefov)


Despite its turbulent history,
the Jewish Quarter
in Prague has maintained most of its historical buildings and is now the best preserved Jewish historical complex in Europe.












Wenceslas Square


Now a lively shopping and tourist area,
Wenceslas Square
at the center of Prague's New Town has been the site of many of the city's most important events throughout history.












Astronomical Clock


Dating back to 1410,
this astronomical clock
is the third-oldest in the world and the oldest still in operation. Don't miss its fantastic moving display on the hour, every hour.












Kampa Island


Located between Prague Castle and Charles Bridge,
Kampa Island
's romantic atmosphere will enchant you. From its banks you can enjoy the best views of Pragues's many monuments.












St. Vitus Cathedral


An example of Gothic architecture at its finest, the spectacular
St. Vitus Cathedral
is the largest church in the country as well as one of the most important.






Planning Your Prague Visit




Discover Czech Beer


True to its reputation, Czech beer is delicious. A newcomer might be confused by the beer's alcohol content, however. Don't worry, the numbers given to the beers don't indicate their alcohol percentage. They refer to the alcohol degree, which is a much more complicated factor. As a rule of thumb, 10 and 12 degrees, the most common, are equivalent to roughly 4% and 5% respectively. Some beers go all the way up to 19 degrees – that's 8% alcohol!




Try a Czech Hot Dog


Believe it or not, one of Prague's culinary highlights are its hot dogs. Infinitely superior to their American counterparts, these delicious sausages stuffed in French baguettes offer the best cheap lunch in town. Stalls are peppered throughout the city, just take your pick!

Best time to visit

Prague is probably most pleasant to visit in the spring (Mar-May) and autumn (Sep-Nov) as the weather is more mild and there are fewer tourists than in the summer months.

What People Are Saying About Prague








Super Tour, great view over Prague by night

A good tour, not quite so much fun as reviews gave you to believe


Hi
I had high expectations having read reviews that spoke of funny tour guides. I guess it’s luck of the draw. Ours was very informative, although I was expecting more stories about the Jewish quarter having read the reviews. So all in all a good tour that shows you the major sights but didn’t quite live up to expectations

Wonderful and exciting tour of the most beautiful place is CZ Republic


Alis's tour of Bohemian national park and Saxon Switzerland was great. He is a great tour guide and is very knowledgeable about his country. He has a great sense of humor and knows the national parks like the back of his hand. We hiked through just like a local would and we didn't feel like 'tourists' at all. He took us to a local restaurant recommending us what to order. He also drove us through the countryside and told us all about the towns. We had a wonderful time and would 100% recommend taking this tour with him!

Cool bone church, nice guild and good length!


Ian was a funny, informative, friendly guide who made the day very enjoyable. The town was about an hour and 15 minutes away and once we got there we saw the bone church, st. barbara's cathedral and a little bit of the town. Lunch was not included, but most people go to the recommended restaurant which has great food and cheap prices!
