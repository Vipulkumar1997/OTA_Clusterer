The Top 10 Things to Do in Hamburg


Thanks to centuries of sea trade, the vibrant city of Hamburg offers an unparalleled wealth and variety of culture. Stay a weekend, stay a week – you're sure to fall for its irresistible charm. Whatever you do, don't miss out on these 10 highlights!












St. Pauli


Don't let
St. Pauli
's skull and crossbones flag deter you. This traditionally working class neighborhood is now one of Hamburg's most culturally diverse and vibrant areas.












Reeperbahn


Also known as the "most sinful mile,"
the Reeperbahn
is Hamburg's infamous red-light district. Nowadays it's a bustling and highly popular locale, home to the city's best nightlife.












Hamburg Dungeon


Discover the dark side of Hamburg's history on a fun and interactive tour – but be warned, the
Hamburg Dungeon
is not for the faint of heart!












Alster Lakes


These two beautiful lakes surrounded by parks are ideal for a break. Have a picnic, jog along the water, or take a boat out. At
Alster Lakes
you'll forget that you're in the middle of a city.












Hamburg Harbor


The
Port of Hamburg
has an important economic role in the city and is still today one of the busiest ports worldwide. Take a stroll along Germany's "Gateway to the World" gorgeous historic harbor and top it off with a snack from the famous fish market.




Speicherstadtmuseum


The Speicherstadt, Hamburg's warehouse district, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Well worth a visit, the
Speicherstadtmuseum
offers fascinating insight into the city's rich trade history.












Hamburg Zoo (Tierpark Hagenbeck)


Whatever your age, you're sure to love this charming zoo, where every care has been taken to make the animals feel at home. The aquarium next door is equally impressive.




Finkenwerder


If you're looking to enjoy a delicious seafood meal, head to this quaint riverside neighborhood. The restaurant Landungsbrucken Finkenwerder has long been a local favorite.




Herbertstraße


A gated street entirely dedicated to legal prostitution and lined with classic "windows." If the Reeperbahn didn't satisfy your curiosity, the nearby
Herbertstraße
certainly will.












Harbor Piers (Landungsbruecken)


Stroll along the
Landungsbruecken
to watch the ships come and go, then hop on a ferry and enjoy an inexpensive and picturesque ride across the waters en route to your next destination.






Planning Your Hamburg Visit




Save Money on Transport


If you plan on discovering the many sides of Hamburg, it's really worth getting bundle transport tickets. Different deals are available depending on the length of your stay and you're sure to save a lot of money rather than buying singles each time. Also, these tickets give you access to the ferries, which are the cheapest way of admiring the city from the water.




Wait for the Spring


Hamburg is infamous for its grey, cold winters. If you can, it's best to plan your visit between April and September. Once the weather improves, the city truly transforms – moods soar, streetside cafés fill up, and the parks and lakes once again become bustling hang-out spots.




Eat Like a Local Without Breaking the Bank


Known for its gigantic portions and very reasonable prices, the restaurant Erika's Eck near the Schlachthof has been a favorite for locals and tourists alike for over 30 years now. This is the perfect spot to feast on some original German grub and if you're out on the town, come here after midnight for its famous €1 sandwiches – available until 9am!

Super venue, fabulous guide, great tour.


Probably the best tour I've ever taken. The guide was great, clear, logical, interesting, with great presentation skills and all the facts and figures without them being overpowering. The venue is dramatic and full of crazy ideas. OK the costs overran a bit, but I think you got value for money in the mid term at least if not in the short term.

Although the ads were in English, the commentary was not.


Purely a visual tour in our case, the commentary was in German. Also a bit difficult to find the right boat.

Activity suited for everyone and all ages - not only train enthusiasts! There's so much love for detail and even more to see. Fascinating stuff! Loved every minute in the Miniatur Wunderland! Would recommend it to everybody.

Good general introduction to the Hamburg Harbour


Good general introduction to the Hamburg Harbour. Boat was OK but the there was only one bartender and it took a long time to have something to drink. Despite of this the experience was positive.
