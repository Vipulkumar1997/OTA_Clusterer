Top 5 most famous paintings at the Rijksmuseum


As well as historical artifacts, the Netherlands' national museum boasts much of the country's best art. With over 2,000 works from the Dutch Golden Age by luminaries like Rembrandt, Van Gogh, and Vermeer, here are a few must-sees to help plan your visit!












The Milkmaid by Johann Vermeer


A drizzle of milk is the only movement in Vermeer's exemplary study of a woman engaged in daily routine – as much the artist's trademark as his exquisite rendering of light.












Self Portrait by Vincent Van Gogh


This early self-portrait captures the artist's transition into the Post-Impressionist style that would define his seminal works. A perfect aperitif for the nearby
Van Gogh Museum
!












The Battle of Waterloo by Jan Willem Pieneman


Though storm clouds linger over Napoleon's army, a patch of sunlight pierces through to illuminate the Anglo-Dutch heroes. No prizes for guessing which side the artist was on!












Early Self Portrait by Rembrandt


Unusual for a self-portrait, Rembrandt's face is cast in shadow. Is he commenting on the vanity of his contemporaries, or have we just been duped into paying closer attention?












The Threatened Swan by Jan Asselijn


Asselijn's swan adopts an almost kung-fu-like stance against an approaching hound. Though its intentions are unclear, it was soon adopted as a symbol of national resistance!






Rijksmuseum: Our Tips




Best time to visit?


The Rijksmuseum is open from 9:00AM to 5:00PM every day of the year (yep, even Christmas!). To avoid queues, arrive before 10:00AM or after 3:00PM, although the latter won't allow you time to see much. April, May, and August are its busiest months, when visitors can expect to queue for about half an hour at peak times.




How to get there?


The Rijksmuseum is located in
Museumplein
(Museum Square) in Amsterdam South. It can be reached via trams 2 and 5 to the Rijksmuseum tram stop, 7 and 12 to Museumplein, and 10 to Spiegelgracht.v




How much time?


Obviously some visitors will prefer to take their time with each artwork, while others may have an itinerary of the best bits so they can skip the rest. Either way, plan a minimum of 2-3 hours there.





Good to Know






When to visit

The museum is open 365 days a year from 9:00AM to 5:00PM.





What is the price?

Adult ticket prices start at 17.50€.





Will I need a guide?

It will definitely help. Might be worth it to check our these best-selling tours.





How to get there

Trams 2, 5, 7, 10 and 12 all stop near the Rijksmuseum. Check the name of the stop before you head out!





Additional tips



The Rijksmuseum Gardens, Shop and Café are open to visitors without a ticket.

Visitors under 18 gain free admission to the museum.

Impressive exhibit layout! Tastefully done!!!


The museum had a wide array of carefully selected artifacts and art works that mostly reflected indicated periods of time, giving us, visitors, a glimpse of history. As a participant, not just as a voyeur.
Fast-tracking entrance to the museum certainly helped me to enjoy more of the place.

Great way to avoid the line at Rijksmuseum


We took tram 2 from the train station, got off at one stop before Museumplein, walked a couple of blocks to the office on the canal banks, got the tickets for the museum and booked a time for our cruise.

So much see, give yourself plenty of time to full appreciate


Fantastic place, although a bit humid, so many lovely pieces of furniture and paintings, took loads of photos. Unfortunately we only got half way round and had to leave to have lunch and go into another activity. Will definitely be going back to finish off the tour. The only downside was having to que and being charged for digital guides and there being only one person on the counter.
