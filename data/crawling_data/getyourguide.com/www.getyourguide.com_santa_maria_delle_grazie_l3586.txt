5 Reasons to Visit Santa Maria Delle Grazie


Mainly known as the home of Leonardo Da Vinci's world-famous The Last Supper, Santa Maria Delle Grazie in Milan is a magnificent church and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here are 5 reasons to visit this stunning and eclectic hybrid of architectural styles.












Leonardo Da Vinci's
The Last Supper



Few paintings are as iconic as Da Vinci's 15th century mural. Though nearly destroyed on many occasions, thanks to a recent restoration, it can now be admired in all its splendor.












The Facade


The exterior demonstrates the church's mix of architectural styles: while the sober terracota facade exemplifies the Lombard tradition, the lavish entrance is in Renaissance style.












The Nave


The central nave and the adjacent aisles, with their highly ornate and exquisitely frescoed arches, are splendid examples of Late Gothic architecture.












The Dome


Designed by the eminent Renaissance architect Donato Bramante, this remarkable dome is camouflaged on the outside – its hemisphere is only apparent from the church's interior.












The Cloister of Frogs


The lovely garden of this inner cloister, named after the statues that spout water into the fountain, is ideal for a picturesque breather from the bustle of Milan.






Santa Maria delle Grazie: Our Tips




Book in Advance for Last Supper


If you want to see The Last Supper, it's necessary to reserve tickets ahead of time. Visits are limited to 15-minute viewing slots. Tickets sell out fast, so you should plan well in advance – in the high season, for example, they sometimes sell out 3 months in advance!




Access the Cloister Any Time


As mentioned above, the cloister is a lovely spot to take a break and renew your energies. If you want to visit the cloister but mass is ongoing, don't worry, you can also access the cloister from a side door at the back of the church.





Good to Know






When to visit

Open 7 AM - noon, 3-7PM Monday through Saturday; 7.30AM - 12.15PM, 3.30-9PM on Sundays.





What is the price?

Church admission: Free. Last Supper viewing: € 6.50 + € 1.50 booking fee





Will I need a guide?

Not compulsory but recommended





How to get there

The Church of Santa Maria delle Grazie is in between two metro stations: Cadorna Triennale and Conciliazone. It’s a 15-minute walk from the
Duomo
or a quick taxi ride.





Additional tips



Make sure to book in advance to view The Last Supper.

Check weather before visiting and dress accordingly.

Unmissable tour, moving, informative, humorous and memorable, perfect!


I do hope I have the name of our guide correct - Charles? It was an excellent tour, but wish I'd paid attention to his name at the outset. It was excellent, detailed, informative, appropriate humour, respectful, moving, memorable. If I had the chance to tour Italy, this chap would be my choice! This company in fact as we did did several excellent tours with exceptional guides. In terms of logistics, this tour company get it right, meeting point , signs, timing, information - all spot on - thank you so much, you made our trip special.
