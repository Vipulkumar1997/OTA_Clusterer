5 Magical Moments On A London Harry Potter Tour


The boy who lived, and ignited a generation of wizards! A trip to London isn't complete without searching out a few of your favorite wizarding world places. Grab some floo powder, and find the real-life locations of Diagon Alley and other Harry Potter haunts.

Platform 9 and 3/4


Head to
King’s Cross
, and push your cart and owl onto the platform just like Harry. Look for the queue of fellow First Years in the main departures hall.












The Great Hall


The enchanted dining hall--recreated at
Warner Bros. Studios
--was inspired by the real dining hall at Oxford’s Christ Church College.












Hogwarts Express


The real British steam locomotive (name: Olton Hall) is now a museum display at Warner Bros. Studios. All aboard for the 11 o'clock to Hogwarts!

The Leaky Cauldron


Head to Leadenhall Market. At 42 Bull's Head Passage, you'll see a familiar-looking optician's shop (AKA: the entrance to The Leaky Cauldron!).

The Ministry of Magic


The exterior shots for the Ministry of Magic were filmed at its rather appropriate real-life counterpart: Great Scotland Yard.






Planning Your Visit




How far away from London is the Warner Bros. Studio?


Warner Bros. Studio is located 20 miles north-west from central London, in Leavesden.



How do you get to the Warner Bros. Studio?


The closest railway station is Watford Junction, a quick 20-minute train ride from London's Euston Station. There are also plenty of shuttle buses that leave from central London. Transportation to and from London is often included in a Warner Bros Studio tour, so check out all your options before you book.



Can you take a Harry Potter tour without leaving London?


The world of Harry Potter is
the world of London
, meaning you can do a lot of sightseeing without ever leaving the city. Take a black cab or a night bus around town, and visit the film locations for the Ministry of Magic. And, of course, you can go to Kings Cross (a real-life train station) and take photos in front of Platform 9 and ¾.

What People Are Saying About London








The overall trip was fantastic, however the guide was 30 mins late


The overall experience was exciting and enjoyable, however the guide was 30 minutes late arriving to begin the tour which had all the customers waiting and feeling very anxious, although she arrived and apologized numerous times for her late arrival, I felt it affected the amount of time we had to spend at the studio and felt this part of the trip ended up being quite rushed and felt under pressure to move quickly from one area to the next to ensure we were able to see the whole studio. I would have liked more time to be able to take my time to enjoy all the amazing things at the studio.

Wonderful experience for Harry Potter fans of any age.


Everything was great, transportation was easy, guide was great and knowledgeable. The ability to take the tour with a guide and then go back and spend more time was well worth it.

Make sure you have time at the bus station!


Went to the Coach station well before departure but ended up waiting at the wrong Tour Guides Bus stop...so we missed the bus. So hard to find so make sure you'll have plenty of time to find the right stop for your bus and make sure to have max sound and your phone available!!!
Everything turned out fine and the bus driver tried to call (didn't hear it). Called back and got excellent help to find our own way to the studio where our tickets waited for us.
Went there with my mum (62) and brother (24) who are fans. I've seen the movies but long time ago.
To enjoy the studio to the fullest you need to know the movies, be a fan or a kid. It's cool to see the masks and sets etc but the more you know before the more details you understand. (Mum loved it :-)
Maybe I'll go there again if I ever have kids who can experience it more.
All the People working in the studio was A+++.

Best way to get to know London with Harry Potter eyes


It was our first time in London and we fell in love with it thanks to our guide Tony. He was professional and knew so much about Harry Potter stories! Made it fun even for muggles :) Took us to fantastic places we would normally never find. I was especially impressed by his patience and professionalism with one of our fellow visitors who was on a wheelchair.

Wonderful experience for Harry Potter fans young and old!


Well organized and easy to enjoy. Train trip was pleasant and bus service to Warner Brothers site was top notch. The knowledge and background information provided by the guide was well worth the ticket price.
