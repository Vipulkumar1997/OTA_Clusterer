is the worlds largest annual funfair. If you like music, beer and lederhosen then look no further!

If you want to eat some real German food and drink some real German beer on your trip, then
the Hofbräuhaus München beerhall

Planning Your Munich Visit




How many days to spend in Munich?


If you're just going to tick the city off the list, then 3 days will satisfy any tourist's sightseeing needs. But for a more relaxed trip and to really get to know the city, a week's stay will be much more suitable.




Where to stay?


With public transport being so efficient, location depends on what you want your experience to be. If you want to be close to the main sights, then look for something in Altstadt. For a more modest budget, look in Ludwigsvorstadt near the Hauptbahnhof and the Oktoberfest grounds. Or if you're in the city for the nightlife, then Schwabing, Maxvorstadt, and the Gärtnerplatzviertel-Glockenbachviertel areas will be your best bet.

What People Are Saying About Munich








A captivating city and a fantastic tour guide!!


Highly recommend this tour. To start, the meeting point was easy to find and the train ride was comfortable. The orientation tour was fantastic... our tour guid, Lucia, was entertaining and informative. She provided great information on history and advice on the "must-do" activities. It was the perfect balance of a guided tour and free time to explore!!

excellent tour by Eric - very informative and respectful


very good guided tour by Eric who was able to impart just the right amount of knowledge to keep our attention over a number of hours. The tour was well timed and quite moving - as noted by the quietness of the group as we moved around. Done with respect to all of those who suffered and died there
