What People Are Saying About Reykjavik








Minke, Porpoise, Hump back and White beaked Dolphins!


Massive thanks for this awesome tour, completely blew my expectations out of the water, (no pun intended) :) excellent guidance from the Marine biologist Jonathan. We not only saw White beaked dolphins, Harbour Porpoises and a minke whales we where gifted with a very rare sighting of a Humpback Whale close to land. Obviously you are always relying on Mother Nature for a tour like this... but the Ship was In great condition, very comfy and they even provide warm overalls which wt a real lifesaver. +motion sickness tablets for anyon with potentially wobbly sea legs!

Nothing prepares you for the first time you see a dorsal fin


The company was easy to find, and all I had to do to check in was say my name. There were warm, waterproof overalls for those of us who like to sit on deck, even though it was rather chilly, but there was also a nice indoor seating area with hot drinks and warm sandwiches. Furthermore, I would like to say that I'm most impressed by the fact that all whale watching companies work together so ships from all companies can have a sighting. Putting aside capitalism for the environment and customer service is incredible. It would have been nice to see a humpback whale, but these are wild animals that do as they please, so we can't predict these things. Besides, the dolphins got really close, and it was just incredible. I have nothing bad to say about my experience with this group.

Fantastic experience - knowledgeable guide and dolphins + whales!


My wife and I had a great experience, and saw numerous Minke whales, white-beaked dolphins, and gannets diving for fish (which I had never seen before). What made this especially unique was the guide. He clearly had a passion for and knowledge of marine biology. Instead of just being a spotter, he was also an educator, and during the way back gave a miniature lecture on cetacean biology and behavior complete with whale vertebrae, baleen, and ear bones. Overall, the trip was worth much more than the entrance fee!
