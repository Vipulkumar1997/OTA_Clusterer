Where to go in Italy



Italy is one of the most popular destinations in Europe for travelers. From the
Dolimite
and
Apennine
Mountains to the
Italian Riviera
, Italy offers something for every taste.

As cliché as it may sound, no trip to Italy is complete without a stop in Rome. So much of not only Italy's history but that of the world can be traced to ancient Rome. Get a feel for the way the emperor's lived and see the famous
Colosseum
. Christians and non-Christians alike visit the
Vatican
to see
St. Peter's Basilica
and the
Sistine Chapel
while hoping to get glimpse of the
Pope
himself.

The city of
Venice
was designed to face the water, not the streets of the city. Some of the best views of Venice are from the sea. However, no one should go to Venice without traversing the city in a gondola. Inland from Venice to the north and to the west are Milan and Florence.


Milan
is the largest city in Italy and is full of bustling, big city atmosphere, but there is one must-see attraction there. The church of
Santa Maria della Grazie
has on display what may be the greatest painting of the Renaissance –
The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci
.


Florence
is famous for the part it played in starting the Renaissance period and has been home to
Michelangelo's David
for over 500 years.

Italy is rich in
history
,
art
, and
architecture
. You can visit Roman ruins, get your fill of Renaissance art, stay in small medieval towns, go skiing in the Alps, discover the canals of Venice and be awed by beautiful churches.
