Amazing sailing experience, highly recommended!


If you enjoy being on a sailboat cruising on the sea, then this tour is highly recommended!! I booked the tour for my partner's birthday. We thoroughly enjoyed the tour! The skipper was very friendly and provided excellent service! The scenery along the coast in Lisbon was also beautiful to see!

A tour thoroughly enjoyed because of a knowledgeable, jovial guide.


The tour was provided by Celina Tours and the Guide who accompanied our family was Mr Carlos who is jovial and exceptionally talented in the field. Our one full day tour would not have been better but for Carlos who was constantly and throughout with us explaining every aspect of monuments and city sight seeing. We thoroughly enjoyed the full day Lisbon tour and recommend Mr Carlos to anyone.

Excellent and fun way to see all the major sights in lisbon


We travelled to Lisbon as a group of 9 friends for my sisters hen party. This was by far one of the best things we did whilst in lisbon. We got to see all the major sights and things we would probably have missed. Our guides were brilliant and very patient with us all taking lots of pics! They even gave us nearly an extra hour to stop at sights at no extra cost. I would highly recommend to anyone. A definite must and more fun than the regular tour bus.
