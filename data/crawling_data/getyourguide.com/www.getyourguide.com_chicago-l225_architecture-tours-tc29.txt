What People Are Saying About Chicago








Fantastic cruise with a passionate and knowledgeable guide


Our tour guide was so passionate and knowledgeable about the architecture of key buildings in the city and even had images of proposed and approved new buildings on key sites. So interesting. I'd highly recommend the architecture cruise.

Wonderful Tour--Rachael was the best guide ever!!!


I highly recommend the evening tour when it is is starting to get dark. Seeing the buildings in the daylight and then light by night was great. It is all about the guide--Rachael (think she spelled it differently) was absolutely amazing. She really new her history and had an appreciation of the architects/architecture. You can tell she just really loves what she does.
