The 10 Attractions You Must See in Dubai


Dubai has transformed itself in recent years with a series of creative, ambitious construction projects that have catapulted this city to the top of every bucket list. Here are a few attractions you won't want to miss when you visit this desert hotspot.












Burj Khalifa


At 829.8 meters tall, the
Burj Khalifa
stands proudly as the world's tallest building. Visit the observation deck on the 124th floor for a gravity-defying, jaw-dropping view.












Dubai Fountains


Brought to you by the same team behind the Bellagio fountains in Las Vegas, the
Dubai Fountain
show is a true spectacle. Grab a seat in a nearby cafe, and take it all in.












Burj al Arab


Dubai is home to the world's tallest hotel, the
Burj Al-Arab
. If you can't afford the $15,000/night luxury suite, try dining amongst the sea creatures in the underwater restaurant!












Palm Islands


There are two palm-shaped artificial islands off the coast.
Palm Jumeirah
already houses luxury villas and a waterpark. The larger Palm Jebel Ali is still under construction.












The World Dubai


Just 2.5 kilometers off the coast,
The World Dubai
is an artificial archipelago in the shape of the world map. These 300 mini-islands are secluded properties for exclusive investors.












Jumeirah Beach


Dubai gets some intense sun. And that means you'll be needing a beach. Jumeirah Beach is the best sandy strip in town, and the hub of hotels makes it a great homebase for tourists.












Dubai Creek


The
creek
divides Dubai into two towns (Deira to the north, Bur Dubai to the south). Check out the Dhow Wharfage, where some fishing dhows have anchored for over a century.












Dubai Museum


The
Dubai museum
is housed inside the 18th century Al-Fahidi Fort. Learn about the Emirates expansion after the oil boom, and examine traditional Emirati musical instruments.












Dubai Mall


In a city this well-known for luxury, you better believe the
Dubai mall
is a must-see! Inside, you'll find an entrance to Burj Khalifa, an ice-skating rink, a games center, and a cinema.












Dubai Marina


Spanning three kilometers along the Persian Gulf, the
Dubai Marina
will be the largest man-made marina in the world upon completion, and house over 12,000 residents and tourists.






Planning Your Dubai Visit




How many days should you spend in Dubai?


For non-architects, three to four days will be plenty of time to see everything you need to see. Be very mindful of when you choose to visit. The weather gets very hot between May and September, and uncomfortable if you aren't used to the desert heat.




Where should you stay in Dubai?


You will have your choice of impressive hotel rooms in this city. For the more budget-conscious travelers, know that you won't have to miss out just because you can't afford to stay at the fancier places! Plan ahead for experiences at Dubai's luxury hotels. Make dinner reservations at Burj Al-Arab, or stop by for an afternoon cocktail (and view of the Burj Khalifa) at The Address Downtown Dubai.




Be conscious of cultural differences


If you are heading to Dubai for the first time, you may have questions about the laws that Western tourists consider unusual. In short, be respectful. Dress conservatively and make sure your shoulders are covered. Public displays of affection are considered unlawful. Also, the consumption of alcohol in public is illegal, except in specified bars.

What People Are Saying About Dubai








This was an amazing experience! Highly recommended.


Compared to the desert safari we did last year with another tour operator, this was definitely the better one. Our driver John, was superb at this job and his customer care was fabulous. No trip to Dubai would be complete without a trip to the desert.

Everything did not work out as promised but generally well thought!


Too much driving around and waiting before the trip actually started. Tour guide was bit nervous because of the wasted time and he left out the women’s museum from the program without any explanation.

Do not miss this! It is so much fun! :-)


We enjoyed this desert safari so much!!! We heard about it from a friend and so glad we were able to experience it. It was well organised, our guide Ansar was so helpful! He is not only a very experienced driver, but photographer and entertainer at the same time. Everything was perfect, the quad ride, the sand boarding and camel ride. The BBQ was really nice and the 2 dancers were amazing too. I wish I could go back now!
