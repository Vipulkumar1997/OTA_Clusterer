Blackford Hill


It may not be as famous as Calton Hill or Arthur's Seat, but Blackford Hill has views that are just as gorgeous. It's also home to the Royal Observatory, a favorite of astronomy lovers.












Dorothy's Eye View


This view of the castle inspired George Gibson to paint the Emerald City from Wizard of Oz. Head to the corner of Bread Street and Spittal Street and behold: Emerald City!






Edinburgh Castle: Our Tips




Sunset over Edinburgh Castle


For a view that you'll remember for the rest of your life, watch the sun set over Edinburgh Castle. The best spots for this are Arthur's Seat and Calton Hill, both located to the East of the city center. The deep-red sun, the colors in the sky, and the black silhouette of the castle come together in an absolutely magnificent panorama.




Fireworks


If you're lucky enough to be in Edinburgh when there are fireworks going off over Edinburgh Castle, for example on Hogmanay or at the end of the Edinburgh Festival, then make sure to head to one of these viewpoints to admire the show and snap some amazing photographs. Princes Street Gardens and Calton Hill are likely to be the most popular spots to watch the fireworks, so if you're looking for a less crowded experience, Blackford Hill and Arthur's Seat are better bets.





Good to Know






When to visit

Opening hours from 9:30AM - 6PM year-round, except for December 25th and 26th.





What is the price?

Free to look at from the outside, £17 for adult entry.

Only if you want one.





How to get there

Additional tips



It never hurts to carry an umbrella when in Scotland!

Since you'll be climbing hills, good walking shoes are a must.

Great trip, great locations, big fun. Awesome, we really enjoyed it.


And the ticket lasts for 48 hours; since we came in only afternoon we could use it still on the third day in the morning. :-)

Super easy to purchase tickets and go on a perfect castle tour.


We were in Edinburgh for a few days and wanted to see everything but did not reserve tickets ahead of time. Worried that we would not be able to book tickets we found the app and booked our tickets with ease. We arrived just in time for the next tour which was guided by Fergus. It was perfect!
