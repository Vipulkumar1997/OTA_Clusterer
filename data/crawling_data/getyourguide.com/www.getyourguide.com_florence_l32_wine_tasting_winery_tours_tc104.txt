What People Are Saying About Florence








great tour with free time & guided tour, good lunch


I had a fun time meeting lots of travelers of mixed ages who were friendly, thought there was a good mix of walking, then sitting on the bus, free time to roam as well as a guided tour in Siena, though had trouble hearing the guide with the radio transmitters.

Great way to cross-off bucket list cities!


This tour was an excellent way to see some highlights of Tuscany! We saw so much in one day, but I didn't feel rushed at each location--we were at each location just long enough to see what we wanted, but not so long to get bored. It was also a great way to learn about the history of the region and some of the things that you wouldn't know without a local guide! Another highlight for me was the ample amount of free-time we got. While it's a tour, we weren't forced to stay as a big group and do walking tours at each place. The only agenda they had planned was getting us to each city, a small wine tasting before lunch, and an optional walking tour in Siena. Everything else was at our leisure, which was the ideal way to do this tour. I highly recommend this particular trip!

Friendly and informative guide; so much for your money!


Manuel was absolutely amazing! He should get so much more recognition than he gets! We learnt so much about Tuscany and the different towns we went to, and the whole experience went so smoothly!
The only thing I'd suggest is maybe giving more time in San Gimignano and less in Siena as due to the time you get to Siena, most restaurants are closed and the only ones open have rude staff and crazy cover charges. There isn't a lot to do there either. But still had a lovely time, thank you Manuel!

Good day sightseeing but group size too big & disorganised at station


Very full day of sightseeing but group size far to big(75 people)also difficult with 3 different nationalities .pickup was supposed to be hotel and had arranged drop off at concert after these details got changed the night before.It did all work out in the end also winery lunch ok but group size made getting drinks hard

Well organised and good price for all-day trip


the trip was good organised.
But I suggest to arrive in anticipate. For two reasons: because before you take a bus there is check in point, and to choose a good seats in autobus. Our bus was already full and we didn`t have very comfortable seats.
