10 things to do in Cape Town


While exploring the "Mother City," you'll uncover the layers of its history that span from the colonial period to the emergence of the Rainbow Nation. With a vibrant scene in a cityscape of sea and mountains, it's easy to fall for South Africa's oldest city.












Table Mountain


The ride to the top of the iconic
Table Mountain
is one you'll never forget. You'll relish the views of the cobalt blue ocean and urban landscape from this lofty perch.












Lion's Head


Reap the rewards of an encompassing panorama after an hour's hike to the
Lion's Head
. A night with a full moon makes it a popular place to view the sparkling city lights below.












Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden


The eastern slopes of Table Mountain rise above the swathes of the
Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden
. The flora, locally known as fynbos, is at its best between August and November.












Cape of Good Hope


Dubbed the Cape of Storms by Portuguese explorers in the 15th century, the lighthouse, which illuminates the
Cape of Good Hope
, is the strongest on the continent.












Victoria and Alfred Waterfront


For shopping, entertainment and a slew of restaurants, you won't go wrong at the
V&A
. It's convenient to reach the aquarium and stadium nearby, and it's the place for a bay cruise.












Two Oceans Aquarium


The
Two Oceans Aquarium
name reflects the meeting of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and it features the marine life in these waters. Don't miss the shark feeding on Sundays at 3:00 pm.












Cape Town Stadium


Learn about this venue from the 2010 FIFA World Cup by taking a tour that includes facts about its architectural design, a walk on the
Cape Town Stadium
field, and a look inside the locker rooms.












Robben Island


Located in Table Bay, Nelson Mandela spent 18 years of his life imprisoned here in
Robben Island
during apartheid. It's a humbling moment when you step into his former cell and reflect on his life.

District Six


The
District Six
museum recounts the history of the forced expulsion and relocation of black residents during apartheid, and the ultimate demise of this former, mulit-cultural district.












Boulders Beach


A raised boardwalk lets you take a walk on the wild side among the rowdy 2000 African Penguins that live here at
Boulders Beach
. It's also a great place to spend the day on the beaches of False Bay.






Planning Your Cape Town Visit




A visit to Table Mountain


You can buy a ticket online for either a morning or afternoon trip to the top by cable car. However, an excursion to the 3,500-foot summit always depends on the weather, so check it before you go. It's wise to bring a sweater or jacket with you, and wear sunblock and proper footware. If you plan to hike to the peak or along one of the three trails at the summit, be safe and bring water, snacks and a friend.




How safe is it?


As in any other city you visit, it's always best to keep your wits about you. It is recommended to take a taxi in Cape Town at night, rather than walking, and be on your guard when withdrawing cash at an ATM. If you're curious about visiting a township, then go with a group led by an experienced guide.




When to go


Cape Town has a temperate climate. October to April offer warm and dry weather, but the notorious south-easter winds occur from December through January. February to mid-April has great beach weather, and hiking enthusiasts will enjoy crisp, clear days from late April to early June.




How many days should you spend in Cape Town?


Four to five full days allow you to experience the sites and sounds of the Mother City at a leisurely pace. Stay longer if you'd like and use the city as a base to explore the beautiful, surrounding areas in the Western Cape, such as the wine region of Stellenbosch.

What People Are Saying About Cape Town








Smooth and easy way to get to Table Mountain


This combo is perfect for a first day in cape town. The hoho is an easy way to get to know the city and the view from the top of Table Mountain is just stunning. Very handy to have both at once!

Great nature experience support by a fantastic team


It was a great experience on the boat along the coast line. Seeing Southern Right Whales in the waves was a fantastic experience. The skipper and his crew did a fantastic job to spot the whales in the waves and approaching them with respect.
The crew was very professional and did their job to make the day in Gansbaai a magical experience.

Such a great experience seeing the Whales & Dolphins - excellent!!


Our guide Sampson was great - very informative and helped make our day special.
You need to have sea faring legs for the boat trip!! But seeing the Whales and a huge pod of Dolphins made it all worthwhile- it was like a scene from the Blue Planet!
The wine tasting and food was great followed by seeing the Penguins and a trip round the coastal route.
Great trip and great value for money - highly recommended!

Great Experience! Not just a Safari, the BEST scenic drive & Guide!


University group visit for studies, we hadn’t thought about the length of the drive, or what we would see and learn. Picked up our group in mini-bus (wifi enabled, surprise!), and set off early. Amazing guide (Tony), was thoughtful and accommodating to extra questions, he shared such depth & detail during the drive. He made all the difference in how the day went. The history and landscape was breathtaking, and little stop for breakfast was perfect. Inverdoorn was awesome and educational, would consider a longer stay. Relaxing drive back along different route. Perfect day-trip from Cape Town. Would recommend/book again, definitely w/Tony!
