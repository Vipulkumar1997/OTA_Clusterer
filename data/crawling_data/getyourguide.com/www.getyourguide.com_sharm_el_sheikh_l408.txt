Top things to do in Sharm el-Sheikh


Sharm – as it's known locally – has become one of Egypt's leading tourist destinations thanks to its luxurious resorts, gorgeous beaches, and bounty of sightseeing attractions. Here's what to see and do on the sunny tip of the Sinai peninsula!












Pharaoh's Island


Also known as Coral Island, the area's outstanding natural beauty is complemented by its
12th-century citadel
. See it by booking a boat tour!












Nabq Protected Area


Nabq is
Sinai's scenic treasure trove
! Visitors shouldn't miss taking a wildlife safari, diving among shipwrecks, or discovering the local Bedouin culture and hospitality.












Naama Bay


The resort district's stunning natural bay boasts some of the city's most popular cafés, restaurants, and bazaars. It's the place to go for tourist-friendly entertainment!












Mount Sinai


The mountain is where Moses is said to have received the Ten Commandments, and the breathtaking views are certainly a religious experience! Be warned: it's 4,000 steps to the top!












Saint Catherine's Monastery


For sightseers who don't fancy the three-hour climp up Mount Sinai, one of the world's oldest Christian monasteries lies right at its feet. It was built 1,500 years ago!












Ras Muhammad National Park


At the tip of the peninsula is one of
Sharm el-Sheikh
's best snorkelling spots! The coastal national park is home to thousands of species, including crustaceans and turtles!












Red Sea Riviera


As well as Ras Muhammad, the
resort-rich riviera
is home to several protected areas. Why not learn to scuba-dive around its reefs, or simply enjoy the archaeological treasures?






Planning Your Sharm el-Sheikh Visit




Where is it?


Sharm el-Sheikh is a former fishing port located at the southernmost tip of Egypt's Sinai peninsula. In the 1990's, strict environmental laws were introduced to protect the coastal environment from unsustainable fishing methods, and the city has since found its feet as a major hub of tourism.




Best time to visit?


The best time to go to Sharm el-Sheikh depends on how you handle hot weather. July and August regularly see temperatures in the mid-40s. November and December see a more merciful climate, although sightseers should note that the days begin to darken around 6:00PM. If you don't mind the crowds, then Sharm is a great place to spend a sunny Christmas and New Year!

What People Are Saying About Sharm el-Sheikh








Professional diving team in Sharm el Sheikh


Other than them not finding my hotel on the first morning and having to call them twice for the pick-up, everything went fine and they really looked after me, both during my Nitrox course and during all dives. I do have a concern though that a 14-year old girl with only a junior open-water qualification and less than 10 dives to her name was allowed to dive to 30 metres inside the Thistlegorm wreck.

It was very fun and the food was delicious!


Agma who was our tour guide was so very nice and he was always keeping an eye for us. In fact, when we were in the middle of the Red Sea, snorkeling, I was concerned for my youngest 14 year old daughter and I would come out of the water often to ensure that she was fine. He will always had his eyes on her and tell me, don't worry, I am making sure everyone is ok. Often, I saw him counting that all 6 members of my family were somewhere in the vast ocean. Love this tour because my husband try to do scuba diving a few years back in Colombia and he couldn't get down at all because his ears hurt him so much. He was not planning to go down in the water, just be there for us. We finally convinced him to go down and he had the experience of his life. The way that Agma did it by allowing us to go down little by little was so very helpful and my husband now wants to get certification because he loved it so much. The beauty of the Red Sea is without description. You have to be there!!!

Very informative, educational and well done.


Said was our guide for this activity and his knowledge of religion as well as respect for other religious was very refreshing. First, we went to the biggest icon of world peace in the world. The sunset behind this icon, which it made it more majestic. The visit to the Mosque was very informative and it was so beautiful in the inside that we saw from the outside, of course. The teachings of the Muslim religious was so interesting in order to understand the Egyptian culture and the Arabic world. The Christian church has the most beautiful murals and stories about Moses, David, Jesus. Then, we had some free time to do some shopping and get some amazing deal for real leather purses and backpacks. Said made us feel welcome, safe and happy to serve us.

Absolutely worthy, inspiring, challenging and stunning!!!!


Hussaim was such a kind guide. He ensure that everyone was safe and even walk slow when needed. He never pushed us if we were tired. He gave us enough water and toilet breaks. He even hold my back pack so that it was easier for me. He allowed me to hold his arm half way going up when my legs were ready to give up going the 750 steps. He was concerned for all 14 people in the group and always waited for those that needed the most help.
If anyone meets Hussaim, please give him an iPhone charger so that he can communicate with his mother while he is at the Mt. Sinai doing tours. His phone dies often. He lives in a small village and don't have it.
The actual hike was so beautiful, the sky was full of starts, the sunrise was one of the most beautiful that I have seen around the world and I have traveled a lot and the visits to the monasteries were very incredible, specially the oldest Christian church in the world, Moses' well and burning bush. It really was an inspiring tour!!!

Excellent trip with excellent tour guide!


The Blue Hole of Dahab on Egypt's Red Sea is very famous spot for diving & snorkeling. Some call it the diver's cemetery because it is a very dangerous spot for those who don't take it seriously. Take this opportunity and visit this place! Trip is well organized and beautiful!
