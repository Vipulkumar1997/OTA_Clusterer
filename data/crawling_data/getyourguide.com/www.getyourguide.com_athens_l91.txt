Top 10 things to do in Athens


Once the heart of a civilization more advanced than any to come for centuries, visiting Athens reveals just how far mankind can go when holding art and wisdom above waging war. Here are the best things to see and do in Greece's proud and passionate capital.












Monastiraki


The Old Town market district
Monastiraki
is a favorite among tourists and locals alike. Though cheap souvenirs dominate its storefronts, there's plenty on offer for sophisticated tastes too!












Parthenon


More than the ruins of an old temple,
the Parthenon
is an icon of Western civilization, making it the site of Athens' most essential tours!












Acropolis of Athens


Many of Ancient Athens' most important buildings were erected in the
Acropolis
to protect them from invasion. Ruins they may be, but most still look pretty good for their age!












Erechtheion


Built on the site where legend tells Poseidon and Athena competed to be the city's patron god,
the Erechtheion
was actually considered more holy than the Parthenon in its time!












Acropolis Museum


Of course, the Acropolis is now mostly in ruin – a monument to Athens' former glory – but almost 4,000 objects excavated from the area can be seen at the
Acropolis Museum
!

National Archaeological Museum of Athens


Widely considered to be one of the best museums in the world, the
National Archaeological Museum of Athens
boasts many of Greece's most important artifacts, from the prehistoric age to Late Antiquity.












Syntagma Square


Named after the Greek Constitution of 1844, the grand
Syntagma Square
at the foot of the Old Royal Palace has been the epicenter of Greek politics ever since!












Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens


In ruins, but once considered the epitome of Doric architecture, the important temple
Olympieion
was home to the gold Statue of Zeus – one of the original Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.












Temple of Athena Nike


Nike is the Ancient Greek word for victory, and the prominently placed
Temple of Athena Nike
on the Acropolis was built to aid the Athenian Empire's wars against Sparta. It didn't work!












Plaka


This historic district at the foot of the Acropolis is also known as the "Neighborhood of the Gods."
Plaka
is a great place to wander around and maybe even see an archaeological dig!






Planning Your Athens Visit




Where to stay?


If sightseeing around the Acropolis is your main concern, Plaka is probably the best place to stay. Despite being a highly recommended tourist spot in itself, its streets are pleasantly quiet. The main attractions can also be reached easily from the Monastiraki area, which ought to appeal more to those attracted to Athens' lively street life.




How many days?


How long to spend in Athens depends on how much of it you want to see, of course, but with most of its historic landmarks situated at the Acropolis, you could cover its archaeological sites, best restaurants, and most popular markets in 3 days.




How to get around?


The city is served by buses and electric trolleys that must be waved down at the blue (bus) and yellow (trolley) stops. Tickets are cheap, but then so are taxi fares. Athens also recently opened a sleek new Metro network. Construction was greatly delayed because they couldn't dig for 5 minutes without hitting undiscovered antiquities!

What People Are Saying About Athens








Great class, great food, great experience!


This was one of the best cooking classes I have every taken. Fofi is a traditional Greek cook and a great instructor. She walked us through everything we were doing and even offered some helpful cooking tips. The food was amazing. It was really fun to sit with everyone and enjoy the meal we had prepared.

Vivian's enthusiasm is contagious -- take this tour!


Meeting Vivan and touring with her was one of the highlights of our short trip to Athens. She is both knowledgeable and passionate about traditional Greek cuisine, and did a wonderful job connecting the food we were eating to developments in Greek culture and history. And she chose a wonderful selection of local, family-owned businesses in Athens to visit. Vivian responded promptly and positively to our last-minute booking request, and provided helpful information about getting to and from the meeting point. Whether you consider yourself a "foodie" or just want to see a more personal side of Athens, you will enjoy yourself. My parents had never been on a food tour before and were initially a bit skeptical of the idea, but they came away as converts due to Vivian's thoughtful selections and engaging personality -- I think they would now follow her anywhere! Take advantage of this opportunity to meet a modern-day Athenian, you won't regret it.

Excellent experience, must do to get feeling for city at start of trip


First time in Athens, this was a wonderful way to discover the city. Our guide Kostas, was really helpful and took us to the main sights as well as some more interesting harder to find spots. I was in Athens for 6 days and wouldn't have had half as good an experience if I hadn't taken this tour first.

Great introduction to the sights in central Athens.


We had a lovely time with Dimos showing us around central Athens by bike. It was very relaxed and nice to meet other travellers and share stories. The bikes were excellent and the tour was well-paced with a stop on route for refreshments.
