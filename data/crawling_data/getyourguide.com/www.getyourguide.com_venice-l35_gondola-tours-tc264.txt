What People Are Saying About Venice








Fab romantic gondola ride through the quiet canals of Venice.


Do not miss this opportunity to treat your loved one to a private romantic ride though the quiet and not much travelled canals of Venice. Also include is a short trip on the Grand Canal. Great location only 2 minutes from St Mark’s Square. Considering it’s Venice great value for money. You cannot visit Venice and not do a Gondola ride.

A lovely way to enjoy the beautiful scenery in Venice


The meeting point was difficult to find so we missed our time spot. However, the organisers let us join the afternoon tour (and others had rearranged to other days). We were sat with others in the gondola but that was absolutely fine - once your gondola sets off, you're too busy admiring the scenery to notice those around you! It was very enjoyable.

Murano and Burano were amazing and enoyed them thoroughly


The meeting point was very vague, we got to the place shown on the map and then were clueless where to wait. luckily we met others on the tour and huddled together. The Glass blowing demonstration was amazing, we really enjoyed it, plenty of time to view the showroom and the souvenir shop and a quick coffee. Burano was also great, the coloured houses and the shops were great for pictures but there was so many shops and so little time that we felt rushed and clock watching a lot to make sure we were back at the boat on time. Torcello for us was a waste of time, it was about 15 minute walk down a canal to get to the church ruins and then when we arrived, there was no one around, was like a ghost town, none of the exhibitions were accessible, the toilets were padlocked shut and we ended up buying a drink at a restaurant on the way back just to use their bathroom facilities. We would have benefitted with more in Burano instead.

One off the bucket list; wonderful expereince


Our guide was friendly and even pointed out famous buildings and landmarks. Fab ride as this takes you through small canals and the grand canal. I would recommend an earlier time to book as it picked up after we finished. Absolutely worth doing; Venice is beautiful
