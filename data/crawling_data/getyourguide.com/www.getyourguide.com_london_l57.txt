The best things to do in London


"When a man is tired of London, he is tired of life," said Samuel Johnson. He spoke the truth. Whether you're looking for West End musicals, double decker buses, Sherlock Holmes pubs, or Kate Middleton lunch spots, the British capital has something to offer you.












Warner Brothers Studio


You can't go to London without visiting Harry Potter! Take a day trip from London to
Warner Brothers Studio
, where you'll be able to shop Diagon Alley, enjoy a Butterbeer, and talk Quidditch.












Stonehenge


Reflect on the world's most famous prehistoric ruins. Getting to
Stonehenge
takes about 90 minutes. Tip: you can also visit Windsor Castle or Bath while out in the countryside.












The Shard


If you can catch a sunny day, there's nothing more beautiful than 360-degree views of London at
the Shard
. Visit the viewing platform inside Western Europe's tallest building.












Madame Tussaud's


Trying to spot your favorite British celebrities? You'll at least be able to find their life-size wax counterparts here!
Madame Tussaud's
is a fun thing to do on a rainy day in London.












Tower of London


Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress, AKA
The Tower of London
, is a historic castle located on the Thames River. The tour is plain fun, and you get to see the Crown Jewels!












London Eye


Climb onto Europe's biggest ferris wheel, and float 443 feet above the Thames River. Inside a
London Eye
pod, you'll get great views of Parliament, Buckingham Palace, and Hyde Park.












South Bank


The walk between the Eye and Tower Bridge in
South Bank
is filled with largely state-funded arts venues. Head to the Tate Modern for modern masters, and then to Borough Market for lunch.












River Thames



The River Thames
weaves right through the heart of London. An afternoon boat tour is a fun introduction to the Tower of London, Parliament, and other riverside attractions.

Wembley Stadium


Opened in 2007,
Wembley
is the 90,000 capacity home for the English national football team (and lots of other major sporting and concert events!).












London Zoo


A visit to the
London Zoo
is a great family outing. Watch the animal feedings, explore the butterfly enclosure, or learn more about conservation.






Planning Your London Visit




How many days should you spend in London?


If this is your first trip to London, stay for at least four full days in order to hit all the classic sights like Buckingham Palace. But whether it's your first trip or your tenth, the key to visiting London is planning. The more you dig around, the more you'll realize how many things you can do in the city -- and everybody will want to see different sights and attractions. Before you go, decide which which tours or sights are a "must" for your group.




How much do taxis and double decker buses cost?


Transportation is notoriously expensive in London. Take the tube or a taxi at least once, for the experience and the picture. Locals travel by bus or by foot. The bus map can be a little confusing, but it is reliable and much cheaper. You'll be an expert by the end of your trip, which will give you a better excuse to come back again!




What's the best time of year to visit London?


They aren't kidding when they say "foggy Londontown." There's always a threat of rain, which is something that bonds the English together in solidarity. Even in the summer, you should carry an umbrella or light jacket. One idea? Plan your visit around a classic London event (like the Oxford Cambridge Boat Race down the Thames, or seeing the Christmas lights at Harrod's).

What People Are Saying About London








The overall trip was fantastic, however the guide was 30 mins late


The overall experience was exciting and enjoyable, however the guide was 30 minutes late arriving to begin the tour which had all the customers waiting and feeling very anxious, although she arrived and apologized numerous times for her late arrival, I felt it affected the amount of time we had to spend at the studio and felt this part of the trip ended up being quite rushed and felt under pressure to move quickly from one area to the next to ensure we were able to see the whole studio. I would have liked more time to be able to take my time to enjoy all the amazing things at the studio.

Wonderful experience for Harry Potter fans of any age.


Everything was great, transportation was easy, guide was great and knowledgeable. The ability to take the tour with a guide and then go back and spend more time was well worth it.

It was for my Mum's birthday and her and my dad went on our end years ago so it made them very happy.

David was an awesome guide who was interesting and entertaining!


I would highly recommend this tour. We booked for 10 people and some of them wondered why we’d book a tour when we could just go to a pub ourselves. After the first pub, they were all convinced it was well worth it. Great stories and info!
