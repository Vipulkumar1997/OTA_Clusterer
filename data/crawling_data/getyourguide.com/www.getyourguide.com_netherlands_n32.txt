Where to go in Netherlands



The Netherlands is a land of
windmills
,
wooden clogs
,
tulips
and everyone riding
bicycles
. When in the Netherlands, why not go Dutch and ride a bicycle? There are many bicycle tours offered to tourists and what better way to see things close up? Take a 2-hour city bike tour where you can see attractions such as
De Gooyer Windmill
, the Royal Palace, Fiets Brug (a bike bridge), the
Van Gogh Museum
and the Heineken Brewery.

Consider taking a night
cruise
while visiting
Amsterdam
. Guests can enjoy hours of leisure cruising aboard a canal bus. See the lights of Amsterdam as you cruise the canals, hear some stories and learn some history from knowledgeable guides. Have a drink and a bite to eat and sit back to enjoy the sights.

The Netherlands is infamous for the
Red Light District
. Join a 2-hour walking tour where guides will tell you about the history and goings-on of this area. Visit some historic bars, walk through China Town, see one of the oldest churches in the city, check out the video cabins and sex shops and see the Prostitution Information Center. Finish off the night at Belushi's Bar for a free shot.

More attractions can be found in
Rotterdam
; see the
Alkmaar Cheese Market
, The Hague, and the miniature city of Madurodam.
