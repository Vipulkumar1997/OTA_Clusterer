Top 10 things to do in Ho Chi Minh City


Named after Communist revolutionary Ho Chi Minh, the city formerly known as Saigon has emerged from its darkest days to become one of Asia's most exciting cities. It boasts vibrant street life, handsome buildings, and warm weather all year round. But what are the best things to do in this interesting city?

Cu Chi Tunnels


How did the Americans lose the Vietnam War? Your guide will lead you through hidden trap-doors to explore the
Cu Chi tunnels
that helped thwart the US army at every turn.

Saigon Opera House (Municipal Theatre)


Modelled on the Petit Palais in Paris, this striking example of French Colonial architecture is easy to reach and regularly hosts some of the city's best concerts.

Saigon Central Post Office



Saigon Central Post Office
still operates, though it also serves as one of the city's top attractions, having been designed by the famous Gustave Eiffel.

Saigon Notre-Dame Cathedral


Pilgrims flocked to this beautiful basilica in 2005 when its Virgin Mary statue was reported to have shed tears. We're sceptical, but there are better reasons to
visit the Saigon Notre-Dame Cathedral
, such as its superior architecture!












Independence Palace (Reunification Palace)


Originally built to demonstrate Vietnam's strength in the wake of Independence, it was torn down, replaced, and eventually renamed
Reunification Palace
after the fall of Saigon.












Pham Ngu Lao Street


Though known as the backpacker district, the bustling
Pham Ngu Lao Street
attracts people from all walks of life with its bounty of clothing, war memorabilia, and other merchandise.

War Remnants Museum


The
War Remnants Museum
paints a vivid – and often disturbing – picture of the country's 20th-century struggles. It's a must for anyone hoping to understand Vietnam's complex history.












Dam Sen Park


With lakes, gardens, and so much more beyond the rides,
Dam Sen
is the perfect amusement park for people who don't like amusement parks, as well as those that do!

Jade Emperor Pagoda


With its ornate carvings and constant aura of incense smoke, this is the pagoda to see if you've only time for one. Be sure to look over its gorgeous courtyard from the roof!












Ho Chi Minh City Museum


Located in the old Gia Long Palace, photographs and artefacts offer an exemplary account of Vietnam's bloody past. It's uncompromising without being gratuitous.






Planning Your Ho Chi Minh City Visit




How to get to Ho Chi Minh City from the airport?


The cheapest way to get to the city is by taking bus 152 near the arrivals exit. It costs extra if your luggage weighs over 10kg, but will take you all the way downtown to the bus station near Cho (market) Ben Tanh. Taxis are located to the left of the terminal. Make sure you take a metered taxi and do not pay in any currency other than Vietnamese dong or you risk being ripped off.




Where to eat?


One of the most charming things about Ho Chi Minh City is how the low-cost street food can so often outperform its best restaurants. You'll find many good ones on Dong Khoi, the lively stretch of shops and bars between the river and cathedral.




Where to shop?


Ho Chi Minh City has several markets worth visiting as well as the aforementioned Pham Ngu Lao Street. The two largest are Cho Ben Tanh and Cho Lon. Cho Lon – the Chinese market – has a dazzling array of goods on offer and is the least touristy of the two. Ben Tanh is also fun to visit, and better regulated, with less knock-off merchandise and fewer pickpockets. That said, you should always be wary of both those things.

What People Are Saying About Ho Chi Minh City








Humorous, personable and knowledgeable guide. Amazing customer service


Foo was an amazing tour guide. He was humorous at all the right moments, knew how to create a light hearted holiday experience while conveying the reality of the history of the Cu Chi tunnels, and Vietnam in general.

The customer service was most amazing - literally responded my emails that I send late at night (I've even received their response at like 2am Vietnam time - their staff is extremely hardworking). Everyone puts the customers experience first. I would highly recommend them! It was an amazing experience

Excellent way to experience Cu Chi tunnels and Mekong in 1 day!


We had a great day out. Early start and a little bit of driving from Saigon, but if you only have one day, this is a great way to go!
We were picked up from our hotel with no delay and were comfortably driven first to the Cu Chi Tunnels.
Getting early to the tunnels meant we avoided large crowds and delays, so it is definitely worth getting up early to get there first.
We then made our way to the river Mekong, where we crossed the river and had a set lunch which was very nice. After this, we went on a canoe down a smaller branch from the Mekong which was very relaxing.
Our next stop was a different island in the river where we were able to have some local fruits (included in price).
Our tour guide Bao was excellent and provided great information about Vietnam. He was able to explain any questions we had. Our driver Mr Tang also made sure we have a safe and comfortable drive.
All round great day out!

Extremely interesting experience, half day was perfect!


My family and I had a great experience using this service. We were promptly collected from our hotel in a great air conditioned bus that included free wifi and water. The drive was about 1.5-2 hours and our guide Henry was charming and had great knowledge. Stopped at a charity for disabled individuals effected by the war with the option to make a donation. Once we arrived at the tunnels henry showed us around with great knowledge of the tunnels. We spent just enough time at the tunnels with the option to use the shooting range and returned home by 1.30pm. If you wanted a quick and easy trip this is for you! Thank you to our guilde Henry!
