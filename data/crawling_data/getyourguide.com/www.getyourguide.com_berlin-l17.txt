Top 10 things to do in Berlin


The history of Berlin has seen it broken and divided, fashioning a city that's nightlife and neighborhoods are as much of a draw as its bountiful museums and jarring architecture. Every corner has a story to tell, but here are a few worth starting with!












Alexanderplatz


This holyland of 20's cabaret emerged as a Soviet showpiece in the Cold War. Central, accessible, and close to other key sights,
Alexanderplatz
is the perfect launchpad for a jaunt around town.












TV Tower


As the highest point in Berlin it can be seen from almost anywhere in the city.
TV Tower tickets
start at €13 for adults─a bargain for Berlin's best view!












Brandenburg Gate


Situated at the bottom of Unter den Linden, close to the Reichstag and Holocaust Memorial, the
Brandenburg Gate
is a monument to triumph, once in war, now in unity.












Reichstag


Germany's parliament is an icon of Berlin architecture. The modern glass dome crowning the Neo-Baroque building is open to visitors. From the dome of
the Reichstag
building you can experience an outstanding view of the city.












Government District


The Reichstag isn't all the
Government District
has to offer. At the north-eastern corner of Tiergarten Park, it's home to some of the best modern architecture in Berlin.












Madame Tussauds Berlin



Madame Tussauds
is relatively new to the city but already has a colorful history. On opening day a visitor tore off Hitler's waxwork head! Only in Berlin!












Berlin Dungeon


See out a rainy day at the
Berlin dungeon
for a reminder of the city's nasty past. Large groups get generous discounts.












Potsdamer Platz


Once a post-war wasteland,
Potsdamer Platz
is now the spot for top-class hotels and film premieres (including the IMAX). The Berliner Philharmonie is just around the corner.












Kurfürstendamm


Known locally as
Ku'Damm
, this 2-mile boulevard forms Berlin's shopping district. KaDeWe─the continent's largest department store─marks its easternmost point near Wittenbergplatz.












Gendarmenmarkt


In the historic
Gendarmenmarkt
the Berlin Concert House stands flanked by 2 cathedrals. Entrance to the German Cathedral is free, but the older French Cathedral costs €3 a ticket.






Planning Your Berlin Visit




When to go?


Unless you're averse to crowds, visit Berlin over the summer, when the city's relaxed street-life is at its most contagious. Include a Sunday to experience one of the bustling flea markets.




Where to stay?


Every Berlin neighborhood has its own character. Charlottenburg is relatively flash, with Mitte a trendier alternative. Prenzlauer Berg is the city's café-culture capital, populated by young families. Schoeneberg is renowned for its gay clubs and bars, while Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg also provide plenty of nightlife options─most a little rough around the edges!




How to get around?


Berlin is covered by trains, trams, taxis, and buses. Train stations are largely unmanned with machines to buy tickets from. Many tourists mistakenly think the trains are free before being fined €60 by inspectors!

The Berlin WelcomeCard covers public transport in Berlin and Potsdam for 2-5 days, and also provides discounts at many restaurants and attractions, including the Berlin Dungeon.

Relaxing trip allowing you to see a lot of East Berlin


I really enjoyed this trip as it was peaceful and relaxing being away from the city, starting at Treptower Park was a lovely location and you can avail of drinks and snacks on board. Comfortable although dated seating inside, the trip covers a long distance of the Spree, where you can see the tv tower in the distance, east side gallery, oberbaum brücke, etc. enjoyable experience

This was a fantastic orientation to the city!


This was a delightful experience that was intriguing, educating and fun. Our tour guide Ken was brilliant and really did a nice job of showing us a lot, not rushing us, keeping it informative and keeping it fun as well. I would highly recommend this tour as one of the first activities you do if you're new to the city!

Fascinating tour of a Berlin you might not otherwise get to see


This tour was the highlight of our trip to Berlin. Our guide Stefanie was superb; friendly, funny, engaging, really knowledgable and exuded enthusiasm. The bikes were really comfortable and the areas chosen were fascinating. The whole thing gave us a perspective on this complex city we wouldn't otherwise have got. Really good value too.
Thanks Stefanie!

The Best Way to Spend 4 hours in Berlin!


My colleagues and I were blown away by the knowledge of our guide Ken! He brought not only a great description of what the day would bring, he also had plenty of humor to go around and keep eveyone focused! If only I could retain a portion of that to remember the trip by!

Keep up the great work! Definitely would push this to anyone I know coming over for work or holiday!
