What People Are Saying About Reykjavik








Great day out, super experience, highly recommended!


This was my 3rd time doing the tour. This time brought my 3 adult kids , to show them a slice of Iceland. They loved the tour, the locations visited, the transport. The guide , Ernie, was great, good sense of humour and very informative without being OTT. The snowmobiling was super, real wow factor for the kids! A great, great day

Exhilarating experience leaving you wanting more.


Bjorn was a fantastic guide, he seemed to be having as much fun as what we were. He was knowledgeable, friendly and definitely an asset to the team. The trip itself was amazing, loved the sites we got to see, the ice cave was good although I would have liked to have got to look at the 'blue' that was so enticing at the back of the cave although I know this is not possible for my own safety. The snowmobiling was just unreal, loved it so much, would loved to have gone faster and further but I understand as a novice to it my safety comes first which was evident throughout the trip too. All in all, the price is high but the experience is out of this world.

Excellent tour, value for money. Great tour guide


My wife and I booked this tour, which we got a 20% discount. The tour was excellent, the guides gave great commentary on the bus along with the tablets provided. The only hiccup was that we waited 45 minutes at the Gulfoss waterfall for the snowmobile company to take us up the glacier. In that time we could have seen the Waterfall instead of doing it on our return. The rest of the day was very well planned. The pick up was on schedule, the time spent at the locations was perfect. I would recommend this tour.

A good chance to see some of Icelands highlights in one tour


The Snowmobiling was definitely an exceptional experience . The geological aspects of the tour were not to be missed also making it a good combination .
The tour was let down by pour organisation at the end when there was an hour and half wait for those of us who had been snowmobiling to be taken back to Reykjavik .
