What to Do and See in Amsterdam


Sure, everyone knows about the coffee shops -- but what else is fun to do in Amsterdam? Holland’s capital city is a hub for happy cyclists, lazy beers by the canal, and art-lovers. As you start planning what to see, here are ten activities you can’t miss.












Anne Frank House


Whether you’ve read the diary or not, the
Anne Frank House
is a must-visit. If you want to avoid the tourist traffic, book a ticket in advance and hop to the front of the line.












Amsterdam Canal Ring


By boat or by land, you won’t be able to avoid Amsterdam’s famous
canal ring
. Go for a stroll, hop on a ferry tour, or people-watch in a canal-side bar.












Van Gogh Museum


The
Van Gogh Museum
is home to the world’s largest Van Gogh collection, and one of the most popular museums in the world. Even the artistically uninterested love the modern architecture (and free wifi).












Museumplein


Find your way to
Museumplein
, the "Museum Quarter" at the heart of the city. Three museums, lunchtime concerts in the Concertgebouw, plenty of shopping, and grassy green space.












Rijksmuseum


The national museum of Holland boasts works by Rembrandt and Vermeer. Plan to arrive first thing or in the late afternoon - or book a
Rijksmuseum ticket
in advance in order to skip the queue.












Red Light District


Whether you’re looking for a museum, a “souvenir," or some risque nightlife: the
Red Light District
is sure to delight and entertain.












Heineken Experience


Established in 1864, Heineken is now one of the world’s biggest beer producers. The lighthearted, fun, historical tour takes a quick 90 minutes. The
Heineken Experience ticket
includes two beers.












New Church


A part-time wedding chapel for Dutch monarchs,
New Church
is Holland’s most important church and a historical cornerstone in Amsterdam. Between coronations, check out their rotating exhibits.












Amsterdam Museum


For city history, visit the aptly-named
Amsterdam Museum
. Educate yourself on everything from famous Amsterdamians to fashion and architecture. Some exhibits are interactive!












De Pijp


Amsterdam’s go-to bohemian neighborhood is brimming with coffee shops, bars, and restaurants. Go before dinner and spend the late afternoon wandering through the Albert Cuypmarket.






Planning Your Amsterdam Visit




How many days should you spend in Amsterdam?


There’s no right answer, but you can get a real feel for the city if you allocate three full days. That will give you enough time to hit the big sights, see the canals, and explore your way through some neighborhoods.




Getting around town


Amsterdam is an easy city to navigate. While the public transport is first class, most visitors find that the city is compact enough to be 100% walkable, save for the train to-and-from Schiphol Airport. Plus, you can easily rent a bicycle when the weather's nice.




How expensive is Amsterdam?


While there are a couple big activities you will have to pay for (like the Anne Frank House and the Van Gogh Museum), Amsterdam is full of street markets and small independent galleries. And the city is so walkable that you won’t need to spend a lot on public transportation.

Best time to visit

There’s never a promise of good weather in Amsterdam, but you can expect milder temperatures and longer days between April and September. April is especially lovely --
those famous tulips will be blooming
, and you can celebrate Holland’s biggest holiday of the year, King’s Day.

What People Are Saying About Amsterdam








Great way to experience the Ganja culture of Amsterdam!


Terrific tour led by Caleb! He gave us great insight into the history of the drug trade in Amsterdam, with some additional history about the city itself thrown in :) A great way to be introduced to the ins and outs of the coffee shop scene if it is something you have never experienced before. A+

Mars was a wonderfully knowledgeable guide!


Really got a sense of the history of prostitution, with a lot of humor and fun thrown in. Great way to visit the Red Light District without feeling intimidated!

We had a great time. What a beautiful place.


Our Guide, Cherri, was fun and educational. She made the trip very informative. We have some time after lunch and the canal ride to walk around the little village. It is like a fairy tale.
