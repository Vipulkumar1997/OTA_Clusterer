Pompeii

Teatro di San Carlo


Naples' opera house's programme is diverse, with ballet shows taking place between April and June, too. Even if opera and ballet are not your thing, the house is lovely to behold.




National Archaeological Museum


If you are a classical history buff, you've come to the right place. See statues and artwork depicting the beginnings of Europe's rich heritage.












Gesu Nuovo


The unusual architecture of this church of "New Jesus" dates from the year 1470. It also faces one of Naples' main squares. The inside of the church is also worth a look for its frescoes!












Castel dell'Ovo


Located on the peninsula of Megaride, the "Egg Castle" dates back to Roman times and has since seen it all: Norman, Saracen, Spanish, and French invaders. See it as part of a wider tour of Naples to understand its history.






Planning Your Naples Visit




How long should I stay in Naples?


Four days or so should cover the basics - take out whole days for trips outside of Naples, such as to Pompeii and Herculaneum.




How walkable is Naples?


Pretty walkable, especially in the city center. There is also a transit system serving the whole metropolitan area, including a funicular taking you up into the hills.




When should I visit Naples?


All year round, but go between October and March to avoid crowds and very warm weather.




Anything else I should know?


In Italy, some stores and other attractions are closed at lunchtimes or in the afternoons, so double check before you set out somewhere.

What People Are Saying About Naples








Trip of a lifetime never to be forgotten in my lifetime!!


Our tour guide, Laura, was very knowledgeable of the entire journey. I highly recommend this trip to anyone looking to Travel to Naples / Mt. Vesuvius!!

Awesome panoramic trip of the whole Amalfi Coast!


We were picked up from a place next to our hotel in Naples by the driver, Antonio, who is a very skilful driver. Despite the winding road, my 4-year old and I felt really comfortable riding the small bus with the professional driving of Antonio. The guide, Marco, was also great, explaining the history, legends and modern day stories of the Amalfi Coast. I highly recommend this tour, a trip full of picturesque views and lots of 'mosts' and ' bests' like the smallest town in Italy and the best gelato in Italy. Loved the restaurant we had lunch in, wonderful views and the spaghetti were amazing. My 4-year old daughter wanted a second plate of the spaghetti. Overall, this was one of the best tours/trips I have been on.

Amazing tour! A must do to see a little bit of everything.


Our guide Rafael was very prompt and informative. He gave us plenty of time at each stop and even took us to a little authentic pizza place near his town for a quick lunch. The views were gorgeous. Plenty of little shops to buy from and lots of nice pictures to take. Pompeii was the only place where more time was needed but that in itself is a full day tour to see EVERYTHING. This was the perfect tour to have a taste of each part and then some. Definitely recommend.

The most knowledgable and personable guide we could have wished for.


Paula brought the whole experience to life with her knowledge and enthusiasm. It was worth every penny and we would recommend Paula to everyone! Ask for Paula in person she was wonderful. Thank you

So glad I booked these to skip any queuing


Herculaneum is an incredibly moving place right from the start. Just thinking about digging the place out and it's enormity is mind boggling. Absolutely well worth the visit. Pity the Italians don't do any food on site but there is a good book shop and places to eat nearby.
