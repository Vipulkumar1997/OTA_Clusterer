Top things to do in Marrakech


Nestled below the magnificent Atlas Mountains, Morocco's cultural hub offers sun-baked historical sites drenched in Berber tradition and ornate Islamic art. A feast for all the senses, here are the top attractions to visit for a taste of Marrakech.

Museum of Marrakech


Housed in the old Dar Menebhi Palace, the
Marrakech Museum
displays Moroccan art from the ancient to the modern, as well as historic books, coins, and pottery from the region.












Jemaa el Fnaa


Barter for souvenirs, food, and clothing at the vast historic marketplace
Jemaa el Fnaa
, then venture further into the medina (Old Town) to explore its labyrinth of traditional Souks!












Bahia Palace


Bahia means brilliance. Built for a former slave who became a favorite of the Sultan, it was intended to be the most dazzling palace of its time!












Menara gardens


With the Atlas mountains providing a spectacular backdrop, the peaceful
Menara Gardens
is a favorite for both locals and visitors looking to escape the commotion of the city.

Saadian Tombs


The
Saadian Tombs
, an immense 16th-century burial ground, are the final resting place for 66 members of the Saadian dynasty that ruled Marrakech from 1524 to 1668.












Majorelle Garden


These exquisite tropical gardens are the work of French painter Jacques Majorelle, hence the vibrant "Majorelle blue" juxtaposed against the natural greenery!












Koutoubia Mosque


With its 70-meter tall minaret visible for miles around, the
Koutoubia Mosque
is Marrakech's most famous landmark. If visiting, bear in mind that only Muslims are allowed in!

Dar Si Said Museum of Moroccan Arts and Crafts


Trace the evolution of North African art in this magnificent old palace. If that tickled your fancy, head to the nearby Maison Tiskiwine for more on Saharan life through the ages.












Toubkal National Park


Though 57 km south of Marrakech, the home of North Africa's tallest mountain, Djebel Toubkal, is worth visiting just for the rustic village of Imlil, where most excursions start.






Planning Your Marrakech Visit




Where to stay?


Riads – traditional Moroccan houses with private interior courtyards – are a huge part of Marrakech's appeal. Some of the best riads in Marrakech are now hotels, so it's worth shopping around for a unique place to stay. Some of the top affordable options include Riad Rbaa Laroub, Riad Edward, and one of the oldest houses in the medina, Dar Hanane.




How to dress?


Most Moroccans are religious but tolerant. Some areas are more conservative than others, so a good rule of thumb is to observe how well-covered those around you are. For women especially, an outfit deemed to revealing might be a magnet for harassment. It's also worth checking in advance whether the places you plan to visit have a dress code, particularly at religious sites and landmarks.




How much money to take?


It depends on the nature of your trip although you should expect to spend about 300-500 MAD a day on food and 50 or so on taxis. Cabs to and from the airport should set you back about 200 MAD and souvenirs are generally cheap. Keep your expenditure low by haggling hard and only paying in the local currency (Dirham). That said, some pounds, dollars, or euros can be very useful in emergencies.

An amazing day out rich in culture and stunning scenery


Our guide was great,took us to an argon nut cooperative ,an experience riding a camel,then onto the Berger village up in the Atlas Mountains,always telling us about the history and culture of his people and after a hike around parts of the mountain and village we were treated to a beautiful meal at a Berger house. This trip from start to finish has been amazing and feel very grounded now. Met some great people and was always looked after by our guide. Would highly recommend this tour.

Nothing like it. Amazing. Unforgettable.


Our driver Yassim, picked us up from the hotel at exactly 9am. Promptly introduced himself, and made us feel comfortable from the first minute. The car had more than enough space for the 3 of us. Had a gentle manner. Knowledeable. Very pleasant aura about him.
Visit to argan oil place provided us rest from the trip. Tea was served with bread. Lady who talked about the business knew her trade so well. Place smelled so good.
Camel ride took us to another world. Will ride again :) While waiting for our turn, men were playing Berber music which made the experience all the more authentic.
Rashid—-our tour guide to Imlil and the Atlas Mountains—-you will always remain our friend, a dear brother. You have done more than show us the magic in Morroco. You are exceptional at what you do, and I hope life brings you all the blessings you so deserve. Shukran.

Unforgettable experience with excellent guide and driver!


Our guide Ridouane and driver Habib (from Marrakech Day trips) made this day an unforgettable experience! They know the area and the local people very well. Besides the tour in the comfortable car, they offered a camel ride, a short hike through the Imlil valley through small villages, a tasteful meal in a local guest house and several nice stops for panoramic pictures!
