What People Are Saying About Marrakech








An amazing day out rich in culture and stunning scenery


Our guide was great,took us to an argon nut cooperative ,an experience riding a camel,then onto the Berger village up in the Atlas Mountains,always telling us about the history and culture of his people and after a hike around parts of the mountain and village we were treated to a beautiful meal at a Berger house. This trip from start to finish has been amazing and feel very grounded now. Met some great people and was always looked after by our guide. Would highly recommend this tour.

Nothing like it. Amazing. Unforgettable.


Our driver Yassim, picked us up from the hotel at exactly 9am. Promptly introduced himself, and made us feel comfortable from the first minute. The car had more than enough space for the 3 of us. Had a gentle manner. Knowledeable. Very pleasant aura about him.
Visit to argan oil place provided us rest from the trip. Tea was served with bread. Lady who talked about the business knew her trade so well. Place smelled so good.
Camel ride took us to another world. Will ride again :) While waiting for our turn, men were playing Berber music which made the experience all the more authentic.
Rashid—-our tour guide to Imlil and the Atlas Mountains—-you will always remain our friend, a dear brother. You have done more than show us the magic in Morroco. You are exceptional at what you do, and I hope life brings you all the blessings you so deserve. Shukran.

Unforgettable experience with excellent guide and driver!


Our guide Ridouane and driver Habib (from Marrakech Day trips) made this day an unforgettable experience! They know the area and the local people very well. Besides the tour in the comfortable car, they offered a camel ride, a short hike through the Imlil valley through small villages, a tasteful meal in a local guest house and several nice stops for panoramic pictures!

Ideal excursion to get to to know Imlil Valley and Berber Culture.


Efficient and promt pick-up.Our guide, Ibrahim, was knowledgable, informative and charming. Our driver, Abdul- Rachman,was very friendly and highly skilled. The Camel ride was fun. We stopped at village street market full of local produce. Lunch on a terrace with spectacular views,was delicious and ample. Our walk was a wonderful and memorable experience. We would strongly recomend the trip to anyone interested in local history and hill- walking. Thanks for an unforgetable day Ibrahim and Abdul-Rachman. Mila ( Spain ) & Paul ( London )
