A History of the Colosseum


Never before have the old and the new fit together so well in one city. Promise us you won’t leave Rome without a visit to the Colosseum! As you get closer to it, you will be stunned by its sheer size and the power it radiates. Step inside and take a trip through history.












When Was It Built?


The Colosseum was commissioned by the emperors Vespasian and Titus, and was finished in 80 AD. Its completion was commemorated by 100 days of ceremony and games.












Gladiators and Games


The Colosseum was designed for sports, such as as fights between gladiators and wild beasts. Its semi-circular structure housed 50,000 spectators.












Fun Facts


The largest amphitheater in the world, the last gladiator fights were held there in 435 AD. Admission was free for all, and mock naval battles took place upon entry.












How It Survived


Unlike earlier Roman amphitheaters, the materials used were built to last: concrete for the foundations, travertine for the piers, tufa infill, and brick-faced concrete.












Behind the Scenes


Although earthquakes have caused some damage, most of the Colosseum still stands. The tour inside this archeological marvel, where you can retrace the steps of the gladiators, is a must-do.






Colosseum: Our Tips




Admission


You can pre-book a standard ticket online that covers all three monuments in the area: the Colosseum,
Roman Forum
, and
Palatine Hill
. Opening hours are from 8:30am until one hour before sunset.




Tours


If you want to do more than just walk in and grab a few shots with your camera, we recommend a small group tour. We’ve done it and it’s well worth it. An expert will teach you about ancient Roman history, architecture, sport, and little known facts that make the Colosseum come alive as you walk through it. You can also combine it with the guided tour of the Forum or Palatine Hill, plus you’ll get to skip the line.




Getting There


The 'Colosseo' station is located on Rome's blue metro line, two stops from Termini. You cannot miss the Colosseum as you exit the station.





Good to Know






When to visit

Open seven days a week, year-round from 8:30 - 18:15. Closed on December 25th and January 1st.





What is the price?

A simple entry ticket is €12.





Will I need a guide?

It's highly recommended!





How to get there

The 'Colosseo' metro station - the Colosseum itself is located directly outside the exit.





Additional tips



Get there early in the morning to avoid the crowds!

Make sure you wear sunscreen, as the Colosseum is open-air.









What People Are Saying About Colosseum








Wonderful place, wonderful tour, wonderful guide.


We spent a fantastic morning touring the Colosseum and the Forum. What an amazing place.
Our guide Marlee was great and ensured that we got the most out of our visit. She was extremely knowledgeable and never boring. She really made the place come to life for us.
A friend recommended that we take guided tours in Rome and she was so right. We had a great time.
Thank you Marlee.

Sam was great, exclusive access to arena floor worth the fee in itself


Sam was a great tour guide, his humour and knowledge of the Colosseum added another dimension to the tour! Being able to get a few minutes of just our group on the arena floor having walked through the Gladiator’s grand entrance allowed you to go back in time in your mind! So much more information than just walking around reading the plaques made it the right decision for us to take this tour! Add to that the option to continue into the forum for more background on the Roman era all within the ticket price made it money well spent!
It’s always a little concerning paying money on a website when you haven’t met the tour agent themselves, but a very professional outfit and definitely Fun Tours a simple concept with the radios and earpieces but made it a lot easier to enjoy the tour without the jostling to be close to Sam to hear what he had to say
I would definitely recommend them to friends and use them again myself
