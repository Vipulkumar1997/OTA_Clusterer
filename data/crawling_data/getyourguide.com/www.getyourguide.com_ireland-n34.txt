Where to go in Ireland



When travelers land in Dublin, they always want to kiss the
Blarney Stone
at the Blarney Castle. That's important, of course, but there are so many more treasures to be found on the Emerald Isle.

The inspirational
Ring of Kerry
is a popular driving route guaranteed to bring visitors through a variety of tiny towns they won't want to miss. This most scenic ride in Ireland is best done by narrated tour to give explorers information only a native would know.

Visitors won't want to miss the so-called "Rebel County,"
Cork
, a magical place natives call "the real Capital of Ireland." The site of the famous "Wars of the Roses," was settled by Vikings over a thousand years ago.


Pub crawls
are a tradition among visitors and residents alike. To avoid only trendy tourist places, it's best to take a Pub Tour guided by an Irish native. But travelers wishing to get back to nature will want to see the
Cliffs of Moher
in County Clare. Home to over 30,000 birds living along a 300 million year-old river bed, the Cliffs offer amazing scenic displays. Nature buffs will also want to visit The
Wicklow Mountains
, a haven for wildlife and natural beauty.

Guided tours insure travelers of seeing the real Ireland in the least amount of time and savvy travelers know the best way to do that is to leave the mapping and planning to the experts.
