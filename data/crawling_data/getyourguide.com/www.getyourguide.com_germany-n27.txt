Where to go in Germany



Planning a trip to Germany, though an exciting task, can also be a bit overwhelming. It's hard to choose between the beautiful scenery, the medieval castles, and the many historical places.

For a taste of Germany's history, plan a visit to
Berlin
, where you can see the
Brandenburg Gate
. Or, visit the East Side Gallery: once a part of the
Berlin Wall
, it is now one of the largest open-air art galleries in the world.

As one of Germany's oldest cities,
Cologne
also offers examples of Germany's past. It has the advantage of being located on the shores of the Rhine River as well. Rent a bike and pedal along the river and don't forget to stop and enjoy a few of Germany's famous beers.

Prime examples of Germany's beautiful scenery can be found in
Dresden
along the
Elbe River
and
Munich
near the
Bavarian Alps
. Dresden also has some of the best
museums
in the world.

For first class shopping, examples of magnificent architecture, and a visit to the third largest port in the world, visit
Hamburg
. If it is architecture you like, Germany has over 25,000 castles and palaces. Perhaps the most famous castle in the world is
Neuschwanstein
, in Bavaria. This and hundreds of other German castles perch high atop mountains or sit along strategic rivers.

Germany has something for everyone: old historic cities, beautiful rivers and mountains, castles and architecture from different eras of history, and the opportunity to relax and just enjoy a beer.
