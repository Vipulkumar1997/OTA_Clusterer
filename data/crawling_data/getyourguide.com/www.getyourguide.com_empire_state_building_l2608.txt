The Best Views of the Empire State Building


The high point of the New York skyline, Manhattan would not be Manhattan without its beloved Empire State Building standing tall above the city. We guarantee you'll fall in love with New York the moment you look up and first see it. Here are the very best vantage points.












Top of the Rock


Should you go to
Top of the Rock
(Rockefeller Center) or Empire State Building to get the view? At the Top of the Rock, you get to see the Empire State Building as part of the view. Simply the best.












From the Streets of the Flatiron District


Head to the
Flatiron Building
and stroll through Madison Square Park. Stand in the pedestrian island on 5th Avenue at 22nd Street, and you’ll have your picture perfect photo.












From a Cruise around Manhattan


Book a cruise around Manhattan, and you’ll get a panoramic view, seeing just how beautifully the Empire State Building stands out among its surrounding skyline.












East River State Park, Kent Street, Williamsburg


In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the beautiful East River State Park provides some of the best skyline views of Manhattan. Bonus: the park holds food and flea markets on the weekends.












To the Top of the Empire State Building


Head to the Empire State Building itself. Astounding views of Manhattan await you from the observation deck. It will take your breath away, we promise.

What People Are Saying About Empire State Building








A wonderful way to see the city and great information too!


We thoroughly enjoyed the Architecture Cruise. The food and drinks were a wonderful addition to the cruise. Last year we took the brunch tour and enjoyed it so much we booked this one! Crew and lecture guide are very professional not to mention the lovely maintained boat. Book this cruise....you won't be disappointed.!

Phenomenal views & skip the line service worth it


I didn't expect the skip the line ticket to be much help, I was so wrong. It saved so much queuing time, leaving us more shopping time.
As for the building, the view is truly exceptional. A must - do.

An interesting and beautiful way to see Manhattan


It was a fun, informative, truly enjoyable way to see Manhattan. There was something of interest to see on both sides of the boat and our host had so many amusing stories to tell.

Excellent, knowledgeable AIA guide/wonderful perspecitve on NYC area


I wish I had done this on my first trip to NYC to get some perspective on the city and the surrounding communities and how they fit together. We had an excellent guide who was/is a practicing architect. He was very knowledgeable about the various buildings and bridges we viewed as we circled the island. The tour made me want to return to NYC and visit areas that weren't on my horizon previously. Importantly, the boat was clean and comfortable and the crew was polite and attentive. Great trip. I highly recommend it.
