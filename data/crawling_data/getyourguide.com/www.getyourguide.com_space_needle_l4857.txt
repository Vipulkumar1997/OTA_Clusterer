What People Are Saying About Space Needle








Fin way to see the sites of downtown Seattle


Fun way to see highlights of downtown Seattle, and where you might want to go back and spend more time. But definitely plan on more than 2 hours for this adventure.

Perfect price for all the tourist spots.


This was a great value for a bundle of all the things I would've done on my trip anyway. Can't beat the price and even locals recommend it!
