What People Are Saying About Cairns








Excellent trip staff on board were all very helpful.


Only comment is that I didn't realise I had to collect a boarding ticket at the marina before I could get on board.

Perfect way to see the Great Barrier Reef


Everyone was wonderful and super helpful. Although there was about 25+ people on the boat everyone was comfortable and very organized. The food was delish, there was something for everyone and then some. The boat was very clean and the staff made sure garbage cans were emptied regularly. Some people were seasick and staff was right there to keep them comfortable. While snorkeling someone was with us in the water showing us where to look to make sure we were all ok and there were other staff looking out for us on the main boat and a smaller boat. All day different staff members too pictures of us and later on it was posted on their Facebook page. I feel there was enough staff to make sure everyone was safe, well looked after and comfortable.

I would totally recommend my friends to take this tour when they come out to view the Great Barrier Reef in Cairns.

There was 4 adults, 2 kids (4 & 11 years old) and we all enjoyed ourselves.

Thank you Seastar for a wonderful day!!!

Amazing way to see the Great Barrier Reef and Green Island.


The full one day trip was amazing, from the lovely reception from staff and cuppa and Danish pastry first thing in the morning through to the fantastic snorkelling morning and afternoon on a section of the Reef no one else was on and a trip to Green Island. We even saw a turtle.
Great food, lovely small group and very attentive staff!!! My first trip to Australia and to the Reef, all the way from Scotland, and this was the best trip to book to see the Reef. The sailing on the way back was the icing on the cake, literally as you were provided with cake on the return journey.
I would recommend this one day trip to anyone wanting to see the Great Barrier Reef!!!!!
Thank you for an amazing day. ❤️
