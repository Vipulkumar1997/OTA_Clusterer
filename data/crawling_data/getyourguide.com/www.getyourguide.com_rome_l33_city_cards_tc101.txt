Five Reasons To Get A Rome City Pass


Rome
wasn't built in a day, but if you plan to see it in three, you might want to consider getting a city pass. Here are five reasons why the investment is worth it!












Travel


Rome passes include a travelcard for public transport, so you needn't worry about lining up for tickets or trying to purchase them with your phrasebook Italian!












Free attractions


Get free entry to many of Rome's leading attractions, including the
Vatican Museums
and
Sistine Chapel
, the Roman Forum, and the
Colosseum
. Discounts are available on many others.












Skip the lines


If free admission isn't enough, you'll also get fast-track entry to many museums and monuments. Don't waste time on lines during peak season - fit more into your itinerary!












Complimentary tour


First time in Rome? What better way to get the lay of the land than a hop-on hop-off bus tour, complete with audio commentary, at no extra cost?












Guide


Your Rome City Pass will come with a free guidebook and map. Depending on which pass you opt for, your city guide may also be available as an app!






Planning Your Visit




How many different city passes are there?


There are two Rome city cards available: the Roma Pass and the Omnia Pass. They offer similar benefits but with some slight differences. For instance, the Omnia Pass has a limit on how many attractions you can visit for free, but offers a physical city guide (rather than an app) as well as free audio guide hire at some museums. The Roma Pass offers a wider variety of attractions, so it's worth figuring out which works better for your itinerary.



Is it worth it?


Ultimately, this comes down to what and how much you want to see. Do you plan on using public transport a lot, visiting the main museums and attractions, and covering the tourist circuit with a bus tour? Then pre-book a Rome city pass.

What People Are Saying About Rome








Great for skipping the lines and getting around Rome!


Bypassing the line at the Colosseum and Roman Forum was by far the best. Once you see the lineup, it almost makes you not want to go in - but the pass made it all worth it.
The metro is a easy to take and will get you around Rome in no time. Highly recommend.

Highly recommend you book ahead with omnia - getting a seat on the yellow buses was so worth it and no queueing

Nice to skip the line. Hot and tiring with kids.

It was perfect! Everything as we planned! It's really worth it!


You should always book before you reach there because it is just impossible to get in the attractions! Everywhere it is just fully packed!!! Never lasting queues!! So, you definitely skip the line and achieve your goal by means of their reps!
