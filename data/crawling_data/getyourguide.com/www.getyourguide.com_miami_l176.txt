Top 10 things to do in Miami


With a relaxed beach life and Cuban-bred passion for partying, this Floridian metropolis is a pastel paradise for people watching. And animals too! Here are Miami's top 10 attractions.












Fisher Island


Home to superstars and the mega-rich, the most affluent corner of the US isn't open to just anyone, but you can get pretty close to
Fisher Island
on a boat tour of the bay.

Miami Seaquarium


"Flipper" was filmed at the US' oldest oceanarium on Virginia Key, but there are more creatures at the
Miami Seaquarium
than just performing marine animals – aquatic and otherwise!












Gator Park



Gator Park
is the place to go if you want to see alligators, of course, but take an airboat tour of this Everglades attraction for snakes, turtles, and exotic birds too!




Miami Museum of Science


2015 sees the grand reopening of Miami's leading science museum, but this is Miami so there are animals here too. Check out the bird of prey center!












South Beach


Home to the famous Ocean Drive, the first part of Miami to be developed is arguably still the most... well, Miami-ish.
South Beach
remains one of the city's best beaches too.












Vizcaya Museum & Gardens


Once known as
Villa Vizcaya
, this opulent estate is now open to the public to walk around and think about moving there upon winning the lottery.

Miami Children's Museum


With exhibits catered to the young (and young at heart), this is a great place to take the family, especially if your children are averse to regular museums!












Zoo Miami


Miami's climate makes it the ideal location for the only tropical zoo in the US. For a small fee you can even feed the giraffes!












Miami Beach Architectural District


This historic district of Miami Beach is sometimes referred to as the Art Deco District. No prizes for guessing which style of architecture dominates its postcard-perfect streets!

Bass Museum of Art


With art from the Renaissance to the present day, the city's leading gallery occupies Miami Beach's old public library building.






Planning Your Miami Visit




When to go?


The city's basketball team is called the Miami Heat for a reason. The tropical monsoon climate means it's always hot, although you can expect thunderstorms in summer and hurricane season runs for as long as June to November. Nevertheless, it's perfect for sunbathing in winter!




How many days?


Most of Miami Beach's best attractions can be covered in 3 or 4 days, but book at least a week if you want to see more of the city and/or go to the Everglades.




How safe is it?


Despite its depiction in movies, much of Miami is pretty safe. Like most cities though, it has parts tourists would be smart to avoid. High-crime areas include Biscayne Boulevard, Liberty City, Opa-Locka, and Overtown. Unlike the others, you might have reason to go to Miami's Downtown district, but stay alert, especially after dark.

Captain Your Own Mini-Speedboat: 90 Minute Guided Tour

We liked it but could be better if the promised water materialised.


It was a unique experience, especially the breezy airboat ride through the grassy glades which could had been given more time rather than the waiting for the wildlife to appear.

We also wasted 45 minutes at the Port of Miami for reasons that have nothing to do with the tour.

The staff are all niçe, though. Thank you.

Get up close to the gators in their natural habitat


We saw 4 alligators during the trip. Bob our captain told us all about the history and environmental issues of the Everglades and its inhabitants. Amazing trip and you get the chance to hold a baby gator in the exhibit area for a small donation.
Ear defenders not supplied like other tours but earplugs are provided.

Miami Beach: Star Island Segway Tour

It was enjoyable, entertaining, and informative.


We enjoyed the Everglades excursion and had hotel pickup in a comfortable air conditioned bus. Our bilingual bus driver pointed out and described sights and wildlife (iguanas, etc.) in both languages going to Holiday Park but spoke primarily in Spanish on the return trip. Because of crowds, we were directed to the alligator show first which was an unplanned deviation from normal routine and may have left less time for the gift shop. We saw four alligators, a couple of vultures, and the cormorants on the covered boat ride; not an over abundance of wildlife, but the information about vegetation and Everglades formation, while not as exciting, was as important to us. All guides - bus and boat driver, and the alligator handler, were all knowledgeable and entertaining. The only thing we may have done differently would be to add an Everglades bike ride but it was August and hot. Overall, we were very pleased with the excursion and glad we did it.
