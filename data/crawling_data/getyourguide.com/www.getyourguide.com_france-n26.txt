Where to go in France



Whether you are visiting France for the first or twentieth time, it's easy to find something new and exciting to do. Because
Paris
is the most visited city in the world, there are countless tours already set up for you! You don't have to do any of the legwork before you go. If it is your first visit, start with a walking, bike, or bus tour to get an introduction to the highlights of the city. Because there is so much to do in Paris, this will help you decide on what you'd prefer to focus your time.

More specialized tours, such as those of the
Louvre
or the
Eiffel Tower
, will help you appreciate these famous sights to their fullest. In addition, you will have the opportunity to skip the long lines at the entrance! This is especially advantageous if you have limited time in the city. Finally, end your visit with a
boat cruise along the Seine
at night. It's a magical way to end a trip in the City of Lights.

If you've been to Paris before or have more time, consider a day trip outside the city. You can take an all-day tour out to the D-Day
Beaches of Normandy
for a lovely break from city life. If you have less time on your hands, consider a short jaunt out to the
Palace of Versailles
. While the grounds and palace are beautiful in their own right, a guided tour can make the past come alive as stories of royalty are revealed. If you have even more time or are considering another trip, go south to
Provence
. The luscious
lavender fields
and local
wine
will leave you sighing in contentment.

Whatever your pleasure, know that you don't have to plan your entire trip. Instead, let France take you by the hand. You'll fall in love.
