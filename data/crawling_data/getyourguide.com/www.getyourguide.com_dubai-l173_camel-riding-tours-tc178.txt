What People Are Saying About Dubai








This was an amazing experience! Highly recommended.


Compared to the desert safari we did last year with another tour operator, this was definitely the better one. Our driver John, was superb at this job and his customer care was fabulous. No trip to Dubai would be complete without a trip to the desert.

Do not miss this! It is so much fun! :-)


We enjoyed this desert safari so much!!! We heard about it from a friend and so glad we were able to experience it. It was well organised, our guide Ansar was so helpful! He is not only a very experienced driver, but photographer and entertainer at the same time. Everything was perfect, the quad ride, the sand boarding and camel ride. The BBQ was really nice and the 2 dancers were amazing too. I wish I could go back now!

We have received excellent service, Oceanair is a highly professional organization. Our guide was Ilyas, he has been very kind, professional driver, we felt safe during the whole safari. He has made his best to entertain us, he made beautiful and extra photoes of us at the sunset and has assisted us to feel entertained.
We would like to thank ILYAS for the beautiful evening, I highly recommend him and Oceanair for booking such an exciting safari tour!!! :)

Phantastic trip into the desert with a perfect driver


Our driver Mansoor was the best. He was not only an experienced and secure driver. He also was very friendly and kind. He told us a lot about Dubai and the U.A.E. during the drive to the desert camp. During the afternoon we drove through sand dunes, did some sand surfing and camelback riding. We finished the day with a spectacular evening in a desert camp were we had a barbecue, shows and many more things to do. We really enjoyed the tour and - again - Mansoor, our perfect driver and host.
