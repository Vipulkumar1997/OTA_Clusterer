Best things to do in Cairo


You can't swing a hookah in Cairo without striking archeological treasure! "The City of a Thousand Minarets" boasts not only stunning Ottoman mosques, but ancient wonders and a clash of modern and traditional cultures. Here's what to see.




Pyramid of Djoser


Book a day trip to this stepped tomb built by the earliest known architect, Imhotep. The
Pyramid of Djoser
has survived over 4 millenia, though all that remains of the Pharoah Djoser is his left foot!




Egyptian Museum of Antiquities


The museum boasts the
world's largest collection of Egyptian antiquities
, including Tutankhamen's solid gold death mask. Expect strict security measures, but it's truly a must-see!




Al-Azhar Park


Finished in 2005, it's already hard to imagine how the site of the breathtaking
Al-Azhar Park
was once a mountain of garbage accumulated over five centuries!




Al-Azhar Mosque


For a tour of Cairo's religious life and history, there's no better place to start than at the city's oldest mosque.
Al-Azhar Mosque
was built in 970AD and it's also home to the world's first university!




Khan Al-Khalili



Khan Al-Khalili
,Cairo's most prominent souk (market), is as old as the Egyptian capital itself, and its economic heart still beats with tourists and locals alike!




Mosque of Muhammad Ali


Crowning its citadel is Cairo's most prominent landmark. Not only is the stunning
Mosque of Muhammad Ali
one of the best places to visit, it offers greats views of the city too.




Giza Necropolis


Though home to two of Cairo's most famous icons –
the Great Pyramids and Sphinx
– the Necropolis' best attraction might actually be the fascinating ancient workers' village.






Planning Your Cairo Visit




When to go?


The best time to visit Cairo is from October through to May, when the weather isn't insufferably hot. Hotels are cheaper during its scorching summer, but don't settle for a place without air conditioning and a pool!




How many days?


Book 3 or 4 days minimum just for sightseeing, but a full week is recommended for archeological day trips, or simply to uncover the many sides of Cairo's vibrant culture.

What People Are Saying About Cairo








Great introduction to the Great Pyramids


I booked this tour for my brother and I for our visit to Egypt. Our guide, Tharwat, was fantastic. He was able to answer all our questions, knew tons of interesting information, and provided helpful tips and advice. Definitely recommend!

Wonderful whole day Tour with Sameh seeing the most incredible sights


This tour was a great experience. Sameh met us at the hotel and was full of facts and useful information throughout the day. I could not recommend this tour more and especially Sameh. Sameh is friendly and there is no pressure you can do things at your own pace and he has suggestions of other places to visit, he wants you to enjoy your time in Egypt. The organization was seamless and if you are thinking of booking do not hesitate and ask for Sameh you will not be disappointed.

We were very pleased with the tour. Sam was punctual, very organized, very professional. We enjoyed the tour. I review things I saw 30 years before and my wife was very excited to see them first time. Like the previous day in the Egyptian museum, Sam was very professional. Thank you both - Peter and Sam !

The trip overall was exquisite, but I would drop the train.


The trip was wonderful, but the sleeper car train segment was a nightmare. Unfortunately the taste of this segment, can ruin or taint the overall experience. The coordination of drivers and guides was extraordinary. The quality of the guides and tours was wonderful. I would give this tour 5 stars minus the sleeper car experience.
