Best things to do in Reykjavík


Reykjavík is a tiny city thousands of miles from anywhere, so why should you go? Well, for starters, there's the breathtaking volcanic scenery, revitalizing hot springs, and crowd-free (though no less impressive) landmarks. And the best thing is, that's not even the tip of the iceberg!












National Museum of Iceland


This journey through Iceland's history is easy to find from Tjörnin Pond, but if you must ask for directions, impress the natives by using its simple Icelandic name –
Þjóðminjasafn
!












Perlan


Home to the Saga Museum and an impressive artificial geyser,
Perlan
is a stunning glass dome crowned by one of the city's best restaurants. The views are just as good as the food!












Hallgrímskirkja


Inspired by Iceland's volcanic rock formations,
Hallgrímskirkja
can be seen from almost anywhere in the city! Take the elevator to the top for Reykjavík's best city views.












Harpa - Reykjavík Concert Hall & Conference Center


Reykjavík's cultural heart beats inside this center.
Harpa
not only hosts some of Iceland's best shows, but has become a benchmark of Nordic design and architecture!












Blue Lagoon


The
Blue Lagoon
is a geothermal spa and health center, which is famous for its revitalizing treatments and facilities. If that sounds like too much fuss, visit the Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach instead!

Kolaportid Flea Market


By the old harbor you'll find Icelandic delicacies like fermented shark among the vintage clothes, vinyl, and usual flea market nicknacks. Come ready with cash to avoid the long ATM queues!












Elliðaárdalur Valley


This recreational area on the edge of the city makes for one of Reykjavík's top excursions. The Elliðaár river runs through its lush flora, swarming with char, salmon, and trout!






Planning Your Reykjavik Visit




Best time to visit?


Reykjavík's endless summer days make it a fun place to visit between June and August, but if you want to see the Northern Lights, your best bet is to go in the winter. Bear in mind, however, that the otherworldly phenomenon (also known as the Aurora Borealis) is notoriously difficult to predict. If it's important that you see it, boost your chances by booking a longer holiday and keeping up-to-date with the daily forecasts.




How long to stay?


Reykjavík has a lot of life in it for such a small city. How many days you need depends on what you want from your holiday. A weekend will be enough to see the city's sights, However, if you want to enjoy any of Iceland's scenic excursions, or immerse yourself in the capital's eccentric nightlife and music scene, a week might not be enough!




How expensive is it?


Reykjavík, like most Nordic cities, has a reputation for being quite expensive and, for a city of its size, that's a fair assessment. Ultimately though, Reykjavík is no more expensive than London or Paris. Furthermore, you're unlikely to encounter hidden costs and can expect excellent value for money.

What People Are Saying About Reykjavik








Well organised even with short daylight time


The guide was very nice and has explained many things about the trip and golden circle. The first part, the lagoon, was a little confusing in how it worked, where to leave our stuff and so on, we stayed there from 09.00-12.00 when the bus left back to the station. This was an amazing time because the sun was rise. There we got back to the bus station where we swapped bus towards the lake of the old parliament, followed by the geyser and the waterfall Gullfoss. There might be not enough time if you want to take many long pictures since the sunset was pretty soon, but for us it was enough. We will see these in summertime too!

Amazing company, amazing guide - highly recommend!


We were so thrilled with the tour to the golden circle and south shore. It was gorgeous, this family run company was amazing to work with and we learned so much about Iceland. Thank you!

A wonderful experience, even in winter. Beautiful horses, lovely staff


This is my first trip to Iceland. I was looking forward to doing the beginner horse riding tour with my son, but was a little nervous as I hadn't ridden on a horse for a long time and have never had lessons or anything. But after my initial nerves I felt very comfortable and relaxed and was happy to go from a walk to a gentle trot. I look forward to doing this again in the summer. - yes I've fallen in love with Iceland and will be back! The guides were great - friendly and reassuring. Pick up time was about 15 minutes late but our accommodation is in the suburbs so I accepted that. I recommend this tour to anyone who wants to experience these splendid Icelandic horses first hand.

Very knowledgeable tour guide and great sights


Excellent tour guide. Very informative. Well worth the money. Saw some great sights in the snow and ice and ended with a nice hot dip in the secret lagoon.

Great tour, fab guide, clean coach with big windows for great views


Tour ran like clockwork. Picked up from bus stop 2 & taken in minibus to our coach for the day which was clean, with big windows to take in the spectacular views enroute.
Day paced well to see everything, but not too rushed. (We had only 3 days to see Iceland) Tour guide (Elun) regaled us with some great Icelandic stories & myths! Had lunch at geyser, lots of choice and served quickly despite being busy. Expensive of course. Great value tour for all the family (age 8,15,45 & 50!)
Highly recommended.
