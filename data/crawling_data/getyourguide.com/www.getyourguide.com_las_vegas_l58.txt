Top 10 things to do in Las Vegas


Call it Sin City if you want, but there's no denying that the Entertainment Capital of the World has a unique allure. After all, it took a lot more than seedy clichés to make Las Vegas one of the world's leading tourist destinations!












Las Vegas Helicopter Tours


Vegas isn't a place to be enjoyed on the cheap! Set the tone for extravagance with
Helicopter tours
of the city's kitsch architecture and surrounding desert landscapes.












Death Valley



Death Valley
, the hottest corner of North America, may be ominously named but its beauty is quite humbling, and it even blooms in spring. Just bring plenty of water!












Las Vegas Strip


The
Las Vegas Strip
boasts many of the world's largest hotels and casinos, all hosting their own dazzling shows. Take the scenic route by limo!












Fountains of Bellagio


The choreographed fountains in front of the Bellagio hotel "dance" every 15 minutes from 8pm till midnight (and every 30 in the afternoons)!












Mirage Volcano


The huge volcano in front of the Mirage hotel is another attraction in the same vein. It erupts on the hour from 8pm till midnight and, oddly, smells like pina coladas!

Las Vegas Motor Speedway


If gambling in the casinos isn't enough to set your pulse racing then how about zipping around the thrilling Motor Speedway in a luxury sports car?












Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area


You might be able to see the canyon's breathtaking red rock formations from your hotel window but getting up close to the
Red Rock Canyon
is a must for avid hikers, rock climbers, and mountain bikers!












Hoover Dam Bypass


The
Hoover Dam Bypass
is actually called the Mike O'Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge, but neither name really does justice to this spectacular feat of engineering!












Hoover Dam


Did somebody say feat of engineering? The
Hoover Dam
's art-deco design is impressive inside and out, although the exterior's breathtaking enormity is truly something to behold.

Stratosphere Tower


The tallest freestanding observation tower in the US offers the best views in Las Vegas, as well as a revolving restaurant and four terrifying amusement rides!






Planning Your Las Vegas Visit




When to go?


Unless you have a high tolerance for heat, plan your trip either side of summer. If you want to avoid the crowds then visit during the week.




How to get around?


From cabs and double-decker buses to helicopters and the Las Vegas monorail, the city has no shortage of ways to travel. Just remember that everything gravitates towards the Strip.




How to dress?


Women shouldn't have a problem but male dress codes differ for nightclubs so it's worth checking them online. Generally speaking though, a shirt and decent shoes go a long way.




How to win?


You're on your own there! Good luck!

What People Are Saying About Las Vegas








Fabulous tour. Clint was wonderful. Beautiful State Park . Must see


Perfect day, perfect weather to explore and enjoy Valle of Fire State Park. So close to Las Vegas. Wonderful way to spend a day outside of Strip. Clint was wonderful and very knowledgeable and full of facts about the area. I recommend this tour for anyone that want to get away from the crowds of Las Vegas and enjoy some beautiful nature .

Everyone who wants to make a quick trip and see as much as possible - this is your chance! We saw so many beautiful places in such a short amount of time, but we still had enough time to explore. Great experience!
