What People Are Saying About Hanoi








The best Hanoi trip is not to miss Ha Long Bay!!!


A literally full day tour of the Ha Long Bay. Don’t schedule anything at night because you might come back from this trip as late at 9pm. The bus who picked us up was late, the tour info said pick up will be at 8am but the shuttle arrived at past 9am. The tour guide was just ok, the bus ride was so bumpy! Don’t ever sit at the back if you want to enjoy the 8 hour (back and forth) road trip. At the Ha Long Bay, you’ll be amazed, will take your breath away! The itinerary was good, tour of the bay, hiking in the wonderful cave and bamboo/kayaking! I highly recommend to do the bamboo boat for a more relaxing feel.. We left late because the tour guides were looking for 2 people “missing” but they were not really missing. They were in the boat and tour guides just didn’t know how to do head counting and panicked to looked for then using a kayak.

Overall, the trip was the best, staff and tour guide were courteous, the bus was clean but not comfortable, the itinerary was perfect!

Great day out but a long way on that bus


We had a great day but the 2.5 hour bus trip each way would have been much better if the bus had been more comfortable.

That said Tam Coc was amazing and I think the value for money was great. I am very happy that we went and experienced this amazing part of the country.

Fun and easy to get to know authentic Hanoi


Taste the bust bum cha in town, sip some egg coffee, visit the temples and in between enjoy the crazy Hanoi traffic on a bike. Highly recommended as the best way to get to know this great city.

We love how the tour was organized with a great guide!


We had a very good and enjoYable time! Although it was just a 1-day trip, we got the best out of it, seeing Halong Bay and the Dong Thiên Cave. We were picked up and along the way fed many interesting facts and culture by our guide, David Hèng. Weather was good and we took a lot of nice photos. The bamboo boat ride was nice and relaxing and we had a very engaging row-lady. The ended happily with all us tired and satisfied on the bus. Thank you David for making it memorable!
