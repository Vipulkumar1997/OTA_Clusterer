Top 10 things to do in Lisbon


Portugal's capital city offers an unpretentious culture coupled with a splendid, historic cityscape. As one of Europe's oldest cities, it's also one of the most fascinating to explore! Here are some top tips to get you started.












Jeronimos Monastery


The magnificent
Jeronimos Monastery
near the shoreline of Belém was once home to the Hieronymite monks – Catholic hermits whose primary role it was to pray for the King's soul!












Bairro Alto


The loosely translated Upper Neighborhood is Lisbon's most historically opulent quarter.
Bairro Alto
is a great place to wander, its preserved romantic ambiance boasts some of the city's top attractions!












Lisbon Cathedral


Built in 1147 and subsequently developed over time, the
Lisbon Cathedral
is a bold mix of architectural styles, yet maintains the imposing authority of its Medieval incarnation.












Rossio Square


Once the scene of celebrations, bullfights, executions, and uprisings, Lisbon's historic
Rossio Square
is the meeting point of choice for locals and tourists alike.












Alfama


The city's oldest district can be found between the São Jorge Castle and the Tagus River.
Alfama
is the place to be for Lisbon's best restaurants and Fado bars!












Tagus River


Whether cycling along its bank or cruising its waters, be sure to explore Lisbon's pulse.
Tagus River
's estuary is a haven for fish, crustaceans, and birds, including flamingos!












Commerce Square


Called
Praça do Comércio
in Portuguese, this vast town square is also known as Palace Square (Terreiro do Paço). The Royal Palace stood here before being flattened by the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake!












Belém Tower


Not only did his 16th-century harbor fortress defend the municipality of Lisbon from coastal attack, but
Belém Tower
was also crucial to Portugal's role in the era's Age of Discovery!

Chiado Square



Chiado
's subsequent recovery after a devastating fire in 1988 has made it perhaps the wealthiest corner of the city. It's now Lisbon's most famous shopping district!












Santa Justa Lift


With the advent of electric power, Lisbon built two elevators to improve access between its hilly streets. This peculiar feat of engineering is a true relic!






Planning Your Lisbon Visit




Best time to visit?


Lisbon is lucky enough to have the warmest winters in Europe without the disadvantage of suffering from intense summer heat. Nevertheless, the subtropic coastal climate is prone to sudden bursts of rain even on its clearest days, so be warned! Going in late spring or early autumn generally means cheaper hotel prices and more manageable crowds.




How many days?


The heart of Lisbon makes a great choice for a long weekend, but many of its top attractions lie within the city's greater subregion. Top day trips include
Belém
,
Sintra
,
Fátima
, and
Cascais
, with many more besides. Each will need at least an entire day to see, if not two.




How to get from Lisbon airport to the city?


Though Lisbon is cheap by the standards of most European capitals, getting one of the cabs waiting outside the airport can be expensive. If you're traveling somewhere central without much luggage, it's undoubtedly cheaper and easier to take the metro. It should only take about 25 minutes to the city center.

We really loved the boat trip. It was really awesome!!!


Two hours of an amazing view on Lisboa. We enjoyed ourselves on this little spectacular trip. Despite rainy weather, they agreed to do the trip. And as soon as we got on the boot, tge weather got better and we got our beautiful sunset view. There were two guys, who told us about a lot of sightseeings, gave us blankets and drinks. Really nice, relaxing experience. It was a highlight of our Lissabon trip and its perfect ending.

Beautiful tour, wonderful guide, just do it!!


I was hesitant booking this at first since I’ve always been an independent traveler but I could not have enjoyed it more!! I went with my boyfriend and we loved every minute of it. There was one other couple in our group who we got along great with, they were travelers and adventurers just like ourselves looking for a cultural and intimate tour outside of Lisbon. The guide gave us just enough information to enjoy each stop and pointed out interesting sights along the way. We could tell he really loved what he was doing, he was funny and talkative and happily answered all of our questions. We had just enough time in each place and never felt rushed or hurried. We were dropped off to explore on our own at each location and then told a meeting time for departure to the next destination. Lunch was nothing special but not too long, giving us plenty of time to enjoy our last stop. Pick-up and drop off at our hotel was a great bonus! Also loved skipping the ticket lines!

A great time with José Ribeiro as our pleasant accommodating guide.


Our guide, José, was so pleasant, humorous and knowledgeable. He made sure that we saw what we wanted to see and also extras around Sintra. A terrific time for our party of 6. We were able to see a lot in the limited time.
Thanks, José.
