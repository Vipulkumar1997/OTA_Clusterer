Where to go in United Arab Emirates



There is a desert adventure waiting in the United Arab Emirates. Within the land of
Abu Dhabi
, the largest emirate, lies the oasis city of
Al Ain
. Its centuries-old history can be appreciated at the
Palace Museum
. One can experience the spirit of the desert firsthand on a
desert safari
. Go
camel riding
and climb to the top of the ancient dunes to experience a sunset unlike anywhere else in the world. When the experience is over and it is time for more excitement, the dunes will be ripe for
sand skiing
back down.


Dubai
still has lots to offer away from the sandy dunes. The booming middle-eastern
business center
offers the 7th largest shopping mall in the world, the
Dubai Mall
. In addition, since 2010, Dubai is home to the
world's tallest building
; the
Burj Khalifa
in downtown Dubai. The spectacle of desert opulence and grandeur continues in the
souk
districts along the Dubai saltwater creek, which are home to hundreds of
gold retailers
, and an estimated 10 tons of gold at any given time. After an eye-opening night of gold shopping,
Dhow cruises
are a popular way to relax and see the sights alongside the creek like the
Chamber of Commerce
and the
Diera Twin Towers
.
