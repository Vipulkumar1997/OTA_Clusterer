Seven Things to Do in Kathmandu


Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal. You can explore thousands of years of culture here, while making your way through historic temples and monasteries that belong to Hindus and Buddhists alike.

Basantapur Durbar Square


Through the 19th century,
Basantapur Durbar Square
was the playground of the Nepalese monarchy. Due to natural disasters over the years, many buildings in the square have needed repair, but Durbar square maintains a tradition of Nepalese architecture and is ranked as an UNESCO World Heritage site.












Shechen Monastery


A Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Shechen Monastery was founded in the late 17th century. Three hundred monks take care of Shechen, which is one of six mother monasteries in Nepal.












Boudhanath


Located on an ancient trade route, this place of meditation is a must-see on any spiritual journey around Kathmandu. Boudhanath is one of the largest stupa's in the world, and many Tibetan traders and merchants have offered their prayers to this land over the centuries.












Kopan Monastery


The
Kopan Monastery
is not far from Boudhanath and is mostly known for teaching Buddhism to foreigners. Starting in the 1970s the monastery offered a month-long meditation course in November and December. At other times throughout the year, please note that the monastery is only open to the public on Saturday.












Harati Devi Temple


The Tibetan name of the Harati Devi Temple is
Swayambhunath
and translates to "sublime trees." The ancient religious architecture frames a museum, library, stupa, and more; and visitors are sure to discover much about Nepalese traditions of worship at the Harati Devi Temple.












Pashupatinath Temple


You'll find the
Pashupatinath Temple
on the banks of the Bagmati River. A Hindu temple, Pashupatinath has been on UNESCO's World Heritage list since 1979. If you're visiting in February or March, check out the Maha Shivaratri festival, which more than 70,000 people celebrate at this temple.












Lumbini


A historical site in the tradition of Buddhism,
Lumbini
is where Queen Mayadevi is said to have given birth to Siddartha Gautama in BC 623. Immerse yourself in monasteries here, as Lumbini is in a monastic zone, in which hotels or restaurants cannot be legally built nearby.






Planning Your Kathmandu Visit




How to Get Around Kathmandu?


The easiest way to get around short distances is by hiring a bicycle rickshaw. You can also hire a taxi or rent a bike. Make sure to negotiate fares at the beginning of your journey.




When to go to Kathmandu?


The best time to go to Kathmandu is October through November as the sun shines the most often. During the summer your plans are likely to get rained out--it's monsoon season. The second best time to visit is February through May, when winter is over but the rain has not yet begun.




What to Eat in Kathmandu?


Many say Kathmandu has the most varied cuisine available in Asia. While you're in Nepal, be sure to sample some local fare. We recommend you try daal (lentil soup), with bhat (rice), or a vegetable curry. Another staple is a Momo, which is a Tibetan style dumpling that uses Nepali spices.

Well organised and great views of Kathmandu and surrounding valleys


The tour was well organised and Sujan the manager was hugely helpful in contacting us before the tour started and helping us arrange everything and making sure we were prepared.

The 3 day trek is great. A certain level of fitness is required, but the guides are supportive and friendly and take the trek at your pace. The groups are small which gives you a much more personal experience also. You are taken through evergreen forests, jungle-esk pathways and contend with some muddy roads at a couple of points. It gives you everything you would want from a trek in just 3 days. The homestays were basic and beautiful and gave you magnificent views of the valleys below.

The view's of the Kathmandu and naighbouring towns were beautiful and I highly recommend to take the time to see Kathmandu from this angle.

The hike ends at the Kathmandu Home Hotel which is perfectly situated in the hustle and bustle of Thamel, but sits just on a quieter street which is ideal.

It was really great, but you need to be fit enough


It was awesome experience. But I don't think kids or unfit people can do it. You need to exercise regulary before do this to prepare your body and heart. I walked 26.000 steps on the first day, 43.000 on the second. I bailed on the third day because I barely can walk anymore. The tour guide (Laxman) was really experinced, very nice, and his English was fluent enough. He offered us to finish the 3rd day routes by car (it's possible).
But it was really rewarding with the super clean air, great view, and tasty local foods. Himalayan Mountain range can be seen from the room. You can also watch sunset/ sunrise from your bed. I met few people from all around the world during the trip.
We came on June during the Monsoon season. Luckily for us it was only raining during the night. The routes were muddy and slippery though.
It was really an experince to try rather than only shops and eat in Khatmandu.

Perfect tour, many suggestions and I made my choice before we departed


Really nice and informative guide. Also, I was discussing with my guide what I might do for a 2 night trip whilst I was in Kathmandu / Nepal - and he suggested the perfect trip for me given my desires - and I booked it as soon as I got back to my hotel room.
