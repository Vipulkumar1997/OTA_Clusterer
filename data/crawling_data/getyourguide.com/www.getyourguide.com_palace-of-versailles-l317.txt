The Top 5 Highlights of the Palace of Versailles


It's hardly surprising that the Palace of Versailles attracts over 10 million visitors per year – it's one of the most majestic places on earth, no exaggeration. Every nook and cranny is worth exploring, but if time is tight, here are the highlights.












Hall of Mirrors


This is the palace's most resplendent room. Each of its 17 arched windows is decorated with 21 mirrors, resulting in a stunning spectacle as light is reflected off 357 mirrors!












The Royal Chapel


Though it's just one of five chapels in the palace, this opulent architectural wonder is by far the most breathtaking. Marie Antoinette's wedding took place here.












The Grand Apartments


Lavishly decorated from top to bottom, the king's apartments are absolutely ravishing -- you'll deem them to be "fit for a king."

The Clock Room


This room's 250-year-old clock is a technical marvel. Not only does it show the time, date, and even the phases of the moon, but it also features a working model of the solar system!












The Gardens


With its impeccable lawns, geometric flower beds, rows of statues, and ornamental lakes, the splendor of the palace's gardens rivals even the most ornate interiors.






Palace of Versailles: Our Tips




Avoid Mondays


When planning your visit to the Palace of Versailles, keep in mind that the palace is closed on Mondays. On every other day, the visiting hours are from 9:00am to 5:30pm, and from April until October, they're extended to 6:30pm.




Get there early


You'll be amazed by the size of the Palace of Versailles and the sheer amount there is to see. Even if you just stick to the above highlights, you'll want to give yourself ample time. On the other hand, if you intend to see everything, you may even consider spreading your visit over more than one day trip.




Fountain Show


The Palace of Versailles' musical fountain shows are quite simply awe-inspiring. They're held from April until October, on every weekend and public holiday from 11:00am to 12:00pm and again from 3:30pm to 5:00pm. It's absolutely worth scheduling your visit for the fountain shows.





Good to Know






When to visit

Closed Mondays. Opening times vary from high season (Apr 1st to Oct 31st) to low season (Nov 1st to Mar 31st).





What is the price?

Tickets for guided tours start from €32, depending on the type you would like.





Will I need a guide?

No, but there are audio tours available.





How to get there

Versailles is one hour outside the city. Get there by the Versailles Express coach, leaving twice a day from the Eiffel Tower, or taking an SNCF train from either the Montparnasse or Saint-Lazare station.





Additional tips



Make sure you are informed about ticket validity and train schedules ahead of your visit.

Flash photography is not permitted inside the palace.

Our guide was excellent and the tour great.


Our guide picked us and dropped us off at our hotel. The Palace and grounds were beautiful and our guides knowledge of the history made this trip one of the highlights of our trip. It was well worth the extra money.

Beautiful grounds, having bought ticket in advance I was so disappointed to queue for one and a half hours to get into the palace...

We enjoyed the palace and gardens very much.


But we did not expect to wait an hour on line to enter. Also we did not have proper footware for the stoney entrance online before entering the palace. You should mention that this is not foot friendly.

Stunning, brilliant, elegant, relxing fall day of taking it all in!


The chateau was stunning. The audio was helpful and you could linger in any room as long as you wanted. The crowds were huge, even in late September. We did arrive by 9:30 by train using the NaviGo tickets. The gardens were beautiful and gardeners were out. We had time, sine we took the train in on our own, to walk out to all of the various far buildings and tour through on our ticket. The old farm, water wheel mill, and village were so pretty. One huge building was getting rethatched and refurbished.... scaffolding galore! In all, we spent 6+ hours at Versailles and we'd go again!
