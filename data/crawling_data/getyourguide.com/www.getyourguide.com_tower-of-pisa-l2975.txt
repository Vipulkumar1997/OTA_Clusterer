5 fun facts about the Leaning Tower of Pisa


The Leaning Tower of Pisa is so iconic that it's easy to forget just what a strange building it really is. In case you didn't know, it's the bell tower of Pisa's cathedral, and it has a history as peculiar as its characteristic tilt!












Bad foundations


The Leaning Tower of Pisa is tilted because the foundations are softer on one side than the other. This started decades before its original construction was finished in 1372!












It was saved by war


Construction was delayed by Pisa's wars against its neighbors, allowing the foundations' soil to settle. If the tower had been finished on schedule, it would have fallen over!












Nobody knows who the architect was


Recent studies favor the enigmatic Diotisalvi over the previously credited Pisano brothers, although he usually signed his buildings. Was he too embarassed to leave his mark?












Galileo's famous experiment probably didn't happen


The Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment helped prove Galileo's laws of free fall. However, with no account from the great scientist himself, most historians doubt it actually happened!












Germany leans further


The Leaning Tower of Suurhusen is the world's most unintentionally tilted building. Second place is also taken by the Germans, with the steeple of Bad Frankenhausen's Oberkirche!






Tower of Pisa: Our Tips




Best time to visit


Go in mid-June to experience Pisa's Luminara festival on June 16th, and the San Ranieri Day parade on the 17th. The best time of day to visit the Leaning Tower depends on what you want out of the trip. Early birds will beat the crowds, but you should check the weather first as it'll likely be clearer later on. Important if you want to get some decent selfies!




How to get there?


The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a relatively easy walk north from Pisa Centrale station, though buses are also available from the bus stop in front of the Jolly Hotel (right across from Pisa Centrale). Pisan buses are sorted by color rather than number, so look out for one with the red LAM sign (LAM rossa) on the front. Alight at the stop "Torre."




How many steps?


You'll need to be pretty fit to climb the Leaning Tower. If you're not sure, take the north-facing staircase to the top. It has two fewer steps (294 as opposed to 296)!





Good to Know






When to visit

Opening times vary due to the season and religious holidays, but generally it is open between the hours of 10:00AM and 5:00PM.





What is the price?

€18 to enter the Tower.





Will I need a guide?

It will definitely help. It's worth checking out our best-selling tours.





How to get there

The Tower is five minutes' walk from the Cathedral Square.





Additional tips



Wear good walking shoes, and don't exert yourself when it comes to climbing the 296 stairs.

You can book a ticket for the Tower from 20 days in advance.









What People Are Saying About Tower of Pisa








Amazing sights and Cinque Terre is a stunning location


Alex was a great guide, full of information on each sight/town but was also happy to let you wander on your own. I would definitely recommend going on this tour, if you get Alex it is definitely a bonus!! He handled public transport issues on the day very well and kept calm in what seemed like a tough situation.

This was a most enjoyable tour, dispite the weather.


Our tour to Pisa was great, the weather didn't cooperate; there was a torrential downpour during our visit. It did make for some great photo shoots however. Both the tour guides were very informative, you do switch guides from the bus to the site guide. We did not purchase tickets to climb the tower for two reasons, 1. the weather and 2. the time is scheduled and the climb and view time is limited.

Just a note from our personal experience, check all the information on the voucher thoroughly. The meeting point indicated on our voucher had been changed due to construction around the Train station. We had to call the tour operator for clarification and the direction given to the new meeting point could have been clearer. Give yourself ample time to get to the meeting point.
