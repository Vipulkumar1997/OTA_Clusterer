What People Are Saying About Edinburgh








It was a great tour, with a special thanks to Eszter!


The tour was interesting. Instead of underground, the tour appeared to be under the bridge. Eszter made the tour, such a story teller she is! She shared true stories and was funny at the same time.

Fantastic evening exploring a different side of Edinburgh


I organised a group tour for some work friends, we had a great time, visiting parts of Edinburgh we'd never seen before. Adam, our guide, was super and I'd thoroughly recommend this activity.

Fantastic, informative, great value tour


Decided to book this tour for something a little different during our short break in Edinburgh and loved it.
Dr Knox the guide and driver Frank acted out and told us all the ghoulish tales whilst getting everyone including the younger passengers involved! Especially loved the visit to Greyfriars Cemetery which was even more spooky on a dark, frosty night !
