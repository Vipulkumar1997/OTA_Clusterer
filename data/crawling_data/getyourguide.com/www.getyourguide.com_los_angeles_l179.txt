Top 10 things to see in Los Angeles


Culture, nightlife, sun, sand, and the Hollywood Hills, L.A. has it all. But as the second largest city in the U.S. knowing what to do on a trip here can be a little daunting. Here are our top ten attractions to help you see the city at its best.

Universal Studios Hollywood


Of course the world-famous film studio and theme park is on the list. Make sure to book your
Universal Studios Hollywood tickets
early so as not to be disappointed!












Griffith Park


For a little bit of greenery away from the roar of the city, head to
Griffith Park
. One of the largest urban parks in North America, you can spend the day hiking or just relaxing.












Venice Beach


When in L.A., how could you not head to the
Venice Beach
to take in the sights and sounds? Spend some time relaxing on the sand or enjoying live music and street performers.

Walt Disney Concert Hall


Home to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the
Walt Disney Concert Hall
is one of the most spectacular concert halls in the world, both for the sound and the architechtural design.

Hollywood Sign


No trip to L.A. would be complete without seeing the
Hollywood Sign
. And of course you should get a holiday snap with the hills behind you. Go on, everyone does it.

The Dolby Theatre


The famous
Dolby Theatre
on Hollywood Boulevard is home to many red carpet events and is an important part of L.A.'s celebrity culture. A definite stop to make on any sightseeing tour.

California Science Center


Why not take a tour at the
California Science Center
one of the best science museums on the planet and expand your knowledge of the world, the universe, and everything else?

Park La Brea


In the mood to spot celebrities? Go for a wander through
Park La Brea
. This housing complex is home to a number of famous people and offers insight into how the other half lives.












Los Angeles Zoo & Botanical Gardens


If you're craving some wildlife, then make a stop at
Los Angeles Zoo
one of the most impressive zoos in the world. And of course a stroll through the Botanical Gardens wouldn't hurt either.












Mulholland Drive


Head along at dusk for spectacular and inspiring views of the San Fernando Valley from
Mulholland Drive
. One of L.A.'s top attractions is the view of the city itself.






Planning Your Los Angeles Visit




When to visit Los Angeles?


The best time to visit the city is in the summer. From June into September there's plenty for tourists to do. Perfect beach weather and good temperatures all day long.




How to get around?


Los Angeles has a good public transport system for some of the city, but not all of it. In the more tourist-friendly areas, you can hop on and off of metro buses, DASH buses, and metro rail trains. But if you want to see the city for yourself and cover more ground around the beach areas, why not rent a car?




Where to stay?


If you're looking for somewhere that's not too expensive, then head to the downtown area. You'll find some great hotels that are well-connected to the city, but not so close to some attractions. West Hollywood is another good, but more expensive choice. Or why not book a stay at the beach in Santa Monica?

Was a great and educational day with the grandchildren.


Our guide was very amusing and knowledgeable. She was also very considerate of the fact that it was very hot outside and made sure we were under the shade of a tree whenever we stopped.

Emily made the tour a lot of fun. Enjoyed everything we saw.


Enjoyed seeing all the streets, working areas, Clint's office, cars and getting to do activities. Again, Emily was a great guide and gave us amble time to see everything. Except for taking two hours to get there we had fun. I called to say we were stuck in traffic and was told no problem. Took away the stress. Would recommend to others.
