Top 10 things to do in Edinburgh


Edinburgh is an effortlessly cohesive reflection of Scotland's breathtaking rural landscape, flaunting cultural vibrancy, historic charm, and scenic wonder. Even its New Town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. So, what are its top attractions?












Edinburgh Castle


The
Edinburgh Castle
was built at least as early as the 12th century. Looking over the city from Castle Rock, it's been at the heart of some of Scotland's bloodiest conflicts.












Stirling Castle


Having withstood multiple sieges,
Stirling
is one of Scotland's most important castles. Even if you're not a history buff, the scenery alone warrants a day trip from the capital!












Loch Lomond


What's a holiday to Scotland without visiting one of its picturesque lochs? Luckily, the largest and most breathtaking one in the country, the
Loch Lomond
, is just a short journey away!












Holyrood Palace


The Holyrood Abbey next to the
Holyrood Palace
is still in ruins after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Fun fact: Holyrood is Old English for "holy cross."












Royal Mile


The historic thoroughfare, called
The Royal Mile
, runs through Edinburgh's Old Town from the Castle to Holyrood for one Scots mile. That's longer than a regular mile, in case you were wondering!












Greyfriars Church


The birthplace of 17th-century Scottish Presbyterianism, this church is a landmark of the country's religious history. It still holds Sunday services in English and Scottish Gaelic.












Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh


Dating back to 1670, when it was used to grow medicinal plants, this conservation project has bloomed into a leading tourist attraction. Today it houses over 13,000 plant species!

HMY Britannia


Built in 1953, this royal yacht is considered one of the UK's top attractions. You can even enjoy lunch or afternoon tea on the Royal Deck!




Rosslyn Chapel


Just south of Edinburgh lies the village of Roslin, where the spectacular
Rosslyn Chapel
was built 600 years ago as an object of curiosity and splendor. A truly unique example of religious architecture!




Our Dynamic Earth


The Holyrood area sits beneath a dormant volcano. The information center Our Dynamic Earth is the perfect place to learn about the natural processes that shaped our planet from the Big Bang to the present!






Planning Your Edinburgh Visit




Best time to visit?


Edinburgh is heaving with visitors throughout the summer, but for good reason – it's festival season! If you'd rather see the city significantly less hectic then you'll have to brave the Scottish winter. The good news is that few landscapes lend themselves so beautifully to cloud and drizzle as that of Scotland!




When is the Edinburgh Festival?


Edinburgh has several large festivals occupying its streets throughout summer, including their film, jazz, and book festivals. However, it's common to mistake the Edinburgh Fringe – the world's largest performing arts festival – as THE festival. It spans 25 days of August. This year's exact dates, and those for the other events too, can be found
here
.




How long to stay?


Book at least a week in Edinburgh if you can. Many of the city's most popular attractions require more time than you'll realise and there's already more than enough to do, especially during festival season. Plus, if you haven't ventured into Scotland's awe-inspiring countryside before, you should consider at least one day trip out of the city too!

What People Are Saying About Edinburgh








Brilliant experience! Amazing, humorous guide!!


Not knowing what to expect, my friend and I waited at the stop for the bus to arrive for our day trip. When it arrived, we had a bright orange "hairy coo" bus which was comfortable and had the most amazing driver, who was also our guide. Graham, was hilarious from the moment we met him, giving us a taste of his humor and sarcasm while he showed us the sights and played some Scottish only music along the way. It was very organised and I felt it was both time and money well spent! I will be recommending to others, and maybe coming along too, if I am lucky enough to find myself in Scotland again soon!

Great toir, amazing guide and a great ecperience@


Our guide James was great! Showed great knowledge about Scotland and its history and he was really passionate about it. We all got in the mood with him. He was great at customising the experience for us. We were really interested in castles and he made a few extra stops for us to admire them, even though some of them were not part of the tour.Landscapes and castles were awesome. Small groups are great! A fantastic experience!

Fantastic afternoon, great food, great staff, loved every minute!


Our party of four were so looking forward to afternoon tea on the bus, and we weren't disappointed! It was fantastic from beginning to end. The food was nicely presented, good choices, a glass of fizz, what more could you want? We were entertained with festive music, some commentary along the way as well. The staff were very pleasant and helpful, nothing was too much trouble, even on a moving bus! It was bumpy at times and we had to hold onto our drinks, but it all added to the fun. Everyone enjoyed themselves, and we are definitely booking again when we come back to Edinburgh next year. Thank you to all of the Red Bus team.

Wonderful experience of British history.


In addition to selling sweets in the Naafi Shop it would be lovely to be able to send a postcard from the Mail Room on board ship, franked or stamped with Britannia logo.
