Luxury Holidays To St Vincent and The Grenadines



Luxury Holidays to St Vincent and The Grenadines with Elegant Resorts


If unspoilt white sandy beaches and tranquil islands away from the hustle and bustle of some of the more populated parts of the
Caribbean
are your thing, then a luxury holiday to The Grenadines is an ideal choice. In fact, it really doesn’t get any more Robinson Crusoe than this in the
Caribbean
. Situated to the west of
Barbados
and south of
St Lucia
, and forming part of the Windward Islands, the best way to reach these little pieces of paradise in the sea is by plane from nearby
Barbados
which makes it an excellent two-centre option for those wanting to see more of what the region has to offer.
A collection of islands seemingly hand-selected by the gods; like lush jewels delicately placed into idyllic, turquoise waters.  To holiday here is to know true luxury; paradise not only found, but perfected.  Everything from the aesthetic appeal of these manicured islands to the laid-back and laissez-faire attitude of this exotic nirvana is enchanting and captivating in a matchless manner; for the epitome of luxury and escapism, nowhere else comes close.
