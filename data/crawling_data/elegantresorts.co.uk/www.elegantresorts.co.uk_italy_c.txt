Luxury Holidays to Italy with Elegant Resorts



Experience a luxury holiday to Italy, home to an innumerable number of World Heritage Sites and renowned for its wonderful coasts, mountains and lakes. Also a landmark in the world of fashion and celebrated for its wine and cuisine, it is easy to understand why it is one of the most preferred tourist destinations in the world.
Epicureans return again and again, while couples adore Italy for her romantic cities and families spend summer holidays exploring the artistic treasures and stunning coastlines which offer infinite pleasures including diving from Sardinia’s Golden Coast and the beautiful countryside with its ideal conditions for walking and cycling. Adventure lovers meanwhile can head for the world-class ski resorts in the
scenic
Alps and Dolomites.



To make the most of any luxury holiday to Italy with Elegant Resorts, we recommend you combine a few nights in one of the cities with either the country or coast or one of the islands - feel free to call and speak to one of our Travel Consultants for more information or to create your own bespoke itinerary.
