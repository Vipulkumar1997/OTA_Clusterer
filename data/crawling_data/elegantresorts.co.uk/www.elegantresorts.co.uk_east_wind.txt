Luxury Holidays  At  East Winds

Situated on the azure waters and warm golden sands of one of St Lucia’s most pristine bays, and boasting twelve acres of glorious gardens – home to St Lucian Hummingbirds, secretive mangrove cuckoos and spectacular shore birds – it offers a beautiful natural haven. Spread throughout this, mostly in semi-detached cottages and rondavels, the stylish rooms are informal yet elegant, spacious and immaculately furnished. Add to this its warm service – the staff are as intrinsic to the experience as the brilliant sunsets and tropical setting – and you have a truly enchanting escape.
