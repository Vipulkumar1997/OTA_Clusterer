Sports Academies with Elegant Resorts


With more and more leisure activities available at luxury resorts, families now have a wealth of opportunities to enjoy a range of sports during the summer months in a more tailored environment and with professional coaching, including boxing, cricket, swimming and racquet sports. Budding young football stars will be delighted to learn that there are a number of soccer schools available, particularly in European resorts, which are run by professional football academies – including some that are affiliated to top Premier League football clubs such as Arsenal FC and Chelsea FC, while golf and tennis are extremely popular pursuits for all ages and there are a huge number of resorts in
Europe
and the
Caribbean
that cater for all levels of ability.



Head to
the Bahamas
to enjoy private junior or adult lessons with certified instructors at One&Only Ocean Club’s Golf Academy, or stay at a fabulous European resort such as Finca Cortesin’s Nicklaus Academy in southern
Spain
, offering intensive, skill-specific courses and providing expert technical analysis using the latest technology. More unusual academies include the Sani Resort Sailing Academy in
Halkidiki
for youngsters from 6 to 17 years old and a six-day Triathlon and Biking Camp at
Almyra
in
Cyprus
where you can be coached in swimming, cycling fitness and running. At some of our luxury resorts, you’ll find that there are academies led by guest instructors who have been at the top of their respective professional games. In
Sardinia
, for example, your children could attend Forte Village’s Rugby Academy and be coached by pros such as Austin Healey, Will Greenwood and Martin Johnson. If it’s an action-packed holiday with intense sports coaching you and the family require, we have a selection of excellent options where all the facilities and instruction are in one place.
