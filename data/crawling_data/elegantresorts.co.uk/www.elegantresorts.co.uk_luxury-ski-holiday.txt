Luxury Ski Holidays with Elegant Resorts



Whether you fancy a European ski holiday or prefer to venture further afield to the USA or
Canada
, we’ve an eclectic collection of ski resorts, luxury hotels and gorgeous chalets for you to choose from, whether you are travelling as a couple, family or a group of friends. Novice skiers and snowboarders will have options for tuition, with private or group lessons held at the resorts’ ski schools, while little ones have the option of attending kindergartens that teach skiing or have play areas for those who don’t wish to learn.
Of course, each area’s variable terrain and facilities will determine which resort would be best for you and your party and our expert Travel Consultants know them all and can guide you towards the right one for you.



There’s no need to worry if you’re going on a ski holiday, but don’t actually want to ski very much, if at all, as most resorts can offer a huge variety of alternative snow sports and activities, including sleigh rides, snowshoeing, ice-skating, ice-climbing, sledging and tobogganing, or else there’s always shopping opportunities to tempt you, with a huge number of our European resorts, in particular, boasting designer boutiques – such as Gucci, Chanel and Prada – that are perfect for a little retail therapy.
People-watching can be a fine pastime and mountain restaurants and stylish village bars and cafes provide great venues in which to watch the world go by, and by the evening, whether your skiing or not, you’ll be off the slopes and looking for relaxation or the most hard-core après-ski you can find and this is where the hotel’s spas are a most attractive option, particularly if you’ve tired yourself out throughout the day.
If you have any remaining energy, the resorts’ bars and nightclubs will no doubt draw you in. Wherever you decide to travel to, you can be assured of glamour, Alpine chic, a cosmopolitan ambience, spectacular scenery, stylish accommodation and an array of exciting activities, whether you’ll be skiing and snowboarding or not.
