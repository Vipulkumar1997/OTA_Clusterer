Luxury Holidays to Croatia with Elegant Resorts


Croatia’s pleasures are timeless, and the Croatians are committed to preserving the extraordinary beauty of the Dalmatian Coast; backed by high mountains with hundreds of offshore islands, it is becoming one of
Europe
's most popular holiday hot spots.
Take a luxury holiday to Croatia with Elegant Resorts and you'll find each island in Dalmatia has its own character and the coast is dotted with everything from major cities such as Split and Zadar, to picture-perfect beaches such as lovely Brela Beach. Inland, admire ancient Roman ruins, soak in a thermal spa, hike through pristine forests watered by mountain streams, and embrace the many local festivals, admiring the colourful dancers whirling around to traditional folk melodies.
