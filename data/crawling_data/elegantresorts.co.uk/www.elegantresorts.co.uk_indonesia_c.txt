Luxury Holidays to Indonesia with Elegant Resorts


Indonesia doesn’t do anything by halves; it is the world’s largest archipelago (approximately 1, 700 tropical islands) and contains the second-largest tropical rainforest in the world with the world's largest flower, a three-foot-wide orchid, and the world's largest lizard, the infamous Komodo Dragon - Indonesia's extremes are vast and stupendous. An all-in-one destination, where no two places are the same, Indonesia offers a heady combination of culture, shopping, tropical vistas and scuba-diving. It’s also home to some of the world’s most beautiful beaches and super-uber hotels, which is why a luxury holiday to Indonesia with Elegant Resorts should be on everyone’s bucket list.
