Luxury Holidays to Australasia with Elegant Resorts



Venture to the lands 'down under' and prepare to be amazed by the sheer scale and wealth of the natural beauty that awaits you.
Australia is the ultimate destination for those looking to combine luxury with a thrilling dose of adventure. With a heady mix of dazzling cities, acres of lush national parks, rainforests, pristine beaches and reefs and the uniquely iconic Red Centre,
Australia
is a firm favourite amongst travellers looking to experience something out of the ordinary.



New Zealand is renowned for offering adventurous travellers a taste of nature at its most astounding. The bubbling geysers, crashing waterfalls, snowy peaks and glacial fiords have to be seen to be believed. Divided into two islands,
North Island
offers a mix of fantastic beaches, cosmopolitan cities and thermal springs, while South Island offers a choice of adrenalin-inducing activities, including diving and dolphin and penguin-watching, while those seeking an epicurean experience will adore the fabulous wineries, restaurants and bars.

French Polynesia is an incredible region of the South Pacific, comprising a collection of lush tropical islands such as Tahiti and Moorea. Gorgeous Bora Bora is another gem and is one of the world's most romantic destinations, where the majestic mountain backdrop gives way to pristine white-sand beaches, palm trees and warm, impossibly clear turquoise ocean.
Try combining your stay in
Australia
and/or
New Zealand
with the South Pacific or Asia. It would maximise your experience and break up the inevitable long journey to the other side of the world, and it goes without saying that our Travel Consultants would be only too happy to create a bespoke itinerary for you.
Explore this site to view our featured locations and attractions, or call our Travel Consultants for more information.
