Luxury Holidays to Laos with Elegant Resorts



A luxury holiday to Laos with Elegant Resorts is an opportunity to escape from the fast-paced lifestyle of the developed world and indulge in this gentle land’s timeless appeal. Laos is often referred to as the 'land of a million elephants' or the 'sleeping beauty of South East Asia'. Situated in the heart of French Indo-China, landlocked between
Thailand
,
Burma (Myanmar)
,
China
,
Vietnam
and
Cambodia
, travellers to Laos will find themselves captivated by the mist-veiled mountains, rivers running through untouched forests and monks trailing along pathways in search of their morning alms. Refreshingly, the traditional ways of life continue here; to hurry is simply not the Laos way. Lao's Buddhist religion is still intense and the diverse hill tribes retain their age-old cultures.
