Luxury Holidays to Malaysia with Elegant Resorts


An exotic mix of Chinese, Malay, Indian and British cultures have contributed to make Malaysia a richly diverse and fascinating country and an exciting luxury holiday destination for Elegant Resorts' clients. The gateway to the region is usually via Kuala Lumpur, one of
Asia's
biggest cities. Away from the capital, we feature a resort in Terengganu, on Peninsular Malaysia, where you can take jungle walks and river cruises, discover sleepy villages or snorkel off Tenggol Island, one of
Asia's
best dive sites. Meanwhile, on the island of Langkawi, known as the 'island of legends', we feature two resorts which are perfect retreats for nature-lovers seeking serenity and tranquillity. The island's countless delights include waterfalls, mountains, rice fields, forests, small villages, sublime beaches, bird sanctuaries and night markets.
