For a more energetic experience, try out its
golf courses
, watersports,
diving
and tennis. Whatever your pastime, a luxury Mauritius holiday will enchant you and uplift your soul. This is deservedly one of the most sought-after exclusive holiday destinations in the world and as it's just a few hours flying time from
South Africa,
it makes for a perfect safari/beach combination holiday.
