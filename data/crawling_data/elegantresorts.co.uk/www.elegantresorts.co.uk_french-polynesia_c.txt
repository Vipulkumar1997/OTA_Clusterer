Luxury Holidays To French Polynesia



Luxury Holidays to French Polynesia with Elegant Resorts



Widely documented as a
scenic
wonder of the world, French Polynesia boasts idyllic beaches and lush volcanic peaks, soaring through coral-filled lagoons. For those seeking exploration, you can enjoy a canoe excursion and feed the oceanic wildlife, or take a guided Jeep safari and hike amongst Bora Bora's forested interior. For those requiring less exertion, take a sunset cruise or an inter-island catamaran trip, providing the opportunity to see the sights and meet the locals.



Bora Bora island boasts a number of high-end boutiques that are perfect for a little retail therapy during your stay. Shop here for Tahitian pearls, original artwork, wooden handicrafts, perfumes and oils. Restaurants are plentiful too, providing serious shoppers with places to refuel mid spending spree. Those visitors interested in military history can discover the island's role in World War II. Relics can be discovered and its even possible to seek out the original US navy guns, which were left behind in 1945. Unsurprisingly, watersports are available in abundance in Bora Bora - scuba-diving and snorkelling amongst a truly breathtaking aquatic paradise is not to be missed. Above water, the nautical options include fishing, paddleboarding, parasailing, jet-skiing and feeding sharks and rays. More than anything, though, Bora Bora is an unforgettable destination for a wedding ceremony or a honeymoon and, even if you've already tied the knot, there can be few better places in the world in which to enjoy a romantic escape with your beloved.
