Luxury Holidays to North America with Elegant Resorts



Expansive, eclectic and exhilarating, the continent of North America is a melting pot of cultures in a collective incorporating
Canada
to the north, the
United States of America
in the centre, including
Hawaii
and Alaska, and
Mexico
in the south.
Canada comprises a vast swathe of wilderness landscapes, awe-inspiring mountain ranges and cosmopolitan cities, including vivacious
Vancouver
– a must-visit during a stay on the west coast. Explore the Rocky Mountains on board the famous
Rocky Mountaineer
luxury train, spend your time enjoying a huge array of outdoor activities and seeking out a variety of whale species in Clayoquot Sound on an eco wilderness adventure to
Vancouver
Island or Sonora Island, or venture across the ‘pond’ during the winter months to ski and snowboard at outstanding resorts such as
Whistler
,
Banff
,
Lake Louise
and
Jasper
– or, indeed, visit the same destinations in the summer, for an entirely different experience. Alternatively, on the east coast, why not combine a luxury cruise from Montreal to
New York
City, discovering the bon viveur of beautiful, French-influenced Quebec City and gloriously Colonial New England en route? The best way to see
Canada
is definitely through a tailored itinerary – and we’d be delighted to help you plan the perfect journey for you.




The
United States of America
needs no introduction at all, but allow us to remind you of the eclectic treasure it is. On the east coast, you’ll find three fabulous cities within a relatively short distance, by American standards –
Boston
,
New York
and
Washington D.C.
Each one is equally perfect for a short break, or as part of a longer itinerary, and boasts a distinct personality whilst being packed with history and culture, great shopping and dining opportunities – not to mention the odd landmark or two! At the southern end of the country,
Florida
and
Miami
pack a punch with glamour, Latino culture, superb beaches, the outstanding beauty of the Everglades and a few – very famous – theme parks, while on the west coast, culture-rich
California
shines and is overflowing with enticements, such as beaches, incredible national parks, trendy restaurants, bars and nightclubs, iconic cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, and a world-famous, laid-back and, very cool, vibe! Venture inland to find the desert jewels of
Arizona
,
Nevada
and
Utah
, replete with Native American culture, staggeringly beautiful landscapes, including the Grand Canyon, and the ludicrously effervescent and fun desert city,
Las Vegas
. The western side of the country is also home to
Montana
, known as ‘Big Sky Country’, and
Wyoming
, replete with magnificent scenery, including wide-open plains and the Rocky Mountains, world-famous national parks, such as Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and a rich Wild West culture – visit either of these states if you enjoy an immersive experience of the great outdoors and to channel your inner cowboy! In the far northwest, meanwhile, Alaska boasts magnificent ice fields, fjords and Arctic wildlife, as well as a rich history of gold mining. The best way to enjoy the Alaskan coast is on a luxury cruise and we have a fantastic itinerary that allows you to do just that. For an alternative experience, how about an
Ultimate Surf
or
Ultimate Dive
tour in the glorious Pacific islands of
Hawaii
, with specialist bespoke tuition from a world-famous waterman, Mark Healey, and his experienced team? Otherwise, enjoy the multicultural treasures the Hawaiian islands have to offer, along with magnificent swathes of sand, volcanoes and lush-green landscapes, as you relax at one of our featured beachfront resorts.
Mexico, on the border of
South America
, is an increasingly popular destination for a luxury holiday, due in no small part to its superb five star beach resorts along Riviera Maya and Los Cabos, offering enticing swathes of white-sand beach and facilities such as championship-level golf courses. Great for couples and watersports lovers, there are adults-only resorts offering the finest spas and romantic, gourmet destination dining, with each resort boasting a distinct Mexican/Spanish flair, underscored by the regions’ centuries-old Mayan culture, which can be discovered at a number of archaeological sites, uninhabited cities and ecological reserves.
Explore our website to view our featured destinations and properties, or call our expert Travel Consultants for further information and inspiration.
