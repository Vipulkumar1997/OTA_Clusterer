Luxury Family Holidays with Elegant Resorts


A luxury family holiday is one of those precious times when parents and children have each other all to themselves without the usual pressures of juggling work with cooking arrangements and homework. Many of us here at Elegant Resorts are mums and dads ourselves, so we understand that there may be challenges to face when holidaying as a family but also that the best holidays, as far as the kids are concerned, are the ones where they get to spend quality time with mum and dad although that doesn't mean to say that mums and dads need miss out on doing the things they enjoy.



Within our portfolio you'll find a wonderful selection of hotels and resorts offering superb kids' programmes, crèches and babysitting facilities. Children of all ages can have lots of fun socialising with others at the Kids' Clubs; taking part in sports, crafts or more educational activities such as learning about their surrounding environment. Making use of these facilities ensures that mums and dads get their well earned break and the freedom to enjoy a spa treatment, a round of golf or a romantic dinner for two, safe in the knowledge that the children are being well looked after.
