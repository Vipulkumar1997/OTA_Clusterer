Luxury Holidays To The Seychelles



Luxury Holidays to The Seychelles with Elegant Resorts



A luxury holiday to the Seychelles with Elegant Resorts will take you to an unspoilt tropical paradise. It must be one of the most beautiful island archipelagos on earth, and was once named 'The Original Garden of Eden'. It lives up to this reputation, with soft white beaches, coco de mer palms and lush wilderness filled with wildlife. Crystal clear waters teem with shoals of vividly coloured tropical fish, a marine heaven for divers and snorkellers. On terra firma, there's even a golf course.



Elegant Resorts clients, on their luxury holiday to the Seychelles, enjoy the epitome of luxury in peaceful and secluded Robinson Crusoe or modern-style villas. Nearby, botanical gardens, bird sanctuaries and World Heritage prehistoric forest make fascinating viewing. The Seychelles is a destination that offers its guests a rare chance for nirvana, and in the loveliest of surroundings.
