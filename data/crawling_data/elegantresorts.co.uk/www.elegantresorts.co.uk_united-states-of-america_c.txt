Luxury Holidays To The United States of America



Luxury Holidays to The United States of America with Elegant Resorts


The USA stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the Arctic Ocean to the
Caribbean
covering no less than eight time zones.  In between it ranges from tundra to tropics, from rainforest to desert, from mountain summits thousands of feet above sea level to salt lakes hundreds of feet below. It has something to offer everyone whether relaxation, rejuvenation or adventure is on your mind.
A luxury USA holiday will suit you whether you're looking for a honeymoon or travelling with the family, whether you want to stay in a city hotel for a long weekend or combine a city hotel with a stay in a resort either in the USA or the
Caribbean
. It's a wonderful place to visit, filled as it is with so many different worlds, subcultures and belief systems. In fact, it's because of this astonishing variety of everything on offer that, no matter how many times you visit, there will always be something new to discover.
