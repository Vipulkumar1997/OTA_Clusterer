Luxury Holidays to The Bahamas with Elegant Resorts


To complement the region’s abundance of natural assets, Elegant Resorts offers luxury holidays to The Bahamas and alongside its stunningly beautiful beaches, you will find world-class hotels, historical sites and local markets offering a taste of the islands traditional heritage. Our featured resort is located on Paradise Island, but all of the island’s are home to a wealth of marine life and offer inexhaustible opportunities to explore the waters above and below; sporting fishermen come from all over the world in search of the ‘big one’, divers are keen to explore the pleasures and challenges that lie beneath, while a host of regattas and races have earned the islands an international reputation for excellent sailing. For a unique and memorable experience it is also possible to swim with wild dolphins in an area of the world that is incredibly important for these gentle creatures.
