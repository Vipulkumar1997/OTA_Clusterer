Luxury Holidays to Ecuador with Elegant Resorts



Despite being the second smallest country in
South America
, Ecuador is big in its offering to visitors. Take a luxury holiday to Ecuador with Elegant Resorts and traverse the Ecuadorian Amazon Basin over glacial volcanoes, then drop down to the lush cloud forest and onward to the sparkling Pacific Coast - all within 24 hours. Alternatively, you could enjoy a cruise around the
Galapagos Islands
, which are located six-hundred miles off the west coast of Ecuador. Please call our Travel Consultants, who will happily create a bespoke holiday itinerary to suit your preferences.
