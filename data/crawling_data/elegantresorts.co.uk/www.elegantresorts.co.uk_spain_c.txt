Luxury Holidays to Spain with Elegant Resorts



From flamenco and fiestas to tapas and siestas, Spain is a country full of passion, vibrancy and charm.

Get set to party in
Madrid
, Spain’s sparkling capital. Especially at night when people fill the streets, keen to explore the countless bars and clubs. Expect sublime food in a dazzling array of dining venues, from tiny dishes of local delicacies to glossy, gastronomic creations. Discover world-class art in Madrid’s iconic galleries, the Museo del Prado in particular. Also opulent palaces, medieval mansions and sleek, shiny landmarks dotted about the city. Plenty to add to your sightseeing wish list.



An ultra-stylish city with a unique coastal setting,
Barcelona
offers an intoxicating mix of attractions. Gaudi’s extraordinary architecture. Art displays by Dali, Picasso and Miro. The shadowy lanes of the Gothic Quarter lined with Basque-style tapas bars and cava lounges. Catalan kitchens, Galician seafood taverns and amazing chocolate shops. The legendary Camp Nou football stadium. Even a string of sandy beaches for sunset promenades. And like
Madrid
, a party scene that’s wild and noisy.

Take a look at our fancy hotels and sample Spanish city life with Elegant Resorts soon!
