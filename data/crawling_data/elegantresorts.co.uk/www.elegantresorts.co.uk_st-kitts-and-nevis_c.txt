Luxury Holidays to St Kitts and Nevis with Elegant Resorts


Once known as the ‘Queen of the Caribbean’, St Kitts and Nevis are a pair of twin islands, blissfully untouched by commercialism. Offering an air of exclusivity with an emphasis on relaxation, a luxury holiday to Nevis with Elegant Resorts is perfect for those looking to escape to an authentic island paradise. 
A true natural beauty, St Kitts and Nevis has a trove on offer for adventurers, too. A towering volcanic mountain, golden sandy beaches and lush, tropical foliage are just the beginning, as an intriguing history lies tucked around every corner, from grand plantation manor houses, to relics of Lord Horatio Nelson’s endeavours. Whether you are looking to recline on pristine sands and soak up magnificent views, or rejuvenate by getting out and about in the wilderness, St Kitts and Nevis is a fabulously laidback and elegant destination in which to do just as you please.
