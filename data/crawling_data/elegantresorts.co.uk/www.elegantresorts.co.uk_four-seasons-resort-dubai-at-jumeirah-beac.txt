Luxury Holidays  At  Four Seasons Resort Dubai at Jumeirah Beach


Four Seasons Resort Dubai at Jumeirah Beach brings the old adage, ‘good things come to those who wait’ succinctly to life. A Spanish-Mediterranean architectural influence prevails, with Arabic accents appearing externally and in the contemporary interiors, which utilise coastal colours and textures to great effect - best exemplified in the guest rooms, which boast private terraces and stunning views. A fabulous array of world-class amenities and facilities include an extravagant day spa with a glass-canopied indoor swimming pool, a further two pools and an expansive, sandy beach. The resort boasts ten restaurants and bars, including the rooftop Mercury Lounge, with its elaborate spherically shaped bar and incredible views of the Dubai skyline. As you’d expect from Four Seasons, children are well catered for here, with a complimentary, supervised programme of events designed to take advantage of the resort’s setting.

City Highlights

One of the world's most dynamic and unique cities, Dubai is a glamorous playground that offers an unforgettable experience to guests of all tastes. Visit one of the ultra-modern malls, where luxurious designer shops combine with state-of-the art aquariums and breathtaking indoor ski resorts. Nestled within the city's sleek, modern architecture, discover the fascinating traditions of the Middle East. Step into the past at the tiny Bastakiya Quarter - lined with narrow streets and dotted with galleries and cafés - and enjoy delicious, traditional Emirati cuisine. Embrace Dubai's glorious landscape as you 'dune bash' through the expansive desert, or feel the water's thrill as you fly board high above the waves.





Family

Endless discovery and unparalleled fun awaits junior guests, with help from the extensive, educational and entertaining itinerary created by the 'Kids For All Seasons' programme. Taking advantage of the resort's lush grounds, children can join new friends to enjoy nature walks, fun in the swimming pool and locally inspired crafts. The sleek and sophisticated restaurants are completely family-friendly, offering delicious and nutritious children's menus, alongside thrilling play areas. Beyond the resort, Dubai offers a unique and captivating experience for children, including at Dubai Aquarium, Dolphin Bay and the exhilarating Wild Wadi Water Park.





The Beach

Pristinely white-sand beach, gloriously clear skies and the aquamarine water of the Arabian Gulf combine to make Dubai an unrivalled beach destination. The resort proudly spreads across 270 metres of stunning natural beachfront, where plush lounge chairs, attentive staff and delicious beachside treats ensure that you soak up the wonderful Arabian sun in complete comfort and luxury. Embrace the waves as you enjoy the environmentally conscious and complimentary non-motorised watersports, including kayaks, paddleboats and stand-up paddleboards, or feel total thrill aboard a jet-ski or on a banana boat.





Spa & Wellness

Inspired by Dubai's ancient pearl industry, The Pearl Spa creates a soothing experience of complete luxury and decadence.  Embracing local traditions, the elite-level signature treatments incorporate crushed pearls, camel milk and desert sand for body scrubs, while hammam rituals feature classic ghassoul clay treatments. After a revitalising therapy in the tranquil sanctuary of your treatment room, enjoy an aqua thermal experience like no other in the heated whirlpool, ice fountain and rain shower. Continue your journey of wellness and peace during an oceanfront yoga session or burn off those calories in the state-of-the-art fitness centre, open around the clock. .





Dining & Gourmet

Boasting an impressive five distinctive venues, Four Seasons Resort at Jumeirah Beach sits proudly among Dubai's best dining destinations.

LUXURYBARED INDEPENDENT REVIEW

Four Seasons Resort Dubai at Jumeirah Beach



I think it is fair to say that Dubai is probably the world's most competitive luxury hotel market. Every major brand is here (Mandarin Oriental coming in 2017) and for the most part, no money has been spared to create hotels of exceptional quality with an array of facilities and services to match. So the Four Seasons had its work cut out for it when it opened in November 2014, in finding its niche in this crowded marketplace.

To make things easy, let's start with what this hotel is and what it is not. What it is not is a beach resort. A hotel that just happens to have a beach (and a small one at that) in its back garden does not a resort make. So if you’re planning a long and languid beach vacation, I would suggest you look elsewhere. However, if it’s a luxury break you’re after, this babs for you. I classify this Four Seasons as a world-class, leisure hotel. There is a big difference between that and a beach resort.

The location is a little different from the rest, although it's a very good spot if you want to be a short ride away from all the action of downtown Dubai with its shopping, restaurants and, of course, the Dubai Mall and DIFC. And further down the road from the hotel you have the boutiques and cafes of Jumeirah. Personally, I like this address.

One of the other unique attributes of this hotel is something very special indeed: The Restaurant Pavilion, linked to the hotel by a covered walkway. This features exceptional food from two of the city’s best restaurants: Latin American food at Coya and some of the best Turkish food to be found in the Gulf, at NUSR-ET. And we really are talking exceptional food. Not to mention the hotel’s several other restaurants which are also top-notch.

You'll also find the Middle East outpost of the iconic American nightclub, Provocateur, right on your doorstep. So, for those dreaming of a Dubai mini-break in a hotel with exceptional service and an array of gourmet dining options along with chic, sophisticated entertainment, then the Four Seasons at Jumeirah Beach is most definitely the hotel of choice.
