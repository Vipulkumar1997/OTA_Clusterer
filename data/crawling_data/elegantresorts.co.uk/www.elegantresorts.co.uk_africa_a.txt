Luxury Holidays to Africa with Elegant Resorts


Noted for its incredible contrasts of scenery, encompassing lush jungle, parched savannah and endless desert, a visit to the continent of Africa used to be the ultimate holiday of a lifetime; today, with increased flight options and variety of accommodation, it's becoming a destination many return to again and again and again.
South Africa is an increasingly alluring destination, equally popular for couples as it is for families. Here, you'll find incredible scenery and wildlife on
safari
, the spectacular
Cape Winelands
with their raft of vineyards and gourmet restaurants, swathes of white-sand beaches and, of course, cosmopolitan
Cape Town
, dominated by a backdrop of Table Mountain and replete with first-class restaurants, attractions and emotive landmarks such as Robben Island.
Botswana
,
Namibia
,
Kenya
and
Rwanda
offer the choice of wetlands, desert, savannah and lush rainforest, each with their own wildlife and choice of lodges and luxury camps for a wilderness adventure like no other, while destinations such as
Mozambique
and
Zanzibar
provide idyllic island beach escapes, perfect for
honeymoons
and convenient for twinning with a
safari
. By contrast, northern Africa offers a kaleidoscope of colours in bustling souks and colour in the ancient city of
Morocco
.
Explore our website to view our fabulous collection of luxury hotels, lodgeas and camps in Africa or please call our Travel Consultants for more information.
