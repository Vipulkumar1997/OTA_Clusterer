Luxury Villa Holidays with Elegant Resorts



Imagine a luxury villa with its own swimming pool and private beach, combined with a full team of staff to cater for your every whim, the finest gourmet cuisine and, possibly, even your very own private spa. A luxury villa holiday with Elegant Resorts offers an escape from the restrictions of a hotel or resort's daily routine, giving you the complete freedom to do what you want, when you want. You'll enjoy a high level of privacy, without compromising on the standards and quality you’d find in a five-star hotel, no dress codes or fixed meal times – all complemented by the very best home comforts. Alternatively, if you are seeking privacy with the option of enjoying first class resort facilities, such as restaurants and children’s clubs, a luxury villa resort may just be the solution, allowing you and your party the best of both worlds.



In addition to our superb collection of luxury villas and villa resorts – which can be discovered in all of the destinations featured below – we also have in our portfolio a discreet, new collection of very exclusive private villas in spectacular locations in the South of
France
and
Ibiza
, each offering the utmost privacy and breathtaking glamour, along with the finest service. Indeed, the villas are so exclusive, we have elected not to feature them on our website. For high-profile clients who value their peace, quiet and security, these luxury villas will, undoubtedly, fit the bill.
