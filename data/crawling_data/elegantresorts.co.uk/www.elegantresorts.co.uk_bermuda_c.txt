Luxury Holidays to Bermuda with Elegant Resorts


Bermuda sits in the Atlantic Ocean about one-thousand miles north of the
Caribbean
Sea, and, as a British Colony with a long maritime history, it presents a quite different atmosphere to the rest of the islands in the West Indies.
On a luxury holiday to Bermuda with Elegant Resorts you'll find a quietly sophisticated island, offering visitors some wonderful museums, art galleries, UNESCO World Heritage Sites and botanical gardens to wander amongst, a pristine capital city, Hamilton, and a host of outstanding golf courses to play. A pretty island with quaint cottages, complete with manicured lawns, rocky coves and pink coral-sand beaches, it’s also classed amongst the world’s top diving sites – hidden amongst the beautiful reefs there are over four-hundred and fifty shipwrecks for divers of any experience to explore.
