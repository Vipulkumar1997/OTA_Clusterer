Luxury Holidays to New Zealand with Elegant Resorts



It's hard not to be passionate about a luxury holiday to New Zealand with Elegant Resorts - there's its spectacular scenery, the likes of which is generally seen in the pages of National Geographic magazine, exceptional food and wine, an entire Maori culture to absorb and, of course, the genuinely welcoming 'Kiwis' themselves.



This is a country of rare seismic beauty, home to a rich variety of flora and fauna, most famously the endangered Kiwi bird. Those with an adventurous disposition can ski, raft, hike or indulge in some inspirational golfing. You can also swim with dolphins, whale-watch or fish for plump trout. What's more, because it's such a compact place, travel within New Zealand is very easy and very efficient. Please call our Travel Consultants who will happily create a bespoke itinerary to suit your preferences.
