Luxury Holidays to Dubai with Elegant Resorts



With its majestic desert kingdoms, dramatic mountain ranges and sweeping fertile plains, the
Arabian Gulf
offers an exotic mix of enticing destinations, including cosmopolitan Dubai. This ever-innovative land is where the ancient and modern meet between the golden sands of the desert and the warm blue-waters of the Gulf, with glorious sunshine, glittering souks, soaring skyscrapers and, of course, a choice of world-class hotels. Championship golf courses, camel and horseracing, international rugby, sand-skiing or more traditional pursuits, such as falconry, are all here, as are sumptuous spas, designer boutiques and umpteen bars and restaurants. The more adventurous can join a 4WD desert
safari
and even learn how to skydive. And the prominence of the English language makes every UK visitor feel at home, while Dubai's vibrant atmosphere and constant sunshine ensure it really does take pride of place in the warm heart of Arabia.
