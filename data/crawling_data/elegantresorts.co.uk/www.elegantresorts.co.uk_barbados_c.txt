Luxury Holidays to Barbados with Elegant Resorts



Barbados is world-famous for being a jet-set escape, celebrities and the like lured by the promise of warm tropical weather, soft white sand beneath their feet, beautifully clear aquamarine water to swim in and a fabulous collection of luxury hotels, private villas and resorts to reside at on the Platinum Coast. However, this lush
Caribbean
island, measuring just 21 miles by 14 miles at its widest point, is so much more than its glamorous reputation, seventy miles of pristine palm tree-fringed beaches, Zagat-rated fine dining restaurants, challenging golf courses and designer shopping opportunities; at its heart, the characterful isle has been influenced by a blend of West African and British heritage.



English is the official language, cricket is its most popular sport and the laid-back locals are well-known for being polite and friendly, while the buildings in the historic capital, Bridgetown, evoke the centuries-old architecture of
London
, many constructed from the local coral limestone in Jacobean, Georgian and Victorian styles. Elsewhere, there are traditional chattel houses, botanical gardens and interesting museums to discover, watersports to experience and an eclectic range of multi-national cuisine to try. The island also hosts a number of events throughout the year, most famously Crop Over Festival, which celebrates the end of the sugar cane harvest that is an integral part of, perhaps, the island's greatest invention – rum.
Elegant Resorts has had a dedicated office on Barbados for a number of years, allowing us to provide our discerning clients with the finest
concierge
service, knowledge and first-hand experience available while holidaying on the island.
