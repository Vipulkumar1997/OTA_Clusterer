Romance and Couples with Elegant Resorts


If spending precious time together is long overdue, or you have a special occasion to celebrate, then we have innumerable ways to help you plan your perfect couple’s holiday. Whether you dream of simply being alone together on a private island in the stunning
Seychelles
, being pampered at a couples spa retreat in
Thailand
, or perhaps even dancing the tango under the bright city lights of
Buenos Aires
, there is a destination and shared experience guaranteed to bring you closer together. From lavish private beach picnics and dreamy beachfront dining by candle light, to sultry sunset cruises with cocktail in hand, hoteliers are more than happy to play cupid with ingenious romantic gestures to spoil their guests. These often go well beyond the more typical Champagne and flowers, rose petals on the bed or private pool side cabanas.



Couples can cocoon themselves within sumptuous city suites, hide away in remote mountain lodges with a bottle of Amarone next to an open fire, or retreat to the sanctuary of a hedonistic Maldivian water villa, with the guarantee of perfect privacy, superb butler service and blissful ambience. For those craving a little more adventure and a lasting experience, a sunrise trek to a temple in
Bali
can offer a shared spiritual connection. Similarly, sharing a star bed under the brilliant desert skies of
Namibia
can offer a real sense of togetherness in the great outdoor wilderness. Closer to home, it’s hard not to be seduced by
Italy
and its beautiful secluded coves and ornate city architecture. Why not charter a private yacht for the ultimate in privacy and sail the stunning Amalfi coastline or visit the glamorous French Riviera to indulge in vibrant city life, glitzy casinos and decadent fine dining. Whether you prefer the idea of sophisticated seduction or simply prefer to cuddle up under the moonlight to watch a classic movie on the beach, there is plenty to fill every heart’s desire.
