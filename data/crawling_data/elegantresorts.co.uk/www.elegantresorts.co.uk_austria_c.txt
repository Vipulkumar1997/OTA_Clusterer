Luxury Holidays to Austria with Elegant Resorts


A luxury ski holiday to Austria with Elegant Resorts is a favourite with British skiers. A warm welcome from the Austrian people and high standards of service has ensured British skiers return year after year. The Arlberg is recognised as being the best skiing area, it includes several mountains in the far west of the country not accessible by road but easily reached by ski-lifts, covered by one pass, from
Lech
in the west and St. Anton Am Arlberg in the south. Skiing for all levels can be enjoyed here, making it a good choice for mixed ability groups and families, while the beautiful and historic capital city of
Vienna
is perfect for adding in a dose of culture.
