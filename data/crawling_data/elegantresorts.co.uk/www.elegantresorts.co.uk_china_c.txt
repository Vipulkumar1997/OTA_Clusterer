Luxury Holidays to China with Elegant Resorts


One of the world’s first civilisations, China remains a wild and chaotic explosion of cultural and geographical diversity – a frenzied concoction of the old and the new, the traditional and the innovative. This is a country shrouded in mystery, but eager to be explored, offering visitors an epic adventure of discovery and surprise.
In recent years, China has become somewhat of a buzz word amongst travellers. Enjoy a luxury holiday to China and discover its rich and detailed history – from crumbling ruins to decadent Imperial palaces, fascinating traditions, countless heritage sites and extreme diversity. Whether a luxurious urban experience, a lakeside retreat or a getaway nestled among tea fields or rice terraces, you'll experience flavours unknown to the western world, friendly Chinese hospitality and exotic eastern architecture all rolled into one compelling adventure.
