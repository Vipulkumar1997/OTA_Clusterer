Privacy Policy





Should you order a brochure via the website, submit an Enquiry Form or Call Me Request Form, Elegant Resorts will hold the information collected and may use it to inform you of offers in the future or to send you marketing material. Because your privacy is important to us, we do not disclose your details or information given to Elegant Resorts to any third party (unless it will enable us to process your booking).
We take full responsibility for ensuring that proper security measures are in place to protect your information. When you book a holiday with Elegant Resorts, your information must be passed on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements, such as airlines, hotels and transport companies etc. The information may also be provided to security or credit checking companies, public authorities (such as customs/immigration) if required by them or as required by law. You may find copies of our Booking Conditions within this website or you may request a copy from us.
Additionally, where your holiday is outside the European Economic Area (EEA), controls on data protection in your destination may not be as strong as the legal requirements in this country. We will not, however, pass any information on to any person not responsible for part of your travel arrangements. This applies to any sensitive information that you give to us, such as details of any disabilities, dietary or religious requirements (If we cannot pass this information to the relevant suppliers, whether in the EEA or not, we cannot provide your booking. In making a booking, you consent to this information being passed on to the relevant persons).
Please note that where information is also held by your ABTA Travel Agent, this is subject to your ABTA Travel Agent's own data protection policy.
If you wish to opt out of receiving future email marketing correspondence from us, you can unsubscribe

You are entitled to a copy of your information held by us. If you wish to access a copy of any personal data we hold on you, please write to the Managing Director, Elegant Resorts, Elegant House, Sandpiper Way, Chester Business Park, Chester, CH4 9QE.
