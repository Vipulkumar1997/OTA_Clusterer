Luxury Holidays to Antigua with Elegant Resorts



Its famous sandy white beaches and pleasant year-round temperature are two of the main reasons to enjoy a
luxury Caribbean holiday
to Antigua with Elegant Resorts, but it has much more to offer. For a start, the atmosphere is blissfully laid back – the people here are unique in their approach to life, so welcoming and more than happy for visitors to be embraced by their colourful culture.



There are glamorous restaurants, boutiques and casinos too, but it is the island’s love affair with the sea (and yachting in particular) that is a huge attraction. Antigua Sailing Week is one of the world’s premier regattas and is a magnet for luxurious superyachts, while there are plenty of private, breezy coves with ideal conditions for watersports enthusiasts. Whether you’re looking for an action-packed family holiday, a romantic retreat or even the perfect setting for your wedding or honeymoon, this beautiful and unique island is sure to inspire you.
