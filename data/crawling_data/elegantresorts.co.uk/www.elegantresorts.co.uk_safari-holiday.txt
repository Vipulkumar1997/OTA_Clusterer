Safari Holidays with Elegant Resorts


There is nothing quite like the early morning anticipation of joining a game vehicle and venturing out into the mist of the African bushveld. The sights and sounds of the stirring wildlife, emerging sunrise, chorus of bird calls and deep bellows of hippopotamus, combined with the cooler morning air, create the most wonderful awakening! Whilst it is hard to leave your luxurious lodge, with its stylish modern comforts and sumptuous feasts, the call of the wild beats any more typical morning alarm call and the raw adrenaline beats any shot of caffeine! With experiences ranging from water-based safari camps in lush
Botswana
, ancient desert sand dunes in
Namibia
, the vast open plains of
Kenya
and family-friendly adventures in malaria-free
South Africa
, there is a wealth of wildlife and landscapes to discover throughout Africa.



Specialist photography safaris enable guests to expertly capture the rich birdlife, horse-riding or walking safaris allow closer than ever access to the game and elephant-back safaris offer a truly unique and tranquil perspective! For those seeking a richer experience, why not follow the Great Migration, meet the local Himba tribe in
Namibia
, take part in a conservation programme or visit an Endangered Species Centre? From small luxury tented camps perfect for honeymooners, to larger malaria-free lodges tailored to families or even private homesteads for larger family groups or groups of friends, there is a safari experience suited to every traveller. Enjoy an action-packed morning, lounge by your plunge pool during the heat of the afternoon and dine under the magnificent skies by night. Enjoy a lively evening of traditional dancing in a boma or retreat to the privacy of your deck for a romantic candle-lit supper. Whether you choose communal dining experiences accompanied by colourful tales from your expert guide or ranger, or prefer to sleep out on a star bed under the brilliantly starry skies, you will be certain to fall in love with Africa. Why not take a look at our selection of
Elegant Journeys
in Africa, presenting a diverse selection of itinerary that are perfect for couples and families.
