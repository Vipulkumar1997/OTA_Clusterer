Luxury Holidays To Morocco



Luxury Holidays to Morocco with Elegant Resorts



From deserts, dunes and snow-capped peaks to a long, rugged coastline. From medina cities and hilltop Berber villages to coastal towns with sweeping sandy beaches. Welcome to Morocco, an exotic slice of
Africa
.

Landscapes here are inspirational, dotted with magical mosques and crumbling relics – some of the most spectacular scenes around. A private tour or guided day’s trekking in the High Atlas Mountains is a memory to treasure forever. Shopping in a traditional souk is a fascinating experience, the market stalls bulging with keepsakes – richly patterned rugs, leather goods, painted pottery and other handicrafts. And the food? Sublime. Think spices and dried fruits, fluffy couscous and fragrant tagines, refreshing mint tea and sensational street food.



Morocco’s fourth largest city,
Marrakech
is a historic, sultry town attracting a fashionable crowd of winter sun seekers and discerning travellers, here for history and adventure amid bustling souks, hidden riads and stylish bars.

Casablanca
, meanwhile, is modern and cosmopolitan. It’s where you’ll find classy art galleries and designer clothing. It’s also a place to hit the beach, with mile upon mile of unspoilt sandy shore washed by Atlantic waves.

Whenever you come, wherever you stay, expect an amazing holiday!
