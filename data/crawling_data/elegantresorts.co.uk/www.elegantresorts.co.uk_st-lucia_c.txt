Luxury Holidays To St Lucia



Luxury Holidays to St Lucia with Elegant Resorts



A luxury holiday to St Lucia with Elegant Resorts is the ultimate way to relax and rejuvenate. Pristine palm-fringed beaches, coconut and papaya orchards, magnificent rainforests sheltering wild orchids and birds of paradise, natural waterfalls and its very own famous landmark, the majestic Pitons – a UNESCO World Heritage Site (twin peaks that rise two thousand feet above the sea). This unrivalled combination of natural beauty, sun-soaked serenity and bounteous beaches have justly earned St Lucia its reputation as the most
scenic
island in the
Caribbean
– perfect if you’re seeking romance, escape or a hint of adventure.



Between beach relaxation there is much to marvel and admire about the luscious
Caribbean
isle of St Lucia. A definitive, feast for the senses, the emerald-green foliage is a welcome addition to the miles of azure waters and stretches of unblemished sand. St Lucia offers much more than the average beach holiday and is the ideal way to enjoy some of the planet’s most stunning seascapes alongside gracious hospitality and Elegant Resorts’ uncompromised standards.
