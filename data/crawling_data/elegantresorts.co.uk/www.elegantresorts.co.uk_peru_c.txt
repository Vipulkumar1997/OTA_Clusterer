Luxury Holidays to Peru with Elegant Resorts


Visitors on a luxury holiday to Peru with Elegant Resorts will find
South America's
third largest country, is almost a continent in itself and its passion for adventure shines through, from the soaring, unspoilt Andes to its desert coastal plains. The birthplace of surfing, water sports-lovers who visit Peru will adore the white-knuckle rafting, board sports and spirit of 'anything goes'. Those who prefer to keep their feet on dry land can discover the world-famous and awe-inspiring
Machu Picchu
(meaning 'Old Peak'), the world's most celebrated Inca archaeological site, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. First views of the ancient site will take your breath away, while exploration of the ruins will take you far back in time. We guarantee the experience will be an extraordinary one and stay with you for life. Please call our Travel Consultants, who will happily create a bespoke itinerary to suit your preferences.
