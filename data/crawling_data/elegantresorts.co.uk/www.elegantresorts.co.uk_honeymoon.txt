Honeymoons with Elegant Resorts


When you’ve spent an inordinate amount of time stressing about, organising and then enjoying your perfect wedding, you’re definitely going to need a fabulous honeymoon in which to relax and celebrate your nuptials, and there are so many locations around the world that are just perfect for a romantic holiday with your other half. Loved-up honeymooners always enjoy their privacy and time spent together and if there’s spectacular scenery to enjoy at the same time, then all the better.



You could go for an idyllic overwater villa at one of our luxurious hotels in the
Maldives
or head even further afield to exquisite
French Polynesia
. The
Caribbean
will always be a popular destination for honeymooners and there are a number of intimate boutique properties and private villas on idyllic islands such as
Antigua
,
St Lucia
,
the Bahamas
and the Grenadines that will inspire romance. Maybe the stunning beaches and aromatic cuisine of
Thailand
,
Malaysia
or
Indonesia
might tempt you instead. Alternatively, how about something a little more cosmopolitan, such as
New York
,
Cape Town
or even Dubai? Each of these options allows for twin-centre holidays, such as combining
Cape Town
with a
luxury safari
or a stay in fast-paced
Dubai
city, followed by time spent residing in a peaceful resort in the desert. You could even catch a flight from
Dubai
and finish your honeymoon on the spectacular
Indian Ocean
islands of the
Maldives
,
Seychelles
or
Mauritius
. The choices are endless, but wherever it is you decide to take your honeymoon, you can be assured that the staff at your chosen luxury hotel, resort or villa will move heaven and earth to ensure you enjoy an unforgettable holiday, with extra special touches guaranteed to make you both feel very special indeed.
