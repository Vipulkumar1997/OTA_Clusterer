Luxury Holidays by Elegant Resorts


Here at Elegant Resorts we're devoted to luxury travel and, as experts in the field of tailor-making luxury holidays, our commitment to excellence has served us well for nearly three decades now. Readers of Conde Nast Traveller ranked us runner up in the 'Tour Operator' category of the prestigious Readers' Travel Awards 2016 for our first-hand knowledge of destinations, the Telegraph has consistently voted us 'Best Small Tour Operator' at the Ultra Travel 100 Awards for 2013, 2011 and 2010 and readers of the Sunday Times Travel Magazine voted us their 'Favourite Luxury Tour Operator' in 2010.


Our service starts from the moment you register on our website or call one of our Travel Consultants - we prefer to speak to you so that we can discover more about the type of luxury holiday you're looking for, including your preferred airline, transfer options, room categories and the kind of facilities you require (a spa, children's club, fitness centre or golf course, for example), whether you want direct access to a beach and the kind of excursions you might want to participate in whilst you're away. Furthermore, the long-term relationships we enjoy with a select group of hotels, airlines and in-resort partners means that we can provide you with exceptional offers, adding true value to your luxury holiday. It's this expertise that can turn an ordinary holiday into a luxurious Elegant Resorts holiday.

Elegant Resorts is a member of ABTA, the Association of British Travel Agents, and is fully bonded with a licence granted by the Civil Aviation Authority, providing you with security and peace of mind.
