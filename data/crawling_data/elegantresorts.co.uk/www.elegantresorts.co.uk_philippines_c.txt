Luxury Holidays To The Philippines



Luxury Holidays to The Philippines with Elegant Resorts



Stretching from the south of
China
to the northern tip of
Borneo
, this archipelago of over seven-thousand islands lies scattered across a brilliantly coloured tropical palette of stunning seascapes. Encircled by the clearest and warmest ocean waters, the islands range from tiny islets, boasting scarcely more than a beach and a few palm trees, to awesome landscapes of towering mountain peaks, vast rice terraces and lush, green jungles.



The Filipino people are the product of a colourful cocktail of races and traditions (there are 111 ethnic and linguistic groups), out of which has been moulded a unique culture. It may come as a surprise to many to learn that the Philippines now claim to be the third largest English-speaking country in the world. Inevitably, given the scale and geography of the Philippines, only a glimpse of their many dimensions is possible on an escapist holiday, orientated towards enjoying the remote island surroundings of our luxurious hideaway offering,
Amanpulo
.

When on a luxury holiday to the Philippines with Elegant Resorts, an overnight stop in Manila may be necessary. Alternatively, as the flight between
Hong Kong
and Manila is only one hour and fifteen minutes long, why not consider combining a short stay in
Hong Kong
with Amanpulo?
