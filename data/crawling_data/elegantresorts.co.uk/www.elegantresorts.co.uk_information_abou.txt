About Elegant Resorts


Elegant Resorts’ history stretches back to 1988, when two of the UK’s luxury travel
                pioneers recognising a gap in the market for a travel company that offered only
                the finest hotels and first-class client service, delivered by professional employees
                passionate about travel, set about creating Elegant Resorts. With their sights firmly
                set on the upper end of the market, the vision of the company was to include only
                those hotels, villas and resorts that could be said to deliver a genuinely luxurious
                experience. This was complemented by partnering with major world airlines to ensure
                that the experience of travelling in any class – but particularly in First and Club
                – came up to the standard of the rest of the holiday.

The Caribbean Early Days And Concorde



The luxury Caribbean market, which was the main area of Elegant Resorts’ expertise,
                was the initial focus twenty-five years ago. Travel to exotic destinations within
                the Caribbean was aspirational to many and, despite an economic down-turn the company
                achieved a profit within its first year. A major contributor to the success of the
                early years was the weekly winter service to Barbados from British Airways by Concorde.
                With a flying time of less than four hours, clients could leave the UK and be on
                the golden beaches of the Caribbean that same afternoon. Elegant Resorts was credited
                with booking more arrivals to Barbados on Concorde than any other travel company
                and it was a sad day on 30 August 2003 when the last scheduled supersonic service
                flew from Barbados. Clients who flew – and even chartered – Concorde now had to
                find a new mode of transport; the business then started to focus on private jet
                travel.

Elegant Resorts grew from strength to strength and gradually, over time, other areas
                of the world were added; meaning today, our portfolio now also comprises hotels,
                resorts, villas and private islands in the Indian Ocean, Arabian Gulf, Middle East,
                Mexico, North and South America, Canada, Africa, Europe, North Africa, Asia and
                Australasia. In addition, we offer a range of experiences, from luxury cruising,
                yachting and skiing holidays to a selection of adventure holidays – and not forgetting
                space travel, for our more daring clients.





Our Travel Experts



Our continuing dedication to staff training, means that Elegant Resorts’ Travel
                Consultants are some of the most knowledgeable in the travel industry, with an unerring
                ability to match clients with their ideal holiday. We are very proud to have a long-serving
                team who believe in delivering uncompromising service. This extends overseas too,
                where we have established teams working their magic in Barbados, Antigua, Dubai
                and Mauritius.

Both overseas and here in Chester, there’s a friendly atmosphere conducive to a
                good working environment. We like to enjoy ourselves and have had some fantastic
                occasions over the years that have included everything from home-grown theatre productions
                to events that our supplier and business partners join in with and every year we
                host an awards ceremony in London to say “thank you” to the people we work with.
                Testimony to our extraordinary relationships with our friends and colleagues are
                all the wonderful awards we have received over the years.

It’s these relationships that enable us to bring our clients exceptional experiences
                throughout the year and ensure that they can rely on us for all their travel needs.

Space Flights

We take great delight in sending our clients on fabulous holidays in this world;
                now we can send them to another... In 2006, Elegant Resorts was the very first UK
                travel company to be appointed Virgin Galactic’s accredited Space Agent, selling
                tickets on the planet’s first commercial sub-orbital space flights. We are very
                proud of our own Accredited Space Agents who have been put through their paces as
                ‘space cadets’ and experienced for themselves the dynamics of space and the effects
                of G-force, during a sub-orbital space flight simulation.





The Chairman's Club

Over the last twenty-five years, Elegant Resorts has built an extremely loyal following
                of clients and as a “thank you” to them we created our loyalty programme, The Chairman’s
                Club. Our Chairman’s Club is the most talked about, invitation-only, ‘private members’
                club’ within the travel industry. The Chairman’s Club members benefit from an extended
                range of services and we repay their loyalty with future travel credits.





The Future

Under the leadership of Michelle Sephton – herself a veteran of Elegant Resorts
                – the team continues to deliver the personalised service we have always prided ourselves
                on and plan to “maintain our strong position in the luxury market by providing trustworthy
                information and service, allowing our clients to enjoy their luxury holidays with
                confidence”.
