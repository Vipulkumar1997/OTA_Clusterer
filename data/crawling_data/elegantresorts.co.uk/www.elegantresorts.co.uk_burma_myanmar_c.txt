Luxury Holidays to Burma (Myanmar) with Elegant Resorts



Intriguing Burma (now more commonly known as the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, the name given to it by its military government), was, for most of the 20th century, subjected to a long period of inaccessibility. Today, more than a century later, the utterly beguiling nation looks hopefully towards a more modern and democratic future, whilst still maintaining its unique traditional values and simple pleasures.



Embark on an adventure and discover for yourself the beautiful landscapes, entrancing river journeys and the incredible, sometimes surreal, sites reflective of the country’s rich and refreshingly unspoiled cultural heritage – such as the stupa-studded plains of Bagan on the banks of the Ayeyarwaddy River, the romance of Mandalay, and Yangon's giant Golden Pagoda. But, after all this, it will be the genuine delight, wonder and hospitality of the Burmese people that will leave you with the greatest impression of this captivating country.
