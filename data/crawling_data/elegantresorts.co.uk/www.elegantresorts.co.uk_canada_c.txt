Luxury Holidays to Canada with Elegant Resorts



On a luxury holiday to Canada with Elegant Resorts you can see for yourself why it's referred to as ‘God’s Country’. Its Eden-like splendour comprises formidable mountain ranges, wild salmon-rich rivers and cosmopolitan cities surrounded by the best national parks on the planet.
Of course, a nation which covers a colossal ten-million square acres of land is crying out to be the domain of outdoor pursuits and, as a result, the Canadians are the masters of a healthy outdoor lifestyle – blessed with the freshest waters, purest air and offering visitors a natural year-round adventure playground with something to suit every physical demand, particularly in our featured areas within the provinces of Alberta, British Colombia and Manitoba.



Eco adventures offer a fabulous education for families whilst the Rocky Mountains are best appreciated on a
scenic
train journey courtesy of either the Rocky Mountaineer or the
Whistler
Mountain Dome. And, at the end of each day’s adventure, you can sample some of the county’s excellent-quality wine.
