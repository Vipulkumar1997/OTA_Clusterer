Property Highlights:

Family

The 'Kids For All Seasons' Club, for 4 to 9 year-olds, comes complete with a pool, indoor and outdoor playground, a games room, an amphitheatre, a bakery and a quiet room as well as babysitting services for younger children. Children aged 10 years and over will enjoy KaroKan, which offers the latest interactive games, a pool table, indoor and outdoor games, computers with internet connection and a DJ booth. Water-skiing, snorkelling and an introduction to golf are also on offer.





Golf

Guests can enjoy complimentary unlimited golf, including a golf cart with GPS on the Ernie Els-designed championship course. Boasting over 7,580 metres of fairway covering an 18-hole, par 72 terrain, the course is built to USGA standards and is the first of its kind in Mauritius. Amidst the beautifully-kept landscape, the semi-challenging holes will enthrall every golfer. World-class facilities include private lessons, golf club, driving range, Pro shop and a complimentary shuttle bus which takes guests to and from the championship course.





The Beach

As you would expect, the beach facilities at Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita are exceptional. Skirted by coral islets and crystal lagoons, jump off the powdery soft sands and enjoy the stunning surrounding waters with an array of water experiences. Take a catamaran trip complete with an on-board barbecue lunch, head out for small game or deep-sea fishing or enjoy surfing, kitesurfing, para-sailing or embark on a submarine adventure.





Romance

The resort's setting of striking headlands, crystalline seas and white-sand beaches makes a dazzling backdrop for romantic escapes, enticing couples looking for somewhere very special and romantic. It may be a honeymoon or anniversary, a time to renew vows or become 'Mr and Mrs'. It may be none of these and simply a luxury getaway to a far-flung tropical location that you crave. A typical day might include a 'floating' treatment for two in a spa suite over the sea or a veritable feast of food, fireworks, wine and music created just for you. On other days, the idea of hibernating at your villa will appeal; each one with a plunge pool.





Spa & Wellness

Slip off to the Overwater Spa, offering twelve treatment rooms and a menu of African, Asian, Chinese and European therapeutic remedies, as well as a sauna, ice-fountains, steam rooms and mangrove Vichy showers. Indulge in Ayurvedic spa rituals, skilled massages and heavenly facials, not to mention island-inspired treatments such as the Sugar Adventure, which involves a brown sugar scrub and deep-tissue massage. Open-air wellness classes combine yoga, meditation and T'ai Chi on selected days, while a separate fitness centre offers a 25-metre-long lap pool, gym, floodlit tennis court and complimentary exercise classes.

LUXURYBARED INDEPENDENT REVIEW

Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita


Located in Beau Champ on the island’s east coast, Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita is situated on a secluded peninsula on the mainland, extending onto a private island called Ile aux Chats. The property is set in lush grounds that are tended to by fifty gardeners – including a herb garden – overlooking Anahita golf course and a large lagoon that’s sheltered by a reef. The layout is essentially a mini village, with restaurants, a fitness centre, an overwater spa, a kids’ club and boutiques, all well spread out. Thankfully, there’s a shuttle service provided in the form of golf buggies, as well as the complimentary use of bikes that’ll enable you to get around if you just don’t feel like walking.
What’s fantastic about Four Seasons Anahita is that its all-villa-style accommodation and the entry level pool villas are impressive and come with one of several options: a private garden view; direct access to the beach; steps down to the lagoon or with views of the mangrove trees. Alternatively, the one to five-bedroom residences are great for families and, for those who really want to push the boat out, there’s the five-bedroom Presidential Suite Sanctuary. It doesn’t feel like there are 136 villas here at all and, during the daytime, most guests seem content hanging around their own pad so the resort doesn’t get crowded. 

There’s a good range of activities to suit all ages and interests, including many complimentary watersports and there’s a family-friendly vibe. Whilst here, you must meet the four resident giant tortoises and if you love marine life, you can learn about the resort’s work with Wise Oceans to protect the reef system, funded by guest donations. There’s also complimentary play on the Ernie Els-designed course for golfers. Evenings can be quiet, but there is live music some nights, with plans to expand the genres into jazz and blues.

Service was as excellent as I expected. With a staff ratio of two to every one guest (when at full occupancy), I was left wanting for nothing.
