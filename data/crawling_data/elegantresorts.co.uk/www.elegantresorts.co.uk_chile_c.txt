Luxury Holidays to Chile with Elegant Resorts


Nestled between the towering Andes and beautiful Pacific Ocean, Chile stretches for 4,300 kilometres along almost half the continent. A land of staggering contrasts, visitors on a luxury holiday to Chile with Elegant Resorts can discover Ojos del Salado, the country’s highest mountain – at an eye-watering 6,893 metres – as well as its plains, including the world's driest desert, the Atacama. Explore Chile’s huge glacial fields, climb its volcanoes and swim in its rivers and lakes, before taking some time out to relax on one of its many excellent beaches. Home to some of the friendliest and most hospitable people in the continent, the Chilean culture is easy to fall in love with. Please call our Travel Consultants, who will happily create a bespoke holiday itinerary to Chile, to suit your preferences.
