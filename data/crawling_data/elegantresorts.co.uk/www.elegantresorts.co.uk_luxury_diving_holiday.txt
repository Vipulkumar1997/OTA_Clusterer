Luxury Diving Holidays with Elegant Resorts

Scuba-diving in the tropics, with its warm seas and excellent visibility, will add a wonderfully new aspect to any luxury diving holiday. Whether you want to learn to dive or you're an already experienced diver you'll find that many of the destinations and properties we feature have excellent diving facilities.
If you're an absolute beginner or wanting to improve your dive knowledge you may be interested in a diving school which offers suitable lessons. Alternatively, the PADI Gold Palm Resort dive centres, popular in many of the resorts in the more exotic destinations in our portfolio, are renowned for their outstanding services and for providing memorable dive experiences. In complete safety and with total awareness of environmental issues they offer a wide range of programmes from beginner scuba-diving to wreck-diving. Experienced divers will find that some resorts also have dive shops to meet all their diving needs.
