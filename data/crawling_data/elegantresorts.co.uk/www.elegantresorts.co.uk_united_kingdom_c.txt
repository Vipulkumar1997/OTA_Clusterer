Luxury Holidays to United Kingdom with Elegant Resorts



No country of equivalent size is so varied as England. All across the country you’ll find landmarks left behind by the forces of trade, maritime supremacy, the Industrial Revolution, the Empire and finance that have shaped so much of British history, everything from Hadrian’s’ Wall and Stonehenge to Gothic cathedrals, Medieval castles and the skeletons of great abbeys long since passed with elegant Georgian terraces and majestic stately homes in between.



However for all these ancient glories, visiting Britain is not just about our splendid past; several of our museums and galleries - filled with treasures and collections - are amongst the finest in the world, indeed, one of our most popular museums is the most cutting edge – Tate Modern - whilst the cityscape of downtown Manchester and the revitalized Newcastle waterfront are a credit to our talent for reinvention.  Charming, exciting filled with art, culture, history and natural wonders, England’s ability to surprise is boundless.
