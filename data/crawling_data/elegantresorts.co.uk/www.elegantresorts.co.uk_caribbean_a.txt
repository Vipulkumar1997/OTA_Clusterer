Luxury Holidays to The Caribbean with Elegant Resorts



Enjoy a luxury holiday to the Caribbean with Elegant Resorts and discover for yourself why these idyllic islands never fail to enchant visitors with their laid-back atmosphere, fabulous climate and sheer natural beauty... Once reserved for royalty and the jet-set, now the powder-fine beaches, turquoise bays and cosmopolitan resorts are relished by discerning travellers from all over the world.
The Caribbean has something for everyone, whether it be the superb sailing and watersports galore in
Antigua
, the elegant colonial architecture of Nevis or the nature-lover's paradise that is lush, volcanic
St Lucia
. If it’s a serious dose of Caribbean holiday glamour you’re after, head straight for celebrity favourites,
St Barths
and
Barbados
.
Luxury holidays to the Caribbean appeal to golfers, tennis players and fitness enthusiasts alike for the world-beating facilities available to them; as well as those looking for a sumptuous spa that will cater to their every pampering need or those simply looking for a gorgeous destination where they can unwind.



As pioneers of luxury travel since 1988, it is perhaps unsurprising that we take exceptional service extremely seriously. Our luxury tour operator story began with idyllic Caribbean hotels and it is from here that our global portfolio blossomed. Boasting an expert Elegant Resorts team, both here in Chester and within a dedicated office in
Barbados
, we were able to ambitiously develop our client offering and hone our remarkable levels of client service.
For almost thirty years, we have aimed to exceed our clients’ expectations by providing an elite and seamless service. From pre-departure
concierge
bookings and a personal airport welcome, access to private lounges, support through immigration and escorting clients to their waiting limousine – we offer an enviable island welcome. Our expert team in
Barbados
will be on hand to meet you within your luxury hotel, will call regularly to ensure your holiday is perfect and will arrange every restaurant reservation or spa booking – even a hair salon appointment, should you require one. Whether you choose to charter a yacht on a whim, wish to dine on the other side of the island, or leisurely cruise around the nearby islands, our team will simply make your wishes happen! Guests are also very welcome to visit our friendly
Barbados
office, located in Sunset Crest, to discuss matters in person.
Explore this site to view our selected properties in the Caribbean or call our Travel Consultants for more information.
