Luxury Golf Holidays with Elegant Resorts


Golfers are notorious dreamers; whether it's a private invite to the Augusta National, that elusive hole-in-one at Troon's Postage Stamp or an empty Old Course on a summer's evening at St Andrews. With this in mind the keen golfer will be delighted to discover that our portfolio includes a selection of  luxury golf holidays and some of the best golf courses throughout the world, courses to suit all golfing requirements - challenging a golfer's skills even improving the odd handicap!



Our featured properties are home to some of the most stunning championship grade golf courses in the world, each complete with lush green fairways and spectacular views, many designed by names such as Bernhard Langer, Tom Fazio and Gary Player. The resorts also feature sumptuous spas, fine dining restaurants, beautiful beaches and various other sporting and recreational facilities, so there's plenty to do off course too. For your added convenience we'd be happy to pre-book your golf tee off times or any spa appointments and dining reservations for you.
