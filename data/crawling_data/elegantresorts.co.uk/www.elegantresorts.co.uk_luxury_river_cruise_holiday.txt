Luxury River Cruise Holidays with Elegant Resorts



Romantic, adventurous and always unforgettable, a luxury river cruise offers a fantastic way to experience the beauty of travel. Floating amidst picture-perfect scenery, and immersed in tangible realms of culture and history, a journey along the world’s waterways takes the time to savour every mile, relishing the unfurling views lying beyond every twist and turn of the river bend.
With small, intimately sized vessels, there is no finer way to discover tucked away harbours and ports, as you wind up narrow canals and estuaries in search of unique and authentic experiences.



Having unpacked just once, your vessel will become your floating hotel, allowing you to relax as the world, and its wonders, come to you. From sumptuous on-board luxuries, where comfort takes number one priority, you can sit back and be inspired by the marvellous sights ahead of you, before disembarking and unearthing a treasure trove of once-in-a-lifetime activities and memorable surprises. With a wealth of excursions on offer to assist in making the most of every destination, be drawn in by thriving hubs of art and gastronomy, walk the sobering steps of infamous historical sites and be humbled by poignant scenes of ancient traditions. Whether you are a wine aficionado, classical music lover or simply wish to explore the intricacies of the intriguing destinations along your route, a luxury river cruise with Elegant Resorts is bound to awaken the passions within you.
