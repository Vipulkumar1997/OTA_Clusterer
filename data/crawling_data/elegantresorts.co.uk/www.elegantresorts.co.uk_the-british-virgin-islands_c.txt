Luxury Holidays to The British Virgin Islands with Elegant Resorts


Take a luxury holiday to the
British Virgin Islands
with Elegant Resorts and you'll discover that the sixty idyllic islands – most of them tiny and uninhabited – are a treasure trove of soft sands, coral reefs and azure waters, famous for their dive sites and shipwrecks. If you get time, do pay a visit to The Baths National Park and explore the grottoes and saltwater pools; legend has it that the huge granite rocks that scatter the beach were placed here by an ancient race of giants – it is the perfect place for a beach picnic and a spot of snorkelling. Some of the finest
sailing opportunities
in the
Caribbean
can be enjoyed in the
British Virgin Islands
and whether you’re a novice or an experienced sailor it is an ideal place to hone your sailing skills. For a wonderful 'sail and stay' holiday, do consider chartering a
luxury yacht
for a week and then enjoying a week on land at one of our featured luxury resorts.
