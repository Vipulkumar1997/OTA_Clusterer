Luxury Holidays to Asia with Elegant Resorts



Just like its world-renowned delicious cuisine, Asia is marked by a tantalising melting pot of contrasting flavours, sights and smells. A continent where communist states lie alongside democratic republics and kingdoms, where Colonial landmarks jostle for attention with skyscrapers and ancient temples, and where all the great religions rub shoulders.
India's
Cambodia's
Thailand's
China's
Hong Kong's
Malaysia
Indonesia
Vietnam's


Visitors to Asia claim that it's the everyday details that provide the most unforgettable memories of their holidays here. A rainbow of vibrant prints in the markets, the scent of aromatic spices frying on the street stalls, the sight of an elephant being ridden through the streets or the feel of the soft sand between the toes on a pristine beach.
Explore this site to view our selected properties and attractions or call our Travel Consultants for more information.
