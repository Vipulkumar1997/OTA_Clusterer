Luxury Holidays to Anguilla with Elegant Resorts



For those in search of the more gentle pursuits a small and secluded island might offer, a luxury holiday to Anguilla with Elegant Resorts offers the perfect paradise. A good starting point for those looking to branch off from the usual
Caribbean
port of calls, Anguilla maintains a sense of authenticity without sacrificing its stakes in elegance. The plush, powdery sands are the main draw for many, and the western area of the island has become the domain of luxury resorts aiming to elevate the beach holiday experience to the next level.



Relax, take in the views and sample the tropical flavours all from the comfort of some of the region’s finest five star hotels and luxury private villas with enviable locations on the finest beaches. Whilst being a magnet for sun-worshippers, it is the welcoming people, fantastic service and world- class food that makes this small three-mile-wide island something a little more special than you might expect.
