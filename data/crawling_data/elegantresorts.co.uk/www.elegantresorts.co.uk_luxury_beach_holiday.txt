Luxury Beach Holidays with Elegant Resorts


There really is nothing quite like a couple of weeks away from it all relaxing on a white, powdery sand beach, soaking up the sun's rays; feeling a reduction in stress levels and an increase in your sense of well being. Here at Elegant Resorts we offer a wide range of luxury beach holidays that will help you do just that. What’s more our experts are on-hand to ensure you select the right beach in the right destination - one that will suit you the best.



You may like the idea of the placid blue waters, languid beaches and whispering trade winds of the
Caribbean
. Or perhaps the idea of a private picnic on a sheltered beach as offered by the Southern
Indian Ocean
islands of the
Seychelles
appeals. Alternatively, there's a string of more than a thousand coral atolls sprinkled in the
Indian Ocean
(we know them as the Maldives) offering dreamy barefoot luxury - blue lagoons, dazzling beaches and rustling palms provide the perfect setting for some real time-out. Here the pace of life is perfect for unwinding with a good book or dozing off in a hammock. A good beach holiday can't always take us to Nirvana or solve all our problems, but it can cause a fundamental shift in our outlook and improve our confidence levels. A simple beach holiday might be seen as unadventurous, but for total relaxation it's tough to beat.
