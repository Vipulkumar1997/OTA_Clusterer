Luxury Holidays To Singapore



Luxury Holidays to Singapore with Elegant Resorts



Singapore was once a Colonial outpost of Britain and is now a prosperous place with a busy port and a skyline that resembles many western cities, with a hub of international businesses and towering skyscrapers, while the various districts, including Chinatown, Arab Street and Little
India
, offer an injection of eastern delights, for the perfect blend. Many visitors will no doubt wish to follow in the footsteps of so many before them for the somewhat iconic experience of heading to the legendary Long Bar at
Raffles Hotel Singapore
for a Singapore Sling. They’re some of the best you’ll ever taste; after all, the cocktail was first created there in 1915. Shopping is a major attraction too, with a variety of different retail experiences available, from markets to malls, while an array of museums will satisfy your art and cultural cravings. Visitors can easily spend a couple of days in Singapore and there are various modes of transport that make it easy to get around.



In addition, there are convenient connecting flights to a host of destinations, for a twin or multi-centre holiday, whether you’re looking for completely contrasting destinations or more of the same. Our recommendations include
Thailand
or Burma,
Malaysia
or
Borneo
,
Indonesia
or
China
, as well as
Australia
and
New Zealand
, and our Travel Consultants will be happy to discuss these options and your own ideas with you.
