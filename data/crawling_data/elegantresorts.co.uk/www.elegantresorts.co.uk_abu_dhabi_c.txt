Luxury Holidays to Abu Dhabi with Elegant Resorts


Rich in history, a luxury holiday to Abu Dhabi with Elegant Resorts is fast becoming a popular choice amongst our clients for holidays in the
Arabian Gulf
. As the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi is affectionately known as the ‘Garden City of the Gulf’ because of its green boulevards, beautiful gardens and parks. It is just a ninety-minute drive away from
Dubai
and, in general, things run at a more leisurely pace here, although there are plenty of things to see and do - from sand-skiing to souk shopping. Discover traditional Arabian life as you stroll through the Zayed Heritage Village or escape the metropolis and take a tour into the desert. Abu Dhabi also has 249 miles of coastline with remote islands and powdery-white sands. Enjoy Abu Dhabi's clean public beaches near the city, or take a boat out to quiet seaside spots.
