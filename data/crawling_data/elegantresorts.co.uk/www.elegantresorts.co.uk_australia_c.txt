Luxury Holidays to Australia with Elegant Resorts


Australia's timeless landscape is a magical network of land, sea and living things. It varies from endless sunbaked horizons and dense tropical rainforests, thousands of years old, to the Great Barrier Reef, so big it can be seen from outer space. Scattered along the coasts, its cities are filled with galleries and gardens, blending a European enthusiasm for art and food with the Australian's laid-back love of sport and the outdoors. This is the land that the Aboriginal people have lived in harmony with for over fifty-thousand years, so do take time to visit their sacred places and trace the path of their ancestors. A luxury holiday to Australia with Elegant Resorts means you can go walkabout and create your own living story. Please call our Travel Consultants who will happily create a luxury tailor-made itinerary, to suit your preferences.
