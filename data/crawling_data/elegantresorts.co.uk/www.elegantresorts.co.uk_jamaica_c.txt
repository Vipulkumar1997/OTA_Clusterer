Luxury Holidays to Jamaica with Elegant Resorts


When you take a luxury holiday to the
Caribbean
with Elegant Resorts, you'll find that Jamaica, the third largest island in the
Caribbean
, is one of the most popular. With stunning scenery and a fabulously laid-back culture, Jamaica is made for relaxing beach holidays and nature enthusiasts, alike.
Taste the world-famous local cuisine, get caught up in reggae rhythms and immerse yourself in one of the most influential cultures of the West Indies, and you can be sure that your
luxury Caribbean holiday
will be just that little bit extra-special in Jamaica. Rainforests, waterfalls and staggering mountains make up the UNESCO-protected eco-system, while the birthplace of Bob Marley and links to Ian Fleming only add to the interest of the intriguing heritage calling out to be explored.
