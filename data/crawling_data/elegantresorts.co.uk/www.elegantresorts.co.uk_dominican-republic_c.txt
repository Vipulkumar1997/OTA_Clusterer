Luxury Holidays to Dominican Republic with Elegant Resorts



Exotic, yet accessible, the Dominican Republic is only a two-hour flight from
Miami
, or a four-hour flight from
New York
, which makes it an exciting twin-centre possibility for travellers. With such an array of superb beaches, diverse scenery and award-winning golf courses, the destination has a cornucopia of attractions to explore, spicy cuisine to savour, energetic dancing to enjoy and Spanish flare to embrace – a welcoming, vivacious
Caribbean
gem for the spirited traveller.



Discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492, the Dominican Republic is the second-largest island in the
Caribbean
and one of its most geographically diverse countries. Along with  stunning beaches and an extensive coastline, its interior boasts the highest peak of all the
Caribbean
islands, Pico Duarte, located fifty-three miles north east of Lake Enriquillo. Visitors are amazed by the rich scenery – a bounty of natural mountains, desert scrublands and fascinating colonial architecture which, in part, explains why the destination is so very appealing. With such a challenging terrain, the dramatic oceanfront holes, remote beaches and year-round tropical climate, draw many keen golfers to the island. The less-travelled northern coast is blessed with the spectacular area of Playa Grande, boasting sixty-foot-high cliffs, blindingly white, pristine beaches and a contrasting verdant
Caribbean
jungle interior. Golfers are thrilled to play on the Robert Trent Jones-designed golf course, with its ten remarkable oceanfront holes (more than any other golf course in the western hemisphere).
