                industry partners and key preferred partnerships, we are able to drive the standard

                our valued guests. Our long-established and exclusive Chairman’s Club provides many
                additional benefits, such as a generous loyalty scheme, exceptional events calendar
                and uniquely tailored experiences, quite in addition to a dedicated Senior Travel
                Consultant and their Personal Assistant. Our Chairman’s Club Manager works closely
                with our outstanding brand partners to provide our discerning clients with the very
                best in bespoke experiences, luxury products and access to elite social calendar
                events.







Expert Staff


From the time of their initial enquiry, our clients enjoy a seamless booking service
           with one of our experienced Travel Consultants. In addition to the clients’ travel
           arrangements, the finer details of our bespoke luxury holidays is expertly handled
           by our conscientious Concierge Team.


Every personal preference is gleaned, any dietary
           detail noted, all touring documentation checked and any spa or dining requests fulfilled. Providing so much more than the rudimentary elements, we can assist in arranging
           elaborate celebrations, secret proposals, expert guides, unique private tours or
           access to some of the most desirable calendar events around the world.

Whether you
           yearn for perfect solitude, wish to visit a remote spa haven in the Himalayas, attend

           the trendiest of city restaurants, we have the team to make your every whim a reality.







Preferred Partners

By working closely with award-winning airlines, luxury hotels, resorts, villas and

               within each destination. Our team of specialists expertly cater for all aspects
               of hospitality – from a warm personal welcome, to transferring in the most stylish

               and indulging in gourmet cuisine, accompanied by the rarest of fine wine vintages.

In Resort


Along with Elegant Resorts’ 24-hour emergency telephone number, we have an experienced
            team of Elegant Resorts Managers and representatives, based in key destinations such as Barbados, Antigua, Dubai and Mauritius, who are on hand in your resort to meet, greet, guide
            and make reservations for you throughout your holiday. With their local insights,
            advice and suggestions, you will feel very much supported throughout your stay.




Returning Home


Our pre- and post-departure teams are here to ensure that everything runs smoothly
            during the run up to, plus after, your time in resort. We pride ourselves in providing
            the same level of service throughout your holiday experience with Elegant Resorts,
            and should events occur beyond our control, or you feel that we have not quite matched
            your expectations, our Crisis and Client Services Teams are diligently on hand to
            help.




Planning Your Next Adventure


Your Travel Consultant will call to discuss your final arrangements before you travel,
            but will also telephone you on your return. This allows you to engage further with
            your travel professional, allowing us to better understand your preferences for
            any future travel arrangements. Clients are able to discuss any plans or requirements
            they may have and we can start to plan ahead for you – beginning your next adventure,
            effortlessly.









Pre-Travel Arrangements

The times before and after your luxury escape are equally important elements of
               your holiday experience with Elegant Resorts. We aim to ensure that every detail
               of your trip is thoroughly pursued, with any late requests being swiftly dealt with
               and any airline amendments expertly relayed. Our team ensures that any chauffeur
               cars are arranged, airport staff fully briefed and all manner of fast track options
               or luggage services are suitably booked, in addition to airport lounges and possible
               spa facilities. We understand the challenges of travelling with large families,
               taking oversized sporting equipment or needing to send luggage in advance of travel
               – so we also work with the industry specialists to provide valuable additional services
               for our clients.
