Luxury Holidays to The Indian Ocean with Elegant Resorts



For their picture-perfect, island castaway settings, combined with the comfort of luxury living, exquisite Indian Ocean holidays are hard to beat...
The jewel-like islands that make up the
Maldives
archipelago are tiny, with just a single, luxurious resort on each. The crystal-clear waters are home to coral reefs teeming with brilliant marine life, providing some exceptional
diving
and snorkelling opportunities.
A little further south-west, the
Seychelles
are like little slices of Eden, bursting with coconut and mango groves while turtles and exotic fish swim just off-shore. The dramatic mountains and lush plantations of its capital Mahé provide an interesting counterpoint to the low-lying paradise isles.



A great all-round destination,
Mauritius
is an alluring mixture of golden sands, turquoise lagoons and lush green landscapes as well as European, Oriental and Creole cultures and some of the world’s finest hotels. Offering something for everyone, days can be spent lazing on a beach or beside the pool, playing a round of
golf
or enjoying a range of watersports, sightseeing or shopping for half-price designer labels in the capital, Port Louis.
Explore this site to view our selected properties in the Indian Ocean or call our Travel Consultants for more information.
