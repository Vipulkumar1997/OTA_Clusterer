Luxury Holidays To Ras Al Khaimah



Luxury Holidays to Ras Al Khaimah with Elegant Resorts



The most far northern emirate of the United Arab Emirates, Ras Al Khaimah (meaning ‘Top of the Tent’), nestles at the foot of the majestic Al Hajar Mountains and borders the Sultanate of
Oman
. The emirate’s landscape is filled with vast swathes of sandy desert, sweeping sand dunes and a long coastline dotted with tranquil lagoons and golden beaches, making it the perfect luxury Elegant Resorts' holiday destination.

Famous for its natural attractions, visitors can enjoy sailing along the rivers in the traditional dhows as well as camel-riding, falconry and wadi safaris. Like the other emirates, Ras Al Khaimah boasts many excellent shopping malls and restaurants and, as it is still relatively undiscovered, you’ll find it less crowded than its more popular counterparts.
