Luxury Holidays to The Arabian Gulf with Elegant Resorts



A fascinating land of windswept dunes, nomadic tribesmen and gleaming modern cities, the Middle East is one of the 21st century's must-visit destinations.
Dubai's
inimitable mix of soaring skyscrapers, lavish shopping, beautiful mosques and glorious sandy beaches make for an exciting holiday to suit all the family. Home to the world's most luxurious hotels, you can expect adventures galore, from camel rides to diving and sand-boarding to the more sedate joys of golf on your
Dubai
holiday.



In contrast,
Oman
is a more low-key, low-rise affair whose ancient forts and beautiful beaches prove the main draw but there are also museums, a picturesque harbour in the historic capital, Muscat, as well as outlying ruined cities and awe-inspiring desertscapes. Also included in our Middle East portfolio is
Abu Dhabi
; with it lush gardens, stark desert and superb shopping, it simply highlights the multi-faceted attractions of this diverse part of the world. Whilst
Ras Al Khaimah
, is still relatively undiscovered and therefore less crowded than its more popular counterparts.
Explore this site to view our selected properties in the Arabian Gulf or call our Travel Consultants for more information.
