Luxury Holidays  At  Curtain Bluff

Curtain Bluff is an elegant, yet unpretentious haven that retains much of its original old-world, Colonial charm. Set on a peninsula, it boasts fifteen acres of gardens and beaches, two of which are reef-protected. Spacious rooms and suites spread up the bluff, capitalising on the cooling breezes and spectacular vista - each is so spacious you could happily spend a whole afternoon up there; Junior Suites feature striking sunken living rooms and are ideal for families; the Morris Bay and Grace Bay Suites include four-poster beds and balcony Jacuzzis, while the appropriately named Terrace Suite boasts amazing views across the bay. Deliberately designed with serenity in mind, the guest rooms are equipped with wi-fi but not televisions, although there is a well-stocked entertainment room.

Family

Curtain Bluff's complimentary kids' club, CEEBEE, offers a full programme of fun activities including crafts, making cookies and ice-cream sundaes, mocktails at the main bar, movie time with popcorn, learning about the local flora and fauna, and swimming. The club is available to 3 to 10-year-olds and is avaialble five days a week. CEEBEE takes place in a shaded pavilion close to the beach and adjacent to the children's play area where there are swings, slides and a treehouse. Should there be a rainy day, there is also an indoor air-conditioned area to play games, watch DVDs or play computer games.

 Teenagers will love Curtain Bluff as there are so many sports activities to enjoy, including sailing and swimming.





The Beach

A patch of Caribbean paradise, Curtain Bluff boasts two soft, golden beaches, offering something for every mood and taste. Lie back beneath the sun on the beautiful, curved Bay Beach, or take to its calm, crystalline waters with a range of thrilling watersports - including water-skiing, kayaking and sailing. Enjoy an exotic cocktail and a delicious island barbecue, backed by a live steel band, at the lively Beach Cafe and Bar. If you fancy quiet contemplation, playing in the surf, or swinging in a hammock to the rhythm of the waves, the palm-shaded and secluded Surf Beach is just the place for you.





Weddings

Intimacy and romance are guaranteed at your fairytale wedding at Curtain Bluff.  Feel the soft sand beneath your toes as you say "I do" beneath an arch of flowers on the beach, overlooking the sparkling Caribbean Sea, before indulging in an authentic island banquet and dancing the night away to a steel band. The resident wedding coordinator and her dedicated team will see to every aspect of your seamless wedding - organising photographers, local flowers and pre-ceremony spa treatments - leaving you to enjoy the best day of your life.





Hotel Experiences

To complement sunset cruises and fishing trips, the hotel welcomes the Antigua Classic Regatta in early April - admire over one-hundred historical yachts as they gracefully sail past Curtain Bluff. Following this, the end of April sees the annual sailing week. Created by the hotel's late owner, Howard Hulford, this charming event has been taking place for over thirty-five years and is sure to impress even the most reluctant of sailors.  The hotel also hosts a series of tennis tournaments throughout the year with celebrity tennis guests such as Tracy Austin, Annabel Croft and Andrew Castle.





Spa & Wellness

The 5,000ft² Spa at Curtain Bluff is set set in its own grounds, close to the sea and offering wonderful panoramic views across to the neighbouring islands, it is the ideal place to unwind and features five treatment rooms (including one for couples), water features, an open-air relaxation room with ocean views, an infinity-edge hot tub and a selection of wraps, scrubs, facials, treatments and massages. Spa packages are available and spa treatments can be enjoyed in one of the treatment rooms in the spa or in the privacy of your guest room or suite
