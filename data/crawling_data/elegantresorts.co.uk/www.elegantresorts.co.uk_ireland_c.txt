Luxury Holidays To Ireland



Luxury Holidays to Ireland with Elegant Resorts



The Irish landscape has a mythic quality and magical resonance not easily forgotten. Picturesque bays, lush emerald-green fields, ancient castles, elegant country houses and a bustling capital city are just a few of the delights of a luxury holiday to Ireland. Ireland's convenient location also makes it the ideal choice for a few days away, although with so much to see and do, people often stay longer. In addition, a wide variety of sporting activities are available, including golf, horse-riding and hiking, while keen fishermen can enjoy the salmon and trout season between April and September, with course fishing and sea angling available all year.



The capital city,
Dublin
, is a vibrant and cosmopolitan city, which buzzes with energy and history, and leaves visitors spoilt for choice with its variety of sophisticated boutiques, art galleries, theatres, fine museums and excellent restaurants, not to mention a plethora of bars where the city's famous tipple, Guinness, may be enjoyed.
