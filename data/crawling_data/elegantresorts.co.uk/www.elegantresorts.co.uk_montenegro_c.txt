Luxury Holidays to Montenegro with Elegant Resorts


With its steep mountains, deep canyons, a coastline edged with beaches and coves set against a backdrop of lush interiors, you might, at first mistake Montenegro for a lost
Caribbean
island, but investigate its towns and villages and you’ll find that you are definitely in the Balkans. Set in one of Montenegro’s most beautiful bays, Kotor, is a marvellously preserved city with medieval architecture dating back to the 12th century. Its numerous monuments and wealth of artistic and cultural heritage have made it a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Bay of Kotor's labyrinthine alleyways open onto small squares where you can sip coffee and listen to the local chatter as the aromas of roasted chestnuts and grilled fish drift by.
