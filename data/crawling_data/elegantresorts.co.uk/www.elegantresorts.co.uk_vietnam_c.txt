Luxury Holidays to Vietnam with Elegant Resorts


Vietnam is an extraordinarily varied and beautiful country and a luxury Vietnam holiday offers you a chance to explore not only its cultural and historical past but also its spectacular scenery filled with endless stretches of white-sand beaches and shimmering paddy fields. Exotic Asian influences sit against a backdrop of French-Colonial splendour in the sophisticated and prosperous capital,
Hanoi
.
Ho Chi Minh City
also retains the allure of centuries past, when Saigon was described as the 'Pearl of the Far East'. Here, you'll find skyscrapers juxtaposed with faded French-Colonial buildings and a myriad of street markets, shops, pavement cafés, stands-on-wheels and vendors selling wares spread out on the pavements.
