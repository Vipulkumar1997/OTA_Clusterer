Luxury Holidays to Grenada with Elegant Resorts



Enjoy a luxury holiday to Grenada with Elegant Resorts and discover the ‘Isle of Spice’ for yourself. The southernmost of the Windward Islands, Grenada is the world’s biggest producer of nutmeg, and visitors to the island can happily spend an hour or two wandering around the spice farms or nutmeg stations. Grenada has managed to avoid the pitfalls that come with mass-tourism, and has a charming policy which asserts that buildings any taller than the tallest palm tree are simply not allowed, meaning the island’s white-sand beaches, turquoise waters and wild jungle remain intact.




If you can resist the lure of the white-sand beaches, especially Grand Anse Beach, the most perfect on the island, then St George’s, the island’s historic capital, is one of the prettiest in the
Caribbean
. The Carenage runs all the way around St George’s harbour in a horse-shoe shape and is filled with plenty of dockside restaurants – great for a lazy lunch, after which, you can wander amongst the hilly lanes whilst enjoying a spot of shopping.
