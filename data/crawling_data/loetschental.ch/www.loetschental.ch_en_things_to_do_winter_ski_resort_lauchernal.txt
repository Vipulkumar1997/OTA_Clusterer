Ski resort Lauchernalp

In winter there is the lure of the best interconnected ski arena with guaranteed snow - the winter sports paradise that is the Lauchernalp. The sunny ski resort has
55 km
of pistes up to a height of
3,111 m above sea level
and also has a quite unique freeride area. The Lauchernalp is just as popular with active skiers, from beginners to experts, as with families with small children, snowboarders and lovers of virgin snow. The ski arena offers simple blue runs to more challenging black descents - everything that a skier's heart could desire!

Against the backdrop of the imposing mountainous
UNESCO World Heritage Site
with 40 peaks higher than 4,000 metres, skiers can access the wonderful slopes of the Lauchernalp with its perfectly prepared runs either by cable car, two chairlifts, two tows and a glacier cable car.

The majestic mountainous backdrop, powder snow, crystal-clear air and cosy mountain huts bring your dream of a ski paradise to life.
