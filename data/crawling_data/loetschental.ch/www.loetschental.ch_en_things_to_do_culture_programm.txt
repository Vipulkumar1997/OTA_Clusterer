Culture in the Lötschental























More





Because of its isolated location, the Lötschental has become a source for a multitude of stories, legends and myths. Wild figures that raced through the Lötschental‘s history and have left their traces.

It is they who were the origins of the «Tschäggättä» custom that is still celebrated today during the carnival season. The masked carnival figures typical in the Lötschental, the so-called Tschäggättä, appear in the period between the Catholic holiday of Candlemass and Shrove Tuesday (the day before Ash Wednesday). Every evening after work these wild-looking figures streak through the valley and hunt down and frighten anyone who is still out on the streets.



Our tip!

Then experience this living tradition at first-hand on 4. February 2016 at the traditional Tschäggättu-Procession or on 6. February 2016 at the Lötschental Carnival Procession.

Food belongs to carnival as much as disguise and music. A special treat are the cookies "Chiächlini" (small cakes) baked for the shrovetide carnival at the Lötschental. Each family keeps its own recipe secret.

Here is a recipe from the village of Wiler, for two Kilos "Chiächlini": Warm up 100g butter add 250g sugar, 2dl white wine, 1dl Kirsch and 1dl Bergamot. Beat 6 eggs, add a pinch of salt and then mix it.

Sprinkle 1 kilo flour and 2 baking powder packets on your kitchen table. Put the mixture on the flour bed and knead it until workable. Let the dough rest for 1 hour. Cut out and bake it in frying oil.

With the conservation of the ritual of the Easter Donation, Ferden has managed to preserve a memorial of a Christian sense of community, i.e. a custom that used to be common in a similar form in the entire alpine region.

Every year, the milk produce of two days is processed into a special kind of cheese, which is then distributed to the inhabitants of Lötschental on Easter Monday. According to a medieval legend, this is done in order to break the curse of the Ferdener Alps.

At the communal cellar, the cheese is turned into a fine mash, salted and filled into Rümpfe, carcasses, which are handmade every year from the bark of a fir tree. All tasks in this process – including the distribution of the donation that consists of cheese, bread and wine for adults to hundreds of guests – are done by specifically selected men from Ferden.

After the morning mass, the children first stand in line at the parish hall to receive the so-called small donation. Then, the open council follows at which the citizens debate the Easter donation. In the afternoon, the guests from the other communities of the valley have their turn and then the women of Ferden. Last but not least, the men of Ferden receive their donation on Tuesday night.



Our tip!

Visit the exhibition at the municipal administration office in Ferden and learn more about the Easter donation. The exhibition will be open according to the office opening hours.

Has anyone not heard of the Lötschental Grenadiers of God? Along with the womenfolk in their brightly-coloured Lötschental traditional costumes they have been part of the solemn processions held on Christian holidays since time immemorial. A piece of living culture that is still celebrated today with love and a sense of honour and one that the locals are happy to share with visitors to the valley.

These "red soldiers" are a legacy from ancient soldiering days. For centuries many residents of the Lötschental have made a living for themselves in far-flung countries.

The men of the Lötschental were also active at the royal courts of Versailles and Naples - it is from there that the uniforms of the Grenadiers of God originate. The soldiers returned to their villages, brought their parade uniforms with them and wear them again at Christian festivals in honour of God.



Our tip!

Experience this living tradition at first-hand on 26 May 2016 at the procession of the feast of Corpus Christi or on 29 May 2016 at the procession of Benedictine Sunday. The processions take place in every village.

Program 26th of May 2016

Grenadiers of God

Religion and faith are deeply rooted in the Lötschental. The churches and chapels are still among the most important locations of the local population. In fact, each of the four communities has its own church and a multitude of chapels and shrines around the village.
The Dedication of the respective church is annually celebrated as a feast. The peculiarity in the Lötschental is that at the Service of Dedication there is a procession of the famous Grenadiers of God.



Our tip!

In 2016 there will be the following Services of Dedication in the Lötschental:


19 June 2016 - Service of Dedication in Kippel

21 August 2016 - Service of Dedication in Wiler

28 August 2016 - Service of Dedication in Blatten

11 September 2016 - Service of Dedication in Ferden


The beginning of the church service is at 10.00 am. At 2.00 pm there will be a devotion where also the Grenadiers of God deploy.

The Lötschental has a total of 54 chapels, churches and shrines waiting to be discovered by visitors. At the tourist office in Wiler or online under

Especially the baroque Chapel of Mariä Heimsuchung (Visitation of Our Lady) in Kühmatt is the destination of regional pilgrimages. Kühmatt, situated at 1,633 metres above sea level, is one of the most impressive places of grace in the valley.

Chapels can always be found on ways and places, where life is going on. In the early days, people's life in the Lötschental concentrated on the surrounding alps during the summer, because the cattle was summering there. Thus, chapels can be found on almost every alp in the Lötschental. Nowadays, chapel feasts are taking place during the summer months. The money that is raised with these feasts is put into the preservation of the respective chapel.



Our tip!

In 2016 the following chapel feasts take place in the Lötschental:


3th July 2016 - Chapel feast Kühmatt

24th July 2016 - Chapel feast Hockenalp

31st July 2016 - Chapel feast Fafleralp

7th August 2016 - Chapel feast Faldumalp

On November 1st and 2nd - All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day - people in Catholic regions are commemorating the dead in a special way. People visit the cemetary, light candles and decorate the graves of the deceased.

In Kippel, there is in addition to the commemoration of the dead, a very special tradition - the All Soul's Donation, also called "Allerseelenspend". In the morning after church and the visit of the graves, a piece of bread and cheese is distributed to all visitors.

The All Soul's Donation of Kippel dates back to 1453. According to a document several honorable men then donated an eternal "Jahrzeit" (yearly commemoration of the dead) to all faithful souls. The income of the "Jahrzeit" were used to cater the priest on the one hand and were distributed to the members of the "Jahrzeit" on the other hand. What was still left from the income, was distributed to the poor.

It is an old tradition that the people from the Lötschental possess vines outside the valley. This tradition can also be seen on our valley flag, on which vines are embroided, allthough vines were never planted in the Lötschental. Thus, an exclusive wine-culture line was produced, whereas each wine has been assigned to a living tradition in the Lötschental:



Goigglär -
The Goigglär is the treasure of Valais wines, namely a Cornalin. As valuable as the treasure of the 3 kings, which is protected by the Goigglär (jesters).

Leetschär -
The Leetschär Grenadier is a Fendant de Salquenen. It is as firm and tight as the Grenadiers of God are standing tight during mass.

Tschäggättubluäd -
The Tschäggättubluäd is a powerful Pinot Noir de Salquenen. It is as strong as the Tschäggätta, which are THE living heritage of the Lötschental.
