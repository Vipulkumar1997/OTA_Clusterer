Lötschental Museum Kippel

The Lötschental Museum leads you into a world full of tradition and customs. More than 60 wooden masks offer an unbroken history of the development of the basic traits of masking in the Lötschental since 1900 till to date. Genuine objects and films allow you to experience traditional costumes and the historic uniforms of the "Grenadiers of God". On your tour you will meet religious art of old and ethnic art of today. You find witnesses of the style of living, of alpine farming and tourism. You will also discover the portrayal of the country and its people in photography and art.
