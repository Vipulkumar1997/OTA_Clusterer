Description
In winter, the snow-guaranteed, well-developed winter paradise Lauchernalp invites you to linger. The sunny ski resort offers you 55 km slopes up to 3111 m above sea level, and opens up a racy freeride area. Surrounded by the imposing mountain backdrop of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, lies the well with a cable car, two chair lifts, one t-bar-lift and a glacier cableway accessible skiing area Lauchernalp. The glacier cableway leads up onto the Hockenhorngrat (3111 m, glacier ski area with numerous medium-difficulty pistes and freeride arena), and also provides access to a winter walking trail at over 3000 metres in altitude with a panoramic view of 40 four-thousand-metre mountain summits. For cross-country skiers and winter hikers there are about 50 km winter hiking trails, as well as 24 km classic and skating trails to explore.
