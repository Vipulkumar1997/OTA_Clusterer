Walking and Pilgrimages

It is no longer a secret that the Lötschental is an exceptionally beautiful hiking paradise. However, very few people know that the valley also has a wealth of chapels, churches and shrines.
The Lötschental has a total of 54 chapels, churches and shrines waiting to be discovered by visitors
.

Consciously take in the extraordinarily beautiful natural countryside in the Lötschental and experience these sites for contemplation in total peace along paths that have been trodden for hundreds of years - and above all rediscover something about yourself.




We very much hope that you experience a peaceful time in the Lötschental – Switzerland's magic valley!
