A tropical island in the heart of the Alps

The “Tropenhaus” in the town of Frutigen takes advantage of renewable energy from an unusual source to breed Siberian sturgeon for caviar, as well as grow bananas, papayas and kumquats. This one-of-a-kind centre offers visitors the opportunity to learn and experience – and even taste - how all this is possible in the Alps! The fruits grown on the premises, as well as the centre’s sturgeon meat and caviar, are served up as fresh, authentic dishes in the Tropenhaus’s very own restaurants.
