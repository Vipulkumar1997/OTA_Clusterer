Villages

Tourism is centred on the five villages of:







Ferden is the first village in the Lötschental and is therefore the gateway to the most unspoilt Alpine valley. Its Goppenstein railway station is known across the world as the southern entrance to the Lötschberg Tunnel and even before construction of the Lötschberg Tunnel, Ferden was the gateway to the Northern Valais region.
After Blatten it is the largest village in the Lötschental in terms of area. Its meadows and fields, especially those close to the village itself, are some of the most fertile in the entire valley and have given the village its name (possibly from the Romanche ‘verdent’ meaning ‘verdant’ or ‘green’). It is particularly worth visiting Ferden's old village centre, where some buildings date back to the 14th and 15th centuries and provide evidence of the architecture and construction methods of this era. Ferden is the first village in the Lötschental.

It is worth paying a visit to the old part of Kippel with its ornamental timber façades and St. Martin's Church, which dates back to the 16th century. As the unofficial cultural capital of the Lötschental, Kippel is especially popular with all cultural enthusiasts. Albert Nyfeler, the well-known painter and photographer from the Lötschental, who lived in Kippel, was inspired by the valley's magic. His collected works can be viewed in the Nyfeler Gallery in Kippel. For visitors with an interest in history, a visit to the Lötschental Museum, which transports visitors into a world of Alpine traditions and customs, is worthwhile.

Right at the very heart of the Lötschental lies Wiler, the perfect holiday destination for active holidaymakers and families. Wiler is the starting point of the cable car to the Lauchernalp at a height of 1,970 m above sea level. The Lauchernalp offers a wonderful hiking and outdoor sports region ideal for hikers and ramblers of all levels. And back in the valley, the "Gsteinätt" Leisure Centre offers many more activities for a successful day's holiday.



This unspoilt mountain village, nestling against the backdrop of a breathtaking countryside, is one of the best-kept secret amongst nature-lovers, romantics and people just looking for rest and relaxation.

Steg-Hohtenn consists, as the name implies, of the two villages Steg and Hohtenn, which merged in 2009 to a single community. The municipality has 1,500 inhabitants and is located in the Rhone valley on the left side of the river Lonza right at the entrance to the Lötschental. In the second half of the 20th century Steg-Hotenn has developed from a farming village into an attractive commercial and industrial community, which offers nowadays nearly 900 jobs. Various industrial, commercial and service companies are located here, including the Alcan Alusuisse AG, which provides 180 jobs in its foundry. Even residents of the Lötschental are working in Steg. Ever since Steg-Hohtenn is closely linked with the Lötschental. So many residents of Steg possess for example “alp rights” (right to use mountain pastures) to use the alps of Fafler and Gugginen in the Lötschental.

Touristically Steg offers an indoor swimming pool with tennis courts as well as a sports center. Hohtenn, on the other hand, is the starting point for many hiking tours along the Lötschbergsüdrampe. In Steg, the oldest vine plant of Switzerland (planted 1744) can be admired.
