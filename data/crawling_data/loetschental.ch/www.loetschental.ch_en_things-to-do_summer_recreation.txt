Daniel Ritler, an innovative young farmer, lives and works in the furthest village down the Lötschental. Daniel Ritler runs his company "Dani's Lamm" in accordance with organic farming guidelines and markets his lamb and mutton under BioSuisse's "Bio-Knospe" (Organic Bud) label. You will find everything you need to know about lamb and mutton on his website
www.danis-lamm.ch
: gigots, ragouts, cutlets, rolled roasting joints, airdried meats and sausage, and lamb salami.

But a visit to the delicatessen farm shop itself is worth it. In the carefully and tastefully renovated barn in Ried in Blatten you do not simply buy; rather you are invited to discover, be amazed and enjoy. From little homewoven bean-bags and aromatic wood to softening soap in the shape of a lamb - from bags and handbags made from recycled materials, greetings cards in all shapes and colours, and decorations for the home and garden made from natural materials, to knitting sets and lamb fleeces: in the stylishly furnished farm shop you can find everything to give you and others pleasure.

With sausage and meat specialities from his own farm, other organic products and speciality cheeses from the Lötschental, and a range of selected wines from Valais, he can satisfy almost all culinary wishes simultaneously.

Why not swim in the great outdoors?...

Who needs a swimming pool when you can bathe in the idyllic Schwarzee or Faflersee lakes in good weather? The imposing Bietschhorn rises up opposite and you can see the Petersgrat with its permanent cover of snow above you.
