Lötschental App

Download the Lötschental app free of charge and start discovering the Lötschental valley!


With the Lötschental app you will always have everything you want to know about the "magic valley" to hand: right there on your iPhone or android phone.

Discover the unique landscape and nature of the Lötschental with a wealth of different tours and ideas for planning your leisure time - which you can filter according to the degree of difficulty, duration and length of the routes.

This app includes all the hiking and Alpine trekking routes, bike trails and pilgrimage tours with detailed route descriptions for summer and winter hikes, as well as tobogganing runs, cross-country ski trails, snow-shoe hikes and ski tours for winter.

All the tours have detailed descriptions, routes and suggested stops. The information is enhanced by photographs of the tours, as well as detailed tracks shown on a topographical map that users can zoom into. Interesting points on tours are labelled on the map by interactive symbols that you can click on for more information. An altitude profile of each tour shows the terrain that awaits you on each individual tour.

You can also use the app to call up events in the Lötschental during the period of your stay, look up the weather forecast or find out about offers in the Lötschental. With this app you will always be best prepared before and during your stay in the Lötschental. Have fun trying it out!
