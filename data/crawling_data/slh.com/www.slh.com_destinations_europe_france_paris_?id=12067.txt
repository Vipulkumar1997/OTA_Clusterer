Things to do


LANDMARKS

Paris is famed worldwide for one landmark in particular – the Eiffel Tower. Scale this iconic structure at night to see the city twinkling around you. Or you could visit magnificent cathedrals, from Notre Dame to the Sacre Coeur, high up on its hill. Paris also boasts striking modern architecture, from the controversial Louvre Pyramid to the latticework adorning the Institut du Monde Arab.

CULTURE

Paris has long been beloved by artists and writers, with a huge number of cultural highlights to savour. Take in the Louvre’s record-breaking collection and the bright Impressionist paintings at the Musée D’Orsay. Visit the striking Centre Pompidou, or discover tucked-away treasures like the Rodin sculpture garden. You could also take a literary tour of Paris, stopping off at sights frequented by writers like Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald.

SHOPPING

A city break in Paris wouldn’t be complete without taking some time out for some retail therapy. Browse the exclusive designer fashion houses lining the grand Champs Elysees. Or linger over delicate macaroons in the artisan bakeries of Ile de Saint Louis. Then wander along the banks of the Seine, where artists set up shop to sell their paintings.






Seek out a quiet space in the heart of the city. Stroll past dancing fountains and find a sunny spot on the lawn at Jardins de Luxembourg.
