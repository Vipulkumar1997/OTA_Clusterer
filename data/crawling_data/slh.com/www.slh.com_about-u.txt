About Us










The Champions of Small


We don’t believe bigger is better, we think small hotels offer a unique personal touch that leaves a lasting impression. We seek out the little gems that offer genuine, one-of-a-kind experiences - it could be lashings of luxury at a palatial mansion or barefoot bliss on a desert island. You could crave the bright lights of the big city, or long for star-lit nights at a remote resort. Bring us your wish list and we’ll provide you with a list of hotels that tick all the boxes, and then some.









Rewarding you, every step of the way


With over 500 luxury hotels in more than 80 countries, the only difficult thing about booking with us is choosing where to stay. That’s why our team of experts are on hand 24/7 to answer questions, make suggestions and inspire you. What’s more, if you join Invited, you’ll be first in line for the exclusive Invited member privileges available at each of our hotels. INVITED is a free to join membership programme with three tiers: Invited, Inspired and Indulged. INVITED
rewards members for booking directly with SLH. Don’t miss out on exclusive privileges for the independently minded.

we don't follow the trends, we make them


Every one of our 520 small, independent hotels has one thing in common: excellence. We’ve carefully selected each of our hotels to celebrate their individual quirks and characters, and we ensure they’re all of a consistently high standard. We don’t settle for mediocre, we don’t do average, and we’d never accept anything less than luxury. We understand the importance of being independently minded, so we seek out independently-spirited hotels to cater to our guests.









We track down hidden treasures


Your time is valuable and trips away are precious, so we only offer tried and tested hotels we know you’ll love. Before they’re welcomed into SLH, our development team visit each one, checking them against a long list of must-haves. When we find a rare diamond that shines, we’ll share the sparkle with you.






We receive over 1,000 hotel applications each year, but accept just 5%.







You're in good hands


We first started seeking out incredible destinations in 1989, when the Berlin Wall was still standing, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were one country and smart phones were non-existent. Since then, we’ve discovered everything from ubër-cool caves to trend-setting tree houses. We've been searching for the
crème de la crème
of luxury for generations, and we know exactly what it takes to create an unforgettable experience.









Don't Just take our word for it


We are delighted to have won some prestigious awards:










World Travel Awards 2014 & 2015


World's Leading Boutique Hotel Brand  2014 & 2015

World's Leading Luxury Hotel Brand Website 2014















British Travel Awards 2016


Best International Luxury Hotel Brand
