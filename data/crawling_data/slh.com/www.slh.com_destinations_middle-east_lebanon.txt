INTRODUCING LEBANON


Lebanon is filled with the ancient ruins and history you might expect in the Middle East, alongside lots of modern touches from skiing to excellent fine dining. You’ll find the largest souk in the world here, as well as stunning architecture. But the emphasis is very much on the present, with buzzing nightlife, sophisticated shopping boutiques and an exciting cultural scene.






Once known as the Paris of the Orient, Lebanon is recapturing its glamour thanks to redevelopment – and a lively party attitude.

Beirut














PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Beirut.

Currency:
Lebanese lira (in 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 5000, 10000, 20000 and 50000 notes).

Cuisine:
Mezze is big in Lebanon; you’ll see a variety of hot and cold dishes including pickled vegetables, hummus, skewered meats and flatbread.

Tipping etiquette:
Expect to tip 10%.

Saying hello:
Use the Arabic greeting, “as-salamu 'alaykum”.









WHEN TO GO


Summer is the time to visit if you fancy beach resorts, pool time and swimming in the Med. But Beirut and the Lebanon are superb destinations all year round, with nightlife and entertainment aplenty. Keen skiers tend to visit in February to make the most of the fresh snow on the mountains. Autumn and spring are ideal if you want to avoid the crowds.






If you’re hoping to take a dip, be sure to take local advice. Due to overfishing, the Mediterranean has seen growing numbers of jellyfish – harmless, but a pain.
