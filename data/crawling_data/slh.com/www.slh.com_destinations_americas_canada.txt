INTRODUCING CANADA


Everything about Canada is big: the Niagara Falls, the CN Tower, the surf swells, the famous moose and infamous grizzly bears. You could go big on luxury in two of the world’s most cosmopolitan cities. Or you could head off-the-beaten track to scenic Nova Scotia where the forests are huge, but your boutique hotel is small and perfectly formed.






Explore trendy cities and epic landscapes, picture-perfect lighthouses and dramatic hiking trails.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Ottawa.

Currency:
Canadian dollar (in $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 notes).

Cuisine:
The home of maple syrup – enjoy it over pancakes with bacon for breakfast.

Tipping etiquette:
A service isn’t usually added to your bill. 10-20% is the norm.

Saying hello:
Most Canadians speak English, but in French speaking Quebec say “bonjour” or “salut”.









WHEN TO GO


As the world’s second largest country, Canada spans time zones and climates. Most people prefer to visit in the summer – between May and September – when the weather is mildest and the days are longest. The autumn can be a beautiful time to visit as the forests put on a spectacular show of colour. While, during the winter, the snow creates a cosy, magical atmosphere, the ski resorts around Toronto fill up, and many cities hold winter carnivals.






Canadians love a festival – from jazz to lobster, comedy to sport – and they’re a great opportunity to get a taste of local life.
