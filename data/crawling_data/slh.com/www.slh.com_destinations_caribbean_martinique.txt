INTRODUCING MARTINIQUE


Martinique is a small island that’s brimming with ‘joie de vivre’ – a true melting pot of French and Caribbean cultures. On the one hand, you’ll find croissants and chic boutiques, colonial grandeur and fine French wines. On the other are Créole specialities and gorgeous beach retreats, lush jungle and divine spas. And, with some of the best rum in the world on offer, you’ll soon be saying ‘Santé!’ with the locals.






On a white-sand beach, beneath swaying palms, the Gallic flair of France meets the charm of the Caribbean.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:

Fort-de-France.

Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
Influenced by French and Creole cuisine, expect to find curries, fritters and a lot of fresh seafood.

Tipping etiquette:
A 10-15% tip is usual.

Saying hello:
Most people will use “bonjour”, but other local dialects are also spoken.









WHEN TO GO


Martinique sits firmly in the tropics so has two clear seasons. During the dry season (from December to May) the weather is calm with temperatures averaging about 26 degrees. The wet season runs from June to November and – although it’s called ‘wet’ – is generally characterised by short, sharp showers. This can be a great time to visit as the golf course, spas, and beaches are quieter and more relaxed. To see the country at it’s busiest and brightest, time your travels to coincide with Martinique’s carnival – a four-day celebration, just before Lent.






This small island is alive with music – make sure you catch a performance of local favourites, zouk or bèlè.
