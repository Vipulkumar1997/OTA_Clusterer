INTRODUCING CROATIA


Croatia is an intricate tapestry where old and new are seamlessly woven together. Lose yourself in historic cities alive with culture. Charter a luxury yacht and take a dip in secluded coves. Or visit chic cocktail bars and awe-inspiring sights, all from the luxury of your boutique hotel. This is the Mediterranean as it was always meant to be.






Croatia’s fast become the ‘It Girl’ of Europe: glamorous, beautiful, elegant and (from time to time) a little bit wild.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Kuna, which is divided into 100 lipa (in 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 kuna notes).

Cuisine:
Get a taste for the seafood-dominated cuisine of the Mediterranean and the filling schnitzel-and-strudel fare of central Europe.

Tipping etiquette:
Staff won’t expect you to tip, but it’s considered polite to do so. 10% is the norm.

Transport:
Travel up and down Croatia’s coastline using the bus service, do some island hopping on a ferry, or jump on the train to explore the rest of the country.









WHEN TO GO


Perched on the Mediterranean coast, Croatia has warm summers and mild winters. July and August are ‘peak season’ with hot weather drawing visitors from far and wide to the country’s beaches, glittering archipelago and many bars and cafes. From October onwards, the coast and cities are quieter, making this a great time for urban sightseeing or shopping.






Croatia’s culinary scene is on the rise with regional specialities and bountiful produce inspiring a new generation of fine dining foodies – oysters, truffles, olive oil and white wine are a ‘must try’ for any visitor.
