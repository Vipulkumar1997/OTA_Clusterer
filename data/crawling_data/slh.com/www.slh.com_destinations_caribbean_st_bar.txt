INTRODUCING ST BARTHÉLEMY


A gem of an island, St Barthélemy – also known as St Bart’s – has built a glittering reputation as a luxury beach escape. Stroll from your exclusive hotel onto white, palm-fringed sands. Sail across crystal clear waters, or dive beneath the waves to discover a world of colourful coral and tropical fish. Or venture into buzzing Gustavia, with its designer boutiques and world-class gourmet restaurants.






French style meets Caribbean spirit on this glamorous paradise island.

Things to do


BEACHES & WATER

St Barthélemy is famed for its pristine coastline. See and be seen at celebrity hotspot, St Jean, or take a dip in the warm, calm waters of Grand Cul de Sac – renowned as one of the best beaches in the world. For something a little more active, the wide sands and rolling waves of Flamands bay make it a popular spot for surfing and sailing.

FOOD & DRINK

There’s no shortage of exceptional places to eat and drink in St Barthélemy. Savour an evening of French fine dining on the Gustavia harbour front. Or sample authentic Creole dishes like stuffed crab and freshly caught lobster. Then take a seat on the terrace at a beachside bar and sip champagne as the sun sets over the sea.

SHOPPING

St Barthélemy offers the very best in Parisian style, transported to an idyllic, sun-soaked setting. Browse for the latest looks and must-have accessories in the designer boutiques of Gustavia or St Jean. Even food shopping is a treat. Nibble on delicate macarons and French pastries, or drop by a gourmet deli for some beach picnic essentials.






Tour the coast in traditional style. Take a trip aboard a sailing boat and discover tucked-away beaches and quiet coves, stopping off to swim as you go.
