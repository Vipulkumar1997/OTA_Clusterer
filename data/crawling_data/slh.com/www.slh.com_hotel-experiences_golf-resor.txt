ALL TO PLAY FOR


Discover some of the world’s finest courses in our selection of luxury golf resorts. From a relaxing day on the green, to practicing your swing in a world-class training centre, these stylish hotels will inspire novices to pros.

Tee off on classic courses set on grand country estates, or bordered by white sands on exclusive private islands. Hit a birdie surrounded by waterfalls and rainforest, or play high up on hilltops with panoramic views. Then, when the golf is finished, unwind in the luxurious surroundings of your boutique hotel.

Each course presents a new and exciting challenge. Which one will you conquer?
