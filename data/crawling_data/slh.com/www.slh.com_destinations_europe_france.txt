INTRODUCING FRANCE


As one of Europe’s largest countries, France offers an endless array of experiences. You’ll find vibrant city breaks and quaint country retreats, rustic vineyards and exclusive beach resorts, cultural treasures and culinary artworks. Like a bottle of the finest Bordeaux, it is a destination with depth, complexity and no shortage of style.






Culture, cuisine and a certain ‘je ne sais quoi’… France does luxury like nowhere else in the world.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
Famous for its haute cuisine, you can indulge in the refined delicacies France has to offer, or opt for delicious, no-nonsense dishes in a country inn.

Tipping etiquette:
Restaurants usually include a service charge in your bill.

Transport:
If you want to travel by rail, France is the place to do it – relax in the most extensive rail network in Western Europe.









WHEN TO GO


The climate in France is as diverse as the countryside. In the north it’s similar to the UK, with changeable weather responsible for the green countryside and delicious regional food. As you move south, the weather becomes significantly warmer with the west and south coast basking in summer sunshine. And it’s no wonder Cole Porter loved “Paris in the spring time” and “the fall” – the whole of France looks at its best during these seasons.






From music and art to wine and cheese, every year the French indulge their passions with some world-class festivals.
