INTRODUCING DENMARK


Perfect for city breaks or country retreats, Denmark has everything from historical sights to world-class dining, chic cities to rural charm. There are quaint cobbled squares, Viking ruins, medieval architecture and Renaissance castles dotted around the rolling countryside. In Copenhagen, you’ll find buzzing cafés and Michelin-starred restaurants, not to mention pretty canals and palatial buildings. And along the coast are beautiful stretches of sand in Jutland, Amager Strandpark and Zealand Island.






Striking scenery, show-stopping architecture and secluded beaches: Denmark oozes Scandinavian style.

stegt flæsk med persille sovs

WHEN TO GO


A lively atmosphere, warm weather and lush scenery are characteristic of spring and summertime in Denmark, compared to the cooler and quieter winter months. In high season the towns and cities are bustling as people enjoy sightseeing and outdoor events. Many time a visit for Roskilde, Denmark’s four-day festival.






For a panoramic view of Copenhagen, visit the observatory, Rundetaarn. It was built in 1642 and fitted with a telescope for studying the night sky.
