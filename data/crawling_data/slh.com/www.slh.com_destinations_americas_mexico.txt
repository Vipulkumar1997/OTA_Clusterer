INTRODUCING MEXICO


Mexico is a treat for all the senses. You could scale Mayan pyramids or kick back on untouched beaches, immerse yourself in colourful cities or find solitude in exclusive country retreats – most of all, relax and revel in the laid back pace of life. This huge country has some of the world’s most beautiful coastline, most renowned historic sights, and most sophisticated fine dining. And, wherever you go, you’ll find a friendly welcome – not to mention a shot of tequila or two.






Ancient history and modern luxury, all wrapped up in exquisite natural beauty.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Mexico City.

Currency:
The Mexican peso (in $20, $50, $100, $200, $500 and $1000 notes).

Cuisine:
Colourful and spicy
–
you’ll find beans and vegetables, tortillas and tamales, meat and seafood, guacamole and salsa.

Tipping etiquette:
15-20% is the norm.

Saying hello:
Greet locals by saying “mucho gusto” or simply “hola”.









WHEN TO GO


Mexico is a year-round destination and its climate varies from place to place. Most visitors come in the winter – from December to April – when it’s reliably dry and warm. The summer – from June to October – is known as the rainy season, but the amount of rain can vary dramatically. In many areas it’s just a short, sharp downpour, and you are rewarded with quiet beaches and lush, green countryside. If you can, try to time your visit to coincide with one of the country’s many festivals.






To see Mexico at its most mysterious, visit during the Dia de Muertos (Day of the Dead) festival and see streets filled with colourful flowers and haunting masked parades.
