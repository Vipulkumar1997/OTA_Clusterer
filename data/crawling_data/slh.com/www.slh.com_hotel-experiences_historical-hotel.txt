A MOMENT IN TIME


From medieval convents to lavish chateaus, private mansions to captivating castles. When you stay at one of our historical hotels, you’ll be part of a rich story that reaches back over hundreds of years.

Many have been sensitively restored to capture the spirit of their heyday. You could experience the bohemian glamour of an exclusive Belle Époque townhouse. Or live the life of luxury in an opulent 18th-century palace. With others, the age-old exterior conceals cool, contemporary comfort – such as private villas set in ancient gardens, or a chic, converted fortress overlooking the sea.

Every boutique hotel in this collection comes with its own unique heritage. What they share is a passion for luxury experiences and unforgettable escapes.
