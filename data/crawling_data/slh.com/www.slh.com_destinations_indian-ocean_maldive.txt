INTRODUCING the MALDIVES


Here, the loudest thing you’ll hear is a palm tree swaying in the wind, warm waters lapping powdery sand, tiger prawns sizzling on a beach barbecue, or the pop of a champagne cork. This is the exclusive castaway life. Go island-hopping in seaplanes and catamarans, snorkelling with parrotfish by your private cabin or savour Creole fine dining on the beach.






Ditch your shoes and pinch yourself – this is a tropical utopia with island spa retreats and luxury hotels on stilts.

Malé














PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Malé.

Currency:
Maldivian rufiyaa (in 1, 2, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 notes).

Cuisine:
For something authentic try
Mas riha
, a traditional tuna currymadewith coconut milk.

Tipping etiquette:
A service charge is usually added to your bill, so it’s not expected.

Saying hello:
Use the Arabic greeting, “as-salamu 'alaykum”.









WHEN TO GO


The Maldives enjoys a superb climate. With temperatures at around 30°C for most of the year, it’s always ideal for diving and evenings al fresco at your luxury beach resort. The quietest season is from May to November when occasional rain storms freshen things up, and when sailing and surfing are particularly good.






Catch a water taxi to the main island of Male, and explore the markets, mosques and mind-blowing Creole cuisine.
