INTRODUCING MAURITIUS


This mesmerizing island in the Indian Ocean has influences from Africa, India, Europe and the Orient. And when you lie on its white sand, dive into its clear waters, venture into its volcanic hills, or sample the local juices and fusion cuisine, it’s easy to see why it’s proved so popular. Nowadays the scots have also made their mark – with some of the most luxurious golf anywhere.






Where the sea is as warm as the weather, and underwater is as jaw-dropping as the inland.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Port Louis.

Currency:
Rupee (in Rs25, Rs50, Rs100, Rs200, Rs500, Rs1000 and Rs2000 notes).

Cuisine:
A blend of Creole, Chinese, European, and Indian influences.

Tipping etiquette:
It’s not expected, but often appreciated.

Saying hello:
Both French and English are spoken in Mauritius, so use either “bonjour” or “hello”.









WHEN TO GO


As often as possible. The sun gods never take a break and the temperatures barely dip below 20°C, even at night. Sea temperatures are always in the mid-20s and golfing conditions are always ideal. The temperatures are coolest from June to August and, for sail sports, the winds are best in the second half of the year when rain showers also arrive to refresh the landscape.






Join turtles and tropical fish while snorkeling on one of the world’s longest unbroken coral reefs.
