INTRODUCING AUSTRIA


Austria is compact enough to combine two holidays in one: a luxury city break and a country escape. The cities are chic and sophisticated, where boutique cafés mingle with baroque grandeur, stylish bars fizz with the spirit of Mozart, and colourful cake shops reflect the decadence of the Habsburg palaces. The countryside serves up exclusive hotels on the Danube, golf courses meandering through forested valleys, cosy spas with thermal springs, and über-cool alpine resorts to ski and be seen.






From its imperious mountains to its imperial cities, Austria knows how to make an impression.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
Traditional sausages are a trademark. Feast on
schnitzel
(tenderized veal),
wienerschnitzel
(fried in breadcrumbs),
pariser
(in batter) and
natur
(served on its own or with a creamy sauce).

Tipping etiquette:
10% is usual.

Transport:
Austria’s public transport is a fast and efficient way to get around.









WHEN TO GO


Austria is best known for its winter revelry – the panache of the piste at its private ski resorts and, in the cities, the mesmerising Christmas markets and yuletide treats. As the snow melts, the mountains, lakes and golf courses become a nature lover’s paradise, while the cities spring to life with festivals.






Nothing captures Austria like an opera. Discover performances throughout the year, indoors and out – including one that floats.
