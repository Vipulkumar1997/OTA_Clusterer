INTRODUCING IRELAND


What Ireland lacks in size, it makes up for in spirit. Sample buzzing nightlife, famous live music and trend-setting shops on a city break. Get a sense for adventure with rugged coastlines and mysterious ancient monuments. Or escape to quaint, historic villages for a cosy country retreat.






Discover a land of lively culture and dramatic countryside, where ancient myths meet modern legends.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
Choose from a wide range of cuisines, from hearty gastro-pub grub, to fresh, organic produce and local cheeses.

Tipping etiquette:
You’ll be expected to givea 10% tip in metered cabs and restaurants where the service charge isn’t included.

Transport:
Public transport can be unreliable at times, so it’s worth hiring your own car to get you around Ireland quickly and easily.









WHEN TO GO


There’s plenty to see and do in Ireland, all year round. Summer plays host to a range of festivals, and spring and autumn see the countryside at its most colourful. Cold winters are just the excuse you need to settle in to a country pub and hear traditional Irish music.






Ireland is a foodie’s dream. Seek out the frequent food festivals to sample regional specialities and fresh, local produce.
