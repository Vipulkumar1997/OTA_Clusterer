INTRODUCING THAILAND


Nowhere captures the charms of Asia quite like Thailand and its people. It has extraordinary beach escapes, spa retreats and exclusive island resorts that belong in the movies. If luxuriating isn’t your thing, there are energising city breaks in Bangkok or the historic Chiang Mai, alive with cultural and culinary surprises. Or why not jump on an elephant? Idyllic jungles with waterfalls, rock pools and frangipane-scented valleys are begging to be explored.






Exotic beaches, fascinating cities, warm-hearted people and culinary wonders are just for starters.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Baht (in 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 notes).

Cuisine:
Spicy, sour, bitter, salty and sweet. Thai food balances these five flavours to create delicious and distinctive dishes.

Tipping etiquette:
Tipping is not generally expected.

Transport:
Thailand has an efficient public transport system, or if you want to get behind the wheel, you can rent a car.









WHEN TO GO


Like most countries in Asia, the weather varies as much by region as by time of year. Most people travel to Thailand between November and February, when the weather is gloriously balmy and the festivals are in full throw. The quietest months are from April to October, when the heat gives ways to a refreshing evening shower and the landscape goes radiantly green.






Prepare to smile a lot, greet a lot and have your heart melted by the incredible warmth of the people.
