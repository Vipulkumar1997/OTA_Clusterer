INTRODUCING ESTONIA


Straight from the pages of a fairytale, Estonia may be small but it has plenty to enthral travellers. Start with a city break and explore cultural Tallinn or hip Pärnu with its buzzing beach resorts. From your luxury hotel venture into the rolling countryside and discover frozen waterfalls, juniper woods, ancient meteor craters and even the ‘singing’ sands of Limo Beach.






Captivating castles, vibrant cities and natural wonders – discover enchanting Estonia.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
International cuisine is popular, but if it’san authentic taste you’re looking for then you can find traditional meat-and-potato or pork chop dishes in most Estonian restaurants.

Tipping etiquette:
A 10% tip is the norm.

Transport:
Estonia is well geared for exploration by bike, but if you prefer to put your feet up there are buses and trains available.









WHEN TO GO


In winter Estonia is transformed into a twinkling wonderland when much of the country is carpeted in snow. This is the time to visit frozen Valaste Waterfall, or take the ‘ice road’ from the mainland to Muhu island. Summers are warm and the days are long, with up to 19 hours of daylight – ideal for enjoying lazy days on the beach and the vibrant nightlife. Visit the blue lakes and verdant green countryside during spring or autumn when the weather is pleasantly cool and breezy.






The sauna is a centuries-old part of Estonian culture. Locals use birch branches to ‘whisk’ themselves – gently beating the skin is said to have healing properties.
