INTRODUCING FINLAND


Finland is a land of extremes: rugged wilderness and smooth scandi-design; cute Moomins and cutting-edge fine dining; northern lights and the midnight sun. In the summer, stroll down wide boulevards in Helsinki’s buzzing centre. In the winter, curl-up with that special someone and ward off the chills with a salmari.






An exhilarating blend of the epic and the eccentric: vast forests, secluded islands and a seriously style-conscious capital.

Helsinki














PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
Try mix of Western and Eastern influences, from Scandinavian-style fish to meats like reindeer or elk for something a little out of the ordinary.

Tipping etiquette:
Tipping is rare in Finland; a service charge is usually included in your bill.

Transport:
For the most part, trains and buses can get you around easily. You’ll only need to plan ahead if you’re visiting more remote areas of the North and East.









WHEN TO GO


Your experience of Finland will be defined by when you visit. In the winter the nights draw in and snow cloaks much of the country. This is a great time for outdoor activities like skiing, snowmobiling or (if you’re feeling brave) stewing in a sauna before jumping into a freezing cold lake. Summers can be surprisingly warm, the days are long, and the countryside is at its most beautiful. For a real taste of Finnish culture, Midsummer is a national holiday and many people celebrate with traditional feasts.






Step off the main shopping streets to track down the finest in Finnish design – from Alvar Aalto to Helsinki’s new wave.
