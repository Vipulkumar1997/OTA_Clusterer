Introducing the United Kingdom


This small island is as eclectic as it is extraordinary. You could bag must-see sights (and must-have styles) on a city break and stay in a luxury townhouse. Or get away from it all with a country retreat, complete with spa and fine dining. As the locals say, “this is the life”.






A land of lively cities and sleepy countryside, iconic sights and trend-setting style.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Pound sterling (in £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes).

Cuisine:
Deliciously diverse – incredible curries, fabulous fish & chips, traditional pub grub, regional specialities and Michelin-starred fine dining.

Tipping etiquette:
It’s polite, but not essential, to tip in restaurants, hotels and taxis. 10-15% is the norm.

Transport:
If you’re hiring a car, remember that the British drive on the left.









WHEN TO GO


There’s always something to see and do in the United Kingdom, whatever the infamous weather holds in store. Winters are generally quieter – the perfect time for cosy pubs, open fires and Christmas markets. Summers are often warm and sunny with lively festivals and sports events to enjoy. While in between the countryside is at its most beautiful.






Live out those ‘costume drama’ dreams at some of the UK’s most popular film locations – from Bath to breathtaking Derbyshire.
