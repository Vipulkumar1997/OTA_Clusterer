A ROOM WITH A VIEW


Imagine taking a dip in a moonlit infinity pool. Savouring a world-famous skyline from a rooftop bar. Or enjoying an evening of fine dining accompanied by panoramic vistas. With our selection of small, luxury hotels, the sky’s the limit.

We’ve collected together the boutique hideaways that boast the incredible views – from Mayan ruins to Italian harbours, alpine landscapes to urban skyscrapers. Where you could wake early to watch the sun rise over the beach. Or escape to the rooftop after dark to see the city illuminated at night.

Whichever retreat you choose you can be assured it will exude style – from top to bottom.
