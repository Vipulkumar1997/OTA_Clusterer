Ulaanbaatar














PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Ulaanbaatar.

Currency:
Tögrög (in T5, T10, T20, T50, T100, T500, T1000, T5000, T10000 and T20000 notes).

Cuisine:
No-nonsense dining – a typical traditional dish is a steaming bowl of stew with meat and dumplings or noodles.

Tipping etiquette:
It’s not expected, but polite to do so.

Saying hello:
Mongolians often greet each other with a warm handshake and the words “sain baina uu”.









WHEN TO GO


Mongolia has something to offer all year round. The event of the summer is the colourful Naadaam Festival, whereas the countryside is at its most beautiful in autumn. Spring and winter are cold and quiet – wrap up warm and explore the capital, Ulaanbaatar, or seek out natural hot springs.






Nomadic Mongolians are famous for their hospitality. Prepare to be welcomed into any ‘ger’ with a small gift to thank your host.
