INTRODUCING LAOS


In this country of infinite smiles, life slows to the soothing pace of the legendary Mekong River. Everything has unspoilt charm – from the mountainous vistas and ancient monasteries, to jungles rustling with elephants and gibbons. Explore pristine French colonial architecture, meander the Mekong while slurping on sundowners, and escape down enchanting streets that simmer with authentic markets, golden temples and French-Asian flavours.






A rich mixture of Indochinese charm and French colonial flair infuses everything – from culture to cuisine.

Luang Prabang














PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Vientiane.

Currency:
Kip (in K500, K1000, K2000, K10000, K20000 and K50000 notes).

Cuisine:
Freshwater fish, pork, chicken and even water buffalo are flavoured with fragrant flavours like lemongrass, coriander leaves and lime juice, and traditionally roasted on an open fire.

Tipping etiquette:
You’re not expected to tip, but it’s appreciated if a service charge hasn’t already been added to your bill.

Saying hello: “
Sabaidee”, with a nod of the head.









WHEN TO GO


From March to September the weather is as warm as the people – ideal for wallowing by your private pool in the day or al fresco fine dining at night, freshened by the odd rain shower. From November to February, it rarely rains and nights are cosy, made for red wine and grand colonial fireplaces at your luxury hotel.






Explore the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Luang Prabang – a sensory urban maze of temples, restaurants and grand architecture.
