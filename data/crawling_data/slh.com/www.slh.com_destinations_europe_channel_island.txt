Introducing The Channel Islands


From adventurers' playgrounds to sleepy rural retreats, few places offer as much variety as the Channel Islands. Seek out the pristine beaches and secluded coves on Herm. Stroll through pretty harbours and discover poignant reminders of the islands' history on Guernsey and Jersey. Embark on a sailing tour around Sark to spot dolphins and colourful puffins. Or experience the old-world beauty of tiny Alderney. Back in Jersey, end the day in style with local, grilled lobster and just-caught oysters in Michelin-starred restaurants. With so many wonders to explore, these island gems are made for luxury escapes.






Bountiful landscapes and captivating coastlines, wrapped up in timeless charm

Practical Information



Currency
: Pound sterling (in £5, £10, £20 and £50 notes). Jersey and Guernsey print their own, but you’ll be able to use English and Scottish notes here too.

Cuisine:
Local produce is the star of island cuisine, from fresh seafood to summer fruits and rich cheeses, with Michelin-starred restaurants and seaside cafés aplenty.

Tipping etiquette:
It’s polite, but not essential to tip in hotels and restaurants. 10-15% is usual.

How to say hello:
English is the official language of Guernsey, so go for ‘hello’. English and French are the official languages of Jersey, so you could also say ‘bonjour’.

Capital city:
The capital of Jersey is St. Helier and the capital of Guernsey is St. Peter Port.










When to go


The charms of the Channel Islands change with the seasons. Summer is a wonderful time for finding a spot on the beach, pottering around historic harbours or setting sail aboard a private yacht. Spring is made for exploring the rugged terrain and watching the wildlife. While the colder months call for crisp seaside strolls followed by evenings in unforgettable restaurants and cosy pubs.






Take a trip out to Herm. This tiny island feels frozen in time, with a sleepy harbour and a patchwork of farms, fringed by white sands.
