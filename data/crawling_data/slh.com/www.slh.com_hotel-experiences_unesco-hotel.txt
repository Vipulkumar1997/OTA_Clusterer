THE WORLD’S GREATEST TREASURES


Step outside and find yourself surrounded by historic grandeur in unforgettable landscapes. With our selection of small, luxury hotels, you’ll be in prime position to discover the world’s most dazzling cultural and natural gems.

You could stay in a contemporary retreat overlooking ancient monuments, or boutique boltholes in the heart of old cities. Escape to a jungle lodge and explore the ruins of lost civilisations. Or seek out the peace and tranquillity of luxury hideaways nestled in nature reserves and national parks.

In each of these exclusive hotels, you’ll find something every bit as memorable as the sights around it.
