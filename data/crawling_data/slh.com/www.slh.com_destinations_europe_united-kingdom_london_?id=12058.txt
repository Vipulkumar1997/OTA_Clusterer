INTRODUCING LONDON


Shop at exclusive designer outlets and illustrious department stores. Catch a show in the West End, or take a river cruise along the Thames. Watch street performers, or stadium sports. Then finish off your day with fine dining in a Michelin starred restaurant, or a pint in a proper pub. London offers a staggering amount to see and do.






Red buses, black ravens, Green Park – London has an enthralling array of colourful sights and world-famous sites.

Things to do


CULTURE

Exhibition Row offers three world-class museums in close proximity. The Victoria and Albert Museum has exceptional fashion and design collections, while the Natural History and Science Museums are firm favourites with children. The Tate Modern on the South Bank of the Thames is a must for modern-art lovers.

FAMILY ACTIVITIES

If your children are fascinated by Princes and Princesses, why not book a trip to Buckingham Palace to see the Royal collections and peek in the State Rooms? Older children will love the grisly London Dungeon Museum too. And Hamley’s Toy Shop is a must for spending pocket money.

NIGHTLIFE

Ministry of Sound, Fabric, Heaven: London is home to some of the world’s most legendary clubs. But if you prefer a quieter or more intimate night you can find plenty of stylish bars where DJs work the turntables. Or stroll along the Thames to see London’s skyline and sites lit up by night.






If you’re hoping to see a West End show but haven’t pre-booked tickets, the booth in Leicester Square offers returns and cut-price seats. Be prepared to queue.
