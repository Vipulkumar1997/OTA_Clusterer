INTRODUCING MALAYSIA


Malaysia is often called the jewel of Asia. It has it all – incredible food, dreamy beach escapes, and fascinating landscape home to even more fascinating wildlife, crumbling remains of its grand colonial past and the skyscrapers of its exhilarating future. Whether you choose a luxury beach resort, mountain spa retreat or sumptuous city break, it’s guaranteed to be priceless.






Colour memories with white sand beaches, golden temples, emerald tea plantations and scintillating cities.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Kuala Lumpur.

Currency:
Ringgit (in RM1, RM5, RM10, RM20, RM50 and RM100 notes).

Cuisine:
Malaysian food is spicy, fragrant and rich. A real treat.

Tipping etiquette:
Tipping is not expected.

Saying hello:
“Selamat pagi” in the morning, “selamat petang” in the evening.









WHEN TO GO


Temperatures in Malaysia hardly vary all year round. Days are hot and balmy, ideal for exploring marine life, mountains, museums or sipping martinis by the pool. Nights are sultry by the sea (low-20s°C) and cosier in the highlands (15°C) – perfect for some spicy, local fine dining. Rain-wise, the odd downpour throughout the year is nothing more than welcome refreshment.






Travel back in time to one of the many colonial tea plantations, home to fine boutique-grown teas and some incredible butterflies.
