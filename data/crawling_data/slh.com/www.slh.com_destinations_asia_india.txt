INTRODUCING INDIA


India’s charms are as varied as they are vibrant. You could head for majestic mountain vistas and dense jungle or white beaches and serene lagoons. Unwind on a country retreat and explore grand palaces and temples. Or take a city break and seek out colourful, spice-laden markets to sample delicious local cuisine.






A dazzling mix of legendary sights and natural beauty, with a bold cultural heritage.

Jaipur














PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
New Delhi.

Currency:
Rupee (in 0, 20, 50, 100 and 500 notes).

Cuisine:
Cumin, cardamom, chilli, turmeric, coriander – India is a world leader when it comes to spices.

Tipping etiquette:
A 10% tip is expected, unless a service charge has been added to your bill.

Saying hello:
“Namaste” with a slight bow of the head.









WHEN TO GO


India has something to offer throughout the year. Winter is the most popular time to visit southern India, but if you’re properly prepared for the weather, monsoon season is quieter, with fewer crowds at main attractions. The northern, mountainous regions attract skiers in the winter and stay pleasantly cool throughout summer.






Gain a personal insight into Indian culture. Join in the fun and prepare to get paint splattered at Holi – the Festival of Colours.
