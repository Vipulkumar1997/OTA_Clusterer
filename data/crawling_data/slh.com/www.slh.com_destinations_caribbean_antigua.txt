INTRODUCING ANTIGUA


With lively barbecues and toe-tapping local music, the Antiguans know how to have a good time. And when the party’s over, they’re experts at relaxing too. With tranquil azure seas and some of the best beaches in the world, it’s no wonder. Sample local fine dining, with glorious seafood and drinks like pineapple straight from the trees. And enjoy the laid-back luxury of your stylish beach resort.






Crystal clear waters reveal spectacular reefs, fringed by powder soft beaches.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
St. John’s.

Currency:
Eastern Caribbean dollar (in 10, 20, 50 and 100 notes).

Cuisine:
Antigua’s traditional dishes often include a variation of seasoned rice and pork, seafood, chicken or lamb.

Tipping etiquette:
It’s not expected and a 10% service charge is usually added to your bill.

Saying hello:
Most people will simply use “hello” although many locals speak Antiguan Creole so you may hear other greetings being used.









WHEN TO GO


If you own a luxury yacht, Antigua is one of the must-visit destinations to see and be seen. Whether you’re showing off your own boat or simply gawping at other people’s, the yacht show is held every December. The climate is warm and welcoming all year round, with the least rain of any Caribbean island, and trade winds blow all year long.






There are plenty of shipwrecks to explore among the reefs. If you’re an experienced diver, head to the south coast and the ledge of Sunken Rock.
