INTRODUCING MOROCCO


From souqs to ski slopes, Morocco is nothing but eclectic. Dive into age-old medinas. Sip mint tea in a café “as time goes by”. Or experience the Berber way of life with a private camel trek in the Atlas Mountains. Then, as night falls, unwind in a hammam at your luxury boutique hotel.






An Aladdin’s cave of sights, sounds and sensations – get lost and find yourself again in magical Morocco.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Rabat.

Currency:
Dirham (in 20, 50, 100, and 200 notes).

Cuisine:
Morocco is the home of the kebab. You’ll also find delicious steam-cooked tajines made with lamb, prunes and almonds.

Tipping etiquette:
Tipping is expected. 10-15% is the norm.

Saying hello:
Use “as-salaamu 'alaykum” and listen to locals to get a feel for the pronunciation.









WHEN TO GO


Whether it’s a luxury city break or relaxing retreat, Morocco can be an all-year-round destination. Spring and autumn tend to be cooler and quieter. In the summer months, dipping into a pool in your Moorish boutique hotel is heavenly. You’ll find ski resorts and thermal spas dotted amongst the Atlas Mountains – which are usually snow-capped from November to April.






Storytelling is a time-honoured art in Morocco. Join a huddle and listen to enchanting tales as the sun sets.
