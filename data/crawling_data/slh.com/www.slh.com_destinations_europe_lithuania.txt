Practical Information


Currency:
Litas (in 10, 20 50, 100, 200 and 500 Lt notes).

Cuisine:
If you’re looking for traditional dishes, try cepelinai (potato parcels stuffed with meat, mushrooms or cheese) and koldunai (boiled or fried dumplings with meat or mushroom filling).

Tipping etiquette:
If you’d like to tip, 10% is usual.

Transport:
Public transport is quick and efficient, but make sure you book your ticket to reserve a seat. Alternatively, it’s easy to hire a bike to get around.









WHEN TO GO


Lithuania has something to offer all year round. Summer is packed with festivals, from folk music to dance, film and theatre. The countryside is at its most colourful in spring and autumn, although be prepared for changeable weather. Winter means snow – wrap up warm and explore a landscape transformed into a glistening wonderland.






Lithuanians love one sport in particular – basketball. During your visit, try and catch a game in the capital, Vilnius.
