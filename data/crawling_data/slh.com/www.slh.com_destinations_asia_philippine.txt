INTRODUCING THE PHILIPPINES


Explore the country’s Spanish-Filipino heritage and tour ancient churches and colonial architecture. Or you could trek to the UNESCO World Heritage Ifugao rice terraces in Banaue. Instead, set off on a snorkelling expedition with whale sharks in South East Luzon. Hop from island to island in the Philippines and wherever you venture you’ll find dramatic landscapes, incredible wildlife and a warm welcome.






Over 7,000 islands backed by jungle, peppered with mountains and fringed with blissful beaches.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Manila.

Currency:
Peso (in P20, P50, P100, P200, P500 and P1000 notes).

Cuisine:
A typical dish might consist of pork, chicken and rice flavoured with tamarind, screwpine (fruit native to the islands) and purple jam.

Tipping etiquette:
A service charge is usually included in your bill, if not a 10% tip is polite, but not expected.

Saying hello:
Most Filipinos speak English, but you could also use the Tagalog “kamusta”.









WHEN TO GO


The tropical climate brings warmth, sunshine and showers to the Philippines. Many flock here for the sandy white beaches that skirt the islands – perfect on a warm day. Others come to trek the dramatic mountainous landscape in the cooler air. And visitors often time their travels around the country’s many festivals – like Ati-Atihan in January.






Kayak through the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River, an underground waterway that stretches over five miles beneath limestone caves, for an unforgettable experience.
