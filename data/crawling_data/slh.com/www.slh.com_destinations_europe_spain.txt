INTRODUCING SPAIN


There’s more to Spain than just sun, azure seas, and ice-cold sangria. Escape to a private retreat in wild Mediterranean woodland. Indulge in a luxury spa treatment in a Moorish style boutique hotel. Discover the tranquil side of the ‘party’ islands as you nibble on authentic Andalucían tapas. Expect the unexpected at every turn – whether it’s the surreal, Art Nouveau creations of Antoni Gaudí or skiing down the Spanish Pyrenees.






Be seduced by the flair, passion and luxury that is Spain: from laid-back beaches to lively cities.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
The home of tapas, ideal for sharing. Expect to find little plates of olives, meatballs, calamari, chorizo, and tortillas.

Tipping etiquette:
A service charge is usually included in your bill.

Transport:
To have the most freedom, rent your own car and explore.









WHEN TO GO


Spain has almost as many different climates as it does cultural traditions. Summer sees the Mediterranean south bask in warm, subtropical weather. In marked contrast, places like Madrid, up in the central plains, get hot in summer, but are cool and calm in winter – ideal for shopping or browsing art galleries. So you can look forward to a relaxing beach holiday or tranquil city break whichever time of year you visit.






Fiestas are a great chance to see Spain at its most vibrant – these festivities are held to mark events like the Rioja or tomato harvest.
