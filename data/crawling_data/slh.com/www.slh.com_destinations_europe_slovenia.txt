INTRODUCING SLOVENIA


Slovenia’s compact size makes it easy to experience a myriad of cultural and natural masterpieces – all in one day. At the chic capital, Ljubljana, you can stroll through 5,000 years of history – from hillside castles and Venetian style churches to the awe-inspiring architecture of Jože Plečnik. Or hike around Lake Bled with its own magical island, explore the world’s largest karstic caves, and spy brown bears deep in the forest.






Nestled between the Alps and the Adriatic coast, Slovenia is wonderful mix of Mediterranean beaches, mountains and meadows.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
Look out for traditional dishes: žlikrofi, (ravioli filled with potato, onion and bacon) and žganci (a buckwheat or maize porridge often served with sauerkraut).

Tipping etiquette:
Although tipping is not obligatory, it is polite to round bills up.

Transport:
If you fancy getting behind the wheel (or handle bars) Slovenia is a great place to explore by hire car or bike.









WHEN TO GO


The Slovenian climate varies across its regions. The northwest mountains have warmish summers followed by snowy winters when skiing, snowboarding and ice-climbing are at their best. There’s a more Mediterranean feel near the coast, with a reliably hot and sunny August ensuring all the sights and festivals are open. Spring and autumn make the countryside particularly colourful – the perfect seasons for river rafting and visiting a vineyard or two.






Slovenia boasts one of the world's oldest philharmonics with thousands of concerts held every year.
