INTRODUCING ASIA


The land of ancient cultures and dreamlike scenery, with buzzing cities and all-to-yourself beaches. The only limit to an escape to Asia is your imagination. In Thailand, golden temples and colourful markets beckon you away from white sands and calm, clear seas. China and Japan offer the chance to discover time-honoured customs and spellbinding views from your luxury boutique hotel. While Malaysia and Indonesia have towering rainforests brimming with wildlife and coral reefs beneath the waves – heaven for explorers.






A bright and brilliant tapestry of inspiring cultures, ancient heritage and captivating natural beauty – embark on your very own eastern adventure

Highlights


BEACH
Find your own piece of paradise in Thailand, a country with beaches that must be seen to be believed. Spend days relaxing on the shore – perhaps with a traditional massage – or take a diving tour to discover magical underwater caves. In Indonesia, white sands are fringed with lush mangroves and rainforests, where you can watch tropical birds flit through the trees. While in the Philippines and Malaysia, pop on a snorkel to watch jewel-bright fish dart about the coral reef.

CITY BREAK
No two city breaks in Asia are the same. You could find yourself strolling between futuristic skyscrapers in Singapore, or sailing along the bay in Hong Kong. A luxury break in Malaysia might see you shopping in designer boutiques, then delving into the labyrinth-like passageways of Kuala Lumpur’s night markets. Or you could dive into urban life in China and Japan, where cities like Beijing and Tokyo never stand still. In Thailand, simply soak up the culture in peaceful Chiang Mai, or go in search of authentic Thai cuisine in Bangkok.

CULTURE
Asia encompasses a myriad of cultures, with a history stretching back over thousands of years. Thailand is famed for its beautiful temples filled with golden Buddha statues, while in Cambodia you’ll find lost cities, immersed in the jungle. China is a treasure trove of historic landmarks, from awe-inspiring imperial palaces to perfectly preserved medieval water towns. Across the continent, age old-customs are kept alive. Whether in tea ceremonies in Japan, vibrant festivals in India, or lively feasts in Indonesia – the perfect way to experience traditional music and dance.
