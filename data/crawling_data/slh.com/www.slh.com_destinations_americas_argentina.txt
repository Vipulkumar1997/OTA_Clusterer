INTRODUCING ARGENTINA


As seductive as a tango, as exhilarating as the fútbol, Argentina is a land of thrilling contrasts. Savour steak with a smooth glass of Malbec. Spot wildlife in the wilds of Patagonia. Or discover end-of-the-world luxury in Ushuaia’s boutique hotel.






An alluring blend of fine wines, vibrant cities and spectacular natural wonders.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Buenos Aires.

Currency:
Peso, (in $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 notes).

Cuisine:
Fire up the barbeque – enjoy steak, ribs or chorizo with chimichurri (a traditional herb, garlic and vinegar sauce).

Tipping etiquette:
It’s not essential, but it’s polite to tip. 10% is the minimum.

Saying hello:
For a formal greeting, use “buenos dias”. Or, simply “hola” or “buen dia”.









WHEN TO GO


Argentina is such a diverse country that there’s something happening in every season. As Argentina is in the southern hemisphere the seasons are reversed – so summers (December-February) are warm, while winters (May-August) can be cold. In the spring and autumn, Buenos Aires is alive with festivals and generally cooler. The summer is a great time to explore Patagonia on foot while, in the winter, there’s a unique, wild feel – as well as some excellent skiing. And the Lake District looks beautiful all year round, but particularly colourful in the autumn.






Order a ‘parrillada’ (mixed grill) to experience the Argentinian obsession with meat in all its glory.
