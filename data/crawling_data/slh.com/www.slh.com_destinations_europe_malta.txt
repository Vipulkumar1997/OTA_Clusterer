INTRODUCING MALTA


Embark on a luxury break to Malta and you’ll discover an island with a unique personality and dramatic heritage. Behind centuries-old city walls are historic churches and palaces full of baroque masterpieces. Ancient temples take you back in time. While hilltop fortresses tell stories of campaigns and conquests. And framing it all are hidden coves and crystal clear waters.






A mosaic of vibrant culture, ancient history and spellbinding scenery.

Practical information]

Valletta.










When to go


Malta has many charms to discover throughout the year. Summer months bring blazing sunshine – a wonderful time to sit back on the beach or cool off in the sea. Spring and autumn are slightly cooler, making this the ideal time to discover the coast and countryside on a more active holiday. While the winter months are perfect for exploring museums and temples without the crowds.






Some of Malta’s treasures lie beneath the waves. Snorkel over atmospheric shipwrecks, or dive to astounding underwater caves.
