UNPARALLELED WATERSIDE ESCAPES


From mystical pools deep in the jungle to shimmering mountain lakes, you needn’t head to the sea to find a waterside paradise. Our collection of lake and waterfront hotels are perched on some of the world’s most beautiful shores.

Admire the gorgeous sight of pristine lakes sparkling with starlight. Sit back on your balcony as you watch boats sail along famous waterways. Relax by the cooling waters of a river winding through the desert, or revel in the canal-side sophistication of a city centre escape.

All our boutique hotels pair the finest luxury experiences with enviable locations. But with each offering something different, which waterside retreat will you choose?
