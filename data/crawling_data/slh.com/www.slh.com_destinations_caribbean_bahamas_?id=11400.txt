INTRODUCING THE BAHAMAS


With 700 islands and an array of stunning beaches, the Bahamas are all about the sea. Whether you want to venture from isle to isle via yacht or kayak, dive into deep blue pools, or perhaps even get up close to a shark, you’ll be close to water all your time here. And if you’d like to truly escape, go beyond Nassau to the ‘Out Islands’.






Swim with dolphins, dance to Calypso rhythms, snorkel in crystal clear waters, or hop from paradise to paradise.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Nassau.

Currency:
The Bahamian dollar (in B$1, B$5, B$10, B$20, B$50 and B$1oo notes).

Cuisine:
Typically you’ll find seafood and steaks served with plantain, rice, fries, potatoes or Johnny Cake – pan-cooked bread make with butter and milk.

Tipping etiquette:
A 15% tip is usual.

Saying hello:
Most people will speak English, so say “hello”. You may also hear locals greeting one another in Bahamian Dialect.









WHEN TO GO


If you’re here in the winter months, the thrilling cacophony known as Junkanoo is a street party unlike any other, held on December 26
th
and January 1
st
each year. But there’s plenty to see year round in Bahamas. With temperatures consistently at 80
°
F all year round, the seas are always warm, and the weather always welcoming.






Although English is the official language of the Bahamas, locals use their own slang on the outlying islands.
