INTRODUCING THE NETHERLANDS


There’s more to the Netherlands than meets the eye. Immerse yourself in culture on a city break – discover famous Old Masters and modern art, quaint canal-side buildings and cutting-edge architecture. Or savour the peace and quiet on a country retreat and explore historic castles and tranquil green countryside.






Take life at a more leisurely pace in a land of cool cities and flat yet fascinating countryside.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
The staples of Dutch cuisine are high in protein: steak, chicken in fish. You’ll also find steaming bowls of soup and stew – great, hearty grub.

Tipping etiquette:
It’s not essential to tip as a service charge is added to your bill, but a little extra is always welcomed.

Transport:
Journeys by rail, car or bus tend to be swift and hassle-free. Cycling is part of the country’s culture – with flat roads and striking scenery, is it any wonder?









WHEN TO GO


There’s something to see and do in the Netherlands, whatever the season. Summer is the perfect time to unwind and sip a drink in a pavement café. Autumn is usually quieter, and spring is when you’ll see the famous tulips in bloom. The cool winters are a great excuse to cosy up in a traditional pub or explore attractions without the crowds.






Cycling is one of the best ways to see the Netherlands. Hire a bike to tour cities and reach tucked-away treasures in the countryside.
