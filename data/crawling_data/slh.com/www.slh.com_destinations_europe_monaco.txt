Introducing Monaco


Monaco was made for living the high life. Discover exotic gardens or embrace the glitz and glamour of the casinos from your boutique hotel. Savour fine cuisine and explore grand palaces, cathedrals and sun-soaked harbours. Or head for the mountain heights for panoramic views across the ocean.






A luxurious playground by the sparkling sea,
set against a majestic mountain backdrop.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
Fresh seafood dominates the menus in coastal Monaco. Looking for fine dining? You’ll be spoilt for choice.

Tipping etiquette:
Bills tend to include a service charge.

Transport:
You can get around by car and rail – or take to the water like a true jetsetter.









WHEN TO GO


Monaco never stands still. Spring and autumn are pleasantly warm and a little quieter than high season – with the exception of the Grand Prix. Summer is the most lively time to visit, with a full calendar of festivals. Winter also has its fair share of special events, and is a wonderful time to explore the boutiques and galleries of Monte Carlo.






Monaco has many delicacies inspired by the cuisine of neighbouring countries. Try barbagiuan – pastry stuffed with Swiss chard and spinach.
