INTRODUCING ICELAND


Home of snowy vistas and black-sand beaches, literary legends and a thriving contemporary art scene. The place to sink into geothermal lagoon spas, snowmobile across a lunar-like glacier, dive between tectonic plates or scramble behind Tolkien-esque waterfalls. Iceland is quite simply like nowhere else on earth.






Spellbinding, heart-snaring scenery in this land of ice and fire.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION



Capital city:
Reykjavik.

Currency: Icelandic
Krona (in kr500, kr1000, kr2000, kr5000 and kr10,000 notes).

Cuisine:
The Arctic seas mean fresh seafood is top of most menus in Iceland’s increasingly inventive restaurants. For breakfast try yoghurt-like Skyr, have gourmet hot dogs for snacks, and warming lamb stews at dinner.

Tipping etiquette:
Not always expected, tips are nonetheless often appreciated in Iceland.

Saying hello:
Similar in some ways to English, Icelanders say “Halló”.










WHEN TO GO


If you’re picturing snowy adventures and long nights looking up for the Northern Lights, visit Iceland when it’s cold – between October and April. June to August brings all-day light, easier driving and lots of hiking opportunities. If you’d like a quiet getaway, try in between these two seasons. Your best chance of seeing puffins and whales will be during Iceland’s spring and summer.






Once you’ve seen Gullfoss near Reykjavik, escape northeast to Vatnajökull National Park and what’s said to be Europe’s most powerful waterfall – the mighty Dettifoss.
