INTRODUCING SWITZERLAND


Switzerland may be world-famous for its chocolate, cheese, and cuckoo clocks. But look beyond the age-old clichés and there’s even more to discover. Discover the beauty of Mont Blanc and the glamorous, luxury ski resorts. Gaze at the magical 13th-century Château de Chillon reflected on Lake Geneva. Embark on a train ride through deep alpine valleys. Or indulge in some chic, boutique shopping and fine dining in cities as impressive as the surrounding landscape.






Artists, poets and royalty have all been inspired by Switzerland’s majestic scenery.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Swiss franc (in Fr.10, Fr.20, Fr.50, Fr.100, Fr.200 notes).

Cuisine:
Look out for this trio of national classics: fondue, raclette (molten cheese over potatoes and pickles) and rösti.

Tipping etiquette:
It’s not customary to tip, but you can always round up your bill to the nearest franc.

Transport:
Trains are scenic, hassle-free, and buses take over when the rails run out.









WHEN TO GO


June to September is the perfect time to enjoy a warm, sunny break in the cities, or explore the pinewoods and wildflower-filled valleys by foot or on bike. From the middle of December to April the snow in the resorts is at its deepest and best for skiing. But even in summer, it’s still possible to whiz down glaciers in places such as Zermatt – famous for its challenging runs. Off the slopes during winter, you could also try ice skating, curling or a thrilling sleigh ride.






The Swiss are renowned for being formal and friendly. Expect a grüezi (hello) greeting when passing someone in the street – and always on a hiking trail.
