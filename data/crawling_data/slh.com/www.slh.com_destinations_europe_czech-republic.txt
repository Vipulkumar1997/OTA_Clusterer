INTRODUCING THE CZECH REPUBLIC


The Czech Republic invented the word ‘Bohemian’, so it’s no surprise that this small country has more than its fair share of style and luxury. Venture beyond historic Prague and you’ll find romantic castles, baroque towns, elegant country retreats and – outside Karlovy Vary – one of the country’s most exclusive thermal spas. And, as night falls, graze on pretzels and sausages, all washed down by a chilled pint of Pilsner.






From beer to Bohemia, the Czech Republic combines romance and revelry like nowhere else in the world.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Czech crown, or koruna česká (in 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 korun notes).

Cuisine:
Enjoy Czech staples like roast duck, beef in a creamy sauce and pork stew. Or dig into something sweeter like strudel, fruit dumplings or crêpes.

Tipping etiquette:
A 10% tip is typical in most places.

Transport:
With one of the most comprehensive rail networks in Europe you can rely on trains to get from A to B. Or, for something a little different, cycling is a popular way to get around – you can hire bikes from most major cities and some smaller towns.









WHEN TO GO


Nestled in the middle of Europe, the Czech Republic has a continental climate with hot summers and crisp, cool winters. In the spring, the countryside’s wildflowers and fruit trees bloom. With much of the land heavily forested, autumn is a great time for colourful displays of foliage. And, while the winters can be dark and cold, they are perfect for hearty Czech food, cosy pubs and glittering festive markets.






Often overlooked, the Czech Republic’s wine is one of Europe’s best-kept secrets. Try a glass of Bohemian or Moravian wine to appreciate the rich, spicy flavours.
