INTRODUCING the USA


The USA is as varied as it is vast. You could bask in the bright lights of one of the world’s great cities or stargaze in the great outdoors. Embark on a road trip through wine country or find yourself in a private spa retreat. It’s a country with enough A-list sights to fill the biggest Hollywood blockbuster, but still has a down-to-earth charm that you can’t help but fall for. And, when it comes to luxury hotels, America remains one of the world’s big hitters.






From the Wild West to the Easy Going East, city breaks to country retreats… the USA offers a world of experiences.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Washington, D.C.

Currency:
US dollar (in $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 notes).

Cuisine:
Every state offers its own specialities and it’s not all fast food either.Home to a world of international cuisines, and with some diners open around the clock, you can eat what you want, when you want.

Tipping etiquette:
Tipping is expected. 15-20% is the norm.

Saying hello:
Just say “hi”.









WHEN TO GO


The USA is a year-round destination and when (and where) you go depends on whether you fancy skiing, surfing or just lazing in a spa. Generally speaking, the North tends to be warm in the summer, but can be cold and cosy in winter. The South is generally warm throughout the year, with milder winters and sweltering summers. The spring and autumn can be the most spectacular time to visit, with beautiful wildflowers and fall colours in many regions. Of course, Hawaii and the national parks have their own microclimate, so talk to your luxury hotel concierge for insider tips on what to expect.






From fine wines to fine dining, hot dogs to cool beers, America is a foodie’s dream come true. To sample the freshest flavours, visit one of the many food festivals throughout the different states.
