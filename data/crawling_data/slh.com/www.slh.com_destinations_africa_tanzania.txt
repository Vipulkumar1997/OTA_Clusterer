INTRODUCING TANZANIA


Wilderness meets luxury in exotic Tanzania. Take to the skies in a private hot air balloon for the ultimate view of lions and cheetahs on the hunt. Relax in a tented camp and look out for the legendary lovebird. Or escape to a suite overlooking azure waters in one of Zanzibar’s luxury beach resorts. For a taste of the old Tanzania, take to Stone Town’s ancient streets and explore Sultan’s palaces and colourful spice stalls.






From the Serengeti to the ‘Spice Island’, Tanzania is the definitive explorer’s paradise.

Zanzibar














PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Dodoma.

Currency:
Tanzanian shilling (in Tsh500, Tsh1000, Tsh5000, Tsh10,000 notes).

Cuisine:
Tanzanian cuisine uses a blend of spices and coconut. You’ll find rice, bread, grilled meat, fish and fresh vegetables.

Tipping etiquette:
Tipping is expected. 10% is the norm.

Saying hello:
Both English and Bantu Swahili are spoken, so say “hello” or “hujambo”.









WHEN TO GO


With a year-round tropical climate, Tanzania is a country for all seasons. There’s excellent game viewing in most months – but, if you want to watch the migrating wildebeest head to the Serengeti between November and July. The rainy seasons are generally March to May and November when the landscape turns emerald green. In contrast, December to March are the warmest months and the landscape’s at its most arid.






If you can tear yourself away from Zanzibar’s pristine white beaches, take in the aromas of cinnamon, cloves and vanilla on a plantation spice tour
