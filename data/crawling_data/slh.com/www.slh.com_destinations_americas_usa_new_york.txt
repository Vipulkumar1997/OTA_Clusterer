INTRODUCING NEW YORK CITY


Iconic landmarks; trend-setting boutiques; groundbreaking theatre; and some of the world’s top fine dining. New York City may be ‘The Big Apple’, but the truth is that it’s more like an onion with layer upon layer of cool culture to unearth. From the metropolis of Midtown to hip Greenwich Village, the cultural hub of Tribeca to the streets of Harlem, there’s something to satisfy every city break traveller. You’ll quickly get in a New York state of mind.






As edgy as it is elegant, Manhattan is an intoxicating mix of sights, sounds and sensations.

Things to do


LANDMARKS

The Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty and Times Square are high on most visitors’ ‘to do’ lists. But don’t miss the sprawling Central Park – look out for Strawberry Fields, a touching homage to John Lennon who lived nearby. Or escape from the bustling streets for a moment of calm and creativity in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, MoMA, or the Guggenheim.

SHOPPING

Follow in the footsteps of Holly Golightly and admire the diamonds in Tiffany on Fifth Avenue. Hop over to West 54
th
Street and you’ll find Carrie Bradshaw’s favourite – Manolo Blahnik. Or give the credit card a rest and dive into the boutique vintage stores of East Village. It’s easy to see why New York has become a fashion mecca.

NIGHTLIFE

They call it the city that never sleeps. And with everything from plays and musicals to performance poetry and jazz to enjoy, it’s easy to see why. Book tickets to a show on Broadway. Sip Manhattan cocktails in the chic bars of Soho. Or party into the early hours in one of the Meatpacking District’s über-cool clubs. Speak to the concierge in your luxury hotel for the lowdown on what’s happening where and when.






Get a fresh perspective on New York from the High Line. This public park is set up high on an old railway track and skirts the city.
