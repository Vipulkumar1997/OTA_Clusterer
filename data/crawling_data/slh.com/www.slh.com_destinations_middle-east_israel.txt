INTRODUCING ISRAEL


From the majestic plateau of the Golan Heights to the shores of the Red Sea, Israel is filled with natural wonders and breathtaking beauty. Travel to cities like Jerusalem that are steeped in history, or spend time in lively Tel Aviv. There’s always time to sit back and watch the world go by, thanks to Israel’s café culture.






The cradle of so many civilisations and histories, the Holy Land wears its ancient past on its sleeve, but offers plenty of contemporary enjoyment too.

Tel Aviv














PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Jerusalem.

Currency:
Israeli new shekel (in 20, 50, 100 and 200 notes).

Cuisine:
Influences come from Moroccan, Arabic and Middle Eastern cooking. Remember, most Israeli food is kosher and is cooked in accordance with Jewish Halkha.

Tipping etiquette:
If you’d like to tip, 10-15% is the norm.

Saying hello:
Both Hebrew and Arabic are spoken in Israel, so use either “shalom” or “as-salamu 'alaykum”.









WHEN TO GO


The hot summer months are the perfect time to escape here and take a dip to cool off in the Mediterranean. Of course, many people choose to travel here for the winter months and experience Christmas in the Holy Land. Early spring is a magical time, when the lush vegetation springs to life after the winter rains.






The markets are well worth a visit. Ask for a Tax Refund Invoice at any shop showing a Ministry of Tourism sign, and hand it in at the airport for your VAT refund.
