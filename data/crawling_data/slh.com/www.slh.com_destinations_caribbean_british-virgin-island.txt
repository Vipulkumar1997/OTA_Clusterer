INTRODUCING THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS


The very best in beach resorts, the British Virgin Islands are the epitome of tropical paradise. With so many beaches and so few people, you’re sure to find your own secluded spot. This is a sailor’s heaven too, with lots of boats waiting to be chartered, and plenty of islands to explore (over 60, to be exact).






Lounge in a palm-shaded hammock, stroll acres of untouched sand or dive into warm, welcoming water.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Road Town.

Currency:
US dollar (in $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 notes).

Cuisine:
Spicy and hearty – putting a tropical spin on North American dishes, as well as offering local cuisine.

Tipping etiquette:
A 15-20% is often welcomed.

Saying hello:
People speak a combination of local dialects, Spanish and English, but “hello” will be understood almost everywhere.









WHEN TO GO


Temperatures are warm all year round, and although there’s officially a rainy season many visitors leave the islands never having seen a drop of rain. If you’re in the British Virgin Islands in July, make sure to catch the HiHo windsurfing race.






If you’d like to come home with some truly authentic island gifts, look out for crocheted souvenirs, straw hats and rum. You can find them all at Tortola market.
