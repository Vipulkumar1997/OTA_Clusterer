INTRODUCING SWEDEN


In a country as vast as Sweden getting away from it all is easy. After a reviving log cabin sauna, take a dip (skinny style is fine) in a crystal-clear lake surrounded by forests of spruce and birch. Wend your way in a canoe around the many islands that make up the Stockholm archipelago. Then relax with a coffee in this cosmopolitan, yet serene city – where elegant museums and vintage stores rub shoulders with cutting-edge design.






From the land of the midnight sun comes a smorgasbord of natural treats and must-see sights.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Krona (in 20kr, 50kr, 100kr, 500kr, 1000kr notes).

Cuisine:
Delicious variations of meat, fish and potatoes. And for a more unusual speciality – reindeer, elk meat and wild berries.

Tipping etiquette:
While not expected it’s polite to round the bill up to the nearest 20kr or so.

Transport:
Travelling by train is quick and efficient. If you’re hiring a car, traffic jams are extremely rare – just keep an eye out for deer, elk and reindeer as you go.









WHEN TO GO


Spring is when Swedish festivals and revelries get into full swing with open-air picnics and parties under the midnight sun. Swedish summers will remind you of southern Britain – only with more hours of daylight to get out into the pure, fresh air, pick wild blueberries and enjoy a spot of salmon fishing or hiking. While the south generally experiences milder winters, in northern Sweden, October is the time to put on your ski boots as the snow starts falling by the bucket-load – promising fantastic skiing well into April.






Sample a Swedish-style open sandwich – the smörgås dates back to the 1400s when thick slabs of bread were used as plates.
