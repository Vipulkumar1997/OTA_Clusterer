INTRODUCING BRAZIL


From Christ the Redeemer to Iguaçu Falls, the Amazon to Carnaval, Brazil is home to some of the world’s biggest, boldest and most beloved sights. Discover lush rainforest and tropical wildlife, sublime coastline and some of the world’s greatest cities. Immerse yourself in the spirit of South America, or get away from it all on a secluded Bahia beach. Then return to your luxury hotel with stories to tell and photos to share.






Brazil is a kaleidoscopic country: a dizzying mix of wildlife and cool culture where everything seems more vivid and vivacious.

Santo André














Practical information


Capital city:
Brasília.

Currency:
Real (in R$5, R$10, R$20, R$50 and R$100 notes).

Cuisine:
Try
feijoada
– hearty black bean stew – or experience authentic Brazilian barbecue and seek out
churrasco.

Saying hello:
“Olá” – or, when speaking to friends, locals say “oi”.

Shopping:
Treat yourself to jewellery made from colourful gemstones, or seek out traditional crafts like carved masks and woven hammocks.













When to go


With buzzing cities, deep rainforest and vibrant coastal villages to choose from, deciding when to visit Brazil is down to what you want to see. In the cooler months, the Amazon is a wildlife spotter’s paradise. There’s never a bad time to be on the coast, but April to December are particularly lovely. And if you’re coming for
Carnaval
, over Easter or in July – a month of school holidays in many areas – be sure to plan ahead.






Take a Jorge Amado book with you to Brazil. Born in Bahia, he’s celebrated across the country as a master storyteller, with tales bound up in Brazilian culture.
