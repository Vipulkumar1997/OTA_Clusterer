INTRODUCING NICARAGUA


Like the volcanoes that dot the horizon, Nicaragua is a sleeping giant. A potent blend of elegant colonial architecture and pristine rainforest, it’s just waiting to be discovered. You could escape to a beach resort or embark on a jungle adventure. Play golf as parakeets flit by or relax in a spa and savour the finer things in life. Welcome to Central America’s best-kept secret.






Off-the-beaten track but on every traveller’s wish list, Nicaragua is a mix of rugged beauty and boutique luxury.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION



Currency:
Córdoba (in C$10, C$20, C$50, C$100, C$200 and C$500 notes).

Public holidays:
14 and 15 September, 2 November, 8 and 25 December, 1 January, 2 April, 1 May, 19 July.

Cuisine:
Serving up something soulful – beans, rice, chicken, beef and pork are some of the staples.

Tipping etiquette:
It’s not expected, but it’s polite to leave a 10-15% tip.

Transport:
Renting a car is the best way to explore the sights and travel from one beach to the next.










WHEN TO GO


Like much of Central America, Nicaragua is defined by two seasons. The summer (December to April) is when the country is at its warmest and driest. The winter (May to November) is known as the ‘rainy season’, but along the coast this is often just a short, sharp downpour in the afternoon. It’s also one of the quietest times to visit and – if you’re lucky – you could have the beach all to yourself.






The coast of Nicaragua is a breeding ground for humpback whales and one of the best places to see these incredible creatures at play.
