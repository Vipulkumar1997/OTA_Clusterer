INTRODUCING CYPRUS


Blending Roman history and contemporary style, Aphrodite’s island has plenty to entice the curious traveller. Head off the beaten track and into sleepy villages, peppered with olive trees and citrus groves. Water babies will love the clear seas around Cyprus’ luxury beach resorts, where aged shipwrecks lie waiting to be discovered. Feasting on grilled halloumi and herby lamb dishes at a nearby harbour is a must.






From tavernas to temples, beaches to blue seas, this small island has a great deal going on.

Practical Information


Currency:
In the south the euro is used (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes). If you travel north, the Turkish lira is the official currency, though euros, pounds sterling and US dollars are often accepted.

Cuisine:
Dine on fresh fish and grilled meats, flavoured with aromatic herbs – all with a large helping of warm Cypriot hospitality.

Tipping etiquette:
A service charge of 10% will usually be added to your bill, but if not you can add it yourself.

Transport:
Hire your own car or book a private tour to make the most of Cyprus’ many sights.









When to Go


In the summer months – particularly June to September – Cyprus is at its most popular with warm weather and buzzing beaches. You’ll find a cooler, quieter island in autumn and spring, when colourful wildflowers bloom and the landscape is vibrant – perfect for exploring on foot or by bike. Many flock to the country in winter when you can ski alongside the Gods on Mount Olympus.






Cypriot crafts make excellent mementos – pick up local silver trinkets, linens made with Lefkara lace and soft leather goods.
