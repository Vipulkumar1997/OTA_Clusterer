INTRODUCING TAIWAN


It’s not for nothing that Taiwan is known as the ‘Beautiful Isle’. Step out from your luxury hotel and you’ll find precipitous tree-lined gorges, cliffs plunging into the ocean, tall mountain peaks and traditional temples. The food is an intoxicating blend of Chinese and Japanese cuisines, creating something totally unique. And while you’re here you simply have to visit a natural hot spring for an open-air spa experience.






Jostling cities, looming mountains and lush green forests – there’s so much to explore.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
New Taiwan dollar (in 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 notes).

Cuisine:
There are a huge variety of styles and flavours, but a typical Taiwanese dish may include a mixture of pork, noodles and usually egg or shrimp.

Tipping etiquette:
Tipping is not customary, but often welcomed.

Transport:
Driving your own car is great outside the cities, or why not book a private tour?









WHEN TO GO


Summers can be hot and humid, while the winters can have colder temperatures, although they don’t dip below freezing unless you’re in the mountains. Typhoons sometimes hit the eastern coast of the island. If you’re here in February you’ll see the Chinese New Year celebrations, while during the Mid-Autumn Festival, revellers eat mooncakes and lanterns light up the skies.






The Japanese brought baseball to Taiwan and the island has since become addicted. Watching a game is a great way to see the locals enjoying what they love best.
