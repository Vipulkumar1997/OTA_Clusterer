INTRODUCING ECUADOR


Ecuador may be relatively small, but it’s filled with enough sights to revive even the most jaded traveller. There are spectacular mountains housing traditional villages, dense jungle with staggering biodiversity, and – the jewel in the crown – the world-famous Galapagos Islands. If you’ve had your fill of natural wonders, you could explore Ecuador’s more quirky side: straddle the equator in Quito, seek out weird and wonderful souvenirs at Otavalo Market or luxuriate in a warm mud bath at Salinas spa.






Teeming rainforests, sleeping volcanoes, lively markets – find paradise at the centre of the earth.

Galapagos Islands














PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Capital city:
Quito.

Currency:
US dollar (in $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 notes)

Cuisine:
You’ll find dishes like
cuadorian ceviche
, a traditional meal of seafood in a lemon and tomato sauce.

Tipping etiquette:
Many restaurants will add a service charge to your bill.

Saying hello:
Ten native languages are spoken across the country, but all Ecuadorians will understand “hola”.









WHEN TO GO


Sitting in the tropics, Ecuador is a year-round destination with two distinct seasons: wet and dry. These vary depending on the region you visit. In the Galapagos you can see the wildlife at any time, but January to May are when the islands are at their warmest and busiest. From June to December, the islands are generally cooler, but also quieter. On the mainland, most people visit during the traditional holiday seasons, so make sure you book your luxury hotel well in advance.






The Galapagos is a photographer’s paradise, so make sure you pack plenty of memory cards to capture those unforgettable moments.
