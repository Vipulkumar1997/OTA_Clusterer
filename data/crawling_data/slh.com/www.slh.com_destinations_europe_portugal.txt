INTRODUCING PORTUGAL


Like the drink that bears its name, Portugal is best savoured slowly. In the north you’ll find remote country retreats, the vineyard-dotted slopes of the Douro Valley and the UNESCO world-heritage site of Oporto. As you head south, there are historic cities such as Coimbra and Lisbon to discover, as well as lesser-known gems hidden in the countryside. Finally, you reach the sun-strewn Algarve with its African influences, world-class golf and spas.






An intoxicating blend of fine dining and sightseeing, historic charm and catwalk cool.

PRACTICAL INFORMATION


Currency:
Euro (in €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200 and €500 notes).

Cuisine:
The home of piri-piri chicken. Olive oil, garlic, coriander and parsley are key flavours in traditional dishes.

Tipping etiquette:
Bills often include a service charge, but a 5-10% tip is the norm.

Transport:
For a quick and easy way to get around Portugal, hiring your own car is the best way to go.









WHEN TO GO


Portugal is known for its summer sunshine when its beaches and al fresco restaurants are at their most inviting. But away from prime tourist season there’s still plenty to see and do. In the spring, wildflowers and almond blossom burst into life. In the autumn, the cooler weather is ideal for exploring historic sights. And, while the winter can be rainy, it’s a great time to experience the festive celebrations and cosy up with a glass of something special.






A visit to Portugal wouldn’t be complete without a Pastel de Nata. But, be warned, these little custard tarts can become highly addictive.
