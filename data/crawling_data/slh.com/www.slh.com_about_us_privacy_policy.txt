SLH Privacy Policy










Small Luxury Hotels of the World ("SLH") Privacy Policy


SLH understands the importance of your privacy and respect that you want to safeguard the use to which your personal information is put. Consequently, we make it a high priority to ensure that your personal information (including credit card details) remains secure and confidential and is used only for the intended purpose. In this privacy policy we explain how we collect data about you and the nature of that data, how we use that data, who that data may be sent to and how you can amend data you have submitted to us.

Our privacy policy applies to our web-site (www.slh.com or any other web page or web-site with the SLH branding) and to personal information supplied over the telephone, by e-mail or letter.

The data we collect and how we collect it

We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information: • your first and last name, telephone number, postal and e-mail address, fax number; • information about your computer and about your visits to and use of our web-site including your IP address, geographical location, browser type and version, operating system, referral source, length of visit, page views and web-site navigation; • if you make a reservation or purchase any items using a credit or debit card then we need the card number, cardholder name, expiry date and CVV number; • your hotel preferences and travel experiences.

We may ask you for personal information in a variety of circumstances, for instance: • when you make a hotel reservation or purchase something from our web-site or on the telephone or by e-mail, letter or fax; • when you register with us, subscribe to our newsletter, enter competitions or register for promotions; or • when you join the SLH loyalty programme, INVITED; or • when you take part in surveys or provide us with feedback.

Telephone calls to and from our office or reservation service may be recorded or monitored for the purpose of quality control and for staff training. Call recordings will be maintained as long as reasonably necessary and will then be deleted. Any personal information obtained from you during the call will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this privacy policy.

Our use of "cookies"

To make SLH work even better for you, we also use 'cookies' to collect information about your use of the web-site. Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to temporarily store information within your browser, which in turn allows us to recognise the computer used to access SLH.
Read our Cookies Policy

Using your personal information

Personal information submitted to SLH via the web-site will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.
SLH may use your personal information to: (a) administer the web-site; (b) improve your browsing experience by personalising the web-site; (c) enable your use of the services available on the web-site; (d) send you goods purchased via the web-site and/or supply you with services purchased via the web-site; (e) send statements and invoices to you and process payments; (f) track your use of the reservation process and contact you once via email regarding your experience; (g) send you general (non-marketing) commercial communications; (h) send you e-mail notifications which you have specifically requested; (i) send you marketing communications relating to our business or the businesses of carefully selected third parties which we think may be of interest to you by post or, where you have specifically agreed to this, by e-mail or similar technology (you can inform us at any time if you no longer require marketing communications); (j) provide third parties with statistical information about our users but this information will not be used to identify any individual user; (k) deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the web-site.
Where you submit personal information for publication on the web-site, SLH will publish and otherwise use that information in accordance with the license you grant to us.

SLH will not, without your express consent, provide your personal information to any third parties for the purpose of direct marketing.
Disclosures of information
SLH may disclose information about you to any of our employees, officers, agents, suppliers or sub-contractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes as set out in this privacy policy.

In addition, SLH may disclose your personal information: (a) to the extent that it is required to do so by law; (b) in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings; (c) in order to establish, exercise or defend its legal rights (including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk); (d) to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset which it is (or are contemplating) selling; and (e) to any person whom SLH reasonably believes may apply to a court or other competent authority for disclosure of that personal information where, in its reasonable opinion, such court or authority would be reasonably likely to order disclosure of that personal information.
Except as provided in this privacy policy, SLH will not provide your information to third parties.

International data transfers

Information that SLH collects may be stored and processed in and transferred between any of the countries in which it operates in order to enable it to use the information in accordance with this privacy policy.

Information which you provide may be transferred to countries (including the United States of America) which do not have data protection laws equivalent to those in force in the European Economic Area.

In addition, personal information that you submit for publication on the web-site will be published on the Internet and may be available, via the Internet, around the world. SLH cannot prevent the use or misuse of such information by others.
You expressly agree to such transfers of personal information.

Data processing on behalf of an SLH hotel

SLH will process any personal data that you may submit through the web-site when making your reservation at an SLH hotel or making any permitted cancellations or changes (such as your name, address or payment details) on behalf of and as the contractual data processor of the particular SLH hotel with which you have chosen to book.

SLH does not have any discretionary authority regarding the processing of your personal data and the processing of your personal data is fully controlled by the relevant SLH hotel and is processed by SLH in accordance with the SLH hotel’s instructions.

SLH will not store your personal data for any other purpose than for its processing according to the instructions of the relevant SLH hotel and will not share your personal data with any third party.

Credit Card CVV number

In the course of processing or transmitting your credit card CVV number SLH will observe and fully comply with the current Data Security Standard of the PCI Security Standards Council.

Security of your personal information

SLH will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.

SLH will store all the personal information you provide on its secure (password and firewall protected) servers. Reservations you make with SLH will be encrypted using SSL technology.

You accept that data transmission over the Internet is inherently insecure and SLH cannot guarantee the security of data sent over the Internet.
If you are a member of INVITED, you are responsible for keeping your password and user details confidential. SLH will not ask you for your password (except when you log in to the web-site).

Policy amendments

SLH may update this privacy policy from time-to-time by posting a new version on the web-site. You should check this page when using the website to ensure you are happy with any changes.

Your privacy rights

You may instruct SLH to provide you with any personal information it holds about you. Provision of such information will be subject to: (a) the payment of a fee (currently fixed at £50.00); and (b) the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity (for this purpose, we will usually accept a photocopy of your passport certified by a solicitor or bank plus an original copy of a utility bill showing your current address).
SLH may withhold such personal information to the extent permitted by law.
You may instruct SLH not to process your personal information for marketing purposes by e-mail at any time. In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to SLH’s use of your personal information for marketing purposes or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt-out of the use of your personal information for marketing purposes via the ‘unsubscribe’ link on any SLH e-mail.
