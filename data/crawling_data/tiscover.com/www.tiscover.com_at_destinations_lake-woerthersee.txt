Wörthersee: A touch of the Caribbean

Thanks to its mild climate and turquoise water Lake Wörth brings a touch of the Caribbean to
Carinthia
. Water temperatures may easily reach up to 28 °C in summer, thus offering perfect conditions for all kinds of
water sports
including swimming, sailing, motor boat riding or simply for a few lazy hours of tanning on the lakeshore. Lake Wörth is just a stone’s throw from Slovenia and Italy. The center of
Carinthia’s provincial capital, Klagenfurt
, is accessible
within a few minutes
and offers a vast array of highlights and events in the field of culture and the arts throughout the year. The Wörthersee area makes a fine destination even in winter, since it is in a convenient location for many
Carinthian ski areas
.



Winter break at Lake Wörth

Enjoy the
charm of winter at Lake Wörth
: Stroll along the lakeshores and marvel at the beauty of the charming, snow-clad lakefront villas. Those with more action and exercise in mind may head for any of the
nearby ski areas
. Get the most out of your holiday and combine
skiing at Gerlitzen
or in the
Dreiländereck
and
Bad Kleinkirchheim ski areas
with a leisurely evening walk along Lake Wörth.
Make use of the vast array of leisure facilities available in the Wörthersee area or simply spend a relaxing day by the lake.
Klagenfurt
is always worth a visit, be it for shopping or anything to do with culture.

Activities








Windsurfing / Sailing Lake Wörthersee










Thanks to
favorable wind conditions
, Lake Wörthersee is a
hot spot
among the
surfing and sailing
community.
Carinthia’s largest lake
is home to five yachting clubs.

Visitors to Lake Wörthersee are welcome to bring along their own sailing boats.
Moorings are offered at Velden and Pörtschach
, for instance.

Sailing and surfing at
wind speeds of 3 – 4 knots
is big fun indeed! Those in need of more speed and challenge will appreciate a fresh breeze of up to 6 knots developing prior to a thunderstorm.

At Lake Wörthersee professional coaches are always happy to introduce beginners to sailing and surfing in a playful and relaxed way.
Rental equipment
is readily available.

In case of an occasional wipe-out surfers will appreciate the
pleasant water temperatures of 25 to 26 °C
.











Golfen Lake Wörthersee










The Wörthersee area is home to three of Austria’s Leading Golf Courses as well as the
APOS Golf Academy Velden
.

Established in the 1920s, the
Dellach Golf Club in Maria Wörth
(on the southern shores of Lake Wörthersee), has been turned into a cutting-edge 18-hole golf course that has already played host to a series of national and international competitions an devents. It is one of
Austria’s Leading Golf Courses
.

The 18-hole championship course of the
Klagenfurt-Seltenheim Golf Club
has been influenced by Scottish and American designers to a great extent.

Among Austria’s Leading Golf Courses you may also find the 18-hole
Velden Köstenberg
course. Hole 10 is Velden’s signature hole and was repeatedly voted the prettiest hole in all of Europe.

Information on the region










Summer holiday at Lake Wörth

Lake Wörth is not only the warmest lake in Austria, but also one of the most beautiful of its kind in the Alpine area. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the lake has often served as a
film location
.
Plenty of public swimming areas
are scattered around Lake Wörth, and the lakeshore is easily accessible from many hotels and guesthouses. Activities include water skiing, sailing, motorboat riding, parasailing and diving – the proper equipment is available at several rental points. The hills and mountains surrounding the lake offer stunning views. The viewing platform on Pyramidenkogel (Gurktal Alps) to the south of
Lake Wörth
, for instance, is definitely worth visiting.

Klagenfurt
, the
provincial Capital of Carinthia
, is only four kilometers from Lake Wörth. The lakeside communities of
Pörtschach
,
Velden
,
Krumpendorf
and
Maria Wörth
have gained a reputation for their charming mansions representing a distinctive form of Wörthersee architecture dating from the turn of the 19th to the 20th century. Even today the Wörthersee area promises
holidays
with all the
imperial splendor
of the good old times. The lake and its picturesque surroundings are best explored in the course of a boat trip.
