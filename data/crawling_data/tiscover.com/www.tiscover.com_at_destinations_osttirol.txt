Holidays in Osttirol

Osttirol and its lovely town of Lienz are always worth a visit. The province is divided into four wonderful holiday regions:
Hohe Tauern national park
,
Defereggental
,
Lienz Dolomites
and
Hochpustertal
in the south-west. Dreamlike mountainscapes and high Alpine pasturelands add to a memorable vacation at the heart of the Hohe Tauern national park. Osttirol makes a true paradise for the relaxation-seeking holiday maker throughout the seasons. Both in summer and winter the marvelous Großglockner and Großvenediger summits attract people from around the world. The huge Osttirol
hiking paradise
comprises 241 peaks beyond three thousand meters. A variety of pristine slopes promises
unlimited ski holidays
in close touch with Osttirol's unspoilt nature, far away from overcrowded mass tourism centers.



Osttirol – Unrivaled winter wonderland

The
Großglockner resort of Kals-Matrei
is the biggest and most popular one of all
seven ski areas in Osttirol
, offering some 150 immaculate slope kilometers. Winter guests enjoy unrivaled skiing fun on sun-flooded slopes. The
Adlerlounge
– Austria's highest toque awarded restaurant (2621 m) – promises culinary delights plus uninterrupted panoramic views of 60 peaks higher than three thousand meters. Osttirol's Defereggental makes a real insider tip for ski aficionados. Families hit the slopes at
Golzentipp
in Obertilliach, a small but fine ski area with romantic log huts in traditional Tirolean style. The SkiHit ski pass gives unlimited access to all ski regions in Osttirol (child discounts up to 18 years). Additionally, the Hochpustertal ski region in Sillian features the ultimate
Yellowsnow snow park
for young artists on snow. The authentic Villgratental valley ranks among Austria's most beautiful
ski mountaineering spots
in almost untouched landscapes. But Osttirol has a lot more to offer:
Lienz
– the main town with great Italian charm – invites visitors to enjoy a shopping tour and stop by at one of the hip bars, pubs and restaurants.
