Wolfgangsee fun splash

Experience the magic charm of a holiday in the Wolfgangsee area.
Lake Wolfgang
covers a total of 13 square kilometers. Together with its scenic surroundings it ranks among the most beautiful spots in the
Salzkammergut region
and makes a fine backdrop to all kinds of outdoor activities such as
swimming, sailing, fishing, diving, cycling and mountain biking
or
rock-climbing
.
Schafberg
to the east of the lake,
Zwölferhorn
,
Sparber
and the
Rinnkogel-Gamsfeld
mountains offer challenging terrain for walking and hiking enthusiasts. The picturesque little towns of Sankt Gilgen, Sankt Wolfgang and Strobl are located on the lakeshore and enchant visitors with friendly and welcoming guesthouses, hotels and lake-front restaurants. Formerly known as “Abersee”, Lake Wolfgang is also home to a number of
beautiful campgrounds
that promise hassle-free holidays for lovers of
water sports, walking, hiking and skiing.



Postalm: A winter tale

Skiing in the Wolfgangsee area
: stunning views of the lake and the mountains, and sunshine in abundance! The
Zwölferhorn gondola
is the gateway to a fabulous
ski area
with innumerable loop trails, powder slopes and a five-kilometer ski run for both snowboarders and Alpine skiers. Located on Europe’s second largest plateau, the
Postalm Arena
is the
preferred destination for families
, as it offers not only outstanding skiing, but also innumerable activities off the slopes such as guided
snowshoe walks, trekking tours, snowbiking and cross-country skiing
workshops, and
sledging
events for the old and young. Thanks to the Skibus Wolfgangsee service the
Postalm
,
Zwölferhorn

and
Dachstein West (Gosau) ski areas
are easily accessible by public transport. The Wolfgangsee area alone boasts
70 kilometers of cross-country skiing tracks
, and there are three more high-altitude tracks on the Postalm plateau.

Information on the region










Summer, sunshine, Wolfgangsee

While Strobl is characterized by stylish mansions and long walks, St. Gilgen’s major attraction is the building which was once home to
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart
and his mother and sister. St. Wolfgang, on the other hand, has been a place of
pilgrimage
and a
popular climatic health resort
for more than a thousand years now. All of these lakeside resorts are
popular summer destinations
, not least thanks to their varied offering in terms of sports and outdoor activities. The major attraction is certainly the lake itself. With pleasant water temperatures of around 20 °C and crystal-clear water of premium quality
Lake Wolfgang
lends itself to all kinds of water sports including
swimming
,
surfing
,
sailing
,
canoeing
,
kayaking
and
diving
. Pedal boats and electric boats are available for hire. The summits of Zwölferhorn and Schafberg as well as the Postalm area ensure exercise and stunning views for mountain enthusiasts. The annual highlight in spring is the internationally renowned
Wolfgangsee Classic vintage car race
.
