Accommodation Type


Hotels
are accommodation facilities that provide amenities in addition to lodging and food. Generally, hotels have more beds than other accommodation facilities.

Holiday apartments
are fully equipped apartments available for rent (mostly self-catering). Generally, holiday apartments have private bathroom facilities, a cooking facility and one or several bedrooms.

B&Bs;
are small businesses with several rooms, mostly with breakfast and simple facilities. Generally, they are designed for overnight accommodation.

Farms
are family-run agricultural businesses offering rooms and holiday apartments. You often get an insight into everyday farm life.

Private accommodations
offer a maximum of 10 beds in private housing (self-catering or with breakfast).

Inns
not only provide overnight accommodation but also offer dining options. The furnishings are simpler than those of a hotel, and there are no additional facilities.

Hostels / youth hostels
provide budget accommodation for young travellers and backpackers.

Holiday homes
are fully equipped houses available for rent. They are ideal for large families or groups who want to spend a holiday together.
Huts
especially cater to hikers. They offer multiple bedrooms, bunk beds and floor mattresses.
