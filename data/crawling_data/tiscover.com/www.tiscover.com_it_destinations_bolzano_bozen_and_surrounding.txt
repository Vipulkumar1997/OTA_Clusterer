Map















A warm welcome to your holiday paradise ... all year round!

Thanks to the central position of our plateaus, we are the ideal staring point for excursions to other provinces and to the heart of the Dolomites. Like from a natural balcony you can enjoy a breathtaking view of these impressive mountains.
Perfect connections to Bolzano, capital of South Tirol, along a wide and comfortable street which takes you until the northern outskirts of the city, only a few kilometers from the toll gate Bolzano Nord. With the SAD bus lines with terminals in Collalbo, Vanga and Longostagno you can get to the center of Bolzano. Furthermore you have the possibility to take the railway from Collalbo or another station which brings you in only 36 minutes to Bolzano, just 200 m from the FS main railway station. From Soprabolzano operates a cable car which takes you down to the city within only 15 minutes.
