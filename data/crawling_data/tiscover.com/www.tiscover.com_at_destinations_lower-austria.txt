More detailed information provided by the Tourist Board


Whether you ski, cross-country ski or snowboard, at
all information about winter in the broad land.

Snowreports (updated daily), live-pictures from all ski-resorts, winter specials and detailed information about the winter cards, which can make your skiing holiday up to 20% cheaper.
You can´t always count on the weatherman, therefore the broad land also focuses on "gentle" wintersports. That´s why Lower Austria is in best shape both on white slopes and in times when snowflakes are rare. Gentle and snow-independent wintersports, such as snowshoe-hiking ore ice-skating, as well as wellness, hospitality, culture and culinary specialities invite you to a different type of winter holiday.



Lower Austria does not have as many sites as the Internet, but still enough to cater for your dream holidays.

The primeval forests at the Danube, March and Thaya rivers, the brusque canyons of the Ötscher mountain, the gently rolling hills of the country around Retz, the swamps in the Waldviertel, the great river valley of the Wachau, the pine woods in the Wienerwald and the oak woods in the Weinviertel, the mystic power spots of the Waldviertel and the peaceful cellar lanes of the Weinviertel, alpine pastures, sun flower fields, vineyards, wild mountain rivers, ... - Creation has awarded Lower Austria a rich, natural and diversified beauty.

Just as well, the vast country around Vienna has seen many of its treasures man-made: The offer goes from small and old treasures like the Venus vom Galgenberg - the oldest stone plastic of the world, dating back to the year 30.000 BC - up to large and modern sights like the Landshaus district in St. Pölten - a excellent example of modern architecture.

The unique variety of nature and culture is also reflected in Lower Austria's tourism offer. Active holidays at hiking, cycling, golf or trend sport experts, wellness days in spa centres, culture tasting in small towns or mighty convents, pleasureful holidays at the wine grower or local host, nature experience in the national parks or at the farm - the selection of ideas for your holidays is nearly endless. We are sure that you are only a few clicks away from the holidays of your dream.
