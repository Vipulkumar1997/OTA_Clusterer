Holidays in the Villach-Faaker See-Ossiacher See region

The Villach-Faaker See-Ossiacher See region in Austria’s southernmost Province stands for
breathtaking mountains, crystal-clear lakes, a mild climate
, friendly people, innumerable leisure time activities throughout the year and an almost
Mediterranean atmosphere
. It is home to the
Dobratsch Nature Park
with an average 45 days of sunshine between November and January.
Gerlitzen Alpe
and
Dreiländereck
lend themselves to Alpine skiing, while the Dobratsch Nature Park makes a paradise for backcountry skiing and cross-country skiing enthusiasts. Thanks to an inspiring blend of sports, culture and culinary highlights Villach and its surroundings have become a popular holiday destination for the old and young.



Winter at its finest

Dreiländereck Mountain
is shared equally by Austria, Italy and Slovenia. The ski area boasts a reliable snow cover, sunshine in abundance, 17 kilometers of immaculate ski runs, a Kiddy Snow Land, a
free ski kindergarten
and an 8.4-kilometer sledge track.
Gerlitzen Alpe
comes with 25 kilometers of slopes for skiers of all ages and ambitions, including the Stella Ronda challenge, a circuit comprising certain ski lifts and slopes. Twelve cozy mountain restaurants and pubs tempt skiers to drop in for a meal or drink and linger for a while.
The former ski area at
Dobratsch
has become a popular destination among
backcountry skiing
buffs. Enjoy stunning views of the mountains in the course of a leisurely winter walk.
Winter campers
are most welcome at Lake Ossiach. And the best thing about a winter break in the Villach-Faaker See-Ossiacher See area is that visitors enjoy free transportation to the ski area from all towns and villages at Lake Ossiach, i.e. from Ossiach, Steindorf, Bodensdorf, Sattendorf and Annenheim.
