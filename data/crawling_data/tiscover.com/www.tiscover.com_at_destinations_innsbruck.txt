Holidays in Innsbruck

Nowhere is the line between city and ountains so blurred as in Tirol’s capital. From outdoor sports to culture and back in one day: that’s Innsbruck. Innsbruck is the capital of the Alps. With the Nordkette Mountains in the background and historic buildings in town, Innsbruck is a unique destination for culture vultures and utdoor enthusiasts. One of the city’s most popular postcard subjects is the
Bergisel
Ski Jump
, venue of the Four Hills Tournament. The ski jump’s restaurant offers magnificent views. Another popular attraction is the cutting-edge
Hungerburg Funicular
, designed by Zaha Hadid. With its cobblestone lanes, shops, cafés and the
Golden Roof,
Innsbruck’s makes for a great place to explore. The
Alpenzoo
is popular with families.



Shopping with Ski Boots


In winter,
Nordkette
offers great skiing. From the city it’s a short drive by bus or Hungerburg Funicular to the mountain top offering spectacular views. Innsbruck is a heaven for culture and shopping. Going from ski boots to high heels is easy here: skiers and shoppers mingle in Innsbruck’s Maria-Theresien-Straße. It is this seamless blend of sports and lifestyle that makes Innsbruck truly unique.
Accommodations in Innsbruck
Innsbruck offers something for all tastes and pocketbooks, ranging from luxurious 5-star hotels to apartments and friendly B&Bs.
