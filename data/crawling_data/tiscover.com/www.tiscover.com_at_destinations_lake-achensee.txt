Holiday at Lake Achensee

Crystal-clear water meets spectacular mountains! The Achensee area comprises five picturesque villages. Visitors are attracted by the Tyrol’s largest lake not only due to the breathtaking mountain scenery of the
Karwendel
and
Rofan
ranges, but also by its varied offering in terms of activities and relaxation.

Sport & Vitalpark Achensee
stands for walking and
hiking
,
climbing
,
mountain biking
,
Nordic walking
,
water sports
and playing
golf
. In addition,
Lake Achensee
is a popular destination when it comes to
sailing
and
surfing
. Kite surfing and stand-up paddle boarding enthusiasts also love the mountain lake at the heart of the Alps. With a maximum depth of 133 meters it poses a special challenge for those with a spirit of adventure.
Winter adds a touch of romance to the Achensee area and makes it a
paradise for cross-country skiers
and snowshoe walkers.



Achensee: Winter sports and well-being

In the cold season the Achensee area turns into a picture-postcard winter wonderland second to none, attracting families and single travelers alike with its varied offering in terms of sports and recreation. There are some 30 uphill facilities and
immaculate slopes for Alpine skiers and snowboarders
– and many cozy mountain restaurants and pubs just perfect for having a decent meal or refreshments. At
seven ski schools
in the area children will be introduced to skiing in a relaxed and playful way. In addition, there are
150 kilometers of cleared walking trails
, as well as more than
200 kilometers of cross-country skiing tracks
, including a special practicing area for beginners. Those who wish to explore the Achensee area without any effort at all are recommended to take a
romantic ride in a horse-drawn carriage
. Snowshoe walking certainly makes for an unparalleled winter experience, allowing outdoor enthusiasts to discover even remote and therefore particularly quiet and beautiful spots. Those longing for more action will love to try
snowkiting
. In January every year ski mountaineers meet at Lake Achensee for the Rofan Challenge. The Achensee area is also famous for its
Christmas-related events
(„
Seeweihnacht
“ and „
Tiroler Bergweihnacht
“) and the popular
New Year’s Eve Swim in Pertisau
.

A beautiful lake reflecting the blue sky, snow-clad mountains, and large snow fields. Achensee offers winter sports and recreation for everyone! High-altitude cross-country skiing, romantic rides in a horse-drawn sleigh, horse trekking, skiing and enjoying breathtaking views...



The Achensee Lake - the Fjord of the Alps. Austria's Emporers were the first to discover this beautiful natural lake as a holiday destination.

The emerald-green Lake Achensee is the largest and most beautiful of the Tirolean lakes. To the west and south rise the imposing peaks of the Karwendelgebirge, to the east the Rofangebirge or Sonnwendgebirge.

The lake (round trips by steamer) offers excellent facilities for water sports, including scuba diving, sailing, windsurfing, kite surfing and swimming. On hot summer days the water reaches up to 22C.

Around the lake there is a whole host of good hotels and holiday apartments to choose from.

On the banks of the Achensee, Tirol's largest lake, rises the majestic Karwendel/Rofan mountain range. Its highest peak is at 2,457 m above sea level... perfect for hikers!

If you wish to enjoy the flair of these jaw-dropping heights without getting too tired, take the Rofan or Karwendel lifts and enter a mystic world of peaks, huts, and alpine pastures.
