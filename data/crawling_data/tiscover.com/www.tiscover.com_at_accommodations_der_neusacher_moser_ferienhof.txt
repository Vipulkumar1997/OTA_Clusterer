beautiful accommodation in a stunning location


We stayed at this Ferienhof for 3 days as part of a motorbike tour of Austria.  Our room was large, very clean and light and airy in a modern way despite the very traditional look of ...


Host's comment

Dear Mr. Down! 
It is a true pleasure for us to read through your rating and we are very glad that you enjoyed your stay at the Neusacher moser. Most of the time a guests smile is gratitute enough, but it´s also nice to read a guests satisfaction on "paper". We would like to welcome you again at Neusacher moser and are looking forward to see you soon. Best regards from the Weißensee. Familie Winkler

...  the property.  Our host and her son were most welcoming and spoke good English.  Breakfast was outstanding and featured many home-made products that were of a high quality.  Despite not offering dinner, she gladly made us evening snacks, served with good beer as well as recommending some excellent restaurants within easy walking distance.  The location is truly outstanding, beautiful and peaceful and linked to other places around the lake by small ferry.  Despite its traditional farming roots, this small hotel has a vibrant atmosphere which added to our excellent stay.

Description










Winter vacation




Summer vacation




THE ULTIMATE IN WINTER HOLIDAYS!

Immaculate ski runs, fabulous cross-country ski tracks and a thick layer of ice on Lake Weissensee...
Cozy apartment or double room accommodation at the Neusacher-Moser, a picture postcard winter landscape and sunshine in abundance.... Enjoy a winter break in Carinthia!

Winter activities include ice skating, Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, winter walking, curling, tobogganing, and a lot more. Having returned from an exciting and fun-filled day out there is nothing to beat a few moments of relaxation in front of the tiled stove, listening to the crackling log fire, enjoying a glass of mulled cider and a savory Carinthian snack to go with... sociable evenings in nice company.

The sauna is on and waiting for bathers! Enjoy a "snow bath" to cool off afterwards - an unbeatable sensation!

And what about the kids?
Well, they will enjoy themselves in the cowshed and barn, since there is so much to see and do.

Being a BOBO member business, we are able to offer a number of advantages and specials. 1-week winter break including ski passes from EUR 661 (2 adults and 2 children; available from Jan 9, 2010)



AT LAST.... IT'S HOLIDAY TIME AGAIN!

Holidays at Ferienhof Neusacher-Moser.... holidays in a picturesque environment on the shores of Lake Weissensee. Perfect for a relaxing break at the heart of nature. Relax, unwind and feel at ease! Retreat to the private bathing area (shallow beach!) or dream away in a hammock under shady pear trees.

We offer beautifully appointed rooms and apartments with solid wood furnishings. Crystal-clear spring water feeds the showers and taps, and hot water is produced thanks to eco-friendly solar energy. Since the lake is on the doorstep, you can even take a refreshing swim before having breakfast.

Our organic farm is a paradise for children and adults alike. There are kittens to play with, pigs to feed, cows to milk, ... And the top-quality dairy produce can be enjoyed for breakfast!

The Weissensee area offers sports and activities at any time of the year: walking, running, Nordic walking, cycling, mountain biking, swimming, diving, rowing, climbing, playing golf and fishing.

Toll-free access to Carinthia: Collect your free 10-day "Vignette" toll sticker and get the road toll for a single ride to Carinthia refunded (offer valid from May 1 to June 20, 2010; exclusively available at "Freie Fahrt" member businesses!).
