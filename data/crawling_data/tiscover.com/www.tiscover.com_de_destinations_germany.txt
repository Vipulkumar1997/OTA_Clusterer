Map















It’s winter time in the German part of the Alps!

Winter tales come true every year between the Allgäu and Berchtesgadener Land regions. Myriads of sparkling snow crystals cover mighty mountains and gently rolling hills, thus turning them into a picture postcard winter wonderland to be enjoyed by both active and relaxation-seeking visitors. Germany’s top ski areas (including its highest mountain, Zugspitze) offer excellent conditions for skiing. For those who prefer winter activities at a more leisurely pace there are lovely walking trails, toboggan tracks and ice rinks.
