Upper Austria has a Passion for Winter

Winter is on its way and what better place to enjoy all that this season has to offer than in Upper Austria: Pine and spruce of Muehlviertel’s mighty woodlands are dusted with luxurious snow, the gorgeous mountains of the country’s south and south-east are covered in white... And once the snow flies, it’s time to grab your skis or snowboard and head for the hills.

You are looking for the perfect winter playground, a place in which to recreate and rejuvenate in a family-friendly atmosphere? Well, Upper Austria’s ski areas are excited to welcome you to the world of skiing and riding. From Hochficht in the North to Dachstein Mountain in the South—Upper Austria's seven Top Ski Resorts shine as family areas, characterized by a spirit of thrift and amiability: All in all, they contain 240 kilometers of runs and thousands of feet of vertical descent. These are the places where snow riders on a budget come to slide, where kids learn to ski, where little ones have fun at licensed daycare centers, and where smiles brighten every day.

One of the best ways to enjoy Mother Nature's wonders is on the stunning network of cross country ski trails. We bring a lot of experience and enthusiasm to your winter vacation, whether it's walking the lovely cleared hiking trails or snowshoeing into a winter wonderland. Is it any coincidence that the classic images of winter are pure Upper Austria?



A Great Summer in a Great Place – Holidays in Upper Austria

Upper Austria’s versatile landscapes range among Austria’s finest and most varied sceneries – nowhere else will you find crystal clear mountain lakes and rivers, rolling plains and lofty mountains, small villages and historic towns, all thrown liberally into the mix. The country’s many cycle paths, such as the Danube Cycle Path, are rated among the best in all of Europe.

The timeless summers of childhood are alive and well in Upper Austria. From mountain hikes and rustic shelters, to historic towns, monasteries, and museums, the long days of summertime are a perfect frame to Upper Austria’s relaxed pace of life. And, anything you can do on water you can do in beautiful Salzkammergut Lake District. Our brand of fun is natural, real and pure. Which is why families feel free to spend a few days or a few weeks tucked away in our hills and mountains.

As varied as are the sceneries and outdoor activities, Upper Austria has a vast array of accommodation to suit all tastes and budgets. Pick from the range of luxury hotels, friendly bed & breakfasts and exhilarating farmstays. Variety is what it is all about.
Have a nice stay in Upper Austria's Passionate Landscapes!
