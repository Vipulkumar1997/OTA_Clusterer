Black Forest, where you can recharge your batteries amidst stunning beauty


With its cultural diversity and picturesque landscape the Black Forest region has provided the background for poems and films for many years now. It seems as if - among forests, mountains, valleys, lakes and rivers - a special inner sense of well-being emerges in a person as nowhere else in the world.

The Black Forest area offers a wide range of leisure time facilities such as hiking in summer or skiing in winter. For visitors interested in culture the region provides numerous villages which have preserved their historic character and romantic atmosphere. The Black Forest is a popular destination for bon vivants, too. Among other things, mountain inns offer hearty snacks accompanied with wine from the Baden region and kirsch.
