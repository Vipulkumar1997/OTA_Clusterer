: Alpine skiers, snowboarders, ice skaters, Nordic skiers, snowshoe hikers, winter walkers and icefall climbers get together at the Peak of Tirol. Snow is always guaranteed thanks to
Ötztal's high altitude location
. The endless ski slopes feature top modern mountain lifts and snow-making systems. Freeriders and snowboarders can choose from a number of snow parks while 34 mountain lifts - whisking you up beyond 3000 meters above sea level – await you on 150 slope kilometers.
The

. Also in the holiday villages of Sautens, Haiming-Ochsengarten, Oetz and Längenfeld varied winter activities and romantic moments are scheduled, among them
horse-carriage rides
, fun-filled
tobogganing
and
snowshoe hiking
at torchlight. What's more, with some
150 Nordic track kilometers
the Ötztal makes a unique
winter holiday paradise for Nordic skiers
. And after an exciting day in the mountains, the splendid
Aqua Dome spa center in Längenfeld
offers wellness treatments and water fun for all ages and preferences.

Walking Ötztal Valley










Those longing for walking and hiking at a rather leisurely pace will love the Piburger See trail around
lake Piburger See
, or the Vent-Mutsbühel loop trail.

7

mountain lifts
operating in summer take mountain enthusiasts to a variety of trailheads, such as the Giggijoch top station in Sölden, the departure point for tours to Rotkoglhütte, and the
Almzeit Family Trail
with varied activity stations spread all over the hiking area.

offer useful information on local flora and fauna and the like. The

, for instance, features a number of sculptures related to local tales and myths, while the
Sölden Alpine Ecology Trail
winds its way along the treeline and portrays wildlife in the mountains.

Obergurgl at the heart of the Ötztal Nature Park is the perfect base when it comes to exploring the mountains. Do not miss out on the Obergurgl
Stone Pine Forest
,

a real nature monument, or a tour to Langtalereckhütte mountain inn.











Hiking Ötztal Valley










Many routes start at charming mountain lodges and cabins throughout the Ötztal Valley. Zuckerhütl tours, for instance, start at the
Hildesheimer Hütte
refuge hut.

, was found.

The mountaineering village of Vent is also a renowned base for manifold high Alpine tours and crossings at the heart of the
Ötztal Nature Park
