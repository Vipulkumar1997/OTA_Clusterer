Holiday in the Alps – Pure vacation bliss!


1,200 kilometers long and 150 to 250 kilometers wide! These are the incredible dimensions of the
Alpine chain
, the
highest mountain massif
within the inner continent right at the heart of Europe. Both locals and visitors can take full advantage of a powerful
living space
and a great
recreational area
characterized by its Alpine climate and the
great variety of landscapes.
The entire Alpine region is rich in cultural and historical attractions and boasts an almost endless choice of sports and activities amid
awe-inspiring nature
. Holiday dreams will come true!
In the summer you can explore the scenic mountains on wonderful
walking tours
or during a picture-book
(mountain) bike
adventure. High altitude fans are strongly recommended to conquer some of the unique rock faces with ropes, ice picks and climbing crampons – of course after an introductory unit with a certified guide and using the appropriate equipment. Families and children or all those in search of relaxation can choose from a
great variety of romantic mountain and
swimming lakes
coupled with
water sports
and splendid recreational hours. Art, culture, festivals and events are quite tempting offers if you prefer a short break in the lovely Alpine towns. All winter long the Alps are renowned for excellent
ski sports
and endless fun on the slopes! The most
famous winter sport resorts
have already become a hot spot also for
skiers
and
snowboarders
. And what's best, the most passionate winter fans can enjoy perfect snow conditions in countless
glacier ski areas
until late spring.
No matter which
holiday in the Alps
you choose – sports, enjoyment, family or recreation – we wish you a maximum of fun. This truly unique region offers a myriad of highlights to discover and explore, creating memories that will stay with you forever!
