Behaglichkeit in familiärer Umgebung


Wir waren zweieinhalb Wochen in dieser sehr angenehmen Pension mit liebenswürdigen Wirtsleuten. Persönliche Wünsche wurden sofort erfüllt (Kühlschrank wurde z.B. auf Bitten ins Zimmer ...

...  gestellt, am Frühstücksbuffet wurde stets gefeilt, um zu verbessern. Die Produkte waren nur vom Besten).Die Lage der Pension ist großartig: weite Blicke auf Berg und Tal von Balkon, Terrasse oder Wiese, gute Erreichbarkeit der Haltestelle des kostenlosen Touristikbusses, auch sind schöne einfache  Abendspaziergänge nahe der Pension bestens möglich. Der Zimmerservice durch Frau Helga (?) wurde äußerst schnell während des Frühstückes des Gastes erledigt, dabei sehr gründlich. Wie macht sie das? Also: alles prima! Nein! Der Wirt, Herr Zaucher muss unbedingt hinzulernen! Es wird wirklich Zeit, dass er das Wort "Leibzsch" (Hochdeutsch: Leipzig) endlich fehlerfrei ausspricht. Mit "z" !!!
