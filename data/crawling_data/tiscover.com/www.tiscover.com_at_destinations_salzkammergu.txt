Salzkammergut holidays

The charming Salzkammergut
lake and mountain district
embraces parts of three Austrian provinces:
Upper Austria
,
Salzburg
and
Styria
. Salzkammergut stands for
sports
and activities, for
crystal-clear lakes
boasting water of premium quality, for short and long
walks and hikes
, and for
lovely lakeside beaches
(e.g.
Lake Wolfgang
or
Attersee
). Marked by
76 big and small lakes
, numerous brooks and rivers, gently rolling hills and impressive peaks, the Salzkammergut area lends itself to
cross-country skiing
, Alpine
skiing
and winter walking. Enjoy your holidays in an inspiring environment at the heart of nature.



Salzkammergut: Winter happiness

The Salzkammergut area is unmatched when it comes to winter holidays in Austria, offering snow-capped peaks, silent and frozen lakes, gently rolling hills covered by a layer of crisp snow, and crystal clear air. Get out those skis and snowboards, snowshoes, skates and curling stones and enjoy winter the way you like it! Salzkammergut is home to several popular ski areas, including the
Dachstein-West family resort
with 140 kilometers of pistes; Upper Austria’s longest top-to-bottom run in
Obertraun
with an overall length of 11 kilometers; or
Tauplitz
with a total of 40 kilometers of slopes. The
longest freeride powder slope
(11 kilometers) can be found at
Krippenstein
, the center of freeriding, with a focus on skiing instead of lift riding. In case you prefer winter activities at a more leisurely pace there are innumerable tracks for
cross-country skiing
, cleared winter walking routes, as well as frozen lakes for ice skating. Salzkammergut: Winter at its best!
