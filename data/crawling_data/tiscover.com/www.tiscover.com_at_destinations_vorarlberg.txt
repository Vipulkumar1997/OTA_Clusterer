More detailed information provided by the Tourist Board


Think of glistening white slopes that make every skier's heart beat faster. Think of skiing beyond compare and ski resorts at one with nature.

Vorarlberg is the second smallest federal country of Austria, yet one which has plenty of attractions to offer. The "land in front of the Arlberg" has some of the most impressive landscapes of Europe. Touring untouched areas with certified mountain guides. Reaching summits inaccessible by cableways. Gliding over groomed trails on cross-country skis or exploring the area in snowshoes or climbing boots.
Our countryside is also packed with adventure without skis. And nearly everything can be learned here. A world worth exploring for sports and leisure time activities. In short: a region for relaxing the body and soul. Welcome in Vorarlberg!



Landscape, culture, variety, quality of life - good reasons to take a summer holiday in Vorarlberg.

Vorarlberg is the second smallest federal country of Austria, yet one which has plenty of attractions to offer. The "land in front of the Arlberg" has some of the most impressive landscapes of Europe: surrounded by the mighty mountain ranges of the Silvretta and Verwall group, the Rätikon, the Lechtal and Allgäu Alps and the Bregenzerwald. From the vast plain of Lake Constance the landscapes lead on to almost mediterranean gardens in the Rheintal valley, along the shores of Lake Constance and in the lower regions of the Bregenzerwald, and over wood-clad mountains to the glacier-topped peaks of the Silvretta range. What welds so much diversity into a common identity is the harmony which exists here between man and Nature. Vorarlberg is a symphony of human and natural serenity. Balsam for the soul, where Nature has been left unspoilt and mass tourism is unknown.
Contemporary architecture and festivals of world renown have attracted attention all over Europe. Between 7 and 29 July 2008, culture and football will celebrate an exceptional encounter during the European Championships 2008.

Flying to Vorarlberg in a jiffy
Ryan Air flies you from London Stansted, Dublin and Liverpool to the Bodensee Airport in Friedrichshafen in a mere 1.5 hours. Buses and taxis will take you from the gateway to the Alps to Vorarlberg’s towns and villages.
