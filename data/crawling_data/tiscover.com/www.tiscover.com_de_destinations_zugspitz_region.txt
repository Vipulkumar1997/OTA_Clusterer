The lovely Zugspitz Region is renowned for its huge variety of walking paths, hiking trails and Alpine routes. Walking fans of all ages and preferences can choose from an infinite number of marked trails - among them pilgrimage routes (Via Romea), theme trails and high Alpine peak conquests for real experts. Ambitious climbers get together at one of the
fascinating via ferrata routes

A great round of golf is waiting for you at the
Karwendel and Werdenfels golf courses
, with the breathtaking Alpine scenery as backdrop. Countless
outdoor swimming pools and Alpine lakes

A visit to the historical town center of Garmisch or one of the interesting museums is an absolute must. What's more, the whole region boasts deeply rooted traditions and ancient handicrafts around every corner. Those in search of the ultimate adrenalin kick should try the
