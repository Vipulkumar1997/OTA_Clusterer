Ski holidays in the Alps
stands for: Large ski areas, reliable snow in glacier ski areas, family ski regions, where kids truly feel at ease and snowboarding on heavenly powder snow slopes.

The most stunning ski holidays ever: skiing, snowboarding and riding on dreamlike ski runs, a relaxing stop over at one of the quaint mountain huts, followed by a sunbathing session. Feeling at ease thanks to genuine hospitality and this very special Alpine flair of secluded mountain villages: a wonderful winter holiday has it all! Here you will find exactly what you are looking for as we have put together a complete list of the Alps' favorite ski regions like Sölden, Zillertal or Schladming promising wonderful winter holidays.
