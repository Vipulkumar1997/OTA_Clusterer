Stubai – So close to the sky

Skiing in June? Why not! Welcome to a really outstanding holiday in Stubai! The
Stubai Glacier

Austria's biggest ski area in the eternal ice
, stretching up to 3200 meters above sea level. Marvelous skiing fun awaits you also in the
Schlick 2000 ski center
and at the
Elfer ski mountain
while cross-country skiers get together in the
Serles-Mieders ski area
with 45 kilometers of high altitude Nordic tracks. Winter walking routes are available as well. Also in the summer, the Stubaital valley has a lot to offer for the adventure-seeking guest:
850 kilometers of signposted hiking routes
are spread all over the region. Real outdoor fun is guaranteed in Stubaital's wildly romantic mountains offering lush forests, rushing waterfalls, 80 glacier fields and far more than 100 peaks higher than 3000 meters.



Eternal ice – Glacier skiing

Here the skiing season starts in summer and autumn: scenic
Stubai glacier
ranks
among the Alpine ski areas with the highest snow reliability
, offering 35 easy to intermediate slopes suitable for the whole family. Pure winter fun in all its facets awaits you in the superb
Schlick 2000 ski center
with 25 perfectly groomed slope kilometers and a highly exciting snow park.
Cross-country skiers prefer lovely Mieders and the
Serles high altitude Nordic track
featuring about
45 kilometers of Nordic loop tours
. Also winter walkers will find everything their heart could possibly desire in lovely Mieders. The
Stubaital valley
is also very popular among passionate tobogganists, especially the Elfer mountain where a wonderful 8 km long toboggan run leads down to the village center of Neustift. What's more, floodlit night tobogganing is scheduled three times a week. The ultimate
Pinnis toboggan run
(8 km) takes action fans through the scenic
Pinnistal

valley
to the hamlet of Neder. On a thrilling tandem paraglide flight you can admire the picture-book landscape from a bird eye's view. Absolute beginners have the chance to take part in
professional paragliding lessons on the Elfer mountain
