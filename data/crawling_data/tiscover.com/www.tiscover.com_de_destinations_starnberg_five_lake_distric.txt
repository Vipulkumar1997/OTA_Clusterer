Activities








Windsurfing / Sailing Starnberg Five Lake District










Favorable wind conditions, an unspoiled environment and cultural highlights in abundance: The five
lakes of Starnberger Seenland
boast perfect conditions for
sailing and surfing
, combining a
gentle breeze
with fabulous views of
Schloss Possenhofen
- Empress
Sissi’s
childhood home?

Especially the
Starnberger See, Ammersee and Wörthsee lakes
are highly popular among sailing and surfing enthusiasts. Sailing races have always drawn sports-minded visitors to the area.

Lake Ammersee has a long tradition in sailing
. The ‘Albatros’, a present by Tsar Nicholas II, may be hired for a nostalgia tour across the lake.

Once the wind gets stronger, there is nothing to keep surfers and kite surfers off the lake. At
Pilsensee-Ost beginners
will find perfect conditions for an
introduction to water sports
.
