The Dolomites: unique vistas

The glowing sun as lovely backdrop of the
famous Tre Cime peaks
creates memories of a very special kind. The locals in the Dolomites call it magic "Enrosadüra", a nature spectacle deeply rooted in the region's history. The three popular peaks are some 250 million year old, and were declared
UNESCO World Cultural Heritage in 2009
. The mighty Dolomites massif can hardly be described: the scenic
Schlern mountains
, the majestic
Sella range
, the incredible
Rosengarten area
, plus myriad cliffs and rocks stretching up to the high Alpine pasturelands. Right in the middle you also find crystal clear Alpine lakes under the deep blue sky. With a bit of luck you can listen to the whistle of marmots romping around on the gently rolling hills. The Ladin farmers still remember old stories and legends of times long past while sitting in front of their quaint wooden huts. Truly memorable holidays …



Superlative winter fun

For real ski aficionados "
Dolomiti Superski
" is the paragon of perfection. A single skipass gives access to some twenty different ski regions covering no less than 1200 perfectly groomed slope kilometers, served by 400 mountain lifts taking winter sport fans up to the highest peaks and most scenic vantage spots. Snow is always guaranteed in the world famous ski resorts of
Cortina d’Ampezzo
,
Gröden

or
Alta Badia
. Besides immaculate slopes for skiers and snowboarders, the area also boasts superb terrain for cross-country skiers and winter walkers.
Spectacular high-altitude plateaus and deep green forests covered all in white can be found in lovely
Hochpustertal
at the heart of South Tyrol. It's hardly surprising that this valley
ranks among the most popular Nordic skiing centers of the Dolomites
- thanks to some
200 kilometers of well-groomed cross-country skiing tracks
and absolute snow assurance. Among the highlights is the Plätzwiese high-altitude track offering picture-book views of the Tre Cime peaks. A wonderful winter holiday in the Dolomites involves not only snowboarding and skiing but also snowshoe hiking or simply relaxing. Winter vacation at their very best.

A winter experience in the most beautiful mountains in the world

As a dreamworld discovered the Romantics reaped the benefits of experiencing the mountain landscape.

From this time onwards thousands of people have followed on to see for themselves and to relax in the alpine setting: those who have stood at the foot of the Three Peaks or seen a Rosengarten sunset in its fiery red glow, or who have even felt the call of the mountains on a personal level. The Dolomites cast a wholly unique spell. In fact, Reinhold Messner hasn´t called them the "most beautiful mountains in the world" for nothing. Many famous personalities as authors, actors and actresses, sportsmen and mountain climbers have all sung their praises.
