Activities








Windsurfing / Sailing Chiemsee










Lake Chiemsee is indeed a
paradise for sailing and surfing enthusiasts
, as it offers all the prerequisites and infrastructure for water sports, including favorable wind conditions.

A
gentle breeze in the morning
and perfect
thermal winds at noon
– you will certainly find the place which offers the perfect wind conditions for your purpose.

From early April till late October it’s all about water sports at Lake Chiemsee. The
Fraueninsel lake island
, for instance, is
even accessible for sailors
, offering plenty of space to relax and unwind, and to enjoy a decent meal and drink at the beer garden.

Lessons for beginners and intermediates may be booked with any of the surf and sailing schools in the Chiemsee area.
Professional skippers
offer fantastic sailing adventures, such as
Sunset Sailing
or
Stargazer Sailing
trips.
