Holidays in Vienna

As the capital of Austria and most important city on the Blue Danube, Vienna has many faces. Although mostly famous for its
coffeehouse culture
and rich history, Vienna has
plenty more to offer
. In the summer the city tempts with beautiful beer gardens and wine taverns; in the winter Vienna’s museums and exhibitions make for great outings. Vienna has more attractions than you can shake a stick at. From
St. Stephen’s Cathedral
, Vienna’s landmark and Austria’s most important gothic building, to the Giant Ferries Wheel, from the
Museum of Art History
to the Albertina and the Museums Quartier: culture lovers will be delighted with the city’s offerings. Vienna is also a great place to combine sightseeing with shopping along Kärntner Straße and Mariahilfer Straße.



Must-sees on every trip to Vienna are the
Imperial Palace,
Schönbrunn Palace
and
Belvedere Palace
. The city’s magnificent buildings give a good sense of Vienna’s grandeur during the Habsburg rule.


The
Spanish Riding School
enthralls audiences with its amazing horsemanship performances. Event highlights in Vienna include the Life Ball extravaganza and the world-famous Opera Ball.
Hotels & More in Vienna
Vienna offers countless great accommodations. Browse Tiscover to find everything from luxurious hotels in the city center to cozy B&Bs and apartments on the outskirts.

More detailed information provided by the Tourist Board


When the days are getting shorter you should not miss a great theater or concert night in Vienna.

The beauty of the imperial period and the beautiful art nuoveau facades are always worth a visit. Late autumn is the best time to spend some unforgettable days in Vienna: sightseeing, shopping, enjoying the ultimate shopping malls! Take a rest in one of the typical Viennese cafes and try a Melange coffee and a piece of excellent Sachertorte cake with whipped cream. The mouth-watering aroma of hot chestnuts awaits you at the atmospheric Advent and Christmas markets in Vienna´s picturesque town center ...

Art & Enjoyment in Vienna

One of the 2003 highlights was the opening of the Albertina. In 2004 the Liechtenstein and the Sisi Museum opened their doors. And 2006 is dedicated to Austria´s most renowned composer, W.A. Mozart.

Over 100 museums (e.g. Art History museum, Leopold Museum, Sigmund Freud Museum) offer excellent exhibitions. The best in theatre, opera and musical can be found here, too. Before and after it is time to enjoy excellent food in Vienna´s restaurants and cafés. And at night several exciting clubs and bars await you in the famed Bermuda Triangle area.

See you in Vienna!



"Vienna, Vienna, you alone shall be the city of my dreams..." This old Viennese folk song is mainly about one fact - that Vienna is fantastic, as beautiful as a dream.

You know Viennese Waltz, the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, the Vienna Boys Choir, Wiener Schnitzel and St. Stephens Cathedral. All right, but you ain´t seen nothing yet...

Art, culture and the city itself make a unique mix of tradition and modern times.

And Vienna is also a great place to go shopping or just stroll around. In between many cafés and Heurigen inns invite you for a break on the shores of the Danube river.

Vienna is pure romance  and enjoyment. Vienna is different and it is highly addictive...

SUMMER IN VIENNA

In summer Vienna shows ist best sides. Numerous sights are waiting to be visited.

Classical music or clubbings - it mostly takes place outdoors. Film festival at the Rathaus square, Klangbogen music festival, dance festival and open-air cinemas : Vienna leaves no chance for boredom.

From May on people go outdoors. "Schani" gardens in the city center, Heurigen inns with view of Vienna and outdoor sitting areas next to the Alte Donau river. Places like Copa Cagrana at the Danube river, the Summer Stage at the Danube Canal, the MuseumsQuartier in the city and the Bermuda Triangel - they all promise great entertainment.
