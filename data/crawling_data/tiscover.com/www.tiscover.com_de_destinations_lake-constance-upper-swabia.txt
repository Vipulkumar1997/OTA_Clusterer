Lake Constance and Upper Swabia: Culture and Recreation


Lake Constance and Upper Swabia are two landscapes that blend seamlessly. Geologically they are part of one as the foothills of the Alps both regions were shaped by the Ice Age.

Soon after it completes its descent from the Alps, the Rhine River broadens and forms Lake Constance before continuing its 820-mile route to the North Sea. Lake Constance covers 220 square miles, making it central Europe´s second largest freshwater lake. Lake Constance is bordered by three countries, Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. The snow-capped Swiss peaks provide a breathtaking backdrop for a choice of water sports, relaxation and cultural pursuits.

Upper Swabia is bounded in the east by Upper Bavaria, in the west by France, and in the south by Switzerland and Austria. The main physical features of Swabia are the Black Forest; the valley of the upper Danube River which rises there; the Swabian Jura, a mountain range that extends parallel to and North of the Danube; and the valley of the upper Neckar River. The Rhine and Lake Constance (sometimes called the Swabian Sea) form the western and southern borders.
