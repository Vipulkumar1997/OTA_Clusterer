Director’s Statement – Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the ‘MSA Act’)

This statement is made pursuant to section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Late Rooms Limited’s (‘LateRooms’) slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year ending 31 March 2017.

Introduction

This statement sets out LateRooms’ actions to understand all potential modern slavery risks related to its business and to put in place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or human trafficking in its own business and its supply chains. This statement relates to actions and activities during the financial year 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2017.

As part of the travel industry, LateRooms’ recognises that it has a responsibility to take a robust approach to slavery and human trafficking.

LateRooms is committed to preventing slavery and human trafficking in its corporate activities, and to ensuring that its supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.

Organisational structure and supply chains

This statement covers the activities of LateRooms:


LateRooms is an online travel agent facilitating bookings for accommodation only


Countries of operation:

LateRooms currently operates in the United Kingdom but can take bookings from consumers based anywhere worldwide and for hotels worldwide, although 94% of bookings are from UK consumers for UK bookings.

Risk Assessment Process

The following is the process by which LateRooms assesses whether or not particular activities or countries are high risk in relation to slavery or human trafficking:


Modern Slavery Act meetings have taken place across the business, including the attendance at a senior management workshop with external consultants as well as ‘top up meetings’ where the LateRooms action plan was set out and further updated; and

Contracts with direct and indirect suppliers will include clauses on the MSA Act and risk factors, for instance with our Hotels, Affiliates and Indirect Purchasing terms and conditions. Zero tolerance for modern slavery and respect for human rights will be built into our procurement processes, supplier contracts and also represented in dialogue with sub-contractors, customers and other business partners.


High-risk activities

We do not view any activities at high risk.


Low risk activities are considered as the procurement of IT hardware from countries rated as high risk on the Global Freedom Index, updated annually by Freedom House, that may include: gold, tin, tantalum and/or tungsten


Responsibility

Responsibility for LateRooms’ anti-slavery initiatives is as follows:



Policies:
The Director of Legal and Business Services led a proactive and robust internal MSA project in 2016 and has attended a workshop held at group level by external consultants. All policies are reviewed annually and updated where necessary.


Risk assessments:
A risk assessment in the form of a ‘Slavery Risk’ form was distributed from LateRooms’ legal team internally. Any additional risk assessments of the indirect supply chain will be under the responsibility of the Procurement team at LateRooms.


Training:
An anti-slavery and human trafficking training presentation (including an internal group memo, presentation video and supporting guidance documents) has been attended by senior management and key people within LateRooms by means of a workshop, proving the methodology of how LateRooms can adhere to the Act. LateRooms is looking to introduce refresher sessions to existing employees within the business and to also deliver information briefing sessions to new joiners.


Relevant policies

LateRooms operates the following policies that describe its approach to the identification of modern slavery risks and steps to be taken to prevent slavery and human trafficking in its operations:



Modern Slavery Act Policy
In accordance with the MSA Act, LateRooms has adopted a group led policy relating to anti-slavery and human trafficking. The policy confirms LateRooms’ commitment to tackling slavery and human trafficking throughout our supply chains and to ensuring transparency in LateRooms business. We expect the same high standards from all our contractors, suppliers and other business partners. LateRooms includes specific prohibitions against the use of forced, compulsory or trafficked labour, or anyone held in slavery or servitude. The policy is reviewed and updated annually.


Whistleblowing policy
LateRooms has adopted a group led policy relating to Whistleblowing. LateRooms encourages all workers, contractors, external consultants, third party representatives and other business partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or the supply chains of, LateRooms. This includes any circumstances that may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking. The LateRooms whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for workers to make disclosures of any wrongdoing, without fear of retaliation. This policy is reviewed and updated annually.


Anti – Bribery Policy
LateRooms’ existing policy is being updated to become a group level policy. This policy outlines how individuals can recognise a situation where bribery might arise and how they should address this.


Recruitment policy
LateRooms has adopted a group led recruitment policy. LateRooms uses only specified, reputable employment agencies to source labour and always verifies the practices of any new agency it is using before accepting workers from that agency. Going forward, the Recruitment Policy will be drafted to reflect that appropriate consideration has been taken in respect of human trafficking and slavery when recruiting both internal/external employees and contractors.


All policies are available for staff members to view on LateRooms’ internal intranet.

Due diligence

LateRooms undertakes due diligence when considering taking on new indirect suppliers, and regularly reviews its existing indirect suppliers. Going forward, LateRooms due diligence and reviews under the Procurement team will include:


Mapping the indirect supply chain broadly to assess particular product or geographical risks of modern slavery and human trafficking;

Evaluating the modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each new indirect supplier by requesting they complete a MSA due diligence questionnaire via LateRooms procurement e-sourcing platform before participating in an RFI or RFP process;

Create a risk profile for each indirect supplier, where appropriate, based on the response within the MSA due diligence questionnaire;

Invoking sanctions against suppliers that fail to improve their performance in line with an action plan, including the termination of the business relationship; and

Insertion of a MSA Act focused legal clause in our supplier contracts. Contracts with suppliers will include clauses on the Act and risk factors. Zero tolerance for modern slavery and respect for human rights will be built into supplier contracts and also represented in dialogue with sub-contractors, customers and other business partners.


Awareness-raising programme

LateRooms plan to roll out a refresher awareness – raising programme by circulating updated and new policies including the Anti-Slavery and Human Trafficking policy, along with a briefing to all staff.

The briefing will explain to staff:


the basic principles of the MSA Act and how it impacts LateRooms;

how employers can identify and prevent slavery and human trafficking; and

what employees can do to flag up potential slavery or human trafficking issues to the relevant parties within LateRooms.


Board approval

This statement has been approved and signed-off by LateRooms’ board of directors, who will review and update it annually.
