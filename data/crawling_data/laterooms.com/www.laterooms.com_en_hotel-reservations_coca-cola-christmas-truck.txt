About the competition

This Christmas, prepare to discover a magical experience like no other. For the first time ever, Coca-Cola is offering one festive fan plus a guest, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take part in the ultimate Christmas sleepover – and stay inside the iconic red Coca-Cola Christmas truck for one night only, on Friday 15th December 2017.
Located in the heart of central London, the truck comes fully equipped with everything you could possibly need for the most extraordinary sleepover experience, with a dedicated host on hand throughout, to ensure you have the most relaxing and magical stay.
Beautifully decorated, the truck comes complete with an enchanting fairy lit wall, a woodland snow scene, flickering festive fireplace and a magical Christmas tree. During your stay, you’ll be able to plug in your smartphone for specially curated Christmas playlists, kick back and watch your favourite festive films on a flat screen TV before bedtime or simply enjoy festive stockings loaded with presents from Santa whilst enjoying an ice cold Coca-Cola or Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. ‘Tis the season to be jolly after all!

The lucky pair who get to spend the night will be treated to a delicious Christmas dinner with all the trimmings, delivered straight to the door, then snuggle up in style, tucked up tight in the trucks’ cosy twin beds and wake to a lovely breakfast.
If exploring is your thing, the next day you can take advantage of free tickets to some of London’s biggest attractions, including the Coca-Cola London Eye, or take in the best views of the city.
Whatever you choose, it’s guaranteed to be your merriest Christmas yet! So, for an unforgettable experience, tell us what makes you the ultimate Christmas fan before midnight on 8th December 2017 to be in with a chance of winning.
Terms apply, GB only, 18+, competition live from 00:01 on 28th November 2017 to 11:59 on 8th December 2017, for full T&Cs see
