About Us

It's going to be a great night...

Welcome friend. You've made it to
LateRooms.com
, which can only mean one thing: you've got a great trip coming up and now you're throwing out the high fives, chest bumping your mates, or just screaming yourself
                silly in excitement.

This is your moment and you know it's going to be a great night.

*And breathe*

Now, where are you going to stay?

Great question. And you've come to the right place. Because we know hotels. Like, really know them.

We have an enormous selection to choose from, more than you'll ever need in 16 lifetimes. We've got over 200,000 hotels dotted all over the globe, so whatever your trip, we can help you get your head down somewhere great.

Whether it's your daughter's first concert, watching your football team win away, or a girly weekend in the city, we can help you make it happen without breaking a sweat.

Yes, you too business trippers.

We're here 24/7, so if you need a great room you can book online, or even give us a call. Then once that's sorted, you can get back to screaming like a prepubescent teenager and rest assured that it really is going to be a great night.

Or great weekend.

Or great half term.

Or… well, you get this gist.


Now book a great room, with LateRooms.com

A little bit of LateRooms.com history

LateRooms.com was born in Salford, Greater Manchester in 1999, starting life as an 'on the day for the day' booking site for unsold hotel rooms.

We're still loving life here in Manchester today, only now offering more than 200,000 properties worldwide, with more UK hotels than anybody else.

These days you can still book late deals on the day of your stay, of course – but also up to a whole year in advance. Helping you plan all those upcoming events, activities and special occasions for which you need a hotel.

Oh, and we've picked up some lovely awards along the way...
