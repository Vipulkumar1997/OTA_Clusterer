The team at LateRooms are by far the best team I’ve ever had the pleasure of dealing with. They are positive, friendly and extremely helpful and they always find us exactly what we need. They are extremely efficient and provide some of the most speedy, helpful and friendly service I’ve ever received. I cannot rate them enough!

We have had a Corporate Account with LateRooms since 2013 and have received great service from the team – any urgent or emergency bookings are dealt with very quickly and efficiently.  By using LateRooms to locate hotels for us saves the company so much time, which in turn allows our staff to get on with other business.

Since using the LateRooms.com corporate service and business portal, Loungers have consistently seen savings in both time and money. The corporate product has completely streamlined the processes for making bookings, consolidating payment, collating VAT receipts and management information reporting.

The Team have been amazing to work with. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to any company looking to use LateRooms for all their corporate bookings. The service is consistently speedy, efficient and there’s always a great range of hotels to choose from that match our budget. The personalised support and assistance they continually provide is essential and second to none.
