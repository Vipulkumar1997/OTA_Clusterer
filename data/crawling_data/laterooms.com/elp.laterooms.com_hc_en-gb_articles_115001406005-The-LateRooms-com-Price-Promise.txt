The LateRooms.com Price Promise is our little way of giving you the peace of mind that you're always getting a great hotel deal on LateRooms.com. If you do spot the same hotel room cheaper elsewhere online, we’ll do the decent thing and refund the difference.

How our Price Promise works:

We’ll look into any Price Promise claim as long it's for a current booking with LateRooms.com and it meets certain conditions, including:


The lower rate found is available for booking the exact same room online (same room type, same hotel, same check-in and check-out dates, same booking conditions – like breakfast and parking etc.)

The lower rate is in the same currency

The lower rate does
NOT
include membership rates, frequent stay or loyalty points or 'reward' type programmes

You let us know about the claim within 24 hours of completing your LateRooms.com booking


We can't offer our Price Promise when:


The lower rate is no longer bookable when we look into your claim (within 24 hours)

You've cancelled your LateRooms.com booking

You make a late booking – less than 24 hours before the arrival date

You find a lower rate on a website that doesn't reveal the hotel until
after
you've booked


How to make a claim

Making a Price Promise claim is simple. If you’ve booked a stay within the last 24 hours that isn't for the same day or next day arrival, and you've read the full
Terms and Conditions
, then just fill in a
claim form
.

Think you’ve found a lower rate?
