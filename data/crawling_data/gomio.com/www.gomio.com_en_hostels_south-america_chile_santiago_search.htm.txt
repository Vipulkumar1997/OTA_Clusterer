Santiago de Chile
is the capital of
Chile
. Because of its central location it is near both the mountains and the beach. During the winter some of the best skiing can be found in the nearby mountains of the Andes. Within the city limits there are also many attractions such as the Plaza De Armas where many historical buildings are located like the Metropolitan Cathedral of Santiago. Through
Gomio
you can choose from many
youth hostels
in Santiago!
