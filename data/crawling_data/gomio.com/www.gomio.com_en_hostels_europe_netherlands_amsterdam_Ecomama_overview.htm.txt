Information Ecomama

Cocomama Boutique Hostel is going
green
and even
more luxurious!
For most of you travelers the Cocomama concept needs no introduction. In case this is all new:
Our Mama places provide the perfect combination between a
cozy stay
,
value for money
and
unique experience
. Ecomama introduces a new green and upgraded atmosphere to this. We make it our mission to engage everyone who is staying in Ecomama into this feeling of sustainable and joyful living.
So come and experience it yourself, we are looking forward to meeting you!
Staying at our boutique hostels means unique and customized: different ways of sleeping to fit everyone’s personal needs.
Of course we have the classic mixed dorm style rooms, all with their own theme.
A solo girl in need for some girl time?
Then the Ladies Only Dorm might be perfect for you with all its different shapes of pink and free girly goodies.
Getting away for a romantic weekend?
Then the Double Deluxe with bathroom might be more suitable for you and your sweetheart!
For our flashpackers
(backpacker with a slightly bigger budget and need for privacy)
we have Cabins:
a cheaply priced cabin-box with double or twin beds, no roommates or windows, with shared bathroom.
For our always conscious
budget seekers
we have the
El Cheapo room
, where making your own bed is included in the price. This room is
very very basic and does not have lockers

in the room but in the hallway
.
See if there is something for your liking - either way our staff is willing to go above and beyond to make your stay and experience memorable and unique.
Ecomama stand for green and conscious hospitality, which you can find in all the different ways Ecomama is build and run: cradle to cradle furniture, use of fair trade materials, natural stone heating,
environmentally friendly
water system and waste recycling.
As we like to engage you in this way of living, we remind and invite you to join our green mission by being a conscious traveller and guest.
Of course we have all the standard facilities like book exchange, movie lounge, fully equipped kitchen, bike rental and so on. But on top of that we have an
in-house coffee bar (to drink, not to smoke)
for all kinds of fair trade organic coffees, teas and treats (fresh breakfast & lunch also).

You won't be disappointed. Guaranteed!

Basically a perfect place with great kitchen, common area, really nice to chill.

Just a couple minor points for owners: put a sound proof door on room 11. Spritz a little chlorine in the caulk lines of the showers once in while (like a couple times/month), go for slightly hotter showers, check every morning that each is working, and put something in all the shower stalls to keep us from standing in a puddle of water with our slippers (you have wooden slats in some but not all)..

Perk-up the shower experience and I'd stay every trip!!!

Super comfy stay in both 12 and 8 bed.. attracts pretty cool fellow travelers (except the occasional German idiot ;)

Warm staff.

Oh.. could probably use a couple more big lockers for worriers.. but I'd rate the place super safe/low risk of anything bad happening, and high risk you'll run into some fun peeps.
