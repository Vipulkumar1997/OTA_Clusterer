Best Hostels in East Africa


Although the boundaries are obscured,
Eastern Africa
is typically considered the stretch between
Eritrea
all the way down the eastern coast to
Tanzania
. More southern countries like
Mozambique
and
Zambia
are sometimes considered Eastern Africa as well. Here you can see a wide array of animals, especially lions since there are many prides living in the Serengeti.
Eastern Africa
is comprised of mostly grasslands and savannahs with beautiful white-sand beaches dominating its shores and the two tallest mountains in
Africa
, Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya.
