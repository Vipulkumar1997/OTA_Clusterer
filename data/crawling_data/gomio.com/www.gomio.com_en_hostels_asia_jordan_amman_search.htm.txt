Amman
is the largest city in
Jordan
as well as its capital. Although Amman is the most westernized city in the middle-east it is also very humble and the people are friendly. The city contains ancient constructions and monuments that are reminders of Ammans ancient history. Al  Balad and the Citadel Hill of Amman are both popular tourist attractions because of the old character that both exhibit. Book a
hostel
through
Gomio
to get the
best price and location!
