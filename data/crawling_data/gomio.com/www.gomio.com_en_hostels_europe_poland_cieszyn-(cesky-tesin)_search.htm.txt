Many backpackers stay in
Cieszyn
as a stop on their way to Prague and end up loving this small, charming town. It is located in the historical region of
Poland
that has been divided and then re-divided over the years due to both World Wars, giving it great historical significance. The different influences on Cieszyn can be seen through their varying architecture. You can explore this lovely Polish town by staying at one of
Gomio's affordable youth hostels
located in the center of the town.
