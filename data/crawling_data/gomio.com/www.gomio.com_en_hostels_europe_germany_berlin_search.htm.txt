What to do in Berlin
What to see in Berlin
Shopping in Berlin
Eating out in Berlin


Hostels in Berlin
is definitely the key to unlocking the secrets this city hides, but where to choose? Here are some suggestions. Cheap
accommodation in Berlin
can be easily found with Gomio. Mitte is the most central borough of the city, and the ideal location to pick a
youth hostel in Berlin
for those who are discovering this city for the first time. Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf, centre of former West Berlin, is another nice location for backpackers in Berlin. A
Berlin youth hostel
in trendy Pankow would match those seeking a thriving nightlife.
