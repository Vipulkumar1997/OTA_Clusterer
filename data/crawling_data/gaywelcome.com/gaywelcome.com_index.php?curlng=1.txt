Your key to unlocking the huge gay European tourism market





GETA Guru




UNDERSTAND >

Who are gay tourists? What are their needs and preferences? Find out what makes them tick.



APPEAL >

How do you develop products and services that will appeal to this high-spending market?



REACH >

How do you best reach gay tourists? What marketing techniques and messages work best?




GETAâ€™s mission is to promote gay tourism in Europe.  A key element of this is helping our members to grow their businesses by learning more about the gay market and how to work effectively within it.

GETA Guru is the best way for tourism businesses to understand gay tourism.  GETA Guru tells you all about gay tourists, how to ensure that your product appeals to them and how to market to them.

Each month GETA Guru will focus on a different element of gay tourism combining research, articles, case studies and forums to provide a comprehensive, interactive examination of a particular subject which will help your business to grow.

Over the years GETA Guru will build into a comprehensive library which will be an invaluable resource for members.

Our first GETA Guru post looks for the first time ever at the size of the European gay tourism market.  Future posts will examine issues such as what gay consumers expect and how to promote your business to gay people.

All GETA members will receive a synopsis of the latest GETA Guru posting.  Executive members will have access to the full posting.

GETA Guru gives you the information and advice that you need to make your business a success.
