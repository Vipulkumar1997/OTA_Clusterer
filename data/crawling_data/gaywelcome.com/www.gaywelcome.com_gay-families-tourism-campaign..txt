Help us make traveling in Europe safer and fairer for gay families









About the Campaign

OBJECTIVES


The Gay Families Tourism Campaign
aims to persuade European countries, regions, cities and popular tourist destinations to proclaim clearly and publicly that they recognise and welcome the legal rights of gay visitors from around the world.

HOW WILL IT ACHIEVE THIS?

The campaign will create a charter committing a destination to recognise the legal rights of same-sex families.  We will work to persuade as many European countries as possible to sign the charter, whether they have same-sex marriage and partnerships or not.  We will promote the list of charter countries widely so that same-sex families can feel confident that the places they choose to holiday will recognise their legal standing.

WHO”S BEHIND THE CAMPAIGN

The
International Gay and Lesbian Association
, Europe (ILGA- Europe), the
Gay European Tourism Association
(GETA) and the
Network of European LGBT Families Associations
(NELFA) have come together



HOW
YOU
CAN HELP

As a first stage of the campaign we want to hear from gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual people to help us compile the charter and promote the cause.  We want to learn about their particular experiences – be it with countries or businesses - that have made their holiday as a same-sex family uncomfortable or difficult or where their choice of destination has been influenced by concerns over legal recognition of their family status.



TELL US ABOUT
YOUR
EXPERIENCES

We promise not to publish or share your comments without your prior permission.

HOW WILL YOUR INPUT BE USED?

The information gathered in the above form will be used to identify specific issues faced by gay families and transexual people when travelling in Europe. These will then be used to help us write the Charter for the Gay Families Tourism Campaign - which we will then ask countries and organisations to sign up to.



The Problem

An increasing number of nations and states around the world are granting legal recognition to same-sex families, such as Civil Partnerships, Marriage and Adoption. Yet when travelling abroad it is not always clear how the legal rights and responsibilities granted in one state will be recognised in another.


11 European countries are in the United Nations’ top 20 most popular destinations worldwide.  Of those, only three allow same sex marriage and two others have some form of legal partnership.  The majority do not.

Of the 49 countries in Europe 10 allow same-sex marriage, 13 have legal partnerships and 28 do not allow same sex partnerships in any way.







How gay people lose out


Visiting a country where same sex families are not recognised can lead to genuine concerns for gay families.


In the event of an accident, will a same sex partner be recognised as the next of kin?

Will same sex parents be recognised as the legal guardians of their children?

Will businesses offer the same services and promotions that they offer to married straight people?

Transsexual people experience particular issues at borders and other official situations where their documents do not always match their appearance.




For some same-sex couples these concerns mean that they actively avoid visiting certain countries.  For others they can lead to real, practical problems when visiting a country where their relationship is not legally recognised.



How Europe loses out

Gay Americans spend $70 billion annually on tourism and European gay people spend over €50 billion annually.  Already many gay families are
taking recognition of their legal status into account when choosing their holiday destinations
.



Those destinations that want to attract gay tourists need to demonstrate that they recognise the rights and responsibilities of gay, bisexual and transsexual people and welcome the increasing number of gay families.
