"GETA calls on EU to suspend talks on visa-free travel for Russian officials"



DATE: August 22, 2013



The Gay European Tourism Association has written to the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Cecilia Malmström, urging her to suspend negotiations on proposals to give 15,000 Russian officials the right to travel throughout the European Union without visas, in light of Russia’s recently introduced anti-gay laws.

GETA argues that granting free travel to the officials and politicians who are responsible for human rights abuse in Russia sends the wrong signal.
