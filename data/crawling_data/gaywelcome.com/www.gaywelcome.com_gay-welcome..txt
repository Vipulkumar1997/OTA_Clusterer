Who are Gay Welcome?









Gay Welcome not only helps you find 'gay-friendly' accommodation, it also helps you identify which hotels, B&Bs and guesthouses are 'gay-preferred'.



Gay Welcome was set up by
GETA - the Gay European Tourism Association
. GETA's mission is to make Europe a better place to travel to and within for gay tourists. GETA does this by raising awarness of the importance of the gay travel market, and by educating companies and organisations across Europe on how to better meet the needs of gay Travellers.




Gay Welcome was set up by GETA to help gay people traveling in and to Europe find hotels, guesthouses, B&Bs and holiday accommodation that better meet their needs. Gay Welcome does this in two ways:


By filtering out gay-unfriendly accommodation

By helping you find 'gay-preferred' accommodation through reviews written by other gay Travellers




So Gay Welcome ensure you no longer have to worry about how hotel staff will react to you and your partner asking for a double bed. And it helps you find hotels, B&Bs and guesthouses run by people who understand gay guests better. Places furnished more to gay tastes. With staff who can advise you on local gay bars. Places where you feel you can really relax and be yourself.
