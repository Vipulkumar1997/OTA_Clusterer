Gay Clubbing in Europe







Each summer sees an explosion of
clubbing
all over the continent from the big cities to the holiday islands and increasingly on cruise liners around the Mediterranean.  You can mix great clubbing with culture, sightseeing and the beach all in one holiday.



For massive clubs every week,
London
takes some beating.  You can start on Friday night and dance all through to Monday morning without leaving the clubbing district of Vauxhall.  Start in the bar and club Barcode and then move onto Beyond and Fire just next door.



If you want some sunshine and seaside then the great Mediterranean party island of
Ibiza
has it all with superclubs every night.  Space is the most popular, a massive clubs and a mind-blowing experience where straights and gays dance inside and out.



But we like the smaller more gay resort of
Sitges
, just 20 miles outside Barcelona in Spain.  In the summer this little fishing village is packed with gay holidaymakers and all the main streets are lined with gay bars and clubs.  In June they have an amazing Pride Festival which takes over the town.



In the same area, Barcelona has a ten day Circuit Festival in August with huge parties inside and out and some of the hottest Spanish boys you will ever see.
For something a bit harder, then Berlin is your destination.  The Hustlaball in October is one of the world’s biggest fetish parties.



For real clubbing professionals, Rapido’s club nights in Brussels are a must.  Clubbers from all over Europe descend on the European Union’s capital for the most amazing nights with international guest DJs and spectacular shows.



In recent years gay party
cruises
on the Mediterranean have boomed. You get to see some amazing destinations and dance all night.  The Atlantis cruise in August takes you to Spain, Italy and Monaco and the great clubbing brand La Demance has its own dance cruise in July.  Also in July the Mediterranean Bear Cruise sails and dances for a whole week under the Mediterranean sun.



And then there’s the huge variety that is Europe’s
pride festivals
.  Our favourites are Madrid (hot weather, hot boys, the whole of the city centre closed for pride all weekend); Tel Aviv (for a surprisingly good party on the eastern Mediterranean beaches);
Amsterdam
(pride on the canals); and Reykjavik (where half of the entire population of Iceland take part and the mayor attends in drag).
