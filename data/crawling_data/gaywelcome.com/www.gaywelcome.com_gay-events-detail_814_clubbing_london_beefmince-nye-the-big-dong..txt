BEEFMINCE NEW YEAR’S EVE: THE BIG DONG!
Yes, you heard right. BEEFMINCE. On New Year’s Eve at the legendary Royal Vauxhall Tavern!
You know this is the best way to say goodbye to 2017 and welcome 2018: BEAR FULL and ATTITUDE FREE. Admit it. Who does not like a BIG DONG?
<< TICKETS @
beefmince.co.uk/tickets
>>
We will open the RVT doors at 9pm this time and at 10pm we have the great pleasure to present a spectacular show with two of London’s most talented and creative performers: your divine host for the evening, VIRGIN XTRAVAGANZAH, plus special guest (and super weirdo), TRACY BARLOW. These two stunning stars will put on a fun and celebratory show, until THE BIG DONG at midnight.
Your host, VIRGIN XTRAVAGA
NZAH, is a 2,000+ year old virgin, a cabaret performer, drag queen, singer, song parody writer, and the current title holder for London’s Next Top Queen as judged by Michelle Visage. Virgin has opened for Jinkx Monsoon, Adore Delano, Jujubee and Detox. She is a Virgin on a mission, and she is determined to fill your NYE party with her celestial Xtravaganzah!
Our special guest, TRACY BARLOW, is the Diva of Durham, the Siren of Sunderland, the Angel of the North! But now she’s been behind iron bars, unless she’s been granted furlough, then you’ll find her in gay ones! Champion of competitions such as NADC, Drag Idol, and The British Sign Language Awards 2017, Tracy Barlow is not a nice queen, she’s not an ice queen, she’s a Vincent Price queen!
After THE BIG DONG at midnight, we will PARTY PARTY PARTY…
And to keep the purest BEEFMINCE atmosphere, it’s resident DJs ONLY! SILVERHOOK and CACTUSHEAD will be taking turns on the decks playing the biggest and most uplifting BEEFMINCE anthems until 5am!
£20 tickets are available behind the RVT bar or at
beefmince.co.uk/tickets
. We expect to sell out so don’t hang about! If you want to chance your luck it’s £25 at the door
IMPORTANT INFO: We can only guarantee entry to ALL TICKET HOLDERS UNTIL 11:30pm
So come join us for THE BIG DONG!
