Let it all hang out...

You don’t need to be a die-hard naturist to enjoy a nude swim now and then - and luckily lots of hotels across Europe are  relaxed about guests wearing their ‘birthday suits’ in public areas. Many of them are gay-only hotels, guesthouses and B&Bs; - and most of those are located on the Mediterranean (where better for a spot of nude sun-bathing?).


The map to the left shows where all of these hotels are located, and each ‘nude’ hotel is listed below. Just click on any pin on the map for more information. Or scroll down the listings to find hotels that take your fancy.
