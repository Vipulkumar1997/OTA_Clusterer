Gay Travel Agents & Tour Operators





















Why use a gay travel agent or tour operator for your next holiday?


We asked our partners ETOA to explain to Gay Welcome the benefits of using a tour operator or travel agent.....


"Tour operators and travel agents are the experts to make travel easier, from planning to “being in the know” about where, when and how you make the most of your trip.
                      They know that your time is precious. So one quick click or call to an agent can make all the difference when choosing the hotel and location for you. Good advice for LGBTI travellers is a must if visiting new places.

When you book regularly, many will recommend accommodation options, destinations and experiences from city breaks to adventure travel, according to your chosen interests, to further help you find better deals and save time.

Travel agents and operators are also there to help you through a maze of travel costs and fees, some optional, some not. Operators and agents should always be registered and bonded with regulatory and consumer protection authorities in your country, to provide additional peace of mind."
