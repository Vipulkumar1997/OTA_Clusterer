"2012 London Pride - what went wrong?"

-

Magazine, UK, Sept, 2012




CLICK HERE
to read our contribution to this article.

When asked for his advice on how London Pride could be improved,
Paul Barnes, Communications Director at the Gay European Tourism Association
, said:
"The dilemma is that Pride needs to be both professional and community-based,' he says. 'At the moment, it's a volunteer-led organisation. We are asking people in their spare time to close down Central London and handle massive budgets, which they've demonstrated they can't do. What they need to do is retain a professional company to deliver the event. That should be done for profit, which will make them  do it properly and efficiently. The gay element will be the board, setting the values and strategy. It's like the gay cruises run by Atlantis and RSVP - you have a gay company to inject the gay elements, but you need a professional cruise line to run the ship itself."

"Power of the Pink Pound"

-

Wealth Section, UK, Sept, 2012



Aaron Hicklin of the Financial Times discusses the emergence of the gay community as a distinct and politically powerful market, and the opportunity it presents to companies and marketeers.




CLICK HERE
to read our summary of the article.


"Gay men, we have learnt from attitudinal and behavioural research, will travel more often, spend more out of home and give more attention to home designs and fashion" says Bob Witeck, Chief Executive of Witeck Communications, which specialises in analysing the gay and lesbian market. None of this means gay men and women earn more money, just that they make different spending decisions - not least because many, gay men in particular, will not have children."



"Have we reached a point where the value of having gay consumers lies in what it signals to a broader audience? It may be that marketing to gays has long surpassed simple expressions of solidarity in favour of more deliberate strategies to position a brand's ethics and philosophy."



This is all good stuff and reinforces our view that the gay market is one that smart businesses should be appealing to.
