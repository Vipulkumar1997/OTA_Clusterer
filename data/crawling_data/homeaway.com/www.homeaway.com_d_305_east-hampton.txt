Vacation like a celebrity in East Hampton
Given that it’s such a short journey from New York, the amount of natural beauty in East Hampton is astounding. Long stretches of golden sands and an abundance of parks combine to form one of the most serene destinations on the East Coast. And this certainly hasn’t gone unnoticed! Countless celebrities own property here, which has led to superb restaurants and chic boutiques setting up shop along the charming streets. Despite its popularity, though, East Hampton has worked hard to retain its village-like charm, something you’ll soon discover when you book one the many East Hampton vacation rentals on offer.

Shop and surf among the locals in East Hampton
Owing to its beautiful landscape, East Hampton has plenty of activities to get stuck in to. Main Beach is the biggest draw for many of East Hamptons’ visitors: it’s one of the best-ranked beaches in the United States, but it’s more than just a place to work on your tan. Main Beach hosts several watersports schools, which will allow you to try your hand at surfing, kayaking, and paddleboarding. Shopaholics will love exploring Main Street, with its trendy boutiques geared toward the visitors at the numerous East Hampton vacation rentals.

Immerse yourself in the culture of East Hampton
If you can tear yourself away from the beach, the town of East Hampton has plenty of family-friendly attractions to explore. One of the true gems of Long Island is LongHouse Reserve. The beautifully maintained gardens cover 16 acres and are dotted with eye-catching sculptures from the likes of Yoko Ono and Buckminster Fuller. The Pollock-Krasner House (once home to the artists Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner) is another place that culture aficionados won’t want to miss. People of all ages will appreciate the fascinating tour, and kids will love creating their own Pollock-style drip paintings.

Soak up the sun in East Hampton
If you’re hoping for East Hampton vacation rentals near the beach, you’ll probably need to book well in advance. Although the months of June through August are the hottest, September is also a great time to visit since the weather is still pleasant, but there are fewer visitors. If your heart isn’t set on the summer, late spring is another great option. Temperatures are milder, but East Hampton still retains its charming, village-like vibe.

Explore the wonderful parks of East Hampton
Once you experience the natural beauty of East Hampton and the surrounding area, you’ll instantly understand why it has attracted countless artists over the years. East Hampton is home to no less than 8 state parks and two county parks, with Cedar Point County Park being the most popular. It encompasses more than 600 acres of coastal beauty and is famed for its stunning views across Gardiner’s Bay, as well as hosting a myriad of different activities, including hiking and fishing. It also plays host to a rich ecosystem of wildlife with everything from deer to ducks.
