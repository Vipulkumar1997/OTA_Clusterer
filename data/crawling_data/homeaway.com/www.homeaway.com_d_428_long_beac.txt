The perfect balance of city and nature in Long Beach
If you’re looking for a vacation that blends the great outdoors with all the excitement of the big city, Long Beach could be the perfect destination for you. You never have to stray far from Long Beach vacation rentals to find superb attractions such as the historic ship Queen Mary, as well as superb shops and restaurants, many of which can be found along the Long Beach waterfront. There’s a huge range of things to see and do, whether it’s visiting El Dorado Nature Center or just kicking back on Mother’s Beach.

Explore historic Downtown Long Beach
Long Beach vacation rentals will ensure that you good use of this prime location on the coast. Booka dolphin and whale watching tour for you and your family. Once aboard, you can see different species depending on the time of year—everything from the mighty blue whale to playful bottlenose dolphins. If you want to take a tour of the city itself, just hop on a Segway to explore the streets with ease. A choice of tours is available, including those that explore the waterfront area or Long Beach’s historic downtown district.

The best of science and art in Long Beach
One of the biggest attractions in Long Beach is the Aquarium of the Pacific. With more than 10,000 sea creatures in residence, you can easily end up spending the entire day here; there are lots of hands-on exhibits which kids will love. For a dose of culture, don’t miss the Long Beach Museum of Art. Exhibitions change regularly and cover a variety of mediums, and there’s also a great restaurant on-site, too. Similarly, the Museum of Latin American Art should not be missed.

Enjoy the sunshine all year round in Long Beach
Long Beach vacation rentals are available year-round as the location enjoys fantastic weather throughout the year. The city gets around 13 inches of rain each year (far below the national average of 39 inches), so whenever you decide to book your vacation, you can expect dry and sunny weather. Even during January, the coldest month, temperatures rarely drop below 46°F. Spring and fall provide pleasant conditions that are well-suited to the many outdoor activities on offer, and those wishing to work on their tan at the beach visit during the summer months of June through August.

Long Beach—combining the best of nature and the city
Long Beach may be a large city, but that doesn’t mean it’s lacking in nature and wildlife. Angeles National Forest - San Gabriel Mountains National Monument is just a short drive away from your Long Beach vacation rental, and has plenty of hiking trails to explore the wonderful forests that blanket the rolling hills. There’s a choice of beaches to choose from along the coast, and Channel Islands National Park is a great place to enjoy scuba diving and other activities. For a touch of Zen, visit the Earl Burns Miller Japanese Garden.
