Kick back in Florida's Clearwater Beach
Beach days ahoy at Florida's Clearwater Beach, a year-round vacation spot that promises travelers pristine stretches of sand, crystal-clear waters and a vibrant, small-town atmosphere. Finding your perfect spot on the beach won't prove too tricky but there's a host of activities and adventure on the menu too, with strolls along the plush Beach Walk, sightseeing cruises and visits to Clearwater Marine Aquarium all helping families and friends make memories. Make even more by opting for a stay in a Clearwater Beach vacation rental, many of which offer an idyllic base just steps from the sand.

Seaside activities at Clearwater Beach
Many travelers can be seen kicking off their days in Clearwater Beach with a stroll along the Beach Walk, a multimillion-dollar development which counts a broad promenade, public artwork and live entertainment among its highlights. Take lunch at one of the waterfront dining spots or enjoy a picnic on the sugar-sand beach before heading off on a dolphin watching cruise from Clearwater Harbor. Departing daily, these cruises are a blissful way to spend the afternoon. Before heading back to your rental, the nightly craft and entertainment festival at Pier 60 offers the perfect close to the day.

Family-friendly fun in Clearwater Beach
If you're traveling with kids, a trip to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, home to Dolphin Tale's Winter the Dolphin, as well as Kemp's Ridley sea turtles and river otters, is a must, with parents able to score even more brownie points by using the Jolley Trolley to get there. For those seeking a culture fix, downtown Clearwater's Cleveland Street District, with its unique shopping and dining and walkable urban setting, serves up exactly that. As night falls, the Capitol Theatre, one of Florida's oldest functioning theaters, takes center stage with everything from musicals to comedy acts on the bill.

Blissful summers at Clearwater Beach
There's little better than spending the summer months enjoying a Gulf Coast getaway. Like the rest of Florida, Clearwater Beach benefits from seemingly endless sunny days and temperatures in the high 80s for much of July, August and September. That said, visitor activities are available for much of the year, so there's never really a bad time to hook yourself up with a Clearwater Beach vacation rental. Cooler water over the winter months may mean that swimming is off the menu, but still warm temperatures and year-round sunshine mean that sunbathing is most definitely not.

Discover an island paradise near Clearwater Beach
For many travelers staying in Clearwater Beach vacation rentals, a trip to Caladesi Island earns a firm spot on their itinerary. Options to get there include a 3-mile walk from Clearwater Beach, a jaunt in a kayak along Dunedin Causeway or a ferry ride from Honeymoon Island State Park. Once you've arrived, expect to find the unspoiled surroundings offering a memorable backdrop for your adventures. Relaxing on the white-sand beach is certainly a popular pastime but those with a little more get up and go will find meandering hiking trails, beachcombing and wildlife watching are all part of the deal.
