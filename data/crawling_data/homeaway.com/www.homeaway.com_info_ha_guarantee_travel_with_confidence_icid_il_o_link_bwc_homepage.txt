Want your stay covered by the
Book with Confidence Guarantee?

Most of our listings are eligible for this protection—just look for the Book with Confidence Guarantee icon on the property’s listing page.

What is a registered payment method?

While many of our listings accept online payment with a credit card directly through HomeAway, we allow properties to designate alternate accepted methods of payment. If an alternate method of payment is used, you would receive detailed payment instructions from the owner or property manager for your reservation on HomeAway’s website.

Supported payment methods:
Credit card, PayPal, bank-to-bank transfer, personal check, e-check,Chèques-Vacances, national credit card, MOIP, Bcash, MercadoPago, PagSeguro, ELV/SEPA direct debit, Pagos en linea PSE, PayU Latam, iDeal, BPay.

Never pay by cash, checks made out to cash, or instant money transfer services such as Western Union or MoneyGram.
