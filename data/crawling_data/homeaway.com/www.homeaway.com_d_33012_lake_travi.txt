Fun-filled Days Are Yours at Your Lake Travis Rental House

Lake Travis is a large, man-made lake located within the Austin metropolitan area, and it is a crown gem in the Texas Hill Country. You will love splashing and playing in the lake with family and friends, and the area offers much more for you to see and do as well. The best way to experience all that the lake has to offer is to treat yourself to a lovely Lake Travis rental house onto or close to the lake. These lake houses boast great views or lake access, a barbecue grill, a hot tub or pool, a large kitchen, spacious bedrooms and much more.

Outdoor Recreation

When you visit the Lake Travis or
Texas Hill Country
area during the warmer months of the year, you will want to spend ample time outdoors enjoying the refreshing water of the lake. You can rent a boat at one of the nearby boat rental companies, or you can go to area parks, such as Windy Point, Sandy Point or Pace Bend State Park to enjoy fun on the shoreline of the lake. When you want a departure from the lake, hiking opportunities abound in this area. Some of the top hiking spots include Hamilton Pool, Pedernales Falls State Park and McKinney Falls State Park.

Shopping

The Austin metropolitan area is one of the largest in the state, and this means that there are some prime shopping opportunities available for you to enjoy close to your
Lago Vista
or Lake Travis vacation rental home. For example, you can shop at The Domain, Lakeline Mall, the outlet malls in Round Rock or San Marcos, Barton Creek Mall and several other top locations. There are hundreds of brand name shops and department stores at these combined shopping destinations, providing you with the opportunity to enjoy several days of endless shopping fun while in the area.

Wineries

The Hill Country is one of the top wine-growing areas in the country, and you can take self-guided tours or guided tours of the wineries while you are in the area. Some of the wineries are located close to Lake Travis, such as the Lakeview Winery, the Flat Creek Estate and the Stone House Vineyard. However, there are also dozens of other wineries throughout the Hill Country, including in areas close to Burnet, Fredericksburg and more.

Weather

The Lake Travis and Austin metropolitan area is widely known as having some of the best weather in the country because of its mild fall, winter and spring months. However, the summers can be downright hot, and the lake provides you with a great way to refresh yourself and cool off on hot summer days. Average highs in the summer are in the 90s, but 100-degree days are common. The average low during these months is in the 70s. During the winters, the average high is in the mid-60s to 70s, and the average low is in the 40s and 50s. The wettest months of the year are May, June and October.

How to Get There

If you are traveling into the Lake Travis area, you will find that reaching the Austin metropolitan area is easy to do. You can fly into the Austin-Bergstrom International airport or take a bus. From there, you can rent a car or take your own car the rest of the way to Lake Travis. This is a sprawling and winding lake that has many access points throughout the region, so it is best to use your online mapping tools to locate the exact area of the lake that you want to reach after you arrive in the Austin metropolitan area.
