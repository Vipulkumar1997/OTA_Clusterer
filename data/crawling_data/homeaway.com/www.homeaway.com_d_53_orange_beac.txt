Relaxing Beach Vacation at an Orange Beach Vacation Home

Your dream of a relaxing vacation on a sun-kissed beach can come true when you book a reservation for an Orange Beach vacation home. Orange Beach is a popular vacation destination in sunny Alabama, providing you with ample opportunities for sightseeing, recreation and fun. Many condos in the area have a premier beachfront location that means you do not have to get in your car to have access to the sand and surf. Condos may also have a balcony, great views, a full kitchen, a BBQ grill and other amenities for you and your family or friends to enjoy.
Things to Do
Outdoor Recreation

There is no end to the fun possibilities that you can enjoy when you make a trip to beautiful Orange Beach. From your
condo in Alabama
, you will have easy access to the beach that you came to enjoy, and you may spend hours each day building sandcastles, looking for seashells and playing in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, there are other fun activities that you can enjoy while you are in the area. For example, you can go parasailing, deep sea fishing, snorkeling, jet skiing or sailing. There are also fun eco tours available that can help you to enjoy the best of what Orange Beach has to offer.

Attractions

While the beach near your
accommodations
may occupy a significant portion of your time while on vacation, keep in mind that there are plenty of other activities and attractions to enjoy. For example, hiking enthusiasts will love exploring the popular Hugh S. Branyon Backcountry Trail, which will take you several miles through the wilderness. Adventure Island is fun for the whole family, and you can enjoy amusement park style rides and games here. There is also a waterfront park that has picnic tables, sports venues and more for you to enjoy.

Nightlife

When the sun goes down in Orange Beach, there is much to see and do. There are some delicious seafood restaurants in the area, and many have live music and a full bar. Some of the options for you to explore include the Live Bait Nightclub, Island Time Daiquiris, Snappers Lounge, Cosmos Restaurant and Bar, the Undertow, the Cigar Bar and others.

Weather

The weather in Orange Beach can be undeniably stunning throughout much of the year thanks to the area's humid subtropical climate. This type of climate is known for having hot, humid summers that are perfect for fun-filled days at the beach. The winters in this area are generally mild and relatively short, and the spring and fall months are breezy and pleasant. Rainfall can be significant, and this is especially true during the summer months. However, there are more than 200 average sunny days per year as well, making it easy to plan a trip when the weather will be nice.

How to Get There

If you are planning to travel into the Orange Beach area,  you have a few travel options to consider. You can fly into the Pensacola or Mobile airports, and you can rent a car to travel the rest of the way to the area. Whether you rent a car or drive into Orange Beach in your own car, you can easily take Interstate 10 to Highway 98 southbound. Highway 98 takes you right into Orange Beach. There are also several marinas in Orange Beach as well as surrounding waterfront communities, such as Gulf Shores and Perdido Key, which have private marinas where you can dock your boat.


Attractions In and Around Gulf Shores (and vicinity)
First time in Gulf Shores (and vicinity) and looking for places to see? Don’t miss cultural highlights like Gulf Shores Museum, Orange Beach Indian and Sea Museum and Holmes Medical Museum. If some outdoor time is on the agenda, soak up some sun at Gulf Shores Beach.
Don’t forget to buy tickets if you plan to attend a game or event at Foley Sportsplex. Also while in town, you can visit Foley Railroad Museum, Pate's Country Music Hall or Waterville USA.
