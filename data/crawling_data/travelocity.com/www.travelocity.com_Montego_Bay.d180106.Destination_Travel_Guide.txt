Montego Bay Vacations

Are you ready for some fun in the sun? Montego Bay is the perfect place to go for a relaxing beach vacation. The city is also full of interesting historical sites, and it hosts a variety of world-class festivals. There's something for everyone in Montego Bay.

Major Attractions
If you want to learn more about the history of Montego Bay, visit Rose Hall, a former sugar plantation built in 1770. You can go during the day, or you can take a candle-lit evening tour and learn about the house's haunted history. If it's sunny, check out the Ras Nantango Gallery and Garden, which features two unique fantasy-themed gardens. Of course, no trip to Montego Bay Jamaica is complete without a visit to the beach. Doctor's Cave Beach is a favorite for both tourists and locals, and Cornwall Beach has beautiful, pure white sand. Most of these attractions are close to major
Montego Bay hotels
.
Festivals and Events
Jazz lovers should go to Montego Bay in January when the city hosts its annual Jamaica Jazz Festival. The festival often attracts big-name artists, and it also showcases many talented up-and-comers. Or, if you're more of a reggae fan, check out the Reggae Sumfest held every July. If you're going to be in Montego Bay during the first week of August, you can participate in the Emancipation and Independence Celebration. This event includes music, street dances, plenty of delicious local food and stage shows. Montego Bay vacations are always more fun when they coincide with one of these festivals. If you're ready to book your vacation, browse through Travelocity, where you can search through over 400 airlines and more than 510,000 hotels worldwide. You'll find plenty of Montego Bay all-inclusive deals and low-priced
Montego Bay car rentals
. A trip to Montego Bay is easy to plan when you book a vacation package through Travelocity.
