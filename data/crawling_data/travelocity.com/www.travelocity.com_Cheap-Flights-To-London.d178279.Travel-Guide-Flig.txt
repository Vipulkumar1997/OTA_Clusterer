Flights To London
Walking along the River Thames, the Old Globe just a stone’s throw away, you’re overtaken by a sense of possibility. You’re reminded of Samuel Johnson’s famous observation: “Sire, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.” Yes, you think, no matter what your life’s ambitions are, they can surely come to fruition here. Steeped in history and constantly abuzz, London is more than just the “Big Smoke.” It’s also a hub of government, international food, and retail therapy. The world is a stage, and London is your stage left.
Book a flight to London on Travelocity today, and soon you’ll be listening to the famed chimes of Big Ben and stopping for afternoon tea. If you’ve left your heart in San Francisco, you’ll find it again in the capital of England.
Transportation from LHR
Most international London flights land at Heathrow Airport (LHR), though the city has many other airports, as well. If your travels take you elsewhere in Europe, Gatwick, Luton, and Stanstead airports can get you there. Once you’re wheels down at LHR, you’re about 20 miles from the center of London. The fastest way to the center of the city is the Heathrow Express, which is just a 15-minute ride between the airport and Paddington Station.
The Tube, or London Underground, offers a more-cost effective route that takes about an hour. You can also hop into a famous London black cab travel from the terminals to anywhere in the city. If you want a stylish first-class ride, book a chauffeur service. If you dare to drive on the “wrong” side of the road and want to explore the English countryside outside London on your own schedule, rent a car when you book your plane tickets to London.
Hotels Near London Airports
The beautiful hotels of London take your breath away before you even cross the threshold. The architecture harkens back to a time when the Tower of London was in full swing and horse and carriage rides were commonplace. Once inside, lavish chandeliers and modern furniture brings you back to the present.
