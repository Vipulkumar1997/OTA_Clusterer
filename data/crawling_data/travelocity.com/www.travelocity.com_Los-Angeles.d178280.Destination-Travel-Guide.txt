Los Angeles Vacations

If glitz, glamor, and gorgeous scenery speak to you, a trip to this city is everything you could ask for.  Vacations in Los Angeles, California, open the doors to an inspiring and magical place with an energy that's palpable from the moment you arrive. From Universal Studios to the Huntington Library and all the way to Venice Beach, the City of Angels is unlike anywhere else. So, whether you're viewing the landscape from the impressive J. Paul Getty Museum or having barbecue in Koreatown, you'll feel the city's wonderful vibe. Ride it like a wave, wise wanderer, and let one of our Los Angeles vacations pull you in for good.

Hotels in Los Angeles
The crashing waves of California’s coast are closer than ever when you book a Travelocity vacation package in Los Angeles, CA. If this is your first trip to the Golden State and you’re not sure where to stay, here are four of the most popular hotel options:
Hilton Los Angeles Airport
: If convenience is what you seek, the Hilton might be perfect for you. Located less than half a mile from LAX, this huge hotel is also close to the city’s convention center and many other attractions. The modern guestrooms here include marble accents and handcrafted beds, as well as high-definition televisions and desks in case you need to work. The on-site Italian restaurant ensures you won’t have to go far for a bite to eat, and the Hilton’s fitness center and heated outdoor pool can help keep your body toned and relaxed.
Loews Hollywood Hotel
: Just steps from Hollywood’s Walk of Fame and the city’s famous Chinese Theatre, this ritzy hotel is home to elegant rooms with finely appointed furnishings. A few quarters here provide views of LA’s skyline, while others offer glimpses of the Hollywood Hills. Suites are available for those searching for some extra space, while the heated outdoor pool presents the perfect way to unwind after a long day. You’ll also find a hip restaurant and fully stocked cocktail bar at the luxurious Loews.
Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport
: Within 1 mile of LAX and less than 12 miles from the Santa Monica Pier and LA’s Museum of Art, this practical hotel might not be as flashy as some of the city’s other accommodation, but you’ve always appreciated simplicity. Upgraded suites with sofabeds are available, and the Four Points has a sports bar, restaurant, and coffee shop on-site to quench your thirst or please your palate. There’s also an always-open exercise center at the hotel, and a heated outdoor pool offering wonderful views.
Fairfield Inn & Suites Los Angeles LAX/El Segundo
: If you’re seeking contemporary accommodations not far from the airport, look no further than the Fairfield Inn. By serving complimentary meals each morning and providing guests with free internet access throughout the day, this hotel is easy to love. Shuttle service is also available for no extra charge, and the fully featured fitness room is another nice touch.
Major Attractions
The hotels included with some Los Angeles package deals are so nice that you may not want to leave, but one trip to the vibrant Venice Beach will keep you out for good. If you love beaches and delicious food, the Santa Monica Pier is also worth a stop. Malibu Beach, meanwhile, is a surfer's delight, while Rodeo Drive is a fashion enthusiast's dream. If you want to imagine what it would it's like to be rich and famous, go and walk around Beverly Hills. To see a real celebrity, however, head over to Hollywood Boulevard, then stay for all of its great bars and eateries. If you can find a deal on car rentals in LA, you should cruise along Mulholland Drive and soak up the scenery. Finally, Downtown LA has plenty of architectural masterpieces, such as the Walt Disney© Concert Hall, as well as sports games, including Dodgers baseball and Lakers basketball.
Festivals and Events
As you look for vacation packages in LA, the list of notable festivals and events in LA is almost endless, but the following should not be missed: the Los Angeles Marathon in February, the LA Gay Pride in June, Independence Day celebrations in July, Nisei Week Japanese Festival in August, the LA County Fair in September, and Day of the Dead (Dia de Los Muertos) in the beginning of November.
Travelocity makes it easier than ever to find a cheap vacation in Los Angeles in just minutes. Check out our selection of deals today, and you’ll be on your way to this famous city before you know it.
Accommodation in Los Angeles
