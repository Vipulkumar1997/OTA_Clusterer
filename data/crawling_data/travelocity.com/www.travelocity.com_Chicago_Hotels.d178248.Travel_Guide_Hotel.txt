Our Guide To Chicago Hotels
Getting to Chicago
The Windy City has two major airports, so arriving in the land of baseball and deep-dish pizza is pretty easy. Whether you land at Midway International Airport or O’Hare International Airport, you’re just a short drive from the heart of the city; Midway is 10 minutes from downtown Chicago and O’Hare is just 17 miles away. Grab a taxi or rental car at the terminal and you’re off to unpack. With cheap hotels in Chicago  in some of the hottest neighborhoods, you’ll be saving cash and exploring your favorite Chi-Town attractions like a pro within an hour of landing.












Where To Stay In Chicago
Centrally Located Hotels:
Chicago Marriott Magnificent Mile
InterContinental Chicago
Best Luxury Hotels:
The Peninsula
The Langham
Best Family-Friendly Hotels:
Embassy Suites Chicago Downtown
Kimpton Hotel Palomar
Getting Around Chicago
Most major attractions are located in the heart of downtown. The city is perfectly manageable using public transportation, taxis, Uber/Lyft, and your own two feet.
Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)
operates the buses and trains, and
METRA
runs trains to the outlying suburbs. If you want to explore the area on your own time, consider renting a car.
TIP: Chicago traffic can be stressful—especially during rush hour, on the weekend, and during major sporting events or festivals. Summer is construction season, and you’ll see plenty of snow during the winter. If this concerns you, stick with public transportation.
What Not to Miss In Chicago
Willis Tower or 360 Chicago
For a true overview of the city, head up. Both the Willis Tower and 360 Chicago offer fantastic views of the city from towering heights. The
Willis Tower

has “The Ledge,” a glass box that extends out from the building, allowing unobstructed views of the city 1,353 feet below. Still haven’t quenched your thirst for heights? Head to
360 Chicago
, located in the John Hancock Center,
and check out “Tilt.” Visitors enter a glass cage that tilts away from the building and gaze out over the city from a height of over a thousand feet. Neither experience is for the faint of heart!
Art Institute of Chicago
The Art Institute of Chicago was named the top museum in the world by Trip Advisor in 2014, and it houses one of the largest permanent collections in the United States. Some of the featured artists include Picasso, Monet, and Rivera, but there are thousands more to admire.
Millennium Park
Millennium Park is centrally located parallel to Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan, and it’s the perfect place to gather with a group of friends. During the summer there are free concerts, performances, and festivals, and during the rest of the year it is a great place to relax and people-watch. The main attraction is the “Cloud Gate” sculpture. Most Chicagoans refer to it as “The Bean” because it looks like, well, a giant silver bean. Chicago’s skyline reflects from all its shining sides, and you can even walk underneath the sculpture.
Adjacent to this is the Crown Fountain. The fountains are actually two 50-foot towers that display images of Chicago residents on a giant video screen. When the face on the screen smiles, water comes pouring from their mouth, dousing the eager children gathered below.
Between Millennium Park and the waterfront is the beautiful Maggie Daley Park. With playgrounds for all ages, an ice skating ribbon in the winter, and a rock climbing wall, it is a magical escape in the city for families.
The Beach
It’s hard to miss the 26 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline that borders downtown Chicago. The beaches are open to the public, so find a beach near your hotel, grab your towels, and walk or take a taxi to the shoreline of your choice. Montrose Beach, North Avenue Beach, and Oak Street Beach are all worth a visit.
Where to Eat
Chicago is a city made for foodies—there’s almost too many good restaurants to list. Obvious choices for deep dish pizza are Giordano’s, Pequod’s, and Lou Malnati’s. Craving a Chicago dog? Head to Portillo’s and be sure to grab a slice of chocolate cake for dessert. Want to try one of the better restaurants in town? Find something owned by Rick Bayless (Xoco, Frontera Grill), the Boka Group (Girl & The Goat, Boka), or Paul Kahan (The Publican, Big Star) —you won’t be disappointed. Don’t forget to try multiple servings of the cheese and caramel popcorn (Chicago mix) at Garrett Popcorn, because there is nothing like the original.

Hyatt Regency McCormick Place

Recent Stay at Hyatt South Chicago
Upgraded to a corner room with views of lake and city, worth every penny.  Booked through Travelocity and therefore they would not allow me to upgrade to valet, finding hotels love to throw "you booked through a third party" in your face as a means to not have to do something.

Jaslin Hotel
3.0
Close to McCormick and in the heart of Chinatown
The Jaslin hotel was a last minute find for me. It is a new hotel having only been operating a little over a yr. The room was very comfortable. The best mattress I've slept on in a hotel that I can remember even at higher priced hotels. I was disappointed that there was no microwave in the room. Guests have to warm food in the microwave in the lobby. There should be at least one per floor if not optimally in the guests room. There was no dressing mirror in the bedroom, it is in the living room where there should be a small dining table. In my particular room the light switches by the bed and the entering the bathroom from the bedroom were not placed optimally. The shower lacked grab bars but had an awesome shower head spray. Annie, who sets up continental breakfast was cheerful and kept the coffee hot & served with a smile as plentiful as the limited breakfast items. Check-in was awkward. We were informed(10:30a)that our room was ready, but that there would be a $50.00 early check-in surcharge if we wanted to access it before (3:00p). Even though we paid for that FULL day & the room was ready? We didn't ask them to ready the room. They also lack a business center and only offer you (1) one PC no printer...you must email what you want printed to the hotel and they will print it for you.Talk about awkward & inconvenient & no fax either. No lobby bathroom access unless you have a hotel guest pass key. Most all the cleaning staff is Chinese & few understand English. Oh well.
