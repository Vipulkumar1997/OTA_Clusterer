Our Guide To Cheap Hotels In NYC
Getting to New York City
Thousands of people fly into New York on any given day. In fact, London to New York is the world’s busiest intercontinental route! With three nearby major airports (JFK International, Newark International, and LaGuardia), Travelocity flights are competitive and easy to come by from nearly any city in the world. And thanks to extensive public transit options, getting to your hotel is a breeze.












What to Know When You Land
Transportation: Between the subway and buses, you can get anywhere you want to go—the A line alone runs 31 miles through Manhattan and Queens. And if you’re carrying a lot of luggage, we recommend a taxi. It won’t come cheap, but it can be worth it, especially when you’ve saved cash with our cheap hotels in NYC. No matter what you choose, remember this: Leave yourself some extra time. New Yorkers may walk fast, but their public transportation doesn’t always keep up.
Wi-Fi Hot Spots: Fashion and food aren’t enough—New York is now leading the world when it comes to public Wi-Fi, too. Settle in with a latte at Bryant Park, Battery Park, or Prospect Park and plan out your itinerary without using all your data. What about Central Park, you ask? It’s too large to cover the whole park, but there are eight hotspots scattered throughout, and a Google search can help you find them.
These Boots Were Made for Walking: Even if you’re not in a hurry, a comfortable pair of shoes will be your best friend in this city. From strolling through Central Park to wandering amongst the paintings at the Museum of Modern Art, using your feet is a must. Got a fancy dinner date? Take a page from the classic New Yorker playbook: throw those stilettos in your purse and wear flats until you arrive.
Climate Conditions
Four Seasons isn’t just a top luxurious New York hotel—it’s also the climate of this northeastern U.S. city. Summers are warm and may be humid; winters are chilly and can be snowy. In autumn, the air is crisp, the leaves are changing, and the temperatures are sweater-perfect. However, depending on what you’re looking for, New York is always on. During the holiday season, the Rockefeller Center tree glitters with thousands of lights as ice skaters twirl below. In the summer, roof decks open and an exuberant vibe is felt throughout the city.
Top 3 Things to Do in NYC
1. St. Bart's Church (1 block from Waldorf Astoria New York)
Also known by its long name—Saint Bartholomew's Episcopal Church—this historic place of worship has existed since 1835 as skyscrapers and corporate buildings grew up around it. Visit between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to tour the impressive Byzantine and Romanesque architecture, attend an organ recital or concert, or just enjoy the peace and quiet of this oasis in the heart of the city.
2. Intrepid Museum (1 mile from Row NYC hotel)
The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum is here to offer visitors an experience that’s a little bit different. After all, this wouldn’t be the greatest city on earth if it didn’t have offerings as diverse as its residents—and visitors. Admire a real space shuttle, submarine, and even an aircraft carrier at one of America’s best museums of its kind.
3. Statue of Liberty (6 miles from Roosevelt Hotel)
If you’re feeling patriotic after learning about American innovation at the Intrepid Museum, make this iconic landmark your next stop. In fact, make it a stop no matter what. Ferry your way over from Battery Park, NY or Liberty State Park, NJ and make the 354-step climb to the crown. A stop at Ellis Island is worth the time, as well.
We’re glad you’re so excited about planning your trip to the "Big Apple," traveler. But you’ll need a place to lay your head after such busy days, and we can help with that. Whether you’re looking for a total splurge or cheap hotels, NYC delivers. Book here on Travelocity, and you’ll find everything you need, all in one place. Except those comfy walking shoes, of course. Be sure to pack them separately.

Large room for New York City  breakfast was nice .
Room was in the basement which was a bit depressing but the room was larger than other New York City   hotels. It was clean except for the long black hair on my pillow.
