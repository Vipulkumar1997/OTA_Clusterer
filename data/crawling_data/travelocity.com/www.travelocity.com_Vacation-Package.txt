Top International Vacations
Sometimes it feels good to fly well beyond your comfort zone. Experiencing life to the melody of a foreign language or the aroma of new cuisine gives you a fresh take on the world. Hear the Big Ben clock sing in person, sink your teeth into a warm Parisian croissant, and practice your French—global travel has endless possibilities. Book an international vacation package with Travelocity, and jet-setting won't deplete your day trip budget.
It wouldn't be a proper
London vacation
without a jaunt on the top level of an iconic red double-decker bus. Ride one on your way to afternoon tea along the River Thames, or make your way to the West End for a lively theater production.
The City of Lights is sending out a siren song. It beckons you to walk along the Champs-Élysées and feed your inner artist at the Louvre. When you embark on a
Paris vacation
, you'll immediately be enchanted by the home of the Eiffel Tower.
Delight your sense of taste on a
Montreal vacation
, where poutine is just the beginning. Head west and embark on an epic winery tour, or show up in Little Italy for a huge slice of not-so-humble maple pie.
You know what they say: When in Rome, do as the Romans do. We guess that means your
Rome vacation
will be filled with authentic pasta and afternoons spent sipping espresso on a café patio. And that sounds alright.
As you treat yourself to stellar views from the observation deck on the CN Tower it will dawn on you: This is the
Toronto vacation
you've always dreamed of. A stop at the Royal Ontario Museum and visit to the Distillery District will round out your trip to the capital of Ontario.
