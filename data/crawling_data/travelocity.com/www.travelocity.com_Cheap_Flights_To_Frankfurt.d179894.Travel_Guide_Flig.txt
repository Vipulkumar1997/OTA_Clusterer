Flights To Frankfurt
Frankfurt, Germany has long been heralded as the business and financial capital of the country, but the thriving city is more than that. As you fly into Frankfurt International Airport (FRA), you can't help but feel a bit of excitement as you look out your window at the futuristic cityscape. The explorer inside of you will be itching to see Romerberg with its small shops and diverse cafes. Be sure to wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes because you will undoubtedly want to walk across the historic Eiserner Bridge for a breathtaking view of the city's skyline. If you want to soak up the city's medieval past, be sure to tour the Bornheim and you will swear you have stepped back into the era of knights and ladies.
Transportation from FRA
Passengers on flights to Frankfurt often opt to stay at
hotels near Frankfurt International airport
because they provide free airport transfers to guests. If you are not staying close to the airport, you can take a bus into downtown Frankfurt from the airport.
