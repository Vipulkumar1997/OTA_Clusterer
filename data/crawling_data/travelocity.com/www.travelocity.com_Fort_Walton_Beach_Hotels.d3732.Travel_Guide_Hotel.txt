Our Guide To Fort Walton Beach Hotels
Along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico is a stretch of coastline in the state of Florida known as the Emerald Coast. Why? Because it looks like Emerald City from The Wizard of Oz was melted down and spread through these waters. And on this coast is a string of beach towns that are perfect for your next getaway, but one stands out in particular. Fort Walton Beach is the definition of a leisure resort town. And you love the life of leisure. One hour in a lounge chair by the pool or on the beach will prove that. And when it’s time for bed, the options for suitable Fort Walton Beach lodging are seemingly endless. You just have to choose the best one for you and go.












Where to stay in Fort Walton Beach
There are few things better in life than staying at a beachfront hotel and waking up with stunning views of a scintillating ocean. A cool sea breeze flows through your windows as the scent of warm saltwater fills the hotels in Fort Walton Beach. And you remember just how lucky you are to be relaxing in such a dreamy location. But with all the incredible places to stay in Fort Walton Beach, the decision to choose just one can be a little difficult so we’ve put together a small list of the best places to stay in Fort Walton Beach. Check them out for yourself:
Hilton Sandestin Beach Golf Resort
: Settled on the pearly white sand on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, this remarkable accommodation is perfect for a relaxing getaway. With rooms like the deluxe junior and parlor suites, you’ll be living in the lap of luxury in this home away from home. Enjoy a meal at one of the many on-site restaurants that feature everything from grilled steaks to sushi rolls. And before it’s all said and done, be sure to put your swing to the test on one of the local golf courses.
SunDestin Beach Resort by Wyndham
: If you thought we were going to steer you clear of the beach, think again. At this lovely place in the sand, you’ll be afforded all the amenities you could ask for. Gaze out across the Gulf of Mexico from the deck of the oceanfront pool area or get a complimentary beach chair and umbrella and set up camp in the sand. When you’re ready to venture away from the resort grounds, book yourself a spot with one of the many deep-sea fishing charters in the area.
Wyndham Garden Fort Walton Beach
: Located on beautiful Okaloosa Island, one of the more incredible Fort Walton Beach hotels will have you sleeping just steps from the soothing waters of the Gulf. Start your morning off with a walk along the water before heading back to the hotel for breakfast at one of the on-site restaurants. Spend the rest of the day hanging out at the Gulfarium Marine Adventure Park where you can experience animal encounters featuring creatures like dolphins, penguins, and stingrays. Head back to the resort and enjoy a happy hour cocktail to toast the end of a fantastic day.
Sandestin Golf and Beach Resort
: This unique resort offers you the option to either stay bayside or beachside and has amazing amenities and services. You can take advantage of the two complimentary four-hour bike rentals each day, a free one-hour kayak rental per day, and access to a resort tram service. Feel like getting ultra-relaxed? Head to the spa and get a custom aromatherapy massage followed by a seaweed and green clay body wrap.
See Fort Walton Beach
While it’s hard to peel yourself off a beach as picturesque as this, it is worth leaving the sand and venturing into town. Considering its rich Native American history, check out the Fort Walton Mound—an archeological site that dates back to 850 CE and stands 12-feet high. The Indian Temple Mound Museum displays artifacts from Indian tribes, European explorers, pirates, and early settlers for an even closer look at how our ancestors lived. Keep the museum theme going with a visit to the Air Force Armament Museum located at nearby Eglin Air Force Base. Aircraft like a B-17 Flying Fortress, a B-52 Stratofortress, and an F-10 Starfighter look like they’re ready to take flight.
Your long days stuck in the same routine are coming to a close. Not forever, but for a week at least. When you book a vacation through Travelocity, you’re guaranteed to find an unbelievable value for a low price. Check out our incredible list of cheap hotels near Fort Walton Beach and make a reservation immediately. The mystical green waters of the Emerald Coast are requesting your presence and you should oblige.

Awsome stay
Came down for a weekend stay, can't tell you how pleased we were for our getaway. Will definitely stay there again. Close to everything we wanted to see and do. Only draw back was the parking, long walk to the rooms if your on the backside of the building. Otherwise it was a perfect place to spend some time right on the beach!!!!

Okay place but I don't recommend taking the kids
The hotel was is decent condition not perfect but perfect for the price. It is definitely in need of some minor repairs but the room was super clean and smelled great unlike other reviews. There aren't any plugs near the beds to charge your appliances but a few places to plug things in around the room. The bed was a bit too short for my 6'3 husband. His ankles and feet hung off the bed. Around 9am (our last day), a woman (an addict with pipe in hand) went around knocking at each door looking for a friend who frequently roomed there and did "stay overs". I informed the manager, who seemed somewhat concerened and interested in her description. He said that he'd call the cops if he saw her (not fully conviced if he was being honest). Other than this incident, the hotel, other guests, and the area felt pretty safe. Overall, it was a great place for couples/groups on a budget. I might stay again but I won't bring my kids here.

A pleasant surprise
we stumbled upon this place by accident after my reservation for another place fell through. I read lots of bad reviews but had to take it since my lodging budget was tied up in my reservation and wouldn't be refunded immediately.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a clean room near many venues we ended up using.  the parking lot was well lit and seemed safe.  The only problem I had was the staff. the front desk girl...who I think was the owner, told me I needed to be with my kids at all times as she was checking me in. I wondered if she were stereotyping me. Also, the maintenance man shook his head and rolled his eyes at my husband after my husband greeted him. Not sure what that was about.
