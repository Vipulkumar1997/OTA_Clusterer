Nice and clean



Pros:

Pretty quiet and clean.



Cons:

Breakfast offering



Location:

Need a car to get to things but we wanted a quieter place away from hub bub and airport traffic.  Location fit that criterium.



Nice and clean pool, room, lobby.
"Breakfast offering" was meager so bring your own breakfast.
Facilities had some special events like ice cdream and some free movies.  Nice.

Amazing time. Comfortable, clean, courteous.



Location:

Love the Shuttle to the strip!



We had a great time and was pleased with all aspects of the hotel. Plan on making it our place to stay on our return visit to see the "kid's".

Not what was advertised. Dirty...



Pros:

Location away from strip, parking was OK. Check in staff is pleasant, but don't mention that there is no service unless you want to clean it yourself.



Cons:

Tell the truth. Hotel rooms are not "suites".  
Clean the room. Every day. Just CLEAN IT.



Location:

Location is WAY off the strip. Grocery stores, gas station, fast food, etc. nearby. Not much to do in neighborhood, but OK if you just need a bed.



"All Suite" is simply a lie. A"studio suites" is just plain hotel room, not a suite. Too bad management feels a need to misrepresent . Not a bad hotel room - decent size,  but not what was promised. 

Room was pretty dim - insufficient light. Furnishings OK, but spartan. Air conditioning is controlled by a thermostat next to the door (in our room). most controls are locked out (very limited cooling, fan is on or off). Not impressed. "One bedroom suitre"  has a single thermostat located in a remote corner, so poor temp control. 

Breakfast was a few bagels in a room on the third floor (good luck finding it). Again, dumb move by management. It would be better to just not advertise breakfast than to do this. Management seems addicted to overpromising. 

There is no maid service. Stayed two nights - zero maid service. Talked to guy next door - 3 days, same thing. No sign about it and no mention from check-in staff. I am OK having a choice to keep towels , but to just skip cleaning altogether is unacceptable. Even the cheapest hotels clean the rooms. Asked at checkout - they have a "only clean every 4th day" policy. They said they will can make supplies available for guests to clean their own rooms. 

Management makes excuses why this is OK, but it is simplynot. (watch response below -  management will be "disappointed  they did not fully meet my expectations and will apologize for the challenges I experienced during my visit") - Good service is better than canned apologies!

Grt Location Close to Strip but Away from Chaos!



Pros:

Clean, comfortable, washer and dryer in room, small kitchen with full size appliances, felt like home away from home!



Cons:

Better maps showing you how to get to your room from parking lots and lobby.  It was a tiny bit confusing!



Location:

5 min. from the Vegas Strip (New York New York, Excalibur, MGM Grand, Tropicana)  10 min away from parking at a casino. Near gas, fast food, etc.



The Suite we stayed in was beautiful and clean!  Great change from smoked filled casinos and extremely family friendly.  Big enough kitchen area to cook a meal and take a break from eating out.  Bed linen was clean and beds were extremely comfortable.  Nice living room area with pull out sofa. Bathroom was large and hotel offered plenty of towels and toiletries.  Extra Pool towels right in the room already for you.  A great bonus was the washer and dryer in the closet in the room.  I think I'm going to pass on staying on the Vegas Strip from now on!  It took us 5 min. to reach the strip, 10 min to park at the nearby hotels, and it was nice to get away from the chaos once we were over it.  It really made you feel like you were in a home away from home!  Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a nice place near the strip!  Enjoy!

Nice resort away from Strip



Pros:

Location



Cons:

Explanation of layout and use of key



Location:

Location away from LV Strip was great. Plenty of food available close by.



Very nice resort for a short stay. It was a little noisy because of event(EDC) going on in Vegas. After young crowd left everything was fine. At first layout was confusing but figured it out quickly. Would stay here in future.

Great timeshare resort 2 miles from strip.



Pros:

The unit was beautiful and spacious.  Close to Strip and had shuttle to/from Strip.  Elevator was a hugh plus.  Staff was excellent.  Enjoyed!



Location:

Location close to Strip as well as markets, dinning as well as fast food.



We were a family of four; Mom 89, Me 70 and two grandchildren 18 & 19.  We had a one bedroom with living room and full kitchen.  We were very comfortable.  Everything was close by.  It was easy to get in/out of complex which was beautifully maintained.  BIG PLUS was the elevator for Mom.  Pool are was great and there were activities planned throughout the week.  I will stay here again!  Thank you staff for the wonderful service.
