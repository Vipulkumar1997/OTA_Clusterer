Denver Vacations

In the majestic Rocky Mountains, Denver is the perfect pairing of wild landscapes and understated luxury—just like Rocky Mountain oysters and craft brews. With climbing, biking, and skiing opportunities around each turn, Denver vacations broaden your horizon to exhilarating experiences and higher perspectives. Nothing can keep you down when you visit The Mile-High City, whether you summit Mount Evans or visit the historic home of the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Book Denver package deals from late fall to early spring to hit the slopes, or plan a summer foray to soak up the sun as you browse the area farmers markets and ramble through the Rockies.

Top Hotels in Denver
The best vacation package in Denver, CO includes convenient flights and fabulous accommodations. As you mix and match your dreamy getaway, consider these guest favorites:
Hyatt Regency Denver at Colorado Convention Center
: Even if you don’t reach the top of a mountain, you’re in for some breathtaking views from your room in this Hyatt Regency hotel. Located a very short walk to the Colorado Convention Center and several performing arts venues, including Paramount Theater, it’s great for when you want to mix a little work with leisure. The full-service spa helps with the latter, too.
Magnolia Hotel Denver
: Every inch of the Magnolia speaks to Denver’s contemporary arts scene with clean lines, bold statement furnishings, and plush linens. The exterior is dripping with vintage charm and sits in good company among downtown landmarks, including Buell Theatre, built in 1908. Step out for a show after dinner in one of the hotel’s two restaurants.
Warwick Denver
: With comforting, earthy décor and fabulous views of North Capitol Hill, the Warwick Denver is the epitome of Colorado chic. You’ll be a short walk to the American Museum of Western Art and the Molly Brown House Museum, so go exploring before dinner at the hotel restaurant and a cozy evening read by the lobby fireplace.
Sheraton Denver Downtown Hotel
: Whether you’re planning a business trip or your next great getaway, this Sheraton is a relaxing place to start and end each day, and the business center and meeting room facilities make it easy to attend to your professional agenda. Of course, you’ll want to fit in a trip to the Denver Firefighters Museum and the Colorado State Capitol while you’re there.
From Museums to Mountaintops
Inspired by a scrappy past and an endless horizon, Denver boasts thrilling activities and cutting-edge arts. Impressive public parks—such as Washington Park and City Park—offer lakes, gardens, playing fields, and more. During warm weather months, the Lakeside and Elitch Gardens amusement parks are open for fun and carefree days. When you’re ready to discover Denver in detail, the U.S. Mint, Denver Art Museum, Children's Museum of Denver, and Denver Museum of Nature & Science are just some of the museums to check out during your vacations in Denver.
When you’re ready to trade the refinement of curated collections for the open trail and a little dirt on your hands, warm up your climbing and hiking skills at William F Hayden Green Mountain Park in nearby Lakewood, just 11 miles west of downtown Denver. To raise the challenge, keep driving west to the Front Range, where Katharine Lee Bates looked out from Pikes Peak over purple mountains majesty and fruited plains to pen “America the Beautiful.”
Festivals and Events
Book vacation packages in Denver from May through July to catch the most beloved local festivals. May features the popular Downtown Denver Festival of the Arts during Memorial Day weekend, with both fine arts and crafts on display. Come June, join in the revelry at the city's oldest cultural celebration, the Denver Greek Festival. For over 50 years, the Greek Festival has drawn crowds with its traditional music, joyous dancing, and scrumptious food. July's festival offerings include the Evergreen Jazz Festival, which proclaims itself as the best jazz festival anywhere. Traveling during the winter holidays? Surround yourself in the glow of Denver’s Parade of Lights.
Your journey to the Mile-High City will be an exquisite adventure, and Travelocity is here to offer you the best prices available, thanks to our price-matching guarantee. Book a cheap vacation in Denver that’s low on costs but high on life. That’s the Denver way, after all.
