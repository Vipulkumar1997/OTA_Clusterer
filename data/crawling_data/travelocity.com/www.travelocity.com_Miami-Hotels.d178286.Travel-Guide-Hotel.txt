Getting to Miami
You have a few options for arriving at your destination along Florida’s sun-kissed southeast coast: The simple choice is to fly into Miami International Airport (MIA) where most carriers land. From there, you are a few short minutes away from your South Beach Miami hotel and dipping your toes in the warm waters of the Atlantic. But two executive airports serve the area as well—Kendall-Tamiami and Opa-locka—if you’re looking to indulge the more luxurious side of life.












What to Know When You Land
Transportation:  Miami International is every bit a major airport, with a plethora of transportation options. Once you have deplaned and have luggage in-hand, you can grab a cab outside of baggage claim, or find a driver through any of the popular ride-share services. If you truly want to experience all that South Florida has to offer, we highly recommend securing a rental car from the airport—preferably a convertible—because it is Miami after all. Should you opt for it, public transportation is available, although it may not take you directly to your accommodations. Make sure to check if there is an airport shuttle service available—even most of the cheap hotels in Miami offer them.
Finding Your Way Around:  Exploring a new city is very exciting; it can also be a little daunting at times. One of the easy tips to help you get your bearings is that the ocean is always to the East. The city is primarily a grid, making it easy to know which direction you are heading. That said, you still need to know where your desired points of interest are located, and nobody wants to pull out the map while driving around to unintentionally broadcast that they are a tourist. We recommend downloading the Miami Mobile App. The city’s tourist board even has apps designed for specific neighborhoods, tours, and attractions.
Climate Conditions
Hopefully, you left the flannel at home. You’re simply not going to need it in Miami. The temperatures range from a "blistering" 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the dead of winter to a balmy 89 in midsummer. Those warmer temperatures are coupled with an increased chance of rain, though, making an umbrella a welcomed accessory to pack. For the most part though, your trip will be blue skies, golden sunshine, and white sandy beaches.
3 Things to Do in Miami
1. Jungle Island (4.1 miles from the Loews Miami Beach Hotel – South Beach)
Take your idea of a traditional zoo and feed it to the hippos. Jungle Island is an interactive experience that puts you up close-and-personal with exotic animals. Channel your inner-pirate and have your picture taken with a parrot on your shoulder at Parrot Cove. Monkey around with macaws and Squirrel Monkeys in the Manu Encounter. And, get to know your distant-yet-closest cousin at the Orangutan School.
2. Miami Jai Alai and Casino (0.6 miles from the Embassy Suites by Hilton Miami International Airport)
If exotic animals aren’t your thing, perhaps an exotic sport is more to your liking. Part racquetball and part lacrosse, jai-alai is all speed. In the world’s fastest sport, the goatskin ball can travel up to 185 miles per hour. Prefer a slower pace, yet the same level of excitement? Head over to the casino floor for some action at the slot machines, or take a chance with a session at one of their many e-table games like roulette and blackjack.
3. Marlins Park (2.9 miles from the Hilton Miami Downtown)
Perhaps your idea of entertainment is of a more traditional flavor. In that case, a trip to Marlins Park to see the Miami Marlins take on their MLB foes can only be matched by mom’s apple pie. Baseball isn’t the only attraction at the greenest stadium in the big leagues, though. You can rock out to national touring acts when the stadium gets turned into an open-air music venue, and raise a pint with a few thousand of your closest friends at South Florida’s largest Octoberfest.
The culture, climate, and colors of Miami are welcoming you like a sunrise over Biscayne Bay. Book your hotel in Miami with Travelocity today and you can experience everything the Magic City has to offer. You’ll be spellbound by the savings, as well as the city.

SpringHill Suites Miami Downtown/Medical Center

Great location close to downtown.
Staffs were friendly and attentive. Room and bathroom were very clean.  Air conditioning was cold as it should be specially  in Florida summer. Breakfast was plentiful with variety of selections from hot foods to beverages and cereals. Check in and check out were quick and easy. The gym was clean and adequate with clean towels provided.  Be aware of the $15 per night parking. Parking was tight but manageable.
