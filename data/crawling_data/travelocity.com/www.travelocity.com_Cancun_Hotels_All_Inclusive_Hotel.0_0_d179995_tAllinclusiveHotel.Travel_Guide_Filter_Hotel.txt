Getting to Cancun
Your time at a spectacular all-inclusive Cancun hotel begins with a flight to Cancun International Airport (CUN). The airport has routes to and from many major US cities; direct flights take off from cities including Boston, Chicago, Atlanta, and San Francisco. United States citizens need a passport to travel to Cancun, and upon landing you will be asked to fill out a visitor’s permit known as the Forma Migratoria Multiple (FMM).
What to Know When You Land
Transportation: Most Cancun all-inclusive hotels are in the Zona Hotelera, which is about 15 minutes from the airport. You can travel via bus or taxi. A quick note, wise wanderer: Taxis in Cancun don’t have meters, so you should negotiate your fare before your trip begins. Once you’re in the hotel district, you can get around via taxi or bus, or walk between resorts and by way of the beach on foot.
Language: Now that you’ve landed in paradise, you’ll need to order a drink. Spanish is the language of Cancun and Greater Mexico, so brush up on a few key phrases before you head south. You can greet people with a quick "Hola" and order a single beer with "Una cerveza, por favor." Language translation apps are your friend.
Helpful Tidbits: The U.S. dollar is often accepted at bars and other establishments in Cancun, but the official currency in the city is the Mexican peso. You’ll see most prices quoted in the local currency. Speaking of bars, wise wanderer, the drinking age in Mexico is 18. For this reason, the city attracts a lot of spring break students. Even though you can drink at 18 in Cancun, only travelers over the age of 21 are allowed to bring alcohol through U.S. customs on the way home. Each passenger is permitted 1 liter of liquor, duty-free.
Climate Conditions
Cancun is between 70 and 80 degrees throughout most of the year. The most sunshine happens in August, and the hottest month is June. You’ll find most travelers flocking to the tropical climate from October to May, so if you can stand the heat you’ll avoid crowds by visiting the city in the summer. If you arrive in September, you can expect some rain. The rest of the year, all you’ll need to pack are tank tops and warm weather bottoms to enjoy some fun in the sun.
3 Things to Do in Cancun
1. Visit Xel-Ha Park – (69 miles from GR Solaris Cancun & Spa)
You may never find a theme park as entrenched in beauty as Xel-Ha Park. You’ll snorkel through a natural aquarium and take a relaxing river tour. In the Xel-Ha cave, sunlight bathes you while nature’s soundtrack fills your ears. Climb to the Cliff of Courage, turn your palms to the sky, and then jump 16 feet to a turquoise pool below.
2. Tour the Tequila Museum – (0.3 miles from Gran Caribe Resort & Spa and ME Cancun)
The Tequila Herrandura Sensory Museum celebrates the tradition of good tequila right in the Hotel Zone. Learn about the history of this alluring liquor, how it’s made, and the legends of agave. Afterward, you can shop for a bottle of your own and indulge in a taste test befitting of a wise wanderer and drinker such as yourself.
3. Explore Chichen Itza – (132 miles from Fiesta Americana Condesa Cancun)
The parties in Cancun may pulsating, but nearby reminders of ancient civilization remain, standing at attention and offering space for quiet reflection. The sacred site of Chichen Itza is one example. These stone Mayan ruins are left over from the pre-Hispanic city by the same name. Buildings like the Warriors’ Temple and El Caracol observatory are available to the public and a wonderful contradiction to the hustle and bustle of life along the beach.
Cancun calls you to experience peaceful nature combined with nonstop parties in local clubs. Whether you’re headed to the popular destination with visions of colorful drinks or tranquil aquatic adventures in mind—you won’t be disappointed. When you book your hotel with Travelocity, your wise wandering is off to a great start.
