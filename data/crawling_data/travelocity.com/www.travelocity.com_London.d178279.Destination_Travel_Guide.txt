London Vacations

Thanks to traditions like the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace, the pageantry associated with royal family weddings, and cultural attractions such as the British Museum, vacations in London expose you to a rich tapestry of accessible opulence at every turn. Even if you've had London vacations in the past, it's unlikely that you were able to put a dent in the countless attractions that the city has to offer. So, why not visit all the heritage on the banks of the Thames again—or for the very first time? Founded by the Romans around 2,000 years ago, London is one of the most historically steeped cities in all the modern world. With over 8 million people and 300 languages spoken in the city alone, London is a true global city that welcomes all visitors with open arms. And, when you use Travelocity to book your holiday package in London, you’ll save enough money to make the Queen blush.

Major Attractions
You'll have a variety of options when it comes to hotels in London, some of which are just as historical as the surrounding sites. Dozens of iconic landmarks like Buckingham Palace and Big Ben are within a short walk or public transit distance. Take a ride on the London Eye or wander through Covent Garden, a popular shopping and tourist site. Feel like taking a bit of a break? Visit the London Zoo or go for a stroll through the expansive Hyde Park. Driving in London can be hectic, though, so it's best to do some research while purchasing vacation packages in London to determine if a rental car the right option for you.
London Hotels
In a city as historically fabled as London, it’s no surprise that many of its hotels are as prestigious as the quintessentially royal properties they neighbor. So, instead of staying at a run-of-the-mill roadway inns, a room at one of these emblematic accommodations should be in order:
St. Ermin’s Hotel, Autograph Collection
– Like a diamond set in the middle of two sapphires, St. Ermin’s is situated in the heart of Westminster right between the eponymous abbey and Buckingham Palace. The hotel’s classic architecture and antique interior design components are complemented by state-of-the-art technologies and modern amenities. After a day exploring the wonderful neighborhood, recharge your batteries with a classic British afternoon tea at the Tea Lounge at St. Ermin’s.
The Rembrandt
– Just south of Hyde Park, and equidistant from the Natural History Museum and the world-famous Harrod’s department store, the historic Rembrandt pampers its guests in understated elegance from the moment they step foot through the lobby door. Enjoy an aromatic exfoliation or other body-rejuvenating treatment at Aquilla Spa, savor a traditional roast lunch at the Palette Restaurant, and sip a proper Pimm’s No. 1 cocktail at the 1606 Lounge Bar.
Sofitel London St. James
– Repurposed from the former Cox’s and King’s Bank building just steps from Trafalgar Square and the National Portrait Gallery, the Sofitel is a destination in its own right. The expert therapists at the award-winning So SPA are trained in multiple exhilarating international treatments. And, the well-appointed guestrooms and Balcon restaurant are both a splendid mix of French chic and British charm. Perhaps the best display of world fusion at the Sofitel, though, is in its St. James Bar signature seasonal cocktail menu which features flavors, spirits, and mixers from around the globe.
The Bailey's Hotel London
– Spend your London nights in a bygone time with a stay at The Bailey’s. This Victorian-era townhome has been renovated into one of the city’s most stunning luxury hotels. Detailed stonework, stained glass windows, and a sweeping lobby staircase punctuate the posh property. While its fashionable South Kensington neighborhood serves as a beacon to pleasure-seekers, business travelers will appreciate The Bailey’s proximity to the Millennium Conference Centre next door.
Festivals and Events
London is host to some of the most exciting seasonal events in the U.K.:
BluesFest: In November, cut a rug to the sounds of major musical acts at this music festival.
Bonfire Night: Be awed by the fireworks displays that light up the city sky on this night.
London Marathon: For the especially adventurous and fleet of feet, the London Marathon is held every April.
Summer Brew Fest: If you're looking to visit during the summer, you have the city’s annual beer celebration to look forward to in June.
London’s Calling
You can save a royal treasure by bundling your flight and hotel together on Travelocity. Packaging your travel and accommodations together is the best way to find a cheap vacation in London. So, if you're thinking about visiting the historical hamlet, make sure to check out Travelocity’s London package deals to make planning your trip that much simpler.
Accommodation in London
If you're planning a getaway to England's capital, Travelocity's web page has 1578
London accommodations
to choose from.
If you are seeking a luxurious retreat, you might like to book a room at the Bulgari Hotel, London or the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London. Or, perhaps the Lanesborough or the Four Seasons Hotel London at Park Lane may be more what you're looking for right now.
The Big Ben is a much-loved London destination. If you want to stay close by, the
Grosvenor House Suites by Jumeirah Living
is just 1 mile (2 kilometers) away, and the
Claridge's
is 1 mile (2 kilometers) away.
