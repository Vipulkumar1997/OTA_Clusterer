Our Guide To Maui Hotels
The island of Maui is the perfect blend of beauty, mythology, and history—all set against a timeless landscape of sparkling beaches and picturesque peaks. The second-largest Island in Hawaii, Maui is home to charming villages and growing metropolitan centers, each awash with warmth and kissed with a salty sea breeze. We could sing its praises all day, but instead we’ll make way for the sound of waves crashing toward Napili Beach and birdsong in the trees at Haleakala National Park. Keep reading to learn where to stay in Maui, from the stretches of sand and beloved hideaways to our most popular hotels in Maui.












Where are the Best Places to Stay in Maui?
As you browse Maui hotels, consider what you want to do with your precious time on the island. While Maui is relatively small—you can drive across it in about three hours—you might prefer to stay closer to the activities you crave most. Here’s an overview of the island with a few guest-loved favorites…
West Maui:
Many of the hotels near Maui’s most popular beach destinations are found on the northwestern coast of the island. With sandy beaches, mesmerizing sunsets, and tranquil waters, the shore towns along the Honoapiilani Highway are a wonderland by the sea befitting any king or queen.
Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa in Lahaina
: Perhaps the most famous town on the island, this onetime fishing village is now home to oceanfront eateries, contemporary art galleries, and unique, independently-owned shops. At the Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa, you can savor this embarrassment of riches and indulge in a rejuvenating massage at the spa and drinks at the hotel nightclub.
Hyatt Regency Maui Resort & Spa
: Spend your mornings on the green at Kaanapali Golf Courses and your evenings at Drums of the Pacific Luau, both within walking distance to this elegant and contemporary resort. And between athletic feats and cultural experiences, you can visit the spa, doze on a private balcony, or sip a tropical cocktail at one of the poolside bars.
The Ritz-Carlton
: With championship golf courses, award-winning restaurants, and a leisurely pace, the Kapalua area delivers a relaxing and elegant opportunity to soothe away the stresses of life back on the mainland. The name “Kapalua” means “arms embracing the sea” and the Ritz-Carlton embraces guests with a full-service spa, six restaurants, waterfront bars, and more.
The Westin Maui Resort & Spa, Ka'anapali
: Also in Lahaina, high above three miles of white sand is PuuKekaa—site of the famous Black Rock ceremony, where a diver lights torches at the water’s edge before he springs into the illuminated water on the cusp of dusk. Witness this time-honored tradition from a luxury suite and take a dip in the sea or one of the five hotel pools.
East Maui and Upcountry:
On the easternmost tip of the island lies the terminus of the famous Road to Hana, the path generations of Hawaiian royalty followed around the coast. The restaurants and shops in the quiet village offer the opportunity to stretch your legs and refuel before the return 52-mile trip past seemingly countless waterfalls, panoramic views, and colorful rainforests. Maui hotels on this end of the island are also close to the Upcounty, where the stark peaks of Haleakala National Park give way to verdant botanical gardens, taro farms, and paniolo ranches.
Central and South Maui:
Most visitors to the Valley Isle fly to this dreamy destination, and Central Maui hotel deals are convenient for travelers who like to stay close to Kahului Airport—they’re also a short drive to all other points on the island. Nearby, you’ll find Iao Valley State Park, home to one of the island’s most distinguished natural features, the 1,200-foot tall Iao Needle—a velvety green, mantle-rock monolith that towers above the lush canyon below. South of Kahului, you’ll find Maui’s southern coast, home to manicured golf courses in Wailea, the wide, welcoming waterfront of Big Beach in Mekena Beach State Park, and expansive views of Lanai and Molokini.
With Travelocity, you’ll find a wide selection of cheap hotels in Maui, luxury accommodations, and everything in between. With our price-matching guarantee, you’ll book the best price available, and embark on your own island adventures.

Thank you again to the amazing staff at the four seasons for making our honeymoon so memorable.

Beautiful place!
We loved this resort! The restaurant was just average but the front desk staff were wonderful! Housekeeping was slow to clean rooms each day & denied me clean towels when I asked a staff memeber directly. When I called housekeeping they broggught towels 45 minutes later so I just used a beach towel so we could make it to our dinner reservation on time. Other than that minor inconvenience it was fabulous & all of the other staff were helpful & very kind. Our room was BEAUTIFUL! It had views of the beautiful pool area as well as the ocean beyond the palm trees & we could even see the island of Molokai. We were pretty busy out & about during our trip but the evenings we spent at the resort were very relaxing! We would love to go back!

Nicehotel close to beach
This was my third visit to this hotel. My first visit was when it was built and then my second visit was in 1997. I read the reviews before booking and many reviews mentioned the condition of the property as being worn. I was reluctant to stay at the Hyatt on this visit because of these reviews but I know this is a great facility in a great location so I gave it a third try.   The reviews are correct and for a first class resort the condition of the rooms are average at best. The positives are the location and overall for the price it was still a great vacation. We had one bad experience when we were checking out. The check out time on the door and on our itinerary was 12 noon. Since we had a late flight we wanted to stay as long as possible. The front desk insisted the checkout was 11am and they made us feel they were doing us a favor to allow a 12 pm checkout. They told us they had a guest coming in at 12 pm. We'll check in is 4 pm. If you ever tried to check in early at a resort you know how hard it is to get in before check in.
