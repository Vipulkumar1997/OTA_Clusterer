Newark Car Rentals & Travel Guide
A city full of straightforward brick and stone buildings, Newark, NJ is often referred to as "Brick City." Others prefer to use the name "Gateway City," as proud locals believe that Newark is the "Gateway to Freedom." No matter what you call it, Newark is a great place to settle in with a beer and an entertaining story.
Driving in and around Newark
Pick up your Newark car rental at the Newark Liberty International Airport, where the vast majority of
flights to Newark
arrive, located just four miles away from the city's downtown area. After settling in at one of several luxurious
Newark hotels
, it's time to take those rental cars in Newark for a spin. Car rentals in Newark make the nearby Union City an easy destination, so head over there and get ready to absorb everything there is to learn at local museums such as the Union City Museum of Art. An additional art display can be found at the William V. Musto Cultural Center, which often plays host to amazing concerts. After an enjoyable afternoon in Union City, drive back to Newark for even more fun. Route 22 offers one of the most pleasurable drives in all of Newark, as it passes right through the beautiful Weequahic Park. Experience the park at an even slower pace while traveling along Thomas Carmichael Drive, a scenic drive that circles Weequahic Lake. No matter where you choose to drive, you'll appreciate the friendly atmosphere of Newark.
