Seattle Vacations

Welcome to Emerald City. Built on industries like logging and fishing, Seattle is still a bit rustic around the edges, with creativity at its core. Whether you're having a cup of coffee at Pike Place Market or ascending to the top of the Space Needle, a vacation in Seattle will have you buzzing with excitement, discovery, and a bit of caffeine. This energy is enhanced by the surrounding beauty, which includes the Cascade Mountains, Olympic Mountains, and Puget Sound. Independent espresso bars serving up gourmet java on almost every corner help, too. So, start looking for vacation packages in Seattle today, and get ready to have the trip of a lifetime.

Top Hotels in Seattle
Mix and match convenient flights and luxurious hotels and book your own custom vacation package in Seattle, WA. Many guests love to stay downtown, because they have easy access to most of the city’s beloved landmarks and transportation to other neighborhoods is easy breezy. Consider these guest favorites as you plan your great escape:
The Westin Seattle
: Whether you’re traveling for work or leisure, this Westin hotel has the professional amenities you need to stay on task—a business center, conference space, and meeting rooms—as well as simple luxuries, like 24-hour room service and an indoor pool. Walk to Nordstrom and Westlake Center for shopping and step out for a play at The Moore Theatre, Seattle’s oldest operating theater built in 1907.
Sheraton Seattle Hotel
: Stay here if you’re planning a vacation around an event at the Washington State Convention Center or a premiere…and if you crave morning walks to browse unique boutiques in nearby Belltown. Dine at one of the two hotel restaurants before walking to 5th Avenue Theater for a musical you’re bound to get stuck in your head as you explore the rest of the city.
Seattle Marriott Waterfront
: When the sea calls, let it woo you to the balcony of your waterfront accommodation. Stay within walking distance to Pike’s Place Market, Steinbrueck Native Gallery, and Seattle Aquarium. Here, the mornings are misty and the nights come alive as downtown shakes off each day with wining and dining and views of Elliott Bay.
The Paramount Hotel
: Surrounded by shopping and gourmet dining, The Paramount keeps good company with other purveyors of decadence. Understated room furnishings and sumptuous bedding pair perfectly with the hotel’s boutique ambiance. Book a room facing northwest for a view of the Space Needle.
Seattle’s Art and Adrenaline
If you're into art and architecture, browse the Seattle Public Library (the Central Library), EMP Museum, the Seattle Art Museum, and Chihuly Garden and Glass—all located downtown or in Lower Queen Anne. Inspired by sea creatures and colors and the curved lines of the Pacific Coast, the sculptures at Chihuly Garden and Glass remind you to admire the landscape. Don’t miss the sounds and sights of the picturesque Puget Sound as you wander through west-side neighborhoods; take a moment to look out over the water.
Want to take Seattle vacations like a local? You’ll need a key ingredient: team spirit. Catch a fly ball at a Mariners baseball game at Safeco Field in spring or summer, a Seahawks football game in autumn or winter at CenturyLink Field, or a Sounders soccer game between March and November. It doesn’t matter which football team you cheer for back home—when you’re here, you’re the 12th Man, so get swept up in the moment.
Festivals and Events
From Hempfest in August to the Capitol Hill Block Party in late July, Seattle hosts some famous events. Bumberfest over Labor Day weekend is a fun music and arts festival, and the Fremont Solstice Fair in June is always alive with magic and mischief. As you search for the best Seattle package deals, plan your trip around a calendar brimming with city celebrations and cultural events. Come November, browse the Best of the Northwest, a fine arts and crafts show organized by the Northwest Art Alliance.
Experience all the artistry, energy, and breathtaking beauty of the Evergreen State with a fabulous yet cheap vacation in Seattle from Travelocity. We offer a price-matching guarantee, so if you find a better price anywhere else, we’ll match it.
Accommodation in Seattle
Seattle is a great city, and finding a place to stay here is easy. Travelocity's
Seattle lodging page
features as many as 250 options that you can choose from.
You could start your search by investigating the sumptuous splendor of the Four Seasons Hotel Seattle and the Salish Lodge & Spa. Alternatively, the Seattle Marriott Waterfront or the Hotel 1000 may be more appropriate on this trip.
Want to cut down your commuting time? Book a room nearby Space Needle at the Hotel Andra or the Edgewater - A Noble House Hotel.




Guide to Exploring Seattle


Bellevue Vacations

Kent Vacations
Kent, the sixth-largest city in Washington, is a pleasant and scenic place offering views of Mount Rainier, more than 70 parks, and close access to numerous lakes.
