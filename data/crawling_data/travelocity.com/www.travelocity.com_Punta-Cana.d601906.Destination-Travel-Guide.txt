Punta Cana Vacations

Christopher Columbus first set foot on the island of Hispaniola in the year 1492, and now it’s your turn to follow the same path. Punta Cana vacations are the perfect Caribbean getaway, where you can snorkel, drink mama juana, and relax in a palm-tree hammock.

Major Attractions

After you book your Punta Cana vacation package, be sure to look into all the activities and attractions in the area. Ever wondered what it would be like to have a dolphin as a best friend? Find out by swimming with one at the Dolphin Discovery Punta Cana. After you’re done bonding with Flipper, get over to Scape Park for some serious outdoor adventures. Take a zipline tour through the jungle canopy, or go spelunking in Iguabonita Cave. Finally, cool off by taking a dip in the clearest blue water you have ever seen in the natural well of Hoyo Azul. No matter what you end up doing, make sure you look into Punta Cana packages that feature all-inclusive options. Some bundle a variety activities with your deal!

Festivals and Events

If you’re traveling in spring, make sure you’re in town on the first Monday of March for Punta Carnaval. The festival takes place in Puntacana Village, directly opposite from Punta Cana International Airport, so you’ll be able to go from your seat to party mode in about 15 minutes. Visiting during the summer? Get a
cheap car rental
in the airport and make the 120-mile drive to Santo Domingo for the Merengue Festival. A whole week of July is dedicated to music, dancing, food, and drinks. Feel the rhythm with the locals in true Dominican style.

Does that sound like a beat you can follow? Search Travelocity’s
Punta Cana hotel deals
to find the one that suits you best. It’s time for you to leave your footprints in the sands of the Dominican Republic.
Accommodation in Punta Cana
Planning a vacation to the great city of Punta Cana is easy, with Travelocity's
Punta Cana lodging guide
featuring approximately 111 accommodations in the area.
Do you have a taste for luxury and style? Tortuga Bay Hotel and Los Altos Condo Residences Casa de Campo will be right up your alley. On the other hand, the Zoetry Agua Punta Cana All Inclusive or the Casa de Campo Resort and Villas will provide you with cozy comfort at bargain prices.
Altos de Chavon Village is a much-loved Punta Cana destination. If you are interested in staying nearby, the
Dreams La Romana - Luxury All Inclusive
is just 4 miles (6 kilometers) away, and the
Casa de Campo Villas
is 2 miles (3 kilometers) away.




Guide to Exploring Punta Cana


La Romana Vacations
The third-largest city in the Dominican Republic, La Romana is the perfect palm-lined representation of this Caribbean country; it is also surrounded by sugarcane fields—the region's major cash crop. La Romana packages offer the opportunity to get a feel for everyday life in the Dominican Republic, while a
hotel in La Romana
serves as more than just a rest stop on the road between the capital and the Dominican's popular eastern beach resorts. The city's unique gastronomy and abundance of high-end golf courses draws tourists of all kinds to this bustling regional center.

I love the hotel. It was beautiful. The people were friendly. I read reviews about the food not being great and honestly thought it was probably a bunch of white people that wouldn’t understand Spanish flavor.
