Flights To Fort Lauderdale
Good thing that the sun is out on your flight to Fort Lauderdale, because you want to head for the beach as soon as you land at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International (FLL). The spring-break center of Florida also celebrates its waterside location with canals big enough to accommodate pleasure boats and the Everglades where airboats can take you close to wild alligators. The land offers diversions as well. At the Riverwalk Arts and Entertainment District, you can shop at trendy boutiques or dance at hot clubs. Delight your senses at the Broward Center for the Performing Arts or go for visual pursuits at the Museum of Art.
Transportation From FLL
Your
Fort Lauderdale vacation package
can include flights to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. If you want to get to your hotel as soon as possible, choose
Fort Lauderdale hotels near FLL airport
. Otherwise, rooms overlooking the water or in the excitement of downtown may be more to your liking. To get to any of your bookings, check the Ground Transportation Booth located on the lower level of your terminal. Staff there can answer questions, such as where to hail a cab if your hotel doesn't offer courtesy shuttles. For more control over your ride, try the Rental Car Center next to Terminal 1. About a dozen companies offer service there. After you've checked into your room, try riding the Sun Trolley for an overview of the city by land or the Water Taxi to admire yachts and millionaire homes from the water.
Enjoy Fort Lauderdale
On Travelocity, search over 400 airlines and more than 510,000 worldwide to find cheap tickets to Fort Lauderdale. The site's multiple selection options let you locate cheap flights to Fort Lauderdale or more luxurious flights to Fort Lauderdale. Book as soon as you firm up your travel plans to get the best airfare to Fort Lauderdale. Then you can enjoy the sun, sand, and sea sooner rather than later.
