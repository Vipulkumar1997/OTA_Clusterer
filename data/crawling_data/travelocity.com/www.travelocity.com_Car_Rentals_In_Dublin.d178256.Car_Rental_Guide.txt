Dublin Car Rentals & Travel Guide
Page through chapbooks of poems, sip rich ales and stouts, and turn your ear to tales of ancient mythology. Ireland's capital city has been the setting for many of the western world's greatest moments and legends…so why not rent a car in Dublin and follow the paths of Ireland’s own heroes and poets? Soon you’ll spin your own stories from the cobblestone streets and waterfront walks of Dublin, where ancient lore meets natural wonder and avant-garde art.
Whether you plan to circle Dublin Bay in a classic town car or abscond to ancient ruins in an adventure-ready SUV with your family, there’s surely something for you in our wide array of Dublin rental car deals. Read on to learn more about the Fair City.
Where to Stay in Dublin
Dublin may be within a short drive to castle ruins at Kildare and the enchanting fishing village of Howth, but you’ll want to anchor your getaway in darling Dublin. So as you browse Dublin rental cars, consider these guest-loved hotels, too:
The Westbury Hotel
: This oasis offers five-star luxury right in the middle of it all. Browse the area’s art galleries before taking in a show at the Gaiety Theatre while you leave the youngsters in the care of childcare professionals. Now, that’s indulgent.
Ashling Hotel Dublin
: Located near the historic Ha’penny Bridge and the world-famous Temple Bar, the Ashling is another five-star treasure near popular attractions, including the Collins Barracks and the National Museum of Ireland – Decorative Arts & History. Dine at the hotel restaurant for your own foray into the culinary arts.
The Westin Dublin
: For fun in the western part of town, stay at the Westin, located near the National Museum of Ireland and Phoenix Park, known as “Dublin’s playground”—this park is so large, it even has resident deer. With a lovely exterior and amenities like 24-hour room service, the Westin is a bit of a wonderland, too.
Hotel Riu Plaza The Gresham
: From crystal chandeliers to tapestry-draped four-poster beds, this is regal accommodation. Here, you’ll be a short walk or easy drive to the city’s iconic landmarks and world-class entertainment and arts at Ambassador Theatre and Gate Theatre.
Driving In and Around Dublin
Dublin Airport is about six miles from the city center, where you'll be within walking or easy driving distance to many sights. Find rental cars in Dublin in the Terminal 1 Arrivals Hall or the multi-story car park in Terminal 2. From there, you own your itinerary. Drive to Dame and Grafton Streets, where you’ll find Trinity College Library, home of the Book of Kells, a beautiful illustrated manuscript dating from the eighth century. For shopping, roll down Henry and Grafton Streets and make sure you have some extra room in the “boot” for all your souvenirs.
When the din of ancient Celtic drums reaches your ears from centuries past, turn the key on your rental car in Dublin and take a short drive to County Kildare, where you’ll encounter the soft sensuality of an unbridled landscape and the haunting beauty of castle ruins. While you’re there, peruse the Museum of Style Icons for an illuminating look at stylish women and the worlds they lived in.
Whether you're looking for cheap car rentals in Dublin or a complete vacation package, Travelocity makes it easy to plan and book your getaway. Book now and get mobile-exclusive deals on the Travelocity app while you’re on the go.
