Honolulu Car Rentals & Travel Guide
Honolulu, HI is the perfect place to relax with a tropical drink in hand. The city has a very relaxed atmosphere, but with an edge of adventure. It's the perfect place for you to fly off to when you want to take a break from your everyday life and embark on a warm weather vacation!
Scenic Adventures in and around Honolulu
The drive from Honolulu International Airport to downtown is only six miles. After
flights to Honolulu
arrive, it's easy to pick up a rental right at the airport. Once you've checked into one of the luxurious
hotels in Honolulu
, it's time to get on the road and explore the surrounding area. For the ultimate history lesson, head northwest to Pearl Harbor, where you can honor the lives lost at the beginning of the United States' involvement in World War II. While you're there, you can visit the Battleship Missouri Memorial, where the Japanese officially surrendered. Continue along Interstate H1 towards Aiea and Pearl City, both of which boast amazing Hawaiian cuisine right off the freeway. These eateries will leave you tempted to spend the money you saved on cheap car rentals in Honolulu. Feel free to treat yourself to kalua pig, a popular local delicacy. After returning to Honolulu, you'll want to explore some of the city's most popular haunts, like the lovely Sand Island, or enjoy an afternoon at the Foster Botanical Garden. There's nothing quite like an afternoon of trekking through the Waianae Mountains, a pleasure you can only experience if you travel to Honolulu.
Exploring Honolulu's Haunts
Browse Travelocity's extensive list of available flights, hotels and rental cars in Honolulu. Car rentals in Honolulu make it easy to get wherever you want to, and if you book your flight and accommodations at the same time, you could save up to $537!
Here at Travelocity, we’re committed to helping you score cheap deals on Honolulu car rentals. We’ll have your rental car waiting for you as soon as you arrive in town. Traveling with your whole family in tow? Choose a spacious and affordable van to keep your crew sane throughout the trip. Exploring the city with your sweetheart? Reserve a swanky two-seater as you paint the town red. With our low rates on rental cars in Honolulu, you can go out and smell the roses, without stressing out your bank account. You can even use our mobile booking app to snag exclusive deals, so you can spend more on your adventures and less on your vehicle.
