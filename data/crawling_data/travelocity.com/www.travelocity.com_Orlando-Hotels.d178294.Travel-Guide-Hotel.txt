Getting to Orlando
If you thought that you could fly into Orlando International Airport (MCO) from just about anywhere in the world, you would be absolutely correct. It’s the busiest airport in the state, with daily service to nearly every major U.S. city and several European and South American cities. (And multiple flights per week serving even more cities.) Suffice it to say, selection and deals on flights to Orlando abound, no matter where you’re coming from.












What to Know When You Land
Transportation: Renting a car is easily the most popular way to get around Orlando. Many of the attractions lie south of downtown, and in Lake Buena Vista and Kissimmee. Roads are well taken care of and signs are plentiful. There can be traffic on weekends near the theme parks, and on weekdays in downtown. Still, it is easy to see why car rentals are a good option. If you prefer not to go that route, Orlando does have an extensive bus system (the LYNX bus), and abundant taxis.
Plan Your Parks: Yes, you could touch down in Orlando with little semblance of an itinerary. However, even if you’re a free-spirited sort of traveler, we’d recommend at least a little planning. Purchasing tickets ahead of time can save you money, and certain events, like character dining experiences, typically need to be booked months in advance. The good news is that the major theme parks are all within about 15 miles of each other, so with a little preparation, you should be able to see everything you—and the kids—want.
Climate Conditions
With warm temperatures year-round, ranging from the low 70s in January to the low 90s in the summer, you’ll certainly never be too chilly in the "Sunshine State." If you have flexibility, you’ll find both great deals and amazing weather from January to April. Be sure to pack a light jacket—nighttime temperatures can dip into the 50s. Rainfall becomes more of a concern in the summer, as well as humidity, but for many families, the school break is the best time to visit. Rest assured, no little rainstorm will ruin the magic of Orlando.
Top 3 Things to Do in Orlando
Walt Disney World® Resort is the usual starting point, but are you wondering what else there is to do? Well, traveler, all you need to do is step outside hotels in Orlando and drive in any direction. Here are three suggestions:
1. House of Blues Orlando (1.5 miles from Hilton Orlando Buena Vista Palace)
Put the kids to bed and take in a concert at House of Blues Orlando for some adult-aged fun. Or, you can include them—the Gospel Brunches on Sundays are legendary, and the restaurant is open daily at 11:30am. Even among the glitter of Orlando, a place "Where Music Feeds the Soul" is a much-needed addition to many holiday itineraries.
2. Universal Orlando (3 miles from Hyatt Regency Orlando)
This is the second-largest entertainment complex in town (after the House of Mouse, of course), so it should be on your list as well. In fact, with five hotels, two theme parks (Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure), and a nightlife area, you might make this one your top choice. Bonus: It’s home to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter™!
3. Orlando Science Center
Need a break from the theme parks? Add a little education to your vacation revelry at the Orlando Science Center. Learn about dinosaurs, reach for the stars in the Crosby Observatory, and participate in science experiments—well, predicting the weather at least. It’s the perfect break before you get back to the thrills.
It isn’t just roller coasters and water slides that will thrill you on your Orlando vacation. You can have a blast planning it, too, especially when you use Travelocity for all your getaway needs. Whether you’re searching for sprawling, luxurious resorts or cheap hotels in Orlando, we have you covered. Book with us, and you’ll have one more item checked off your to-do list.

Wonderful
The rooms, the location, the staff and facilities far exceeded our expecatations. Our rooms were beautiful, we were overlooking the mini golf, inside our rooms we never heard outdoor noises. Security was excellent. We had 4 rooms, with 15 people and all of us enjoyed our stay there.

Nice and convenient
Nice place to stay and relax while waiting overnight for a plane or for transportation in the morning.  Room nice comfortable.  The only improvement I can think of would be scheduling the breakfast on the deck 9 restaurant.  There were so many people lined up that we couldn't get our "free breakfast ".
