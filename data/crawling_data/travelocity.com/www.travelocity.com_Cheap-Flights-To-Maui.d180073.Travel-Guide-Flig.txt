Flights to Maui Hawaii
It’s certainly not difficult to learn that Maui is one of the most popular Hawaiian Islands to visit. Well-known for its white sandy beaches and whale watching, visitors travel from all around the world to explore Maui. But did you know that Maui also has a thriving art scene and is a great place to go for a gastronomical getaway? Thanks to Travelocity, flight deals to Maui can be found whether you are seeking time on the beach or relaxation by a waterfall. Once your Maui flight arrives at Kahului Airport (OGG), your island adventure is set to begin.
Transportation from OGG
Being a relatively small island, flights to Maui are typically filled with vacationers eager to visit every part of it. After you make your way from the aircraft to the OGG arrival terminal, you’ll want to find the fastest and easiest way to get to your corner of this Hawaiian paradise. Depending on your budget and comfort demands, you’ll have a few ground transportation options—all of which are available just in front of (or in the case of rental cars, right next to) the baggage claim area. Taxi cabs are going to be the fastest and most comfortable way to get to your hotel—they are also going to be the most expensive. Rental cars will offer you the most flexibility while you are on the island, allowing you to take the Road to Hana as your own pace. A private airport shuttle service is available for travelers heading to the major tourist destinations on Maui. Finally, public transit can take you upcountry and to Haiku marketplace.
Hotels Near OGG
Kahului Airport is not particularly close to the primary resort locations on the island. Still, with every point on the island being a short drive from OGG, you’re not too far from your hotel once you land. Here are some of the more popular hotels near OGG:
Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa
: Located on Kaanapali Beach in Lahaina where the Black Rock greets the sapphire ocean, the Sheraton is a destination in its own right. With lush green lawns, a world-class spa, and flexible meeting space, this is the perfect place for any event—even if your to-do is simply sunning by the pool.
The Westin Maui Resort & Spa
: Tee it up on the nearby Kaanapali Golf Course, stroll to the Whalers Villa mall, or simply watch the waves crash on the private beach. If you can, reserve an ocean-facing room on an upper floor for a sunset you won’t soon forget.
The Ritz-Carlton
: With two championship-caliber golf courses, six amazing eateries, a signature spa, and a host of poolside cabanas—all on-site—you’ll be pampered with luxurious amenities the moment you arrive on the pristine property.
Hyatt Regency Maui Resort & Spa
: When your poolside cabana also opens to the resort’s private strip of sandy serenity, the toughest decision you’ll have to make is whether to cool off in the ocean or with a refreshing cocktail from the Tiki bar. That same tropical theme is consistent throughout the Hyatt’s 40 gorgeous acres.
Things to Do Near OGG
Maui is an island that begs to be explored at every turn. Here are some of our favorite things to do near OGG:
Snorkel Molokini Crater: The Molokini Crater is just off the island of Maui and features a protected marine life conservation district. Snorkelers can see exotic fish, sharks, turtles, and the coral reef. Snorkeling Molokini Crater is a must-do for anyone who loves the ocean.
Hike Pipiwai Trail: When you dream of traveling to Maui, what activities do you picture yourself doing? Surfing, lying on the beach, hiking to a gorgeous waterfall—and so much more. So why not make one of those dreams a reality by hiking the Pipiwai Trail? This is a four-mile round-trip hike that takes you through beautiful Hawaiian scenery and ends at Waimoku Falls. Grab airline tickets to Maui so that you can experience this amazing hike.
Finding Cheap Tickets
Maui is a popular destination for those visiting the Hawaiian Islands. November through April is the busiest time of year, especially February and March when the whale population is dense. But even with a higher number of tourists, some of the cheapest flights to Maui are available.
Best Time of Year to Visit
Maui, like all the Hawaiian Islands, has fantastic weather all year. However, many visitors prefer to visit during the winter months when their hometown is freezing. If you are looking for a great deal on hotel rates and Maui plane tickets, you will want to take a look at late spring and early fall when tourism declines. Search Travelocity for the best deals on Maui airfare.
