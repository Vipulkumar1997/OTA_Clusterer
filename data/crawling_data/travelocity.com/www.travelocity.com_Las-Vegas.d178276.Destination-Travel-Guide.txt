Las Vegas Vacations

Las Vegas, Nevada, is best known for its bright lights, star-studded shows, and world-class casinos. But no matter what sort of adventure you’re looking for, there are Las Vegas vacations that can fulfill your every wish. In fact, that is just what this sprawling desert metropolis is all about. Yes, you can allow the sights and sounds of the casino sweep you off your feet, but the next night you could spend at the spa, and the night after that, you can put on your dancing shoes. The only thing that you can’t do on vacations in Las Vegas is stay there forever. Or could you?

Major Attractions
Surely you have heard of the most famous street in America: The Strip. It features some of the most well-known places in the city, from classic casinos to the famous replica Eiffel Tower. Get your heart racing at the world's highest thrill rides—or in the casino—all located there. However, the more vintage, rock-and-roll atmosphere of downtown is also not to be missed. Try your luck at the legendary Golden Nugget casino, then stroll to the Neon Museum, where you’re sure to take some of your new favorite photos.
Did you know that the area around Las Vegas is filled with outdoor fun, too? Yes, journey away from the bright lights and you’ll find you can gaze up at lights of a different kind—the stars. The Hoover Dam and Red Rock Canyon are popular destinations to marvel at the power of Mother Nature. Now that is almost as awe-inspiring as our Las Vegas package deals.
Festivals and Events
While it’s true that any time is a good time to visit this happening town, there are some special events you might consider. You can book vacation packages in Vegas to coincide with monthly favorites such as the Art & Wine: A Perfect Pairing, held the second Wednesday of each month. Wines are paired with the featured works at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art for a unique combination of art and imbibing. If you prefer beer, sample from among more than 150 brews from around the world at the Desert Hops Nevada & International Beer Festival in August. However you choose to let loose, Las Vegas is here with a festival and a smile.
Hotels in Las Vegas
Hotels and flights go together like pools and pina coladas, and you’ll have plenty of those in your future when you’ve booked a cheap vacation in Las Vegas. As one of the world’s leaders in hospitality, though, “Sin City” has a whole lot of options when it comes to where to stay. Look into these hotels to add on to your package.
Guests at
MGM Grand Hotel & Casino
practically never have to leave. This sprawling resort has 17 restaurants, a spa, and plenty of pools. When the sun sets, join in the electric energy at the nightclub, or take in a show at the David Copperfield Theatre. It’s all here.
The
Bellagio
’s excellent reputation—and its five-star rating—are both well-earned. The hotel’s fountain shows may be its most famous attraction, but for guests lucky enough to have a room, the inside is even more impressive. Even the lobby ceiling is decorated with blown-glass flowers by the legendary artist, Dale Chihuly.
The Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino
is the epitome of opulence, so if you are in search of the most elegant experience available, look no further. This five-star resort has two pools, 20 restaurants, and an on-site spa to cater to your every need. And no trip is complete without being transported to Venice, itself, as you cruise down the hotel’s canals in a gondola.
Excalibur Hotel Casino
will have you living like royalty—it is even shaped like a castle. Both kids and those who are just kids at heart will love the arcade, while adults can entertain themselves at the casino. Take a dip in the outdoor hot tub or just relax by the poolside bar. In Las Vegas, your day is yours alone.
Whether you want to come for the gaming, the nightlife, or just a little bit of everything, we’ve got the perfect vacation package in Las Vegas, NV for you. Many cities try to claim they have something for everyone, but in this city of dreams, it is true. And Travelocity will get you there, with the best deals and the easiest booking this side of the Hoover Dam.
Accommodation in Las Vegas
Las Vegas is a great city, with 231 accommodations featured on Travelocity's
Las Vegas hotels page
.
The SKYLOFTS at MGM Grand, at 3799 Las Vegas Boulevard, or the Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas, at 3960 Las Vegas Blvd S, are brimming with elegance and luxury. Or, perhaps the Mandarin Oriental, Las Vegas or the Nobu Hotel may be more suitable on this trip.
Would you like to minimize your travel time? Reserve a room nearby the University of Nevada-Las Vegas at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas or the Wynn Las Vegas.
