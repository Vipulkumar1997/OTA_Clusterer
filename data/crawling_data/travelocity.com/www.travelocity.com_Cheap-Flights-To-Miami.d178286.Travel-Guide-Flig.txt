Flights To Miami
Neon signs light up the night sky, sending out a siren song to salsa dancers and party-goers who want to stay up to greet the sun. Bienvenidos a Miami Beach, where a frenetic energy spills out from the clubs onto the sidewalk, wafting through the air and exciting passersby. Greater Miami is inspired by the same energy, encouraging you to live a glamourous life, if only for a few days. Think of the stories you’ll have to tell the grandkids one day when you join the trendsetters in South Beach.
As Florida's largest party city, Miami excites with a sunny seashore, Cuban culture, and captivating clubs. The Art Deco District enthralls anyone who loves history and architecture, and the sports stadiums host professional teams who have honed their expertise in football, baseball, basketball, hockey, and soccer. Become acquainted with underwater wonders by diving the natural and artificial reefs or snorkeling in turquoise-blue waters. When you combine Miami flights with the top activities, you’re instantly stamped a savvy traveler. All flights to Miami land at Miami International Airport (MIA).
Transportation from MIA
You booked plane tickets to Miami and your bags are packed. Before you know it, you’ll be descending over MIA with palm trees dancing in your eyes. Book a hotel near the airport, and you’ll be clad in your swimsuit and headed for the beach in under an hour of your wheels touching the ground for your flight to Miami. Many airport hotels offer free shuttle pick-ups, so you can get door to door without batting an eyelash.
If your hotel doesn’t have a shuttle, hop on the people mover to reach Central Station. From there, you can take Metrorail for fast access to downtown or Metrobus for a wider selection of stops. On the east side of the same station, the Rental Car Center offers choices from more than 15 car rental companies. If you want the services of a private vehicle but don’t like to drive, take one of the taxis on the ground level of the airport. The ground level also offers the SuperShuttle pickup, which is a great option for large travel parties.
Hotels Near MIA
You’re a wise wanderer who found the best airfare to Miami, so why wouldn’t you stay in one of the top hotels? A beachfront room offers unparalleled views and a thrilling atmosphere mere steps from the sand:
Fontainebleau Miami Beach
: You’ll wake up, step onto your balcony, stretching out on a cushioned lounge chair. The white sand just below gives way to lapping waves. Head downstairs, take a dip in the pool, and then head out to explore Miami. By evening, the Fontainebleau offers live entertainment just steps from your luxurious room.
Eden Roc Resort Miami Beach
: This iconic Miami Beach hotel has attracted celebrities and socialites over the years, and its beachfront location is perfect for the wise wanderer. Take a dip in the pool and walk the grounds, where the likes of Lucille Ball and Ernest Hemingway once meandered.
Loews Miami Beach Hotel – South Beach
: You can spot the bright white décor and well-lit palms of Loews from a distance, and it will draw you in like a magnet. Lounge around the gigantic pool, and rent a cabana to be treated like a VIP. Refuel at the Lure Fishbar or get a treatment at exhale Spa—soon, you’re ready to party down.
The Ritz-Carlton, South Beach
: It doesn’t get more upscale than The Ritz-Carlton, and the serenity of this South Beach hotel will lull you into bliss. Fall asleep to the sound of the waves through your cracked window, then head to nearby Ocean Drive to make the most of your sizzling Miami getaway.
Things to Do in Miami
Drinking and diving aren’t the only things to do in Miami, just ask anyone who has delighted in the culinary offerings of Little Havana. Sip on some strong coffee, take a walk through the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, and snap photos of the sculptures at Coral Castle. You already showed your travel planning acumen by booking one of our top flight deals to Miami, so you’re sure to find plenty of innovating ways to fill your time in Southern Florida.
Search Travelocity for the cheapest flights to Miami today, and before you know it you’ll be sunning your shoulders in South Beach and getting inspired in the Art Deco District. Ready, set, vamonos!
