* This is the largest savings for simultaneous booking of flight and hotel from July 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016, and not the discount rate or amount for your booking. Savings calculated based on the cost of a Flight + Hotel booking on Travelocity.com as compared to the aggregated price of the full published fare given by the airline and the cost of your hotel for the same travel products for the same travel dates when made separately. Savings will vary based on the origin/destination, length of trip, stay dates and selected travel supplier(s). Savings are not available on all packages. Please confirm the actual discount rate/ price on the booking page.
