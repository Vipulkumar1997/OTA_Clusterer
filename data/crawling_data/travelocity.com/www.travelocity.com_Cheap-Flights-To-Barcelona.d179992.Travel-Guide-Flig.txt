Flights To Barcelona
Barcelona is one of the most fabled cities in the world. Between its astounding architecture, amazing food, and friendly people, it has the makings of the trip of a lifetime. Getting a great deal on flights to Barcelona is easy and you will want to be sure to gaze out the window as you fly into the city. Plan your trip carefully because there is a lot to see and do here, you won't want to miss a thing. Be sure to visit the magic fountain of Montjuic while you are here. While you are planning your days, don't forget to plan your nights! Barcelona is a modern city and there is an active nightlife.
Transportation from BCN
Hotels near Barcelona International Airport
(BCN) abound and getting to them is painless. After your plane lands and you collect your luggage, you can take a bus, taxi, train or rent a car. For individual trips around the city, a car is recommended, even though the public transportation is quite good. Barcelona is a large city and while navigating within the city is easily done via public transportation or on foot, you will probably want a car for side trips outside the city. The hotels typically have all the amenities you could want, and some of the older ones sport amazing architecture. What you might lose in an amenity or two is more than compensated for with the ambiance.
Explore Barcelona
If you do nothing else while in Barcelona, you have to visit the Gothic Quarter. This part of the city largely dates from the middle ages and the Gothic architecture is perhaps the most astounding in the world. The Gothic Quarter alone is worth the trip to Barcelona. The food is another compelling reason to visit. Plan to visit once and then return several more times to drink in the majesty that is this fabled city. You can find great airfare deals on tickets to Barcelona. Travelocity can help with
