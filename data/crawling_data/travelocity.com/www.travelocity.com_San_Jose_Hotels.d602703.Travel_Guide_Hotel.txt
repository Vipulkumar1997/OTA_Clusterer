San Jose Hotel & Travel Guide
If you are booking lodgings in or near San Jose, it is useful to know that there is a treasure trove of possibilities awaiting you. If you're going to stay within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of the heart of San Jose, Travelocity's hotel database lists at least 70 hotels and apartments that match that criteria.












Accommodations that you can discover within easy walking distance of San Jose's downtown, are the
Holiday Inn Express San Jose-Central City
and
Hampton Inn And Suites San Jose
.
San Jose is best known for the Winchester Mystery House. Within just a short stroll of this icon you can find the
Hotel Valencia Santana Row
and
Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Santa Clara
.
Enjoy the area around the San Jose State University by reserving a hotel room at the
Hotel De Anza
or the
The Fairmont San Jose
. If you and your friends think you would rather check out the area near to the Tech Museum, consider the
San Jose Marriott
or the
The Westin San Jose
. The San Jose Convention Center and the San Jose Museum of Art are two more significant San Jose sights. The
Hyatt Place San Jose/Downtown
and the
Hilton San Jose
are within walking distance from the San Jose Convention Center. Alternatively, the
Four Points by Sheraton San Jose Downtown
and the
Arena Hotel
are near the San Jose Museum of Art.
If you are planning a San Jose visit, but are on a budget and simply are after the best priced accommodation options, our hotel database also has affordable hotels to choose from in the vicinity. 5 miles (8 kilometers) away from San Jose's downtown area is the
Extended Stay America San Jose - Airport
. The
Arena Hotel
is only 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. The
Quality Inn
and the
Extended Stay America San Jose - Edenvale - South
are two alternative lower-cost options that are worth a look.
The
Rosewood Cordevalle
is around 20 miles (34 kilometers) from the downtown area of San Jose. Also, the
Hotel Los Gatos
is 9 miles (15 kilometers) away. Another option is to make a booking at the
Sheraton Sunnyvale Hotel
or the
The Inn at Saratoga
.
Like to travel a little out of the center? Northern California lays claim to many impressive attractions worth checking out. Northern California offers mountains, and commonly visited sights are art museums, art galleries and street art. Tireless travelers may also take part in snowboarding and skiing in the region.
Fremont is 16 miles (26 kilometers) to the north of San Jose and boasts Mission San Jose and Northwestern Polytechnic University. Fremont hotel establishments include the
TownePlace Suites by Marriott Newark Silicon Valley

Holiday Inn Express Fremont-Milpitas Central
. 20 miles (34 kilometers) to the southeast of San Jose, you'll reach San Martin, home to the
Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites San Jose-Morgan Hill
and
Hampton Inn Morgan Hill
