Transportation from SJD
Staying in one of the
hotels near Los Cabos International Airport
is an excellent arrangement, as it puts you mere minutes away from the downtown area. You won't find public transportation that serves the airport, so you should arrange airport transit when you book your airline tickets; you can opt for a shared or private shuttle service to take you to your destination. Car rental companies also abound in this side of Mexico; a car rental is the perfect option if you don't mind cruising along on your own to Los Cabos beaches, bars, and shops. If you're feeling adventurous, you can even head north, explore the road less traveled, avoid swarming tourists, and check out travel delights like Cerritos Beach and Todos Santos.
