Cozumel Vacations

You work hard to take a vacation, so why not make the most of your next getaway? Experience true solitude during your next international sojourn by reserving a Cozumel vacation package. Not only will you experience utter tranquility while staring out at the Caribbean Sea, but you can dive into adventure with the endless amount of activities available on the island.

Top Hotels in Cozumel
Once you’ve secured your passport, the rest of your trip planning will be smooth sailing. Booking package deals in Cozumel is nearly effortless when you make your reservation through Travelocity. Although you’re probably already dreaming up fruity cocktails garnished with a tiny umbrella, you still need to choose one of these fabulous hotels to lounge in during your stay.
Playa Azul
: With an ocean view in every room, you can’t go wrong at Playa Azul. Offering sumptuous breakfast and access to the golf green at the Cozumel Country Club, you’ll have no trouble filling your time between stretches of lying in the sand.
Iberostar Cozumel All Inclusive
: This 5-star resort will make even the most seasoned traveler gasp when they first see the accommodation. Nestled alongside the Mayan Riviera, the all-inclusive hotel offers numerous pools, delicious restaurants, and stellar service.
Cozumel Palace All Inclusive
: It’s called the Cozumel Palace, so you can expect to be treated like royalty. Enjoy a private balcony with a hammock, bright and spacious guest rooms, and views of the sea that will make your heart swell with happiness.
Allegro Cozumel All Inclusive
: Rooms adorned with brightly colored linens and a turquoise pool that will cause you to forget about all your worries are just a few of the reasons to stay at Allegro Cozumel All Inclusive resort. Located right on the beach, the resort’s décor reflects the sunlit charm of the Riviera and contains all the luxurious amenities you’ve come to associate with time well spent.
Major Attractions
Many travel to Mexico anticipating to simply lie on the beach and do nothing, which is a perfectly acceptable way to spend your Cozumel getaway, but you’d be missing out on many of the island’s charms. Its beaches are raved about by travelers from all walks of life, but its most inviting oceanic escape would be Cozumel’s sites for scuba diving. After you tire of reading your book on Palancar Beach or tanning on Paradise Beach, head to a local gear shop and rent scuba diving or snorkeling equipment. Palancar reef is home to colorful arrays of coral, sea sponges, and schools of swift fish. Advanced divers will delight in swimming above the Santa Rosa Wall, which boasts sea caves and tunnels that are large enough to swim through, as well as a multitude of sea life, including turtles, eagle rays, and large fish.
You could spend your entire vacation in Cozumel submerged in the warm salt water, but then you’d miss out on visiting the vibrant city of San Miguel. Stroll through the charming downtown district and marvel at the goods for sale in the open-air market, take a seat in the shaded town square, and sample local fare like chile rellenos and tamales until you’re as content as the seabirds swooping happily overhead.
Festivals and Events
Your Cozumel vacation will include sun-kissed days, margaritas enjoyed by the ocean, and sweet, peaceful moments of reading in the shade. And if you venture to Cozumel during late February or early March, your trip will also include celebrating Carnaval, one of the biggest events to occur annually on the island. The Mardi Gras-esque celebration lasts for an entire week and includes enchanting live music, flashing lights, sparkling parades, and enough cheer to make the Christmas season look morose in comparison. When attending Carnaval in Cozumel, be sure to bring your dancing shoes and an easygoing attitude—you never know where your feet could take you throughout the festivities.
In early November, celebrate Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, with locals. The final day of the celebration occurs on Nov. 2 every year and commemorates the lives of those who have passed on. Although the subject matter sounds quite somber, the holiday is celebrated with dancing, parades, fireworks, and lots of food. Join in on the festivities and if you’re planning on taking a Cozumel family vacation, this event might just be the perfect cultural experience to add to your itinerary.
The only thing standing between you and sipping on an icy margarita overlooking the Caribbean Sea is taking action and reserving your Cozumel vacation package today. Skim through our extensive list of accommodations and transportation options, and book the bundle best suiting your needs. Afterward, you might want to start sorting through the garage in search of your snorkel gear…
Accommodation in Cozumel
Are you and your family getting ready for a getaway to Cozumel? Take your time browsing through the 50 hotels listed on Travelocity's
Cozumel hotels guide
and make your booking as soon as you find one that suits.
You should start your search by taking a look at the lofty luxury of the Landmark of Cozumel and the Cozumel Palace All Inclusive. If those aren't right for your tastes or budget, think about the Presidente InterContinental Cozumel Resort & Spa, at Carretera A Chankanaab Km 6-5, or the Secrets Aura Cozumel - All Inclusive, located at Carretera Costera Sur Km 12.99.
