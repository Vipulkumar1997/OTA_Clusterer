Flights To Orange County
Orange County has blossomed into more than a southern suburb of Los Angeles. This collection of cities thrills tourists with theme parks, relaxes sun worshippers with miles of beaches, and impresses shoppers with expansive indoor and outdoor malls. Flights to Orange County land at John Wayne Airport (SNA) and are often included in
Orange County vacation packages
. Otherwise, you may prefer accommodations closer to the charmingly walkable City of Orange or with views of the surfers at Huntington Beach.
Transportation from SNA
The car is king where you fly in, which makes roads well-maintained and parking easy-to-find and mostly free. Consider renting a car once you've completed one of your Orange County flights. The major rental-car companies have counters on the lower level between Terminals A and B. If you're heading to Disneyland, its Resort Express bus stops at the Ground Transportation Center on the lower level. The Center is also where you can catch shuttles and taxis after your plane ride. For bus service, ride routes 76 and 212, or I Shuttle Route A from the lower level in front of Terminal B. You can buy your ticket on-board. After you've freshened up at one of many
cheap hotels close to John Wayne Airport
, slather on the sunscreen and get ready for fun outside. It rarely rains, so you won't have to consult any weather reports before your daily travel adventures.
Have Fun in Orange County
If you find cheap flights to Orange County through Travelocity, you'll have more to spend on oranges at the Irvine Farmer's Market, Mexican cuisine in Santa Ana, or concerts at the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Save up to $537 when you book a hotel and flight at the same time. No need to worry about fluctuating costs with the Travelocity guarantee. If you find a lower price on your room, airfare, or rental car, we will honor the lower amount and refund the difference.
