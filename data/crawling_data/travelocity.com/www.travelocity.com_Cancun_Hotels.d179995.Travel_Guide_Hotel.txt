You’ve done it—you’ve finally set aside some time for a vacation to a faraway place, where the worries of office work and everyday life might as well be in another universe. But you don’t want to go to a place just an hour away. Sure, it may have an outstanding spa, yoga classes that conclude with the sunset, fabulous dining options, and luxurious amenities, but it’s not the escape you need. You need a place with pearly white sand beaches flanked by sparkling turquoise water on one side and lush tropical rainforests on the other. So go to Cancun, Mexico, a vacation destination with all that and more. Use Travelocity to find the best gay hotels in Cancun and let your dreams about the perfect getaway come true.












What Are the Best Gay Resorts in Mexico?
Whether you’re here to dance in the Pride Parade or just want to check out a limited-time art exhibition, your accommodation will ensure you have a warm, welcoming place to rest your head. Do you live to sample the menus at on-site restaurants? We’ve got a hotel for you. Aching to take a dip in the pool after a long day of hiking? Yes, we’ve got that covered as well. Here’s our list of our favorite gay resorts in Cancun:
Grand Oasis Sens
—This adult- only resort bills itself as “sexy, sensual, and fun.” It’ll be hard to argue that point when you wake up in your Sian Ka’an Club Suite, walk out onto your private balcony, and bask in the spectacular surroundings. Make your way down to the pool deck and soak up as much sunshine as you’d like while cocktail servers bring you ice-cold margaritas. When your appetite becomes too strong to ignore, there’s plenty of on-site restaurants to choose from. Enjoy breakfast at Coffee and Me, grab lunch at Hippie Chic Grill, and sit down for dinner at Black Hole. If you really want to treat yourself properly, book one of the all-inclusive deals and everything from unlimited golf to open bar tabs will be on offer. The Grand Oasis Sens is definitely one of the best gay all-inclusive resorts in Mexico.
Fun in the Sun
Part of the joy of a vacation is spending time outside a gay resort; Cancun is perfect for this. The warm tropical breezes blowing off the sea drag you out of your hotel room like the smell of a freshly baked pie brings you to the kitchen. Leave the confines of your incredible suite and spend the day on nearby Isla Mujeres, where you can enjoy some of the best snorkeling conditions in the region. The coral reefs surrounding the island offer you the opportunity to view magical creatures like sea turtles, reef sharks, and an array of fish species. If you’d really like to mingle with some of the ocean’s most well-known inhabitants, sign up to swim with dolphins at Dolphin Discovery. You’ll have the chance to interact with these amazing mammals on a level you didn’t think was possible.
After you’ve emerged from the deep blue sea, make your way back to the mainland and pay a visit to the Museo Maya de Cancun. This giant structure, opened by the National Institute of Anthropology and History in 2012, is a must-do during your vacation to the Yucatan Peninsula. Wander through the hall dedicated to the archeological history of the state of Quintana Roo. After that, head into a second hall dedicated to the entirety of the Mayan culture. Artifacts found in as faraway places like Belize and El Salvador are showcased throughout the hall. There’s also an archeological site called San Miguelito on the grounds of the museum that is nothing short of spectacular.
Ready to take that next step toward making your dream vacation a reality? Travelocity will be your best companion when you’re looking for the best offers on gay-friendly resorts in Cancun. Even though you’ll be treating yourself to a luxurious and glorious retreat, you’ll still be saving tons of money. Ready to wander? Follow the sounds of rolling waves to the beaches of the Yucatan Peninsula. It’s time wander wisely…and drink tequila.

Krystal Cancun
4.0
Perfect location, Staff is attentive
For the price and the amount of stars the Hotel has, its quality will surprise you. When we arrived our room was upgraded to a deluxe, giving us an ocean view. The stay overall was wonderful, the pool was large, there was access to the beach from the pool area. There is only one bar accessible from the pool which can be an inconvenience because if your not relaxing around that area your constantly swimming back and forth. For what we paid the hotel experience was more than what we can ask for. I can tell during my stay there that management is trying to do more for their customer's and that the hotel is on its way 4/5 stars. I would definitely be staying at a Krystal Hotel on my next visit.

GR Caribe By Solaris Deluxe All Inclusive Resort
4.0
Great stay with one problem
First of all the stay in general was very good and the staff very nice, Thanks to Rosa Linda, Jeyson, and Mauricio around the pool and beach, they provided great service. The nightly entertainment at the Solaris next door was also very enjoyable. Room was clean and comfortable. Food at the two restaurants was great and the outdoor buffets were also ok for the quick meal. The only problem we experienced was the beach, as the facility does not have many beach chairs with umbrellas and the ones they do provide are often " reserved " by " chair hogs" who place towels over them and then go off to the pool or for lunch and leave everyone else wanting the place that they have " reserved " but are not using. Lots of rocks in the water so stay on the far end of the GR Caribe beach where the sand extends out into the water much further..

Great stay!
I stayed 5 nights 6 days and it was very relaxing. Not a lot to do at the hotel but getting out and about is very accessible. Only problem I had was the elevator broke down twice and my room phone didn't work the whole stay. Other than that I had a great time!
