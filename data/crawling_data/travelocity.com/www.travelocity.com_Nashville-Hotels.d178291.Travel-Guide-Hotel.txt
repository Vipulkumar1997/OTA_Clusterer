Our Guide To Hotels In Nashville TN
You can’t help but tap your toes when the Man in Black comes on the radio. Sure, you’ve always danced to your own drummer, but the familiar sounds of a classic Cash number cause a tidal wave of nostalgia to wash over your soul. You first heard his live album back in high school, and you’ve wondered if Nashville could be the June to your Johnny ever since. Now is your chance to find out. Embark on a journey to Music City, and soon you’ll be elbow-deep in savory barbecue sauce and the acoustic melodies. But first things first. You’ll need to choose one of our Nashville hotels before your epic journey to the legendary home of country music can begin.












Best Places to Stay in Nashville Near Musical Meccas
Southern hospitality and soul food intrigue even the savviest of travelers, but it’s Nashville’s reputation for music that really sets it apart from other destinations. With your sleeves rolled up and a harmonica in your pocket, you’ll fit right in at the Grand Ole Opry and Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. And you won’t miss a beat when you stay at Nashville lodging near the city’s famed musical landmarks:
Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center
: If lavish is your style, this impressive resort will have you smiling wider than a s’mores fanatic near a “Ring of Fire.” Lush gardens, a glass atrium, and waterfalls are all a part of the experience here. No, you won’t want to “Cry CryCry” at the sight of your temporary home. The resort is just a 15-minute walk from the Grand Ole Opry.
Renaissance Nashville Hotel
: Some hotels set the standard for elegance, and the Renaissance Nashville is one of them. Stretch out on your contemporary bedding, order up an exceptional meal from one of the on-site restaurants, and enjoy your view of downtown. The hotel is just 3 minutes from the Ryman Auditorium and 8 minutes from the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum on foot.
Omni Nashville Hotel
: No one has to remind you to “Get Rhythm”—it’s in your nature. You would sleep at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum if you could, just to soak up its melodic vibes and breathe in the history. The Omni lets you get pretty close; it’s attached to the Hall of Fame. When you tear yourself away from the exhibits, take advantage of the hotel’s rooftop pool.
Where to Stay in Nashville When You’re a Foodie
Nashville’s foodie scene has already made a name for itself, and continues to evolve. Some dishes are must-try, including hot chicken and brisket. Every delicious diner is at your disposal when you stay in one of the top epicurean-friendly neighborhoods:
Downtown: Put a fork in some classic Southern eats at The Farm House or Husk before a night of live music. Downtown Nashville is constantly welcoming new eateries, and staples like Frothy Monkey are happy to show you some good old fashioned hospitality. Choose an accommodation in the heart of things, like
Sheraton Nashville Downtown Hotel
, and a post-meal nap is easy as pie.
Midtown: Midtown turns up when the sun goes down. Up and down Division Street and Broadway, guitars are strumming and the underside of beer pints are pointed toward the ceiling as party-goers take “bottoms up” seriously. Stop by South Street Original Crab Shack & Authentic Dive Bar and Hattie B’s Hot Chicken before retiring to one of Midtown’s best hotels in Nashville.
East Nashville: The craft beer scene is alive and well in East Nashville. After a few hours at the Holland House Bar & Refuge or Pharmacy Burger Parlor and Beer Garden, saying “I Walk the Line” might not be so easy. Hop in a cab and head back to your Nashville hotel for the chance to recharge and rehydrate.
From the sweet tea to the country jams, Music City endears itself to you the moment you step off the plane. And with so many cheap hotels in Nashville to choose from, you’re never far from the smooth sounds of a saxophone or the savory scent of ribs fresh off the grill. Go ahead, begin your wise wandering now.

Recently Reviewed in Nashville


Quality Inn Nashville Downtown - Stadium
5.0
Excellent location for Nashville nightlife
1. The location is excellent for downtown Nashville exploring  2. Their free shuttle is a terrific customer service (you can get dropped off right at Broadway and walk across the gorgeous pedestrian bridge to get back late at night/early in the morning)  3. The breakfast buffet was excellent, very busy and they were VERY attentive  4. The staff, literally everyone we ran into, smiled and said "hello". This place is managed very well.  5. The room was clean and cool.  This is an OLD motel, but it has been renovated well. The shower was great, the A/C was awesome. The door stuck a little due to so much paint, but that was barely an inconvenience.

Best Western Plus Music Row
4.0
A good price / location combination
The hotel appears to be going through some upgrades.  They are changing furniture and refinishing some.  We could smell fresh paint or varnish in the bathroom.  It looked like the tub had been repainted and the vanity had a fresh coat of varnish.  Not the best smell, but understandable, given the situation.  The breakfast included with our room was good.  They had coffee available all day.      We were pleased that it was just a short walk to hop on the free Music City bus.  The hotel is also close to some restaurants on the outskirts of Music Row.  Hotels closer to downtown are much more expensive.  The price and accommodations were a good value.
