San Diego Vacations

While some believe paradise to be a state of mind, you know better, wise wanderer. Located in Southern California in a prime spot on the Pacific Ocean, San Diego offers endless sand and sunshine, paired with a laidback vibe that you know and love. The city practically begs you to get out and about with its comfortable climate, gorgeous scenery, and abundant activities. On San Diego vacations, you can plan to play a round of golf, visit an amusement park, museum hop in Balboa Park, hike in the Torrey Pines State Reserve, or relax at a luxurious day spa. This California city is incredibly attractive and packed with plenty to do, so be warned: Once you book a vacation package in San Diego, CA, you may never want to go home again.

Hotels in San Diego
Whether you want to check out the happening action in the Gaslamp Quarter, or simply spend your time soaking up some sun, there’s a hotel here that’s perfect for you. Got your eye on one of our package vacations in San Diego? Aside from your flight, the next major decision is choosing where to stay. To make this task a little easier, here’s an overview of four of the most popular hotels in America’s Finest City:
Catamaran Resort and Spa
: Sip on a mai tai within steps of the sand at this incredible resort, right on Mission Bay. Lying just 3-miles from SeaWorld, this island-style resort hosts waterfront luaus on a regular basis, giving you a chance to work on your hula skills. The rooms here include all the essentials, and you can upgrade to one of the Catamaran’s studios, which come with full kitchens and separate living areas. The on-site restaurant serves amazing seafood entrees in their indoor-outdoor dining room, and the hotel’s lounge is the ideal place to wash down your meal before bumming your way around the beach.
Wyndham San Diego Bayside
: If you prefer city life to time on the sand, the Wyndham is a winning choice. Set to the west of Downtown on the shores of San Diego Bay, this waterfront hotel is less than a mile from the bustling Gaslamp Quarter with scores of restaurants and boutiques, and just a short drive from Balboa Park and SeaWorld. Spend a night exploring East Village and the marina, then relax in the Wyndham’s outdoor pool before calling it a night.
The Dana on Mission Bay, BW Premier Collection
: From cycling to surfing, a wealth of activities awaits you at the Dana. Overlooking the waters of man-made Mission Bay, this resplendent resort lies a mere mile from SeaWorld and is within a five-minute walk of the water and amusements at Belmont Park. Take a bike cruiser for a spin on Bayside Walk, or ride the Giant Dipper, one of the oldest rollercoasters in California. This inn offers you a few different options when it comes to dining, and as far as activities are concerned, there’s a massage center on-site, plus a hot tub and a pair of pools. And all guests who stay at the Dana are eligible for free Wi-Fi and a complimentary shuttle ride to SeaWorld.
Loews Coronado Bay Resort
: When it comes to this city’s to high-end oceanfront resorts, it’s hard to beat the Loews Coronado. Occupying one of the most picturesque places in San Diego, this opulent hotel spans 15 acres of a pristine peninsula and is just minutes from the Gaslamp District downtown. Take a leisurely stroll along the coast of Coronado, and explore the shopping scene on Orange Avenue. Return to the Loews after nightfall for dinner at any of four restaurants, or indulge in some personal pampering at the full-service spa.
Major Attractions
The San Diego Zoo is one of the most popular attractions in the city, and is frequently named as one of the best zoos worldwide. For glimpses of the ocean’s inhabitants, search for sea creatures along La Jolla Cove or head to SeaWorld for a majestic marine show. You can also enjoy the playful side of the city with a visit to LEGOLAND California or at the beachfront amusement area, Belmont Park. Culture buffs like you can learn about the history of the area with an afternoon in Old Town, a period park that features exhibits, dining, and shopping, or by exploring the historic ships at the Maritime Museum, which celebrates this waterfront city's rich seafaring heritage.
Festivals and Events
When you book vacation packages in San Diego, consider which festivals you want to attend. The San Diego Bay Wine & Food Festival in November lets you swirl, sniff, and taste your way through one of the West Coast’s biggest food and drink celebrations. Summer Shakespeare performances at the Old Globe Theatre bring a bit of the Bard to Balboa Park, while the San Diego Film Festival is a five-day, international showcase of contemporary work in the fall.
If you’re craving a cheap vacation in San Diego, there’s never been a better time to book. Hurry up and soak up the sun by reserving San Diego package deals on Travelocity today, and save hundreds of dollars when you book a hotel and flight at the same time.
