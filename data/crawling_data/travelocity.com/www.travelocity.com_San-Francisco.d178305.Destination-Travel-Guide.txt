San Francisco Vacations

Say hello to San Francisco, California, and prepare to leave a piece of your heart among the morning bay mist. But let’s focus on the magic memories you’ll take home with you. The beating heart of Northern California, San Francisco delights with its impressive array of cultural attractions, bustling and diverse collection of neighborhoods, top-notch culinary scene, and a refreshingly welcoming atmosphere. Always pushing forward while still honoring its history, this cutting-edge city brings you the past, present, and future in one seaside package. It’s only fitting, then, to book San Francisco package deals to visit this winning city.

Top Hotels in San Francisco
There are many fabulous places to stay in the City by the Bay—from simple and low-cost accommodations to luxury resorts. Consider these guest favorites as you mix and match the perfect vacation package in San Francisco, CA:
Parc 55 San Francisco - A Hilton Hotel
: Located just north of Market Street and blocks from Union Square, the Parc 55 sits amid some of the city’s most iconic landmarks, like the San Francisco Mint, the Flood Building, as well as The Warfield Theatre and Golden Gate Theatre. Fill every minute of the day with world-class entertainment and treat yourself to a delightful nightcap at the hotel bar before a fabulous night’s sleep in luxury linens.
Stanford Court San Francisco
: On the lookout for brilliant views of the city? Stay at this boutique hotel in lovely Nob Hill, a short walk or bike ride from Grace Cathedral and the Cable Car Museum. Borrow a bike from Stanford Court to spin through San Francisco like a local. While the hotel’s exterior is vintage to boot, the streamlined interior décor is rooted firmly in the present day and the spa offers state-of-the art treatments to soothe and rejuvenate.
Hotel Whitcomb
: You’ll feel like you’ve stepped back in time when you walk into the opulent lobby at Hotel Whitcomb. Rich woodwork and tapestries greet you like the friendly hotel staff and each guest room boasts its own unique charm. Located right on Market Street, this accommodation beckons you to a show at the Orpheum Theater, just steps away, and dinner at the Whitcomb’s elegant restaurant.
Hotel Nikko San Francisco
: Love to go out and dine in? There’s room for both at Hotel Nikko, thanks to their fabulous location near Union Square and 24-hour room-service. The lobby and event spaces glisten with an abundance of graceful contemporary art, and each room is decorated with a simple and soothing aesthetic.
A City of Neighborhoods
The City in the Bay may take up a small patch of earth, but each neighborhood treats San Francisco to unique vibes and iconic sights. As you look for the perfect hotel for your vacation package in San Francisco, consider which district or part of town you want to stay in. Fisherman's Wharf, where you can easily launch off to Alcatraz Island, is full of seafood eateries and street performers. Chinatown, with its incredible food and vibrant atmosphere, is also a great place to visit. Haight-Ashbury has plenty of unique bohemian shops, while Union Square is where all the luxurious stores are.
Alternatively, SoMa (South of Market) is a good place to stay if you plan on attending a Giants baseball game (between April and September), while Golden Gate Park, located near the Richmond and Sunset neighborhoods, is one of the city's most beloved parks. Finally, Telegraph Hill features the iconic Coit Tower, and Russian Hill is where you can stroll down flower-lined Lombard Street and navigate its eight hairpin turns—both of which are essential experiences for vacations in San Francisco.
Festivals and Events
There's something happening every day in the Bay Area, so book your San Francisco vacations accordingly…or let yourself be swept up in a pleasant surprise. Must-join events include the San Francisco Beer Week in January and February, the Saint Patrick's Day Parade in March, the Cherry Blossom Festival in April, the Bay to Breakers race in May. If you’re traveling during the summer, experience the revelry of the Independence Day celebrations in July, and the San Francisco Blues Festival in September.
With so much to do here, book your cheap vacation in San Francisco as soon as possible. On Travelocity, you can find everything from flights to car rentals in San Francisco. You can also save up to $537 when you book a hotel and flight in one cool California bundle.
Accommodation in San Francisco
San Francisco is a marvelous city, and finding accommodation here is easy. Travelocity's
San Francisco lodging page
lists no less than 370 options for you to browse at your leisure.
Do you have a taste for luxury and style? Fairmont Heritage Place, Ghirardelli Square and The St. Regis San Francisco ought to tick all your boxes. Or, perhaps the Ritz-Carlton, Half Moon Bay or the Loews Regency San Francisco might be more what you're looking for this time around.
Golden Gate Bridge is a popular San Francisco attraction. If you want to stay close by, the
Cavallo Point
is just 2 miles (3 kilometers) away, and the
Hotel Drisco
is 2 miles (3 kilometers) away.




Guide to Exploring San Francisco


Marin County Vacations
Marin County lies just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco. While it may be located at the less-famous end of the iconic bridge, Marin County vacations can be just as amazing as trips to the city. Families, couples, and single travelers will find lots to do in Marin County, especially if you like to spend time outdoors.

Daly City Vacations
If riding horseback down a sunny beach sounds like a good way to spend a vacation, look no further than Daly City, California. Just south of San Francisco, Daly City boasts uncrowded beaches, top quality restaurants, and, of course, unbeatable California weather. Far enough from San Francisco to avoid the crowds but close enough to make a trip to the Golden City part of your itinerary, your Daly City vacation will be a treat for the whole family. Explore the California coast for yourself with affordable Daly City vacation packages.

Half Moon Bay Vacations
Half Moon Bay is set amid the rugged, natural beauty that exemplifies Northern California. Less than 30 miles south of San Francisco, this city offers a Half Moon Bay vacation to remember, and it is perfect for anyone seeking an outdoor retreat that combines dramatic coastal views with surrounding forested hills. Do you desire the chance to commune with nature while enjoying the benefits of a vibrant artistic community? Start packing now!
