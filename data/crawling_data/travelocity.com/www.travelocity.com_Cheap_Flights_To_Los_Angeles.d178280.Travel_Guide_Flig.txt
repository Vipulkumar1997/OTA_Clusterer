Flights To Los Angeles
They say if you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere. But you know the truth. If you can make it in Los Angeles, you’ve truly passed a test of talent and stamina. While the streets here are lined with palm trees and the hopes of aspiring artists, not everyone can make it to the silver screen. Even if you’re not heading to the City of Angels with dreams of stardom dancing in your eyes, you never know when you could be discovered on Sunset Boulevard or catch a celeb’s glow as you pass them on Rodeo Drive.
LA is the land of sunshine and big dreams, and a place where you can get sand in your toes by morning and turn your face toward the sun in Griffith Park by afternoon. In the evening, scope out the nightlife in West Hollywood or downtown. Book flights to Los Angeles with Travelocity, and your turn in the land of stars and dreams is about to begin.
Transportation from LAX
Los Angeles flights land at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), near the coast and just 20 miles from downtown. Whether you’re staying in the heart of the city or at one of the beach cities, there are transportation options for getting to your hotel. Los Angeles traffic has earned itself a reputation as being a challenge, and navigating it can require a bit of patience. If you’d rather let someone else take the reins, take the FlyAway shuttle to locations including Union Station and Westwood. You can also take the “G” shuttle to the Metro Green Line Aviation Station.
To open up the possibilities for your Los Angeles vacation, grab a rental car near the arrival level islands. A car allows you to make your way around the county on a whim, from the beach to the desert, maximizing your days in Southern California. Book your rental car at the same time you buy airfare to Los Angeles to save money, like the savvy wise wanderer you are.
Hotels Near LAX
When you stay around the airport, you’re within just a few miles of everything from Manhattan Beach to Santa Monica. Depart from your hotel in the morning and head straight for the Hollywood Sign, or spend a whimsical day exploring area amusement parks. You saved big on your plane tickets to Los Angeles, so a quality, comfy hotel room awaits you at the end of a long day.
Fairfield Inn & Suites Los Angeles LAX/El Segundo
: Just minutes from any of the LAX terminals, this hotel has bright, playfully colored furniture and extended stay suites big enough for you to really stretch out. Put up your feet at your own desk and awaken each day to a full breakfast.
Hilton Los Angeles Airport
: This cosmopolitan property is under a mile from the airport. Begin your day with a dip in the sparkling pool, then jump in the car and head to the beach. Book an executive suite, and you’ll recline in style after your brush off the sand.
Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport
: You can check in around the clock at the Four Points, and you’re greeted by quintessential LA palms as you approach the hotel. Within minutes of Hermosa and Manhattan Beach, the hotel also has a “Beererie” where you can try a local craft brew.
Loews Hollywood Hotel
: You’re ready to take your vacation up a notch. A rooftop pool calls for you, and a prime Hollywood location is where you belong. Check in to the Loews Hollywood, and let the property’s spacious spa and stunning views sweep you off your feet.
Things to Do in Los Angeles
There are stars in your eyes and on the sidewalk. As you tour the Getty Center and Grauman’s Chinese Theatre, you’re taken with the possibility of seeing your favorite celebrity around any corner. Compare your handprints with your hero on the sidewalk outside Grauman’s, and then head to Universal Studios Hollywood to act out scenes from your favorite movie. You were savvy enough to book one of the cheapest flights to LA, so your wallet has plenty of cash for tickets to the Hollywood Bowl or a shopping spree at The Grove.
Book flight deals to Los Angeles on Travelocity today, and your trip to the City of Angels is off on the right designer-outfitted foot. It doesn’t get any more glamorous than the heart of the country’s movie industry, and you’re perfectly primed to fit right in. Grab your finest pair of sunglasses and get ready to make your entrance.
