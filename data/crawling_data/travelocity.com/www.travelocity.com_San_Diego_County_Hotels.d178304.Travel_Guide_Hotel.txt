Our Guide To Cheap Hotels In San Diego
It’s called Sunset Cliffs for a reason. From your vantage point a few dozen feet above the breaking surf, you’ll enjoy an amazing view of the glowing golden orb as it dips into the steel blue Pacific. If fortune shines upon you like the glorious San Diego sun has all day, you might catch a glimpse of the elusive and ethereal Green Flash—when a verdant dot remains visible for a brief moment after the sun has already dipped below the horizon. After nature’s light show, head back to your San Diego hotel and freshen up for an evening of urban excitement.












There’s probably no city with a more fitting nickname than that of San Diego. With its location on the sparkling blue waters of the Pacific Ocean and ridiculous amount of sunny days, San Diego truly deserves the moniker of “America’s Finest City.” Whether you’re going for a stroll in the sand as the tide washes over your feet or you’re exploring the bustling avenues of downtown, our San Diego hotel deals will help you find a perfect home base. The sun, the fun, the surf, and the sand blend together to make a trip here unforgettable. And when you book your stay through Travelocity, you’ll save enough to experience everything San Diego has to offer.
What Are the Best Places to Stay in San Diego?
When you’re trying to figure out where to stay in San Diego, you are most likely going to think about the beach…and you would not be altogether incorrect. However, the city’s most popular stretches of sandy serenity—Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, Ocean Beach, and La Jolla Shores—are just a short drive from anywhere, even the cheap hotels in San Diego’s outlying areas. So why not stay somewhere else around town—closer to the nightlife, parks, and wilderness areas that help San Diego earn its nickname? Here are some of the more popular neighborhoods and our favorite hotels in each:
Downtown
San Diego is very much a beach town, but its downtown area is also every bit a true major city center. The Gaslamp Quarter alone has enough boutiques, eateries, and nightclubs to give SoHo, The Magnificent Mile, and Rodeo Drive a run for their money. Add to that a renowned theater scene and the San Diego Zoo in Balboa Park, and you have a downtown on par with any in the states.
Wyndham San Diego Bayside
– Not only is the Wyndham less than a mile from the airport and a short walk from the attractions downtown, it is also situated on Harbor Drive next to Waterfront Park. Talk about an ideal location! That’s not all the hotel has going for it. With sweeping views of the city skyline or the setting sun, you may not want to leave your comfortable guest room…unless it is to explore the city on one of the Segways you can rent on-site.
Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego
– Just steps from the San Diego Convention Center, the excitement of downtown, and the attractions at Seaport Village, the Grand Hyatt welcomes travelers of all kinds. Coordinate your event at the convention center with a meeting in the hotel’s 300,000-plus square feet of flexible space. Enjoy a relaxing treatment in the Marilyn Monroe Spa, then down a nightcap while watching the sunset from the Top of the Hyatt, the 40th-floor lounge.
Mission Bay
San Diego has two bays. The San Diego Bay is primarily for work, as it’s home to three Navy properties and multiple shipping companies. Mission Bay, on the other hand, is all about recreation. Hop on a paddleboard, rent a sailboat, or take a leisurely wine cruise—you really can’t go wrong.
Catamaran Resort and Spa
– Add a touch of the exotic to your San Diego vacation. This Polynesian-themed resort is tucked away in a secluded corner of Mission Bay. Your guest room doors open up to a grassy lawn that leads you right to a private bay beach. Want to experience some bigger waves? The Pacific Ocean is just three blocks away. After you’ve washed your cares away in the refreshing waters, enjoy a sunset luau back at the resort.
The Dana on Mission Bay-BW Premier Collection
– Situated on a small outcropping in the middle of Mission Bay, the Dana is far away from the hustle and bustle of the city. If you play your cards right, the only thing that will remind you of outside civilization will be the nightly fireworks from nearby SeaWorld. Spend your day getting pampered at the on-site spa, count the kayakers float by on the bay from the resort’s private beach, or rent a boat from the private marina and get out on the water for yourself.
We’re not fortune tellers, but we can see a trip to the shores of Southern California in your near future. All you have to do is book one of Travelocity’s great deals and leave your everyday worries behind you—you won’t need them for a while. Whether you need an upscale resort by the bay, one of the luxurious downtown San Diego hotels, cheap lodging around town, or accommodations anywhere in the area, Travelocity can save you money in a flash. Speaking of flashes, there’s one thing we didn’t tell you about the Green Flash: It only can happen if you are there to witness it.

Hilton San Diego Bayfront

Great Hotel Centrally Located!!
This was a great location to stay in.  Very central to anything you can want to do while in San Diego.  Right across from the Gas Lamp District with all it's great restaurants and bars and the Padres! But also convenient to get to the Zoo, Balboa Park, Coronado Island, Mission Beach and La Jolla!! The staff was very friendly and always helpful.  And the Spa was AMAZING!

Centrally Located
On a budget, it's a nice place. Uber rides are short to Mission Beach and Seaworld. Rooms are clean and several restaurants, a grocery store, and a casino within walking distance. Room for four only stocked enough towels for three, had to leave a note for housekeeping.

San Diego Downtown Lodge
4.0
Good experience overall!
The hotel is very close to the 32nd Street Naval Base which is one of the reasons I chose it. Upon arrival I was a little concerned about the area and how the exterior of the building looked. It is set up more like a motel how all the rooms are arranged outside. However, once we got into the lobby and saw our room everything was fine. The hotel rooms look very nice, marble counters, and hardwood floor. I was pleased with the price and considering the area it is located in it was a good stay!     It was close to everything we wanted to do as well. 2 hours away from Los Angeles, maybe 30 minutes away from La Jolla and the seal beaches. I would stay here again, the room service was good, we always had new towels and sheets, and the room was really clean.
