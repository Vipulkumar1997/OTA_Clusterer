Orlando Vacations

In Orlando, Florida, anything is possible. You can explore exotic lands, play putt-putt with pirates, and splash around with dolphins—all before lunch. In addition to its major attractions and amusement parks, Orlando offers world-class performing arts, professional sports, and fine dining in an attractive locale. Plus, as if there weren’t enough things to do in town, you’re only a short drive from watching the sun rise over the Atlantic and set into the Gulf of Mexico. And, when you use Travelocity to help you book a cheap vacation in Orlando, you’ll have enough money left over to buy a souvenir from every place you visit.

Major Orlando Attractions
Orlando is called the Theme Park Capital of the World, and with good reason—the city is home to the biggest and most famous of its kind in the world, including Walt Disney World® Resort, Universal Studios Resort, SeaWorld Orlando, and LEGOLAND Florida. With so many water parks, amusement parks, and resorts to choose from, Travelocity’s Orlando vacations will fill up your itinerary fast. Stay at one of the hotels along International Drive and let the I-Ride Trolley take you between the Orlando Premium Outlet malls on each end of the route, with a stop at the Orlando Eye Ferris wheel on the way. If you're looking to explore outside city limits during your vacations in Orlando, rent a car for a side trip to the coast for a tour of the Kennedy Space Center or to soak up the sun's rays on Cocoa Beach.
Orlando Hotels
Many vacation packages in Orlando include stays at some of the most renowned accommodations in Central Florida. And, with the help of Travelocity, you can find a great rate on many of them. Here are some of our favorites:
Caribe Royale All-Suite Hotel & Convention Center
– The Caribe Royale is situated so close to the Disney theme parks that you don’t even need to get on the highway to get to their front gates. And, with every room being either a suite or two-bedroom villa, you can bring the entire family and still enjoy your own personal space. Location isn’t the only thing that this hotel has going for it, though. The on-site convention facilities make the Caribe Royale an ideal option for business meetings, as well.
Walt Disney World Swan
– All of Disney is at your doorstep when you stay at this fabulous resort property. And, after a day meeting princesses and pirates, you can recharge your batteries in your plush guestroom bedding that includes a pillow-top mattress, goose-down comforter, and overstuffed pillows. If you’re taking some time off from the rides and attractions at the theme parks, you can spend the day by the pool, on the golf course, or in the day spa—all of which are on the impressive property.
Walt Disney World Dolphin
– A sister property to the Swan, the Dolphin offers a host of amazing conveniences that include complementary transportation to all the Walt Disney attractions, parks, and resorts, a free shuttle to the outlet mall, Disney ticket counters, two business centers, and airline boarding kiosks. Add to that an Asian-inspired full-service salon, 17 on-site restaurants, and a host of specialty shops and you’ll have one of the most impressive lists of amenities in the hospitality industry.
Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Suites – Waterpark
– Not only is this environmentally friendly IHG Green Engage Holiday Inn close to the Disney attractions, it’s also a short drive from SeaWorld, Gatorland, and a handful of championship-caliber golf courses. Plus, there is a water park on the property! The entire family is going to love the on-site activities that include the Batman Laser Challenge, a 3,000-square foot arcade, and a 4-D theater.
Festivals and Events
Gorgeous weather and scenery make Orlando the prime destination for festivals, events, and conventions. Visit in March for a weekend of comics and cosplay at MegaCon, or for 10 days of international and independent movies at the world-renowned Florida Film Festival. Take on the challenge of seeing over 700 hours of theater in May during the two-week Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival. Special events are held throughout the year in various theme parks, such as Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights in October and the annual Epcot International Food and Wine Festival during autumn.
Find Your Place in “The City Beautiful”
You can save up enough money to fill Cinderella’s Castle when you bundle your hotel and flight with one of Travelocity’s Orlando package deals. Plus, when you purchase your travel and accommodations at the same time, it takes all the stress out of the equation. And, isn’t that what a vacation is supposed to be about? Finding great prices on vacation packages in Orlando, FL, means you can stay and play without breaking the bank.
Accommodation in Orlando
Orlando is a much-loved destination, and finding a place to stay here will be a breeze. Travelocity's
Orlando hotel deals page
lists no less than 758 options that you can choose from.
If you have a taste for life's little luxuries, you'll be sure to enjoy the
Disney's Animal Kingdom Villas - Kidani Village
or the
Disney's Beach Club Villas
. Alternatively, the Bay Lake Tower at Disney's Contemporary Resort or the Boulder Ridge Villas at Disney's Wilderness Lodge will provide you with wholesome comfort at bargain prices.
Countless travelers stay at the
Las Palmeras by Hilton Grand Vacations
, because it is 3 miles (5 kilometers) away from the Universal Studios Orlando. Also, the
Residence Inn by Marriott Orlando Convention Center
is only 3 miles (5 kilometers) away.
