Our Guide To Cheap Hotels In Boston
While some may call Boston “Beantown,” in honor of its historic staple, you like to think of the New England city as “The Hub of the Universe” or “The City of Notions.” You’ve pored over the pages of Emerson and Alcott in search of ideas and stories, and you have not been disappointed. Now’s the time to journey to the land that inspired these and other literary greats. Armed with a leather notebook and your favorite pair of wandering shoes, you’re ready to seek out America’s brilliance. When you find yourself tiring of the powdered wigs of the past, contemporary flair will flourish through your getaway. If you’re wondering where to stay in Boston, you’ve come to the right place. Read on to learn more about Boston hotels in some of the city’s most beloved neighborhoods.












Life is a Stage in the Theater District
Lining the green lawns of Boston Common with marquis and stage doors, the Theater District puts Boston’s performing arts scene right in the middle of the most popular sights and hotels in Boston. Book one of these lovely digs and you too will enjoy one of the best places to stay in Boston. Step out for a night at the opera, wander over to the nearby waterfront, and bask in the faint harmony of a matinee as you get ready to dine on fine seafood.
Boston Omni Parker House Hotel
: This downtown hotel is on the Freedom Trail and is just a 10-minute walk to the heart of the Theater District. The historic hotel, built in 1855, will impress you with luxurious linens and opulent artwork. Stop for a drink at the hotel bar, which gives you the sense that you’ve stepped into a secret speakeasy. As a smooth whiskey passes your lips, your soul soars and you can hear the whisper of history.
Boston Park Plaza
: Feel your worries drift away into the ether. They have no place here. You’re smack dab in the middle of the Theater District and your hotel is teeming with ornate décor and stunning city views. Sink your teeth into some divine “farm-to-fabulous” eats at Off the Common, the hotel’s fabulous restaurant, or get a mouthwatering cheese platter delivered to your room. Yes, you think, Liz Lemon will be proud. You’re working on your night cheese.
Back Bay and Boston Common
You’ve always had a soft spot for brownstones and open air concert tunes dancing through autumn leaves, so the Back Bay feels like a home away from home. Victorian houses share the neighborhood with cultural hubs like the iconic public library, and you’re never far from those sparkling water views you love. Boston hotel deals in the Back Bay—located west of Boston Common and the Theater District—makes Beantown your oyster, so enjoy the city’s signature chowder while you’re bustling around.
Copley Square Hotel
: Travelers have wandered the halls of this boutique hotel since 1891. The shops of Newbury Street are just two blocks away, and you can retire to the hotel’s martini lounge for a night cap. Just be sure to set your alarm, because the hotel hosts a morning power hour between 6 and 7 a.m., where jogging maps, bottled water, and granola bars are waiting in the lobby. Or sleep in and dream of another lovely day wandering along Freedom Trail and sipping tea in Boston Harbor.
The Westin Copley Place, Boston
: You part the curtains in the morning and gaze out at the Charles River. Throwing open your suitcase, you realize you forgot to pack your workout wear. No worries; just ring the front desk and they’ll lend you some New Balance gear in minutes. After your cool down, recover at the Grettacole Spa and later investigate the flavorful Brazilian restaurant. Copley Place Mall is literally attached to this hotel, so take advantage of the shops, but don’t worry about dropping. A pillowtop bed will catch you.
You’re ready to walk in the steps of Clara Barton and Benjamin Franklin, enjoy a fresh bowl of chowder, and buy some Red Sox gear for a day at Fenway Park. Book one of our cheap hotels in Boston and let your foray into history begin. Don’t forget to pack your monocle.

Beautiful hotel on the Boston waterfront
This modern and elegant hotel is a lovely and comfortable place to stay.  What really stands out is the warm, friendly and helpful staff.  Everyone went out of their way to be responsive.

The Liberty
4.0
check inn:
I arrived on a Saturday evening. The lobby becomes a big noisy bar. There was only one receptionist whith a very soft voice. It was difficult for her to hear and difficult for us checking in to hear and understand her. There was a big line to check inn. My suggestion is that for those days where the lobby turns into a big noisy bar, check inn should be done elsewhere and more staff should be ready to help guests in check inn.  The concierge was always helpful.       The men at the entrance are not friendly at all.
