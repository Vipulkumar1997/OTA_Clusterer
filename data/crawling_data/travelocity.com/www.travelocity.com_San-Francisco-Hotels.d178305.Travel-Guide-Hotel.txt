Our Guide To Cheap Hotels In San Francisco
At twilight, fog rolls into the City by the Bay and shrouds you in a veil of possibilities. Will you spend your evening hunched over a craft bourbon cocktail in the Castro District? Or depart one of the San Francisco hotels and walk down Baker Beach, bewitched by the lights from Sausalito twinkling across the Golden Gate Bridge?












San Francisco has attracted a diverse crowd of inhabitants—from tech industry moguls to modern-day hippies. Yes, it is unfaltering in its ability to boast the typical urban offerings of a big city, yet it also has enriching experiences spanning from the art world to the baseball diamond. And while you may not know the city as well as one of its die-hard residents, that doesn’t mean you won’t become endeared to its charms. For even if you don’t leave a down payment in San Francisco, as the song promises, you will surely leave your fluttering heart there. Go ahead, dive right in to the California mystique San Francisco has to offer. Let Travelocity help you find your perfect home base for your stay—whether it be cheap San Francisco hotels or luxury landmark accommodations. Hotels in the heart of things are the perfect place for a wise wanderer such as yourself to get in touch with the crown jewel of the Golden State. And, Travelocity’s San Francisco hotel deals can save you a gold rush worth of cash to spend on your foggy night out on the town.
Where Are the Best Places to Stay in San Francisco?
When you are looking for where to stay in San Francisco, it is best to consider the attractions you most wish to visit. Once you know where you want to go and what you want to do, it will be much easier to decide on your accommodations. Here are some of the best hotels in the most popular neighborhoods in San Francisco:
Union Square
New York can have Central Park, and D.C. can keep the National Mall. San Francisco has its own hub of history and high spirits in Union Square. Shop at upscale retailers, dine at inspired eateries, and even work on your Double Salchow at the outdoor ice-skating rink…weather permitting, of course. In short, it is San Francisco defined, in one open city block. Here are our favorite Union Square hotels:
Parc 55 San Francisco
– Modern style and conveniences meet attentive service at Hilton’s newest venture into San Francisco. Enjoy a view of Union Square and Twin Peaks from your spacious guestroom, then enjoy a grab-and-go breakfast before you start exploring. After you’ve experienced the city from bay to beach, treat yourself to dinner at Pac 55’s Kin Khao, hailed by GQ magazine as one of the “best new restaurants in the U.S.”
Hotel Nikko San Francisco
– Take in a jazz show at Feinstein’s, feast on Asian-inspired California cuisine at ANZU, and rent an exotic sports car—all without leaving the property. Unwind from your day downtown in your guestroom’s urban refuge with a pillowtop bed, thirsty bathrobe, and in-room massage. And, sleep soundly with the knowledge that you are contributing to helping to save the planet just by staying at this EPA Energy Star award-winning hotel.
SoMa
Tucked neatly between the Mission and Financial Districts, SoMa (short for South of Market) is the perfect neighborhood if you are visiting the city for either work or play. Visit the Cartoon Art Museum, take in a ballgame at AT&T; Park, or experience the creative culture at Yerba Buena Gardens. We highly recommend this SoMa hotel:
Hotel Whitcomb
– Venture back in time to this over a century old historic landmark. Having served as City Hall from 1912 to 1915, the Whitcomb is steeped in San Francisco lore. While the décor may be opulent and antique, the amenities are thoroughly modern. The stately grandeur of your guestroom is complemented by the innovative fare available at the Market Street Grill. And, a drink at The Tavern will help you harken back to Old San Francisco.
Nob Hill
One of San Francisco’s premier neighborhoods, Nob Hill is home to mansions once owned by railroad barons and gold rush champions. A stroll along its streets will take you past such sights as the Fountain of Tortoises in Huntington Square, the Cable Car Museum, and a host of impressive eateries. If Nob Hill is calling your name, book a room in this swanky hotel:
Stanford Court San Francisco
– Don’t be fooled by the Stanford Court’s classic exterior. This boutique hotel is completely cutting edge once you walk through the lobby doors. Keeping with San Francisco’s digital dominance, the hotel offers business travelers and vacationers, alike, access to state-of-the-art technologies like a collection of MacBooks and iPads, free high-speed Wi-Fi, and Google Glass Explorer program. When you are ready to trade in the virtual world for some real-world, you can enjoy a good night’s rest in your gorgeous, well-appointed guestroom.
You’re ready to fall in love with sourdough bread and dim sum. You’ll spend your days shopping and your evenings with a glass of wine in one hand and the Golden Gate Bridge in sight. You won’t settle for just any accommodation. And hotels in San Francisco would never expect you to. Indulge yourself with a high-end suite along the water, or save your budget for Union Square designers and stay at one of the best cheap hotels in San Francisco. Then, prepare to be blown away by San Fran.

Mini weekend getaway
The hotel is amazing! My boyfriend and I were spending the weekend in SF and so happy that we chose this hotel. Fortunately, we got to the hotel early and instead of getting a room on the 20th floor that would have been a normal size room, we got a suite with balcony on the 8th floor (corner unit) with amazing views of the bay bridge and Oakland hills. The staff were all great and the room was huge and clean! I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel to those looking for a quiet area to stay yet close enough to local bars/lounges and great restaurants.

A one nighter
My wife and I stayed here on our last night before heading home.    It lived up to the Hyatt name and was excellent.    All the staff were terrific.   The restaurant/ bar were open, clean and just enjoyable to sit and relax.    Food was great.    Staff were outstanding in friendliness, service and professionalism.     Our room was clean, big and comfortable.    We faced the atrium and instead of just curtains to block light the room had something like a big blind that came from the ceiling all the way to the floor.    Free WiFi and all the things you could require in a full service hotel.    I'll stay here any time I travel to San Francisco.    I should also point out that the hotel has a 24 hour shuttle to the airport.
