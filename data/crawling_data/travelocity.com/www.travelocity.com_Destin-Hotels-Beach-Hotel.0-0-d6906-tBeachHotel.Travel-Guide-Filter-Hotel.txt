Clean rooms.
The room was clean and tidy. The cleaning staff did a nice job! Front desk wasn't friendly. When checking out didn't even ask how our stay was for our family. Hot tub was dirty and handle didn't work to turn it on so it had one workable jet. The sign out front is fun for tourists to get their picture ...

For the price, not bad... but very noisey.
Its a holiday inn express... Clean, modern, and economical. But, not quite a relaxing destination as per the hotels design if your close to the breakfast cafe, every single person walks past your room and its very loud so youl be awake by 830 on your vacation. The staff was nice, the maids very chatty, ...

Author Abraham Verghese once said, “I'm a great believer in geography being destiny.” Keep that in mind as you plan your next great getaway. Escape to a place where the strong currents of the Gulf of Mexico draw warm, emerald waters and leaping dolphins toward a white, sandy shore. Like sea glass, follow the path of sailors and fishermen from centuries past to the stunning seaside city of Destin. They say don’t tempt fate, but why not book dreamy Destin beachfront hotels and give destiny a nudge? Before you dive in, read on to learn more about the journey…
What are some fun beach activities to do in Destin?
Destin locals and travelers alike practically live on and in the water. Surfing, snorkeling, sunbathing, fishing, and parasailing are just some of the many ways to enjoy the Emerald Coast. The crystal sand at Henderson Beach State Park looks like sugar beneath your feet, and the ocean breeze will brush your sun-kissed skin as you skim across the water on a windsurfing board. Beneath the rippling surface, Destin is home to coral reefs and other colorful sea creatures just waiting to be discovered near Destin Harbor.
Destin is also home to waterfront villages for those moments when you want to drip dry and browse sundries along a vintage downtown boardwalk. The carnival attractions and evening fireworks at Destin Harbor Boardwalk will remind you of childhood merrymaking while waterfront cocktails, fine dining, and luxury Destin beach hotels will remind you how grateful you are to be all grown up. Speaking of fine dining you may be wondering…
Have any advice on finding the best places for seafood in Destin?
Travel along Harbor Boulevard and follow the scent of shrimp scampi and lemon juice on fresh oysters.
Dewey Destin’s: With a location in the harbor and another on Crab Island, this is a delicious and thoroughly Southern landmark, and no trip to Destin is complete without a cup of seafood gumbo and a plate of the blackened catch of the day. This is Florida, so order it spicy, as Floribbean food is meant to be.
Marina Café: Add a hint of ginger to the palate here, where the presentation is as bright as the internationally inspired menu. From fried green tomatoes with shrimp to sushi rolls and pan-roasted salmon, you’ll find something to make your mouth water.
Harbor Docks: This establishment boasts a laidback and indulgent atmosphere with a menu to match. If you’re looking for a unique smorgasbord of cheesy coastal comfort foods and stunning sunset views, dine at Harbor Docks and waste some time.
Many of the city’s top restaurants are located between the harbor and Henderson Beach, and so are fabulous accommodation options, including
SunDestin Beach Resort
and
Pelican Beach Resort
, both by Wyndham Vacation Rentals. It’s time to stop wondering what living in a condo on the beach feels like and instead trying it.
When destiny woos you out to sea, book Destin hotels on the beach with Travelocity. We’ll match the best price you can find, so instead of combing the internet for deals, you can be well on your way to combing the beach for starfish and seashells.
