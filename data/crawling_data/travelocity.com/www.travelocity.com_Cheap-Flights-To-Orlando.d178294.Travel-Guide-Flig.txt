Flights To Orlando
Close your eyes and let your imagination off its leash. Are you walking beneath swaying palms, letting the sun warm your face? Perhaps you’re in a fantasy land, lively characters all around you, awakening your inner child and sense of wonder. You don’t need to create an inner wonderland to experience the realm your mind has created. It’s been right here all along: Welcome to Orlando.
It's not just the eternal sunshine that makes Orlando a vacation paradise for millions of travelers each year. "The Theme Park Capital of the World" boasts some of the most-visited attractions in the on the planet. Frolic with beloved characters at Walt Disney World®, watch silver screen fantasies come to life at Universal Studios Orlando, or plunge into the cooling waters of Wet'n'Wild. "The City Beautiful" also exalts nature through its grand oaks, towering palm trees, and Lake Eola with its famous fountain. Flights to Orlando touch down at Orlando International (MCO), which uses groves of trees and waterways to landscape its surroundings.
Transportation from MCO
When your Orlando flight lands, you’re bound to be itching to get to your hotel and begin your adventures under the sun. Most transportation options depart from the Ground Transportation Level of each terminal. Many local hotels include a complimentary shuttle, which will get you door to door in just minutes.
Staying at a theme park? Your package may include airport pickup. Or, complement your cheap flight with an inexpensive bus ticket. For more direct service, book a shuttle van that charges by the person. Taxis may be cost-effective since you're charged by the vehicle, and taxi vans can carry up to nine passengers. If you want to explore Greater Orlando, book a rental car when you buy plane tickets to Orlando. You'll find the counter to pick up your vehicle in Terminals A and B for most rental car companies.
Hotels Near MCO
You’re a savvy traveller; you proved that when you booked one of the cheapest flights to Orlando. Continue to save cash by booking a great deal on a hotel near the airport. You’ll have your bags unpacked and your swimsuit on before you can say “Where is the sunscreen?”
Holiday Inn Resort Orlando Suites – Waterpark
: This all-suites hotel is at the entrance to Walt Disney World®. Begin your day at the on-site water park and then take a nap in a cabana. Make memories at a 4-D movie experience or the Batman Laser Challenge.
Walt Disney World® Dolphin
: Situated inside the park, this family-friendly place greets you with giant dolphin statues and a fun aqua color palate. Imagine you’re staying under the sea with the vibrant coral accents, and enjoy the pool with waterslide as soon as you’re checked in.
Caribe Royale All-Suite Hotel & Convention Center
: When you want to stay away from the famous park but within reach of Orlando’s best attractions, the Caribe Royale is ideal. You can’t miss the bright pink façade, and once inside more than 50 lush acres provide a tropical respite.
Walt Disney World® Swan
: The sister resort to the Dolphin, a stay at the swan is fun for your entire gang. Spacious suites give you tons of room to stretch out, and you’re within steps of the best rides in Orlando as well as the Mandara Spa.
Things to Do in Orlando

Leu Gardens wait to enrich your day with their beautifully trimmed displays, and the Orlando Science Center has interactive displays that will open your mind and bewitch your senses. Take a walk through charming Old Town to get away from the crowds and meander through the shops.
