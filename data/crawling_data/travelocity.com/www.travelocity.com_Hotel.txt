Enjoy the razzle and dazzle of fast-paced life in one of the big coastal cities, or pack up your ski equipment for the adventure of a lifetime. We offer a wide variety of accommodations to suit your tastes; rest in the penthouse suite of a five-star resort, or enjoy a home-cooked meal in a charming bed and breakfast. No matter where – or when – you want to get away, Travelocity is here to help you land the best deals swiftly and painlessly. Stop putting off that trip – adventure awaits.
The celebrities, the sports, the shopping… yes, you’ve heard stories of “Tinsel Town.” Isn’t it time for you to see if the tales are true? Check out Southern California’s allure for yourself when you book
hotels in Los Angeles
.
Friend, they don’t call it “Sin City” for nothing. Cruise through the casinos, take a gondola ride, then rest up in
Las Vegas hotels
to do it all again in the morning. Or evening. Whatever suits you.
Mark Twain once said the coldest winter he ever spent was a summer in San Francisco. You’ll have to judge the truth of that for yourself – and try the famous clam chowder at Pier 39 while you’re at it – when you book a night in our
San Francisco hotels
.
Next up, glide down the California coastline to the other city by the bay. No matter when you reserve
San Diego hotels
, you’ll enjoy year-round sunshine, beautiful beaches, and yes, those famous burritos.
Move inland toward Colorado and relax in the capital city – our
hotels in Denver
will take care of all your worries. Book that ski trip, sample craft brews, or just find new ways to get elevated in the “Mile-High City.”

As for the food, well, your new city has plenty in store for you.
Take a seat at a raw bar on the Boston waterfront and partake of refreshing oysters straight from the sea – the terroir of Cape Cod Bay is spectacular. Encounter living history on the Freedom Trail, or rendezvous with Rembrandt and Monet at the Museum of Fine Arts. Rest assured that
Boston hotels
will always be ready with a soft pillow where you can lay your head and dream of tomorrow’s plans.
Journey west to
hotels in New York City
and discover the treasures of America’s most spectacular metropolis. From the morning sun shining on the Statue of Liberty to the sparkling lights of the skyline at night, there is nothing like the Big Apple. As Sinatra said, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.
The great William Smith once extolled the virtues of another celebrated East Coast city: Philadelphia. Travelocity’s
hotels in Philadelphia
are the perfect place to relax after a day spent dining on signature cheesesteak and reveling in America’s most important historical landmarks.
Philly may be the site of politics past, but
Washington, D.C. hotels
are where today’s mavens meet and mingle. Travelocity will have you keeping company with the nation’s brass and taking in some of the world’s greatest museums before you can say “Let’s do brunch.”
If you’re looking for a different kind of charm, perhaps it’s
Charlotte hotels
you seek. Settle in with a homemade sweet tea and enjoy the Southern hospitality. Later, venture downtown and find a darkened lounge brimming over with sultry blues music. Your East Coast vacation is complete.

Top Hotels in America's Midwest
The Midwest is home to some of America’s most vibrant cities, with world-class attractions and mouthwatering treats for all tastes. When you book with Travelocity, you’ll spend less time searching and more time dreaming of ice skating on a winter’s eve or a warm, cheesy slice of deep-dish pizza. Whatever your desires, the Midwest is a must-see stop for any traveler.
Let’s begin our journey in the birthplace of that delectable deep-dish pizza we mentioned.
Chicago hotels
are about much more than tempting tidbits. Promenade along Navy Pier for waterfront tableaus or take yourself upward, to the top of the Willis Tower for sweeping skyline views.
Hotels in Detroit
offer up a whole new world of attractions, from lovely strolls in the gorgeous Belle Isle Park to perusing masterpieces at the Institute of Arts. Of course, you can always simply immerse yourself in the sultry tunes of Motown.
Yearning for a summer frolic through gardens of modern sculpture? Or a winter’s afternoon spent gliding along a frozen lake followed by a steaming cup of hot chocolate?
Hotels in Minneapolis
are your home away from home for year-round outdoor adventure – plus so much quintessential Midwestern charm, you’ll never want to leave.
Slip south to
hotels in St. Louis
to dine on the city’s renowned smoky barbecue and melt-in-your-mouth gooey butter cake. Then cross state lines to Malcolm Martin Memorial Park in Illinois for a million-dollar view of the Gateway Arch.
If you like to spend your getaways wandering amongst quaint village enclaves with nary an itinerary in sight,
Columbus hotels
are your ideal match. Amble through historic architecture and urban gardens in the German Village neighborhood, then let butterflies alight on your shoulders at the Franklin Park Conservatory. In America’s Midwest, no dream goes unfulfilled – and no treasures go undiscovered when you let Travelocity be your guide.

Hotel Deals in Southern United States
Where do you find your travel inspiration? Is it in the enticing flavors of a new and exciting cuisine? Or in the beautiful sights and sounds of historic districts and vintage theatres? Whatever it is that fuels your appetite for adventure, the American South has it. Brimming with vibrant culture, savory dishes and year-round warmth, it’s always the ideal place for your next getaway.
Many a traveler has felt the pull of the “Sunshine State”— after all, it’s difficult to resist more than a thousand miles of coastline and 250 days of bright skies. If you’re drawn to the allure of
Miami hotels
, recline in comfort on the famous sands of South Beach, then trade in your sandals and dress up for a festive soiree. Further north, America’s most well-known theme parks are at your doorstep with
hotels in Orlando
; along with world-class entertainment and dining outside the parks as well.
For another city where the days are sunny and the nights are merry, explore Travelocity’s
hotels in Atlanta
. Spend an afternoon enveloped in the smells of hydrangeas and camellia as you wander the paths of the Atlanta Botanical Gardens in search of peaceful meditation spot. By night, stroll through the Fox Theatre Historic District and immerse yourself in the sights and sounds of outstanding ballet, symphony, and theatre productions.
If you envision a vacation that boasts quintessential Southern charm and plenty of delectable morsels, a trip to Texas just may be in your future. Yearning to tempt your taste buds with juicy brisket that melts in your mouth, slaw, and whiskey cake? You’re in search of
Dallas hotels
, wise wanderer. However, no Texas tour is complete without a visit to the home of NASA, “Space City,” or the impressive Museum of Fine Arts, one of America’s largest. Travelocity’s

Best International Hotel Accommodation
You’re a worldly sort, not the type to let those travel guidebooks gather dust, and your globe provides inspiration as much as decoration. But where to go next? From the cosmopolitan cities of Canada to the timeless destinations of Europe, there is no shortage of new places to explore. Delve into Travelocity’s incredible selection of international hotel accommodation and prepare for your next adventure.
One of the world’s finest international destinations is close to home: Your northern neighbor. Canada has much more on its plate than poutine, the famous French fry and cheese curd combination. Reserve
Montreal hotels
to experience its historic Old Port, glimpse the towering Notre-Dame Basilica, and stroll through one of the world’s largest botanical gardens. To the southwest,
Toronto hotels
stand ready to introduce you to this quirky, charming city. Home to the expansive, Frank Gehry-designed Art Gallery of Ontario and vibrant neighborhoods like Kensington Market and the Distillery District, Toronto is perfect for those savvy travelers who like something a little different.
If your travel desires lie farther afield, you may need a trip to Europe.
London hotels
are the ideal destination for wise wanderers who seek extraordinary architecture, a thriving theatre scene— and of course, classic, wood-paneled pubs where you can sip a pint. Or, look into our
hotels in Rome
and travel even further back in time, to antiquity itself. Gaze up at the massive Colosseum and you’ll soon understand why its name so closely resembles “colossal.” Peruse artworks by the great masters at the Galleria Borghese and then bask in the sunshine in the adjoining park as you daydream. Continue your art tour of Europe with
Paris hotels
and traverse through the Louvre in pursuit of da Vinci and Michelangelo. Wherever your travels take you, go confidently: Travelocity is always here to help you find a comfortable place to rest your head.
