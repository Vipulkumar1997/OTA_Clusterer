Punta Cana Hotel & Travel Guide
If you are planning a trip to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, the hotels in Punta Cana are ready and waiting to make it a memorable one. With pristine, white beaches and emerald Caribbean waters, this is one tropical getaway that will call your name long after you fly home!












h4>Outdoor Recreation
Vacations in Punta Cana
are all about sunshine, seaside lounging, and delicious ocean foods. The main hub of activity for tourists on this tropical island is in the triangle between the Carratera Higuey-Miches and Highway 3, making it a good spot to look for Punta Cana hotels that aren't directly on the beach. The close proximity to two major highways also means it's a great spot if you plan on visiting the rest of the island or relocating to
hotels in Santo Domingo
during your vacation.
If you're a golf lover, be sure to check out the Punta Cana Resorts stretched out near Highway 105. Along with immediate access to gorgeous beaches, resorts in this area let you stay right next to the renowned Cocotal Golf and Country Club, and the Cana Bay Golf Course. Experience what some of the world's biggest golf names have come to love about Punta Cana, and tee off with the glittering waters of the sea in the background!
Hotels in Punta Cana
When you'd rather spend some time off the beaten path and away from the constant hustle and bustle of downtown Punta Cana, look for resorts in the Uvero Alto region. Hotels here are a bit more isolated and perfect if you are looking for endless afternoons with nothing but the quiet lapping of waves to keep you company.
Once you have made the decision to visit the Dominican Republic, don't delay! Book your Punta Cana hotel with Travelocity today!

Interesting stay at the Melia
Room smelled musty. Bought air freshners but they didn't do much to help. Out of three rooms that were in our party ours was just terrible. Hotel itself was clean and comfortable. Did a time share presentation, it was terrible. Lied to us to get us to go. Not what was promised.

Enjoyed my  and  survived Irma. Had a hard time getting a room after airline cancelled flights. Internet shows hotel sold out, but hotel says they have room. Hotel says talk to Travelocity's and Travelocity's says I need to talk to hotel. We walked to front desk with Travelocity's on the and could get no help from either party. It became frustrating and I had to move to another hotel

Fun, relaxing beach vacation
This was my first time at an all inclusive resort and we upgraded to the Premier Club experience. The staff of the hotel is wonderful and very accomodating and willing to make your stay enjoyable. Willy was always pleasant and helpful in getting us set up on the beach, and was a lot of fun to chat with. Rosa in the Oceana restaurant also went above and beyond for us. The weather was beautiful, the food was enjoyable, and the activities we did partake in added variety.
