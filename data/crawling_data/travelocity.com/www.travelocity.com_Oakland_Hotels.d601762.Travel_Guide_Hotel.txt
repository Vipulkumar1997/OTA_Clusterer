Oakland Hotel & Travel Guide
Set on the San Francisco Bay, Oakland is the eighth largest city in California and has plenty to offer visitors. The city has a thriving arts scene and was named as one of the country's top art communities in 2013. There are many places to stay in the city, and Oakland hotels come in many shapes and sizes. The city is perfect for a break on the coast with your family, but it is just as accommodating for business travelers, with plenty of hotel meeting rooms and conference centers available. There is also some great shopping to discover, with plenty of independent stores offering one-offs and special designer pieces.

Four Points by Sheraton San Francisco Bay Bridge
3.0
Basic Hotel but good if traveling on Business
Stayed there June of 2013 for vacation, not as nice as I expected but clean and the customer service was excellent. All the staff was nice, it is centrally located to San Francisco, Concord, Oakland, and Richmond/Napa. Unfortunately one of the elevators was broke for the entire 6 days I stayed there. The swimming pool has yellow tape around it for 5 out of the 6 days we stayed there so I was unable to swim. The Jacuzzi worked but both the pool and Jacuzzi had huge handicap machines next to them so cosmetically the pool area did not look that attractive the way it looks on their website.

Red Lion Hotel Oakland International Airport
4.0
Close to Oakland Airport with reasonable rates
The hotel is very close to the airport with easy access. The rooms were nice appointed, well maintained and relatively clean.I did note something sticky on the dresser from a previous guest that hadn't been cleaned off(which I did) and when I returned for my second night, I noticed the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. Trash can liners TOO small; after throwing one item in them, the fell off the edges and it was impossible to insure trash went in the liner. The breakfast buffet (that came with my room package) was very good-freshly made food and included ethnic Chinese food one morning because a tour group had stayed at the hotel-I found this very accommodating. I was surprised that yogurt wasn't available, however, since it is so popular and common at other hotel breakfasts and buffets. There was no hotel directory in the room so hard to find TV channels, location of restaurant and fitness center, etc. When I asked at the desk, they said there were none-that was a first for me, even at lower cost hotels!

Nice and clean!
It is a decent hotel for what you pay.  The fridge was a little too loud, but everything is clean and no foul odors.
