Madrid Car Rentals & Travel Guide
Madrid has a strong artistic and cultural heritage, and it is perhaps best shown in the Museo del Prado, one of the world's best collections of classical art. When you book
flights to Madrid
, you can also look forward to exploring Spain's imperial past at the Naval Museum. If you'd like to break free from the city's Museum Triangle, book a car rental in Madrid and spend a few days exploring the gorgeous surrounding region.
Driving in and around Madrid
You can pick up rental cars in Madrid from Adolfo Suarez Madrid Barajas Airport, located approximately 8 miles from the downtown city center. A luxury vehicle with a GPS navigation system can help you find your way around Madrid's road network; if you're traveling on a budget, though, you may prefer to rent a cheap car or van and plan your chosen routes in advance. To get yourself started in Madrid, take a short drive to the Palacio de El Pardo, where kings of Spain lived in luxury during past centuries. This opulent palace is surrounded by mountains and close to the village of El Pardo, which is a great place to enjoy a traditional Spanish meal. For a great gastronomic experience in the heart of Madrid, head to the La Latina neighborhood, and spend an evening hopping between the various bars, sampling tapas (small plates of food) in each one.
Exploring Madrid
Search for cheap car rentals in Madrid using Travelocity's search engine, and use the Travelocity app to access mobile exclusive deals on
Madrid hotels
and flights. Book your flight and hotel together to save up to $537 on your trip to the capital of Spain. When you save money with Travelocity, you have more money to spend on the spectacular sights of Madrid, such as the stunning flamenco performances at Corral de la Moreria.
Here at Travelocity, we’re committed to helping you score cheap deals on Madrid car rentals. We’ll have your rental car waiting for you as soon as you arrive in town. Traveling with your whole family in tow? Choose a spacious and affordable van to keep your crew sane throughout the trip. Exploring the city with your sweetheart? Reserve a swanky two-seater as you paint the town red. With our low rates on rental cars in Madrid, you can go out and smell the roses, without stressing out your bank account. You can even use our mobile booking app to snag exclusive deals, so you can spend more on your adventures and less on your vehicle.
