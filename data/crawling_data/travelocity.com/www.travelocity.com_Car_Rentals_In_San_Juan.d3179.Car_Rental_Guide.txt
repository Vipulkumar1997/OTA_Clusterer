San Juan Car Rentals & Travel Guide
Would you like to stroll along quaint streets and swim under waterfalls on your next vacation? Consider San Juan, Puerto Rico. Car rentals in San Juan allow visitors to more effectively explore the city and the island, leaving more time to sample classic island cooking like mofongos with creole sauce, whole fried red snapper (chillo entero), and cod fritters (bacalaitos). Quench your thirst with a pina colada or two, and learn more about the island's famous rum by taking a ferry to the Bacardi distillery for a guided tour.
Rain Forests and Old San Juan
Luis Munoz Marin International Airport is only about six miles from the city center, so be sure to get one of the car rentals in San Juan and head straight to historic Old San Juan. A free trolley there will help you make your way around the historic walled city that dates back to the 1500s. Touring Plaza de Colon is an unforgettable experience, and Castillo San Felipe del Morro is an imposing fortress. You can also rent a car in San Juan and set off on an adventure that takes you across the whole island. Be sure to check out El Yunque National Forest, which is the only tropical rain forest in the United States; swimming under the various waterfalls is a popular pastime.
A Tropical Paradise on American Soil
Puerto Rico is about 100 miles long and 35 miles wide, so there is more to explore than you might imagine. At Travelocity, it's easy to find the most affordable
flights to San Juan
, along with both modern and historic
San Juan hotels
. Bundle airfare and accommodations together in a vacation package, and you can save up to $537! Travelocity is also a great source for cheap car rentals in San Juan.
Here at Travelocity, we’re committed to helping you score cheap deals on San Juan car rentals. We’ll have your rental car waiting for you as soon as you arrive in town.

You can even use our mobile booking app to snag exclusive deals, so you can spend more on your adventures and less on your vehicle.
