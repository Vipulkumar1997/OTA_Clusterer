Our Guide To Cheap Hotels In Myrtle Beach
When we envision ourselves strolling along faraway beaches and distant shorelines, we imagine leaving footprints across stretches of pristine sand softened by vibrantly hued waves. Sometimes the sky is a brilliant robin's-egg blue, while other times the sunsetâ€™s reds, oranges, and pinks paint the horizon. These tempting scenes are easy to conjure in your mindâ€™s eye, but they will undoubtedly pale in comparison to the actual experience of embarking on a seaside escape.












Austrian journalist Henry Grunwald once noted, "A beach is not only a sweep of sand, but shells of sea creatures, the sea glass, the seaweed, the incongruous objects washed up by the ocean." And once you soak in the scenery of such a place, you'll realize it's not the stunning panoramas that stand out, but the tiniest elements tucked away that make them so memorable. Whether it be one of the many
pet friendly hotels in Myrtle Beach
or a beachfront hotel, settle in at one of the best places to stay in Myrtle Beach, and take a moment to appreciate the intricacies of your surroundings, from seashells enveloped under a stratum of sand to the sight of historic buildings, visible from atop the largest Ferris wheel in the United States, the SkyWheel.
Wondering where to stay in Myrtle Beach?
Similar to its visitors, Myrtle Beach hotels come in a variety of styles. Based on what youâ€™re in the mood for, one accommodation will likely meet your needs more than any alternatives. To help you select the Myrtle Beach lodging option best for you, hereâ€™s a glimpse of four of our favorites.
Sea Crest Oceanfront Resort
for the family: With a 20-year history and a central location thatâ€™s just steps away from the Family Kingdom Amusement Park, the Sea Crest Oceanfront Resort continues to be the destination of choice for countless families because of these perks:
Sips and snacks: Situated on the 5th floor of the Sea Crest building, the Beach Java Cafe serves drinks, snacks, and Starbucks for beachside imbibing.
Aquatic activities: Slip into your swimsuit and enjoy any of the resortâ€™s aquatic attractions, including a pair of hot tubs, indoor and outdoor pools, a lazy river, and more.
Dining and drinks: Grab a drink or bite to eat at the tiki-themed waterfront Malibu Beach Bar, which offers karaoke and live entertainment throughout the year.
Dunes Village Resort
for an all-in-one experience: Why bother leaving the resort when thereâ€™s so much fun to be had inside? Among the largest indoor water parks ever builtâ€”and the only one in Myrtle Beachâ€”this hotel and resort invites you to enjoy more than 30,000 sq. ft. of fun, featuring a 250-ft long river ride, the cityâ€™s first adult-sized water slides, and a slew of other thrilling attractions:
Relax and unwind: Looking to relieve some stress? The resort has a range of massage services to put you at ease.
Chill out in a cabana: With a poolside spot to call your own, you can read a book, pop in a DVD, or just cool off in a chaise longue.
Sate your appetite: A variety of on-site eateries, including the Admiralâ€™s Room, Captainâ€™s Cafe, Perkâ€™s Up Coffee Shop, and the Cabana Tiki Bar, let you enjoy breakfast, lunch, and dinner without leaving the resort.
Westgate Myrtle Beach Oceanfront Resort
for location: Offering an unbeatable location on the sands of the Grand Strand, the Westgate Oceanfront Resort lets you experience the many facets of Myrtle Beach:
Laze the day away: Go for a swim in the hotelâ€™s heated outdoor pool, or drift along the heated lazy river. Thereâ€™s also a childrenâ€™s play area, a hot tub, and Coconut Willy's Pool Bar to keep you happy.
Work on your swing: With access to more than 100 of golf courses, the Westgate Oceanfront Resort makes it easy to improve your game.
Fun for all ages: The Family Kingdom Amusement Park is right across the street; if youâ€™ve got kids, this is one spot you wonâ€™t want to miss.
Close to the culture: The Broadway at the Beach entertainment center complex is close by as well as the legendary Palace Theatre.
Sea Mist
for quintessential Myrtle Beach: A landmark on Myrtle Beach for the past six decades, this family-friendly resort offers endless hours of entertainment:
Slip and slide: Try out the three-story water slide, take a nap as you drift along the lazy river, or take a dip in any of the 11 on-site swimming pools.
Fill your belly: Grab a bite at any of the resortâ€™s eateries, including Tena's Restaurant, the Three Steps Down Grille, Pete & Polly's snack shack, Jason's Cafe & Ice Cream Parlor, and the Barefoot Cabana.
Awesome events: The perfect setting for your big event, the Sea Mist features full-service catering and more than 17,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor conference space.
Endless entertainment: Perfect your putt at the 18-hole miniature golf course, or give your wrist a workout at the on-site arcade, featuring more than 100 games.

Blu Atlantic Oceanfront Hotel & Suites
3.0
Decent  hotel, No disernable Wi-Fi
The room was clean, except for the refrigerator.  The Wi-Fi was impossible to get on, very weak signal. Staff was friendly and helpful. The view from the ocean-front room was beautiful,  The towels were rough and scratchy, and the bathroom had no towel racks or hooks and no hand towels. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. All in all, I might stay here again because of the staff and good location, but I will bring my own towels and toilet paper, and maybe some of those stick and remove hooks for the bathroom.

Amazing view!
Checked in for a stay last night in an oceanfront suite we had reserved and received a free complimentary upgrade to the best suite we've ever had! The rooms were clean and comfortable with spectacular views! Matthew P was so helpful when checking in and answering all my questions and offered suggestions as well. The view was amazing and the resort is beautiful especially loved the private boardwalk right o to the beach - can't wait to go back again !

Bluegreen Vacations Carolina Grande
5.0
Good place to stay, watch the floor you're on
Good place to stay, well maintained, great rooms, a great location.  The rooftop pool is nice and offers a great view of the boulevard.  Be careful though what floor you are on, we stayed there last fall and were on the floor (6th?) right outside the pool and hot tub.  Not good if you like privacy or a quiet morning!  The hot tub was about 10ft from our sliding glass doors, close enough where we could have carried on a conversation with the people in it.  The staff couldn't move us that night and had to be reminded the next AM.  They were apologetic and helpful though, and moved us to the 10th floor which solved the problem.  Beware also of the timeshare sellers!  If you take them up on the presentation offer to get free stuff practice saying "no" ahead of time.  They are persistent and can be rude.  We will be staying there again.
