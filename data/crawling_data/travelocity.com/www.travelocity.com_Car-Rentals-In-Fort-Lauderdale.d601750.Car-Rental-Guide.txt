Fort Lauderdale, Florida lies within one of America's most happening metropolitan regions. Lively, laid-back, and full of entertainment, Fort Lauderdale is more than just relaxation and cocktails.

Indeed, Fort Lauderdale has a wide array of offerings. Start looking for hotels and car rentals in Fort Lauderdale today, and get ready to enjoy all that's offered down here.
Traveling Around Fort Lauderdale
Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport is a mere 3 miles southwest of town. Taxis and buses are available, and the Rental Car Center is located conveniently right next to Terminal 1. Many choose to rent a car in Fort Lauderdale because the area is sprawling and there's much to see, such as alligators in Everglades National Park. Miami, with attractions like the happening South Beach nightlife scene and the majestic Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, is just minutes away via car. West Palm Beach is another short drive; there, you can see renowned sights like McCarthy's Wildlife Sanctuary and the Norton Museum of Art.
