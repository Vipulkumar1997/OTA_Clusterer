Palm Beach - West Palm Beach Car Rentals & Travel Guide
If you listen carefully, South Florida has a language—or some may call it a soundtrack—all its own. Palm trees swaying gently in the breeze say “Swish, swish.” The sea birds flying overhead in search of lunch say “Ca-caw!” And the most wonderful sound of all is the lapping of the waves against the shore as you recline in the sunshine and breathe a sigh of total relaxation. You’re in West Palm Beach, and you are having the time of your life sunning, shopping, and dining on delectable dishes. But in order to hold all of your fabulous finds as you wander from store to store, you may want a set of wheels. It’s time to find a car rental in West Palm Beach and really live the good life.
Whirl Around West Palm Beach
West Palm Beach rental cars are your ticket to Florida’s gorgeous eastern coast. Palm Beach International Airport (PBI) is just four miles from downtown West Palm Beach; if you’re staying across the channel in the town of Palm Beach, it’s just another mile. Plus, you can engage in Florida’s favorite form of revelry as soon as you land—there is a putting green right in the airport for you to practice your golf game. Once you’ve perfected your putt, find the best rental car deals in West Palm Beach at the counter in the airport, located on level 1 near baggage claim. Choose your dream wheels and head on out.
Interstate 95 goes right through town, linking you with Fort Lauderdale and Miami to the south and beautiful beach towns to the north. Or meander your way through those beach towns on Florida’s scenic Route 1, also within easy reach. One thing is sure: Travelers who rent a car in West Palm Beach will have no problem getting around.
Where to Stay in West Palm Beach
At the end of an exhilarating day of exploring—or a relaxing day on the sand—West Palm Beach car rentals will be waiting to take you to your home away from home. Where will that be? Stay on the southern edge of town and luxuriate in five-star opulence at
Eau Palm Beach Resort & Spa
, where you can relax with a facial or massage.
Colony Hotel Palm Beach
is just a block from the world-class shopping and dining on Ocean Avenue; it’s no wonder presidents and royalty have been staying here since 1947. The nearby
Chesterfield Palm Beach
may also attract you, with its elegant white stone façade and address on the quaintly named Cocoanut Row. Connoisseurs of culture will love
Hotel Biba
, located in the El Cid Historic District.
Wherever you stay, you’ll be able to splurge on shopping and treat your taste buds to astounding flavors when you book your automobile here on Travelocity. We’ve got a great selection of cheap rental cars in West Palm Beach, so all you have to do is find your perfect match.

Here at Travelocity, we’re committed to helping you score cheap deals on Palm Beach - West Palm Beach car rentals. We’ll have your rental car waiting for you as soon as you arrive in town. Traveling with your whole family in tow? Choose a spacious and affordable van to keep your crew sane throughout the trip. Exploring the city with your sweetheart?
