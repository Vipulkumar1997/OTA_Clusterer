Cancun Vacations

A rich Mayan history and impressive sandy white beaches make up Cancun, Mexico. Packed with a colorful history and brimming with authentic cuisine, Cancun is a great place to explore a new culture or simply slip away for rest and relaxation. Home to one of the largest barrier reefs in the world, you will feel the pull to get up from your hammock and dive into the brilliant blue water to explore what lies below.

Major Attractions
When you book Cancun vacations, the main attraction is typically the sandy white beaches and blue water. Most
hotels in Cancun
offer water sports and impressive beach lounging that makes it easy to have a great vacation without venturing much farther than your hotel. To take in more local sights, look into hotel shuttle services or
rent a car in Cancun
so that you can explore the Mayan ruins, Museo Maya de Cancun, and local markets. The Interactive Aquarium, in the midst of the hotel zone, is easily accessible and allows you to get up close with dolphins, stingrays, sea cucumbers, star fish, and more. Nearby Playa del Carmen is about an hour away if you want to take in more local shopping, dining, and music.
Festivals and Events
Booking Cancun vacation packages is an easy way to plan out your hotel stay and flights all at once. When you are deciding what time of year is best, consider some of the local festivals you may want to attend. Independence Day on September 16 brings fireworks and impressive celebrations. The Mayan Village Show in January provides plenty of historical entertainment and the Riviera Maya Wine and Food Festival in March celebrates fine food and drinks with events that span well into the evening.
Book Cancun packages on Travelocity now, so you can save up to $537 when you book a hotel and flight at the same time.
Accommodation in Cancun
Cancun is a great city, with upwards of 234 accommodations to choose from. Reserve a room as soon as you like via Travelocity's
Cancun hotel deals page
.
The Le Blanc Spa Resort All Inclusive Adults Only, at Boulevard Kukulcan Km 10, or the Hard Rock Hotel Cancun All Inclusive, at Blvd Kukulcan KM 14.5, Hotel Zone, are brimming with elegance and splendor. If you're hoping for your money to go further, check out the Hyatt Zilara Cancun - Adults Only - All Inclusive, at Blvd Kukulcan Km 11.5 HZ, or the Excellence Playa Mujeres - Adults Only - All Inclusive, located at Prolongacion Bonampak.

Good Value
Overall, the resort is a good value. The room was spacious enough for 2 but there are no comfortable chairs. There was not any hot water for 2 mornings so get up early or shower in the afternoon. The food was good but does get a little tiresome after a few days. I would recommend the resort and would ...

Great Hotel, Please double check the promotions
The hotel was great, the food was good and the staff was friendly. My only problem was when I was searching for a hotel to stay in, I searched for an all inclusive hotel. This hotel was listed within the category of all inclusive and the rate was basically a steal. I had seen this same hotel off ...
