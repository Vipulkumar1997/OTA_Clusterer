place for your holiday

Sweden is a well of desire. Wide, open, nordic cold and summery fresh. Sweden unites contrasts, it is modern and mystic at the same time. The country is pioneer in environmental protection, an obvious step, regarding all the unique nature heritage, from Lapland in the north to numerous islands like Öland in the south. Dark, deep forests and wide, grey blue lakes, gleaming in the morning light, from afar surrounded by tiny, typical falun-red painted wooden houses.

Sweden

Welcome to our selection of boutique and stylish hotels in Sweden. Secretplaces selects only those truly special accommodations
with soul. Whatever your reasons to travel to Sweden be it to party on midsummer night, the thrill of staying at a
boutique hotel in Stockholm
or a charming countryside hotel, Secretplaces will help you find the perfect spot.




Sweden . where to go

In the north of the country, during the white nights, it never gets
dark. At this time, the Swedes will celebrate Midsommar, wearing
traditional costumes, dancing around the maypole to traditional folk
music, characterized by vivid, bright sounds from the fiddle, bagpipes
and typical chants. Capital of Sweden is Stockhom, a town engaged in the
dialogue between traditions and modernism. It spreads over 14 islands
and is dominated by traditional architecture and a living, progressive
atmosphere. Still, Sweden is associated with the gloomy, secret-shrouded
viking civilization and Nordic mythology with it's various tales and
stories of ancient, magic times, where God's where real and nature was
wild. Maybe it is because of this heritage, maybe because of the vivid,
colourful new ideas and styles that Sweden is today a country of unique
spirit and character.
