London boutique hotels and bed & breakfasts

Welcome to London! The list of sights to see in London seems to be endless and in most times one single weekend trip is not enough to discover it all. To grant you a relaxed and unforgettable stay in the capital, We showcase an exquisite selection of great places to stay for your city break from superb bed & breakfasts in Belgravia to luxury Knightsbridge hotels and trendy Soho accommodations. Whatever your taste and budget, we’ll help you find that perfect getaway in one of the world's greatest cities - majestic London.




London - culture and entertainment

London has undergone quite a revolution in the food stakes
over the last few years. Once known for its uninspired cuisine, London
is now in many respects one of the food capitals of the world serving
up, as it were, an incredible variety dishes and raw materials. If you
don’t believe us, just visit Borough Market on the weekend near London
Bridge and see for yourself the amazing variety of cheeses, meats,
fruits on offer. In fact, Borough Market has become one of the city’s
landmark tourist destinations in its own right. Well worth a visit.
And
if you are into music then you are well catered for with over 400
venues, whether it's classical, pop, or rock or alternative. We have
already mentioned that Borough Market is one of London’s delights. Yet
it is only one of many markets – too many to mention here, at least.
Portobello, Camden Market, Brick Lane or Notting Hill are just some of
the other most famous ones, but dig deeper and you find countless
others, some of them more authentic and intimate than the big boys. This
is just scratching the surface.
Yet despite its massive size and
energy, the fact is that in many ways, London remains a collection of
villages. Chelsea, Kensington, Hampstead, and countless other
communities retain their own unique feel and architecture. Seek and you
shall find… anything! Indeed, you should never get tired of London.




Gastronomy in London

English food doesn't have a really good reputation but notwithstanding, you should try the famous English breakfast with eggs, warm tomatoes, beans and sausages.
If you feel like visiting a real street food market in London, you can go to Maltby St. Market. There you'll also get the chance to taste the famous fish and chips.
In the evening, you can do a pub crawl through the centre of London, where you can find out yourself if the English beer is as good as said.
Are you hungry after a party night? Let's go to the Brick Lane Beigel Bakery, where you can eat bagels all day and night.
Last but not least: The unique tea time is more than just a normal cup of tea. It goes hand in hand with a wide selection of delicious pastries and cakes.
