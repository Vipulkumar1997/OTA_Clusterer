Poland - where to go

In the beautiful landscape of the Nowogródek Pomorski the hilly fields stretch in gentle waves as far as the eye can see. Large, dense forests with giant trees, wide rivers and mountains make the countryside unique and special.
The Slowinski National Park is known for its 40 meters high dunes, separating the Lebsko and Gardno Lakes from the Baltic Sea. Climbing atop the dunes you will be rewarded with spectacular panoramic views of the blue sea and the golden sand.
In the capital Warsaw the influences of historic events, from having been dragged between many empires and regimes over many centuries, to the influence of WWII and the period of Soviet leadership, are ever present. Today Warsaw has become a city with different styles and aspects, most noted when comparing the east and the west of the city. Besides world class restaurants, some of Europe's best bars and cute little cafés, you can also enjoy scenic parks, galleries and many other things to discover.
