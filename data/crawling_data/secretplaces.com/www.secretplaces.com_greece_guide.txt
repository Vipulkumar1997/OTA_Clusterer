Greece - the country and its islands

place for your holiday

Where to start with Greece? If there’s a country that can truly say it offers something for everyone, then it’s Hellas. History? It practically invented the term and let us not get started on the cultural, sporting, scientific legacies, its landscapes, islands, and blue seas.
These are some of the tangibles. The intangibles are just as impressive and by that we mean the people of Greece have an infectious joie de vivre. They combine the passion of the Spanish, say, and a historical legacy that perhaps only the Italians can match.
The Greeks are direct (if they like you, you’ll know it), proud of their country’s legacy and who will do their utmost to welcome travellers. Basically, the many facets of Greece on offer provide a treasure trove of possibilities. Whether its island hopping you’re into, the legacy of ancient Greece, its bustling cities or mountains, there’s something here for you.

Greece - island hotels, bed & breakfasts and boutique hotels

Welcome to our unique selection of small, beautiful and boutique hotels in Greece. Secretplaces highlights only truly special accommodations, so whatever your reasons to travel, be it a romantic getaway, an island holiday or just the thrill of staying at a small Greek Taberna in Crete, Secretplaces will help you find the perfect spot in Greece.



Greece - where to go

It is the islands that first come to mind. The fabulous
Cyclades
,
Santorini
,
Mykonos
et al,
Crete
and the lesser known, more peaceful Lesvos and Kea. The
Peloponnese
is famous for its Mountain landscapes and coastline.
Athens
is famous for, well… being Athens, with the Acropolis lording it over this most bustling of cities. If it’s ancient Greece you want then don’t forget Olympia and Delphi as well, but we haven’t even began to scratch the surface.
