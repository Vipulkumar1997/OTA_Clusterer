Algarve - beaches, ocean and seafood

place for your holiday

Ask our advice





The Algarve, Portugal’s southernmost province, has a mild climate, warmer water and a calmer sea than the rest of Portugal, making it the perfect holiday destination. You will find sandy beaches surrounded by towering sandstone cliffs, hundreds of little sandy islands strewn across the many estuaries, saltwater lagoons and hidden bays only accessible by boat.
This splendid variety is matched by the diversity of hotels and accommodations that cater for every taste. Although a great part of the Algarve has been overrun by mass tourism developments, there are still many places that have managed to maintain their original authenticity such as the eastern Algarve and the west coast which remains largely untouched, though it is quite windy. Also the interior retains much of its original charm and it is worthwhile for the visitor to explore this untouched region.

Algarve seaside boutique hotels, resorts and holiday homes

Although being a famous tourist destination, the Algarve still offers a wide choice of more authentic places to stay that are off the beaten track. You have the choice between
boutique hotels in Sagres
near the beach, rustic country side inns on the western Algarve coast and
pousadas in Tavira
. Do you more feel like a
boutique hotel in Lagos
?Whatever your taste, we’ll help you find that perfect getaway in Algarve.




Algarve - where to go

Some areas of the Algarve have in fact changed after decades of tourist development and urban sprawl. But there are marvels that have retained their original charm such as the town of Tavira in the eastern Algarve, which has a number of charming boutique hotels, small bed & breakfasts and holiday homes. In western Algarve the best hotels and guesthouses can be found around Sagres and Silves with almost untouched beaches not too far away. A bit inland the Serra de Monchique boasts beautiful views and small little villages surrounded by lush oak forests.




Algarve - gastronomy

Fish and seafood take pride of place in the gastronomy of the Algarve. Start with the delicious fish soup, and then move on to the "arroz de marisco" (shellfish and rice stew) or the cataplana (cockles cooked in a sealed wok with smoked pork sausage, cured ham, tomatoes, and onions). Fried pork loin and bread soaked buck are delicious meat specialties. For dessert try the egg sweets and fruits mixed with almonds.
As for beverages, Lagoa produces the best wines in the region. Try the white aperitif wine, and the flavoured Medronho from the Monchique hills. Most wines carry a high content of alcohol and sugar.
