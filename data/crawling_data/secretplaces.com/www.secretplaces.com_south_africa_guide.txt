South Africa - the rainbow nation

Lets us help you find the perfect
place for your holiday

Ask our advice





South Africa is not called the rainbow nation for nothing. What you get in South Africa is the “World in one country” and that’s not overstating it by any means. It is a simply gorgeous and varied land that takes in colour, vibrancy, awesome nature and some pretty fantastic cities to boot. Anyone who has been to Cape Town, for example, will know what we mean by that. It’s as if this mythical southern tip of Africa was showered with wonder dust when being formed.

South Africa boutique hotels and bed & breakfasts

Welcome to our new selection of charming hotels in South Africa and boutique South Africa hotels. Secretplaces highlights only those truly special accommodations with soul. Whatever your reasons to travel are, be it a trip to stunning
Cape Town
and the Table Mountain, the thrill of staying in an eco-lodge in Kruger Park, Secretplaces will help you find the perfect spot.




South Africa - what to do

For adrenalin lovers, it is the adventure capital of the world. You
can, of course, sit with a glass of good wine in hand by the beach and
just do nothing. But what about shark-cage-diving? Swimming with
penguins? Trekking in stunning mountains fashioned from the sea and
wind? Visiting a Safari Parks? It’s all there in South Africa.
In
order to recover from the action-packed activities a little, take a trip
to one of South Africa’s charming cities. Johannesburg, Pretoria and
Cape Town are particularly noteworthy here. The latter is the oldest
city in the country and is also called the "Mother City". Cape Town is
the perfect starting point to climb the Table Mountain or to visit the
nearby Cape of Good Hope.
Obviously, not all is peachy pink. The
country’s political and historical problems and challenges are well
documented, but that doesn't stop it from being a magical and welcoming
destination, which is worth a trip whole year long. Also, South Africa’s
inhabitants are some of the most welcoming and gregarious on Earth.
