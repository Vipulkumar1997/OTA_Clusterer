COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK NOTICES

"All content on our site, including specific hotel information, graphic design and all other relevant information and content, is the property of Secretplaces.com and protected by international copyright law. It may only be used on a personal basis for non-commercial purposes and its reproduction, distribution, copy or any other use for commercial purposes is expressly forbidden.


PERSONAL AND NONCOMMERCIAL USE LIMITATION

Use of this website is conditional on your acceptance that all information contained in it and all matters that may arise between you and us shall be governed by Portuguese law. Any disagreements that may arise between you and us shall be dealt with by the competent Courts of Portugal to the exclusion of the Courts of any other country.


CHANGES AT SHORT NOTICE

There may be occasions when it is necessary for hotels to withdraw certain services and facilities or change prices at short notice. We do not make any representations or warranties to such changes but if these have been notified to us prior to your departure, we shall endeavour to pass this information on to you as soon as feasibly possible.


BOOKING AND PURCHASE CONDITIONS

The applicable booking and purchase conditions are those that appear on the relevant "observations".


CANCELLATION

Should a reservation be cancelled or amended after it has already been confirmed, any associated cancellation and amendment charges shall be payable in accordance with the individual policy of the hotel. Any such cancellation must be advised to Secretplaces, sent to the general e-mail at
info@secretplaces.com
and shall only be considered valid and regularised after it has been confirmed in writing to the traveller by Secretplaces.


PRIVACY

Any information you provide us, such as your name, e-mail address, credit card number and expiry date and telephone number shall remain strictly confidential and not passed on to third parties.


LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

Although we try to insure the content of our site is factually accurate, information, products and services contained in our site may include inaccuracies or typographical errors. Changes are periodically added to the information contained herein and we and our respective suppliers may make changes and/or improvements to our site at any time.


ROOM PRICES AND AVAILABILITY

Secretplaces always look to ensure that the information provided by the hotels in reply to availability requests on prices, dates, extra beds and number of people is accurate. However, this information is ultimately provided by the hotels themselves and Secretplaces cannot be held responsible for any erroneous information provided therein.

Prices displayed on hotel rates pages, and special offers displayed throughout the site, are intended as a best possible guide, but do not constitute a firm offer or a guarantee of rates for any particular stay. Likewise any rates shown during the initial enquiry process (i.e. before a hotel / supplier has replied with a quote for a specific stay) are intended as a best possible guide, but do not constitute a firm offer or a guarantee of rates.

Secretplaces contains a number of links to external websites which our users may find of interest. However, we do not control these websites and cannot be held responsible for their content including, but not limited to, rates displayed, descriptions, hotel facilities and reservation system information, nor are we able to certify that they will not change without our permission. The user shall accept full responsibility on entering these websites.
