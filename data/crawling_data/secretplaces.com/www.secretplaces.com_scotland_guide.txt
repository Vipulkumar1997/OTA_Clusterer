Scotland is one of those exhilarating nations that seem to pack so much into such a compact place.
Part of the United Kingdom, it retains its own unique identity, history and culture, and though picture postcard clichés of Scotland abound – from the haggis to whisky and kilts, etc, etc, the truth is it is also a modern and forward thinking nation offering visitors so much to delight.
