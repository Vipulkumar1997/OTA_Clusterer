Wonderfully friendly boutique b&b in Sonnac.
Oh lazy days. Located in the small village of Sonnac, at the foothills of the French Pyrenees, the Le Tresor is simply delightful base from which to explore this part of the world, which thankfully still remains somewhat off the beaten track.
What makes it so special? From the outside, Le Tresor seems to be your typical French old village “maison de maitre” balustrade windows and all, but inside it has been done up a treat with contemporary art and fabrics whilst still maintaining the essence of southern France. The same goes for the four rooms, each individually styled yet maintaining French character in the wooden shutters, red floor tiles and polished wood. It makes for a fantastic boutique bed and breakfast. You could also not ask for more affable hosts in Tilly and William. Their mission is to make your stay as wonderful as possible. They themselves say it is important to have as much fun in the house as you will have out, so everything is laid back and made for relaxation, whether by the fireplace or a hammock in the pretty garden simply reading a book, or taking a sip of wine from the honesty bar.
Tilly is also a bit of a wizard in the kitchen. Breakfast, which consisting of fresh fruits, croissants, yoghurts, etc is a case in point - simply delicious. Tilly can even prepare meals on request on weekends.
As mentioned, Le Tresor might be a little bit off the beaten track, but use that to your advantage. This lovely wine region is unspoilt yet close enough to a number of the loveliest villages in Languedoc, including Mirepoix and Carcassone.
