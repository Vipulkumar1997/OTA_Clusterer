The Irish must surely be one the most gregarious, fun loving people in Europe. Almost everything or any time is an excuse for a “craic”, that quintessentially Irish word meaning “good conversation, entertainment and fun”. It sums up the Irish way of life down to a tee.
That’s just the intangibles. Ireland is also famed for its utterly stunning scenery that takes in lavishly green landscapes, lakes, sea, mountains and wild open spaces of jaw dropping beauty. We have no idea why Mother Nature blessed this small Atlantic island with so much scenery and character, but we’re thankful it did. From the Kerry Mountains to the Wicklow hills – it’s all there in glorious green.

Ireland hotels, country inns and bed & breakfasts

Welcome to our singular selection of romantic and stylish hotels in Ireland. Secretplaces selects only those truly special accommodations with soul. Whatever your reasons to travel to Ireland be it of drinking a Guinness in a typical Irish pub, the thrill of staying at a
boutique hotel in Dublin
or a charming manor house in the
Irish midlands
, Secretplaces will help you find the perfect spot.




Ireland - where to go

Of course, Ireland is also the unofficial capital of the world for
spontaneous pub jam sessions, and
Dublin
, that fairest of cities, is one
of the best places to witness this first hand. Take a walk down Temple
Bar or O’connell Street (amongst many others) and you’ll see what we
mean. Go with the flow, take a pint of the black stuff in hand and join
in the singing, laughing and conversation that is set to full into the
early hours.
If you want to see the country in all it's glory,
Secretplaces will soon be adding a number of charming Irish hotels from
which to take it all in. Keep posted!
