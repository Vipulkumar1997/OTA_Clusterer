There’s a single word that manages to convey the meaning of flair, flamboyance, pride and swagger all into one and it’s French: Panache! If ever there was a word that accurately describes the Gallic way of life then this is it and if ever there was a country that has taken the art of living to such sophisticated heights then it must be France.
The finest cuisine,
wines
and cheeses vie with a unique sense of style that makes it a simply irresistible proposition. Countless monuments, chateaux and abbeys and museums will keep even the most urbane traveller happy.

France Hotels, B&B's, holiday homes and maisons d'hôte

For all its sophistication France fiercely hangs on to its rural traditions and beliefs like no other modern country. This is very much reflected in the country’s range of accommodations.
Hotels in Paris
, the
French Riviera
and most
coastal
towns are as sophisticated and stylish as any in the world, of course, but it is the small, romantic bed & breakfast or maisons d’hôte in the
French countryside
that are especially charming. In addition to its beautiful cities, France has managed to preserve its magnificent landscapes, mountain scenery and a village life of yesteryear with no apparent contradiction. So whatever you are looking for – whether a bold design hotel, peaceful bed & breakfast in a medieval village or just downright chic, you will find it here.




Where to go in France

Although some of Frances regions are more famous than others, almost all of them are worth visiting. Be it for their natural beauty, the excellent local food, the romantic villages or chique cities. For those that have never visited France,
Paris
with its stylish city life and boutique hotels is a must. Next in line would be the
Provence and nearby French Riviera
, known as the Côte d'Azur, the
Loire valley
and its enchanting chateaux,
Brittany
with its rugged coast and lovely bed & breakfasts or chambres d'hôtes,
Aquitaine
in the south west. Food lovers will not want to miss the Périgord and
Alsace
.
