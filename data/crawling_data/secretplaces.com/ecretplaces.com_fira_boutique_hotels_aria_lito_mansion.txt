Being located in the old quarters of town is always an advantage for any special accommodation worth its salt. And so it is the case with the Aria Lito, which is bang in the middle of the historic part of Fira.
Unsurprisingly, its architecture matches the grandeur of the old town, and so does its history, one which has welcomed many distinguished guests over time.
Still, it's not just all about history. Here, you get great views too, especially of the eastern side of the island and somewhere off into the distance you can just about see the Aegean Sea.
What else does it offer? A sense of refined luxury and peace even though located in the heart of Fira, which is a lively city in itself.
Still, if you just want to lounge about, then the Aria-Lito offers an outdoor pool and sunbathing terrace, a lounge terrace, a private garden and a Wine Cellar with a selection of Santorinian, Greek and International wines.
All this an easy access to, either by boat or plane as it is only 8 km from Santorini airport and the port of Athinios.

Aria Lito Mansion














by John & Marsha



Date of stay 22/05/2015

My wife and I stayed 3 dreamy days and nights at the lovely, pristine, and ably-managed Aria Lito, up the hill from the Thiera bus station, adjacent to a Roman Catholic monastery with a prominent bell tower. Our rooms included a sleeping room facing Santorini's eastern shore (so not the classic view of the caldera below the bluffs), and steps outside our entrance door was a small pool we enjoyed each late afternoon of our stay. Also, part of our rooms was a comfortable bathroom, and a separate sitting room skylit through arched ceilings. The staff, from the moment of our arrival, to the very early breakfast delivered to our room on the morning of our departure, was gracious, competent, and friendly. We found the location, slightly out of the hubbub of either the Main Street or the throng streaming the alees on the caldera side, was ideal. We took advice from our hosts to take the mind-blowingly beautiful but rigorous 12 kilometer walk along the trail to Oia, and visited the archeological gem, the Akritiros settlement, a town uncovered with lava, along the lines of Pompeii. We'd recommend Aria Lito to friends in a nanosecond.

sehr schön

Date of stay 08/10/2014

Das Aria Lito liegt super geschickt, mitten in der Stadt und doch ist es ruhig und total schön. Nur ein paar Schritte zur Caldera und noch weniger Schritte in die Einkaufsstraße. Ruhe im extrem schönen Garten und auf den Liegeflächen an den Zimmern und am Pool. Eine Oase die keine Wünsche offen lässt. Das Personal extrem freundlich und geben sehr nützliche Informationen über die Insel. Sehr sehr schön. Danke
