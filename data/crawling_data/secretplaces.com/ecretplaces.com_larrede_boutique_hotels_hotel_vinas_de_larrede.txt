At the door of the Aragonese Pyrenees Mountains, 24 km (15 min) away from the largest ski resort in Spain, known as Formigal-Panticosa, you will find the charming Hotel of Vinas de Larrede. Located next to the Gállego River, this accommodation is surrounded by a beautiful natural environment and is also very close to the old town center. In fact, the medieval tower and the Church of San Pedro (a historical monument of the Romanesque architecture) are only a few minutes on feet away. In this way, you will be able to visit the beautiful streets of Larrede and discover its surroundings of interest, such as the traditional town of Biescas.
The hotel's beautiful facade - made of large windows and built on a foundation using predominantly noble materials, such as wood and stone - offers spectacular views over the Pyrenees and its valley. In this environment of utmost peace and tranquillity, you will be able to enjoy a relaxing stay while observing the breathtaking landscapes surrounding the house.
Thanks to the many particular services offered by the hotel, such as the garden and its orchard, the swimming pool as well as the spa and wellness centre, take some time for yourself and appreciate the moment. In the Hotel Vinas de Larrede, while reading a fine book or enjoying the beautiful sunsets on the terrace, you will have the impression that time has stopped.
