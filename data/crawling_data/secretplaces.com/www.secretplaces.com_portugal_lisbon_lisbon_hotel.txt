HOTELS & HOLIDAY HOMES

View Map





The Portuguese capital Lisbon is settled on seven hills next to the impressing river Tagus near the Atlantic Ocean. Known as a city of seamen, explorers and adventurers, the historical charm that Lisbon offers you is combined nowadays with modernity, making the city one of Europe’s cultural capitals.
As a local company we had the opportunity to select the best and most extraordinary hotels and holiday accommodations for you, directly on-site! You can start your holidays in Portugal from an exclusive manor house or from one of the luxury hotels that we have selected for you. Another option is to choose one of the charming boutique hotels or a bed and breakfast of our selection. If you are travelling with friends you can also enjoy your stay in your own holiday apartment in the Alfama or Bairro Alto. We'll help you find that perfect getaway in Portugal's picturesque capital.
