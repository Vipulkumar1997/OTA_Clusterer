place for your holiday

We can’t think of a more down to earth and unassuming, yet fascinating, country than Belgium. It’s been happily going its own way for over 175 years almost under the radar screen for many people. But Belgium is actually one of the most interesting places in Europe and it is is a shame that many people see it as a gateway rather than a place to discover, get to know and enjoy in its own right.
Belgium’s historical importance to Europe, despite its small size, reflects a strategically important position at the juncture of some of the great powers of Europe, namely France, Germany and the Netherlands. It has been fought over the centuries, from Roman times to Waterloo, where Napoleon met his match at hands of the Duke of Wellington, and right up to the 1st World War.
