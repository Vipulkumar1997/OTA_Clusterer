Portugal hotels, country inns and holiday homes

We at Secretplaces have spent many years travelling through Portugal in search of hotels, B&B’s and guesthouses that are truly authentic and have that something special.
As diverse as this beautiful country is the choice of holiday accommodations on offer. We have put together a handpicked selection of the nicest. You can choose from
boutique hotels in Lisbon
, our
seaside hotels in Cascais
and the
Lisbon coast
or take a short break at one of our
guesthouses or bed and breakfasts on the coast of the Alentejo
, known as the Costa Vicentina. If you prefer wamer water a holiday in one of the charming
Algarve hotels
near the ocean sounds ideal.



Where to go in Portugal

It is not easy to choose a destination in Portugal. The
Algarve
with its warm and turquoise water and sandy beaches surrounded by rocky cliffs comes to mind, then the trendy town of
Lisbon
with its boutique hotels and
Oporto
and its small guesthouses, which is so different to Lisbon. But it is the lesser known
Alentejo
with its fascinating and still untouched coast called Costa Vicentina with its country inns and seaside hotels that we especially recommend. Wine lovers will not want to miss the
Douro valley
with its traditional manor houses and wine estates from where you can also make a short break to see the Minho region and its coast in the North-East of Portugal.



What to do

Famous Routes
Whether your interest lies in
Wine
, Art, Architecture, Gastronomy, Literature,
Nature
or Religion there seems to be a route in Portugal that provides for every different taste and interest. Many have been well established for centuries and travelling on them will make their subject matter come vividly alive. Should you wish to know more about an individual route, please contact us. We will be happy to help you organise your itinerary and accommodation.
Wine Country
Succulent reds, cool whites, bubbly greens. Portugal produces an astonishing variety of quality
wines
given its size, many of them unknown to the outside world and grown in some of the country’s most beautiful regions. The fortified wines of Port and Madeira, however, are famous the world over and unique to Portugal.
Mountains
Portugal may not have the wealth of mountains that its neighbour possesses, but those it has are equally beautiful and wild.
Natural Parks
Portugal boasts a wonderful variety of natural parks and nature reserves preserving the natural beauty, wildlife, monuments and way of life of the regions.
From the rugged, mountainous parks of the north, to the peaceful stress free reserves of the south, Portugal has much to offer the visitor when it comes to nature.
