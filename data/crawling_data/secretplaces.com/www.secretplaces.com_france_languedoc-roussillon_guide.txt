With its 27,500 km2 and 2.3 million permanent inhabitants, Languedoc–Rousillon is situated in the extreme south of France and bordered by the Pyrenees, Andorra and Spain from below – and Provence and the Midi-Pyrenees as far north as the Auvergne. It has a long Mediterranean coastline of sandy beaches stretching 180 km from the Spanish border to the Camargue.
Languedoc encompasses the largest wine producing area of Europe and is noted for its relaxed pace of life.

Languedoc-Roussillon

Choose from our selection of boutique and charming Languedoc-Roussillon hotels and guesthouses for a variety of tastes and budgets, including romantic Nimes hotels, bed and breakfasts and luxury Languedoc-Roussillon hotels amongst others.



Languedoc-Roussillon where to go

Montpellier, the (arguably) regional capital, is a fine
university city with many 17th and 18th century houses, wide boulevards,
parks and gardens – the Jardin des Plantes was the first botanical
garden in France, built in 1593.
Sète is the largest Mediterranean
fishing port on the coast of France and has many excellent seafood
restaurants – in July and August there are water jousting festivals.
Narbonne,
founded by the Romans, is a busy centre for the wine trade with good
shopping. The Cathedral of St-Just rivals those of northern France and
has some beautiful tapestries; close to town, situated in a wild valley,
is the Benedictine abbey of Fontfroide with its 13th century church and
rose garden. Béziers prospered in the 17th century when the Canal du
Midi, which connects the Mediterranean with the Atlantic, was built; the
Museum of Fine Art has works by many Flemish and German masters,
including Holbein – the Roman Arena is used for bullfights in August.
Perpignan,
once the capital of the kingdom of Majorca, has managed to preserve its
Spanish heritage, which is reflected in the architecture and ambience
of the town.
A little further along the coast are Collioure and
Céret, which at the turn of the century were simple villages and the
unique light there attracted many painters: Matisse, Derain, Dufy,
Picasso, Chagall. Picasso was particularly fond of Céret and it claims
to be the birthplace of Cubism.
Collioure was a source of
inspiration and is represented in many Impressionist paintings. This
corner of the region, although called Roussillon, is, after centuries of
struggle for possession between France and Spain, essentially and
proudly Catalan – the language widely spoken and the red and yellow
Catalan flag is flying everywhere.




Languedoc-Roussillon activities

Good beaches and resorts along the coast, offering a variety of water
sports. Many golf courses throughout the region – some of competition
standard – accessible to all levels and inexpensive. Numerous health
spas that offer treatments for a variety of ailments – or simply the
opportunity to relax and get into shape. There are vast nature reserves
that are the habitat for a huge variety of flora and fauna and ideal for
hiking, trekking, cycling and riding. Good fishing in the rivers and
lakes – they are well sign-posted and there are easily available
topographical maps.
During the summer in the Pyrenees there is
mountain climbing, accompanied by experienced guides, mountain biking,
or walking. In the winter there are good cross-country ski routes and
excellent skiing. Serious walkers can follow the ancient pilgrim
pathways to Santiago de Compostela in Spain, that takes you across the
region. Markets and country bric-a-brac markets in towns and villages on
different days and from early spring until late autumn; there are
numerous festivals, fetes, classical, jazz and folk concerts. Children
are welcomed and included in all activities everywhere.
