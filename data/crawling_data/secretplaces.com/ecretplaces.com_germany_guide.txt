Think of Germany and you probably think of world beating efficiency. Yet it offers the world so much more than that.
Western Europe’s largest country is also a multifaceted powerhouse and inspiration in so many ways. For every tranquil river, mountain range and landscape there seems to be a picture perfect village and city of distinction (never too large in the mould of London or Paris).
Germany also has a great respect for its customs and folklore and there is always something to do. Explore fascinating museums, its fairytale castles or, of course, the world famous wine and beer festivals. Then there are the unique treasures of art and many architectural masterpieces.
But whatever your reason to visit Germany - art, gastronomy, festivals, landscapes, towns and cities, to name but a few – your stay will be underpinned by the genuine hospitality of the German people.

Berlin- the trendy and hip capital

Berlin
is also one of the great cities of the world. Famous not only for its recent history, it is also a city of green spaces, impressive architecture and a pulsating nightlife with a fertile counter-culture fuelled by a young population. Berlin Mitte (formerly in East Berlin), Kreuzberg and Prenzlauer Berg are some of the epicentres of this underground movement – they buzz with restaurants, bars and nightclubs.
