The background history to the Pousada do Rancho do Peixe is rather cute. A group of friends, all lovers of windsurf and the great outdoors, had for years been coming to Jericoacoara to take in its perfect winds and awesome beauty.
They loved it so much they decided to set up a permanent outpost and the result was this place.
Designed by a renowned architect, the Rancho do Peixe follows our friends philosophy down to a tee in that its lines are simple, rustic and complementary to nature.
You won’t find any thing like concrete, bricks or mortar here. What you get instead are the basic materials of wood for walls, straw for rooftops and “taipas” all sourced locally and with an eye to environmental friendliness.
But don’t be fooled into thinking facilities or amenities are basic. All the necessary items for a superbly comfortable stay are here, including an excellent restaurant specialising in Brazilian cuisine with a Mediterranean flavour, high speed Internet and a 25 m2 swimming pool for starters.
Oh yes, you also get plenty of sun, sea and sand, for the Rancho do Peixe is blessed to be situated in one of the finest regions in Brazil for water activities and lazy sun based holidays. Actually located on Preá beach there are many km of sand to enjoy. All 20 bungalows are ample, approximately 80m2 and spread out amongst the coconut groves and dunes all with views of the wonderful sea. If your idea of a perfect holiday is to enjoy tropical tranquility by the waters edge, perhaps with a dash of windsurfing or horseback riding on the never ending dunes, then the Pousada Rancho do Peixe is the place for you. Its certainly one of the places for us!
