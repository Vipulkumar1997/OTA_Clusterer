Denmark



Leave it to the Danes to invent hygge. It’s basically the national emoticon: a feeling of community, closeness, camaraderie and contentment all wrapped up in one ergonomically designed package.


Of course it’s easy to be content when your country consistently tops liveability rankings, produces addictive crime dramas and is full of green fields, forget-me-nots and windmills. Yep, Denmark just seems to work. Design is minimal, politics is open, pedestrians and cyclists rule the streets and locals walk around looking tall and unfairly attractive. Come for the old-world charm, stay for the new-world outlook.

A Taste of Scandinavia,
August 2017

Eva Korecki

Scandinavia was great but we were not prepared for the physical difficulty while travelling on local trasport and staying in hotels with (very often) hard access to the room. We were expecting a lower standard of traveling and accommodation but it was still a bit of a nasty surprise in comparison  to our Asian trips.

A Taste of Scandinavia,

The perfect trip if you want to explore a part of the world but don't know exactly where you would like to go.

Best time to visit Denmark

Best time to visit Denmark




With its northerly latitudes, early summer is the best time to see Denmark. June in particular is gorgeous, with warm weather, long summer days and fewer crowds than the peak summer season of July/August. Travelling in May or September can be lovely, although the weather may be a little more unpredictable. Midwinter, and February in particular, is the only time of year to avoid Denmark: many outdoor activities will be closed and the sky is a uniform grey, as the islands are battered by storms blown in from the North Sea.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Imagine a huge peninsula surrounded by about 443 islands. Massive bridges span the sea in between, connecting everything up, and what little land there is sits a precarious 30-odd metres above sea level. Denmark isn’t known for its soaring mountains and dramatic scenery. Most of the country is flat and formless, but beautiful nonetheless: rolling plains and flower fields, windmills turning on the horizon, white cliffs and the soft sand dunes of the north. It’s hard to measure the landmass with any accuracy, since the sea is constantly rising and falling, eroding and adding material to the coast. It’s a land of small wonders rather than big statements.








Top 5 reasons to move to Denmark






×

Top 5 reasons to move to Denmark




1. Progressive politics

Denmark’s politics are based on compromise. Because no government has held an absolute majority since the beginning of the 20th century, everyone tends to get a say. Old, young, gay, straight, rich, poor – everyone’s welcome in Denmark. The result? People here actually like their government, and it’s rated as one of the most accountable and transparent systems in the world.

2. Cities that work

Denmark believes in ‘people-friendly cities’. You know, the ones where a city’s design actually makes life better for the people living in it. Bicycles and pedestrians rule the streets, public transport is ubiquitous, cheap and efficient, money is invested back into parks and infrastructure, and everyone gets a say. It’s a nice change to visit a country where they probably haven’t heard the phrase ‘traffic jam’.

3. Sustainability

It’d be hard to find a greener bunch than the Danes. Copenhagen in particular has been singled out for its commitment to sustainable development. It’s aiming to get 50 per cent of its citizens to cycle to work or school, not to mention going fully carbon neutral by 2025. It’s even got a special ‘Green Laboratory’ devoted to thinking up new eco-technologies for the country.

4. Great design

There’s a certain Danish attitude towards food, fashion, architecture and fine art: less is more. You’ll find a simple and functional aesthetic in just about everything in Denmark, from chairs to buildings to dinner. The Dane’s even designed the sweeping wings of the iconic Sydney Opera House. It all comes back to the notion of hygge: the idea that beautiful things can enrich people’s lives.

5. Quality of life

It’s the thing every country is searching for. Everyone except Denmark. This little country of 5.7 million people consistency tops global rankings for quality of life, and it’s mostly down to the ‘Solidarity System’. This is the country’s idea that no one should be left behind. So although citizens pay a lot of tax (especially the rich ones), the country is rewarded with low unemployment, universal health care, great childcare, public transport and free education. Worth it.

Denmark travel FAQs





Is tipping customary in Denmark?









Tipping in Denmark is not required (although it may be appreciated). Most restaurants include a service charge in the price of your meal, and many service industries are paid very well, so they don’t rely on tips.







What is internet access like in Denmark?









Internet and Wi-Fi are easily available in Denmark, particularly in the major cities. Many cafes and bars will have Wi-Fi access, and internet cafes are common (if a little hard to find in some cases – just ask your concierge). The easiest way to get online is the public library, there’s one in every town.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone in Denmark?









Denmark has great mobile coverage, so reception shouldn’t be a problem. To avoid roaming charges and international rates, consider picking up a pre-paid SIM card – you can find them at most convenience stores.







What are the toilets like in Denmark?









Toilet facilities are what you’d expect in any developed Western country – flush toilets are standard.







What will it cost for a…?









Beer: 6 USD
Coffee: 5 USD
Simple lunch at a cafe: 15 USD
Dinner for two in a restaurant: 75 USD
Train ticket: 3 USD
Bottle of water: 1.5 USD







Can I drink the water in Denmark?









Denmark is one of the few places in the world where the regulations on the quality of tap water even exceed those for bottled water. As such, tap water is completely safe.







Are credit cards widely accepted in Denmark?









Major outlets and stores will accept international cards like Visa, Mastercard and AMEX, but some will only accept the local Dankort card. Nearly everywhere will require a PIN code, so make sure to check yours with your bank if you’re unsure. It’s also worth remembering that a lot of retailers will charge an extra 3-4% if you use a foreign credit card, often without warning.







What is ATM access like in Denmark?









ATMs are widely available in cities and towns (even the smaller ones), but may be closed at night for safety reasons. The term ‘ATM’ is not well known in Denmark, so if you’re looking for one ask for a ‘hæve-automat’.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling to Denmark?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Top responsible travel tips for Denmark

1. Be considerate of Denmark’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. Make an effort to learn some Danish before you go. Locals will appreciate the effort

5. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

6. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, especially children.
