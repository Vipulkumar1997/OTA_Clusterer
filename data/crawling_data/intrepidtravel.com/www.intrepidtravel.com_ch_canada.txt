Grand Canadian Rockies,
September 2017

Yvonne Lynes

Intrepid is great, you can interact with other travellers as much or as little as you like, but the more you put in the more you get from the tour

Review submitted 15 Nov 2017











Grand Canadian Rockies,
September 2017

William Smith

The small group travel allows Intrepid to get deeper into into the destination areas and offers activities that larger companies either do not offer or charge extra for. The guides are very knowledgeable about the areas visited and are very flexible in giving group members an experience to remember.

Transport in Canada

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Canada, you may find yourself travelling by:







Ferry

Find your sea legs and enjoy a mode of transport that offers scenic views and a dose of fresh air. A ferry ride in Canada is a fun way to get acquainted with the coast.


Grand Canadian Rockies










Bicycle

One of the best ways to see a place and get fit at the same time, cycling allows you the freedom to set your own pace and go where big tour buses often can't.





Accommodation in Canada

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Canada you may find yourself staying in a:







Campsites

Have the ultimate outdoors experience by camping out under the stars with friends in the beautiful Canadian wilderness.

Best time to visit Canada

Best time to visit Canada




Canada's vast land mass makes for varying climate conditions, but generally, Canada gets quite cold - sometimes extremely! December - February are the coldest months and can make travelling difficult at times, although the snow is brilliant for snow-sports enthusiasts.

June, July and August are the warmest months, and are perfect for summer outdoor activities like rafting, hiking, camping and canoeing. Due to the warmer temperatures, tourist spots and other popular places will be busier than other months. The months of May and September, while not typically as warm as the summer months, still offer great conditions for travelling and sightseeing, minus the crowds.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Anyone who has been to Canada will know that the Canadian stereotype is actually quite accurate. Well known for being welcoming, friendly, funny, hockey-mad, adventure-loving, sports enthusiasts, Canadians generally do a good job of living up to their reputation.

Large cities like Vancouver are a cultural melting pot of nationalities, and attitudes towards different ways of life are generally quite liberal. This can be seen in the variety of cuisines, shops and people that populate the city.

Known for loving the outdoors and enjoying adventure, both city-dwelling and rural-living Canadians typically remain active with hiking, cycling, canoeing and snow boarding all popular past times, no matter where they live.

The Eastern side of Canada has a decidedly different quality to the West Coast, and retains much of its colonial heritage with the French language being widely spoken and French-influenced food and music being popular.

Canada is also home to native people, with the people of the First Nations and the Inuit in the north calling Canada home. Like many indigenous people and tribes around the world, the people of the First Nations have an ongoing struggle in retaining and protecting their customs and heritage. Modern influences have had a negative impact on their culture and lifestyle, yet despite this, many still actively live and promote a traditional way of life, through the making of tribal music, handicrafts, art and clothing.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Things to try in Canada

1. Poutine

French fries topped with a gloriously messy mix of gravy and cheese curds may not be for everyone, but Poutine is a true Canadian classic… and the perfect hangover cure!

2. Seafood

If visiting the West Coast, Vancouver is known for having one of the best restaurant scenes in the world, and seafood is almost always on the menu. Feast on a fresh seafood banquet, try some inventive fusion-cuisine or grab some sushi for a quick bite.

3. Boutique Beer

Over the last few years, microbreweries have been popping up all over Canada. Whether you visit a microbrewery that brews chocolate-flavoured beer or eat at a restaurant that has a local beer menu, a Canadian boutique beer is worth trying.

4. Maple Syrup

It comes as no surprise that maple syrup is popular in Canada! So be sure to dose up your pancakes with loads of the stuff… and include a side of bacon too, as the locals do.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Canada is BIG! This is clear when looking at a map but even more obvious when travelling in Canada (after driving all day you could still be in the same province). With such a large land mass, it comes as no surprise that the environment varies widely depending on which area of Canada you are travelling in.

Sitting in between the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, Canada shares a long land border with the
United States
in the South, and
Alaska
(US) and Greenland in the North. Mountains, forests and woodlands feature heavily throughout the country, with relatively flat prairies and plains dotted around also, providing arable land. There is much ice and tundra in the Arctic North, with only a few communities choosing to live there.

Although a sparsely populated country, the cities of Canada are well-populated and built-up, although not overly crowded or busy. Expect skyscrapers, malls, the odd traffic jam and all the modern conveniences expected of contemporary cities. Parks, trees and public-art beautify most cities in Canada, and provide sweet relief to travellers and locals alike. Smaller communities exist in more remote areas, with quaint villages on both coasts relying on fishing, tourism and agriculture as main sources of income. Expect a slower pace of life, low-density housing and much less buzz than when in the city.








History and government

History and government




Early History

Canada has been occupied for centuries by different native tribes (some nomadic), who lived their lives with a strong connection to their ancestors and the earth. These people have recently become known as First Nations people. Living by hunting, gathering and fishing, the ability of First Nations people to live in a traditional way was greatly diminished once the French and British settlers arrived in Canada in the late 1500s. With colonisation, many First Nations people became dispossessed, with loss of land to development and the widespread hunting of bison creating food and land shortages.

France and England fiercely competed for Canadian territory over the years, with the lucrative trade of fur being a commodity worth fighting for. After hundreds of years of fighting, the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763, making Canada officially a British Territory.

Recent History

The British North America Act was passed in 1867 and with this, Canada became a self-governing state. After suffering major loss of troops in World War I, Canada was granted relative independence from Britain in 1931. Currently, Canada is still a member of the Commonwealth but the British monarch only retains a ceremonial role in the running of the country. More recently, Canada has continued to flourish as a nation, with wide-scale immigration leading to increased multiculturalism and a resource boom strengthening the economy. Playing host to the 2010 Winter Olympics, Canada is increasingly becoming known as a liberal, tolerant nation - home to legalised gay marriage, universal health care and some of the most liveable cities in the world.








Outdoors Experiences in Canada

Outdoors Experiences in Canada




Top 10 Outdoors Experiences in Canada

1. Beautiful Bears

Seeing polar bears in their natural habitat will take your breath away. Get out and explore the outskirts of Churchill in a tundra vehicle to get up close to these magnificent creatures.

2. River Rafting

The Kicking Horse River is an amazing channel of churning white water. For a dose of adventure, try whitewater rafting on this formidable force of nature.

3. Sensational 'Snowscapades'

Make the most of Canada's abundance of snow by getting out there and having fun in it! Channel your inner child and make snow angels or have a snowball fight with friends.

4. Majestic Mountains

The Rocky Mountains of Canada are well-known for a reason - their imposing beauty is unforgettable. Take in the epic landscapes while hiking and don't forget to have a camera handy to capture the best panoramas.

5. Cycle Adventures

Hop on a bike for some two-wheeled fun and pedal through stunning scenery in Whistler. Tear it up by racing a friend or go slow and take in the amazing views.

6. Stanley Park Perfection

A walk around Vancouver's Stanley Park will see you taking in gorgeous scenery, interesting sculptures, historic totem poles and beautiful birdlife. Stanley Park provides a slice of nature close to the city.

7. Enchanted Camping

Nothing beats getting away from it all to camp among the quiet stillness and natural splendour of the pristine Canadian wilderness.

8. Animal Encounters

Keep watch for deer, moose, caribou, bald eagles and timber wolves while hiking through the wilds of Jasper National Park in Alberta.

9. Giant Glaciers

Be astounded by the immense size and cool beauty of Canada's gigantic glaciers. Perhaps take a thrilling ride on an ice mobile to experience it all up close.

10. Hit the Hot Springs

Take a refreshing soak in the Yukon Territories Hot Springs. Immerse yourself in the soothing waters of this outdoor haven and feel your aches and pains melt away.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Canada may be home to one of the world's largest malls but the shopping experience certainly doesn't end there. The diversity of Canada's population is reflected in the eclectic mix of boutique stores stocking unique artisan wares, modern art, eco fashion and pop culture objects.

Major cities like Vancouver have an abundance of interesting boutiques and galleries stocking literature, bespoke items and vintage posters while smaller towns are great for locally-produced gourmet food, wine and quirky kitsch souvenirs. The China Town areas of major Canadian cities offer a great shopping experience and are generally excellent for top-value market-buys, cheap eats and interesting sights. Choose to snap up bargains and major labels from chain stores and malls, but head for independent shopping strips, boutique shops and markets to find unique treasures and support local artists and creators.

It's also a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.








Festivals and Events in Canada

Festivals and Events in Canada




Calgary Stampede

Canada Day

No matter where you are in Canada, come July 1 you'll know that it's Canada Day! Canadians celebrate this national holiday with parades, fireworks, parties, concerts and barbecues. Be sure to get in the spirit and celebrate with the locals.

Australia: Not required
Belgium: Not required
Germany: Not required
Ireland: Not required
Netherlands: Not required
New Zealand: Not required
South Africa: Yes - in advance

Tipping is very much a part of the culture in Canada. Tipping is expected in restaurants and cafes, and is not already included in the bill. Generally, add 15% to the bill or feel free to tip a higher amount if the service is particularly good or you're feeling generous. Overall, it's your choice but remember that wait staff are usually receiving the minimum wage, which is quite low in Canada. Tipping taxi drivers and valet attendants is also customary.

Internet access is good in Canada, and it's easy to find in most cities and towns. Hotels, hostels and internet cafes are usually the best places to access the internet.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Canada?









Mobile phone coverage is generally very good in Canada but coverage may be patchy in remote areas such as national parks and other mountainous places. Ensure global roaming is activated before you enter Canada.

Cup of coffee = 1.70 CAD
Local bus fare = 2.25 CAD
Budget takeaway meal = 5 CAD
Restaurant meal = 20 CAD







Can I drink the water in Canada?









Drinking water from taps in Canada is considered safe unless otherwise advised. For environmental reasons, try to use a refillable water bottle rather than buying bottled water.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Canada?









Major credit cards are accepted by most retailers and restaurants in Canada. As in most countries, be sure to carry adequate cash for smaller purchases.







What is ATM access like in Canada?









ATMs are very common in Canada, so finding one won't be a problem in most towns, cities and suburbs.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Canada?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Canada

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Canadian cities generally have excellent public transport options. When sightseeing, try to use buses, trains or monorails - or even better, walk.

When camping or visiting national parks, refrain from feeding native animals or leaving food out.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

It’s not uncommon to encounter bears within campsites and national parks. Intrepid leaders have been trained for these situations and will inform the group on how to 'bear proof' the camp. There’s no reason to be alarmed as it is extremely rare for bears to attack humans. In this case, follow the instructions of your leader at all times.
