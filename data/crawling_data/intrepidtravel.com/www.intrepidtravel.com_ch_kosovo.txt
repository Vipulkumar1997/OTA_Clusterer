Kosovo tours & travel













Home

Destinations

Europe

Kosovo



Tiny Kosovo is Europe’s newest (official) country: a handful of landlocked mountains, poppy-dotted meadows and oak forests smack bang in the middle of the Balkans.


The shadow of conflict in the late 90s has kept Kosovo off the holiday radar, which is a real shame. But go there today and you can feel that shadow lifting. NATO troops may still guard Serbian monasteries, and proper independence is an ongoing struggle, but the headlines now are increasingly good ones: an emerging tourist trade, film festivals in Peja, Pristina’s trendy cafe scene and world-class walking in the Rugova Mountains. Yep, Europe’s youngest member is definitely making up for lost time.

Kosovo, Albania & Macedonia Explorer,
September 2017

jackie george

The Intrepid approach to travel is very enjoyable because of the small group size, flexibility and variety of daily activities, and the reasonable cost.

Best time to visit Kosovo

Best time to visit Kosovo




Kosovo’s mountainous terrain means cold, snowy winters, hot summers and some pleasant months in between. Between December and January the temperatures can drop below freezing, particularly up in the hills, but life down on the plains is a little more stable. July and August are the warmest, with average daily temperatures around 27°C with very little rain. If you’re after outdoor activities like hiking and swimming, try late spring or early autumn when the days are mild and the sun is shining.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




It’s hard to drop a ball in Kosovo and not have it roll away from you. Most of the country is steep and mountainous, except for two big plains: the Metohija Basin in the west and the Plain of Kosovo in the east. The countryside is mostly rolling fields and meadows – poppies, wildflowers and so on – with dense forests of deciduous oak and beech trees in between. Every so often you’ll come across a Serbian monastery high up in the hills, or a red-roofed town by a riverbank. You could drive across the whole country in a couple of hours. Fun fact: Kosovo has the only river in Europe (the Nerodimka) that splits and flows into two different seas.








Top 5 travel myths about Kosovo

Top 5 travel myths about Kosovo



1. There’s a war going on

Not true anymore. The Kosovo War between Albanian rebels and the Republic of Yugoslavia ended in 1999. These days there is still some tension between the Albanian majority and Serbia (NATO troops still guard isolated Serbian monasteries around Pristina), but the war as it stood is over. Kosovo got its independence in 2008 and has now been recognised by most UN member countries.It’s even on the International Olympic Committee.

2. It’s dangerous

While the scars of war still exist, they’re fading fast. The vast majority of old landmines from the Kosovo War have been cleared, conflict with Serbia has eased considerably and the majority of the country is busy looking to the future. Kosovo has the youngest and fastest growing population in Europe, with major cities like Pristina expanding day by day. All that’s required for travelling there are common sense and a little sensitivity. That’s it.

3. We’re not allowed to travel there

Travel warnings for Kosovo advise caution, but they don’t say not to travel there (except in some areas of the country, check with your relevant government department). It’s always a good idea to keep an eye on the current political climate, which is why a group trip in Kosovo makes the most sense. You can travel with a local leader who has their finger on the pulse, and you’ll be informed well in advance if there is any unrest on the horizon.

4. There’s not much history

Even though it’s Europe’s youngest official country, Kosovo has an old soul. Rome conquered the province in the second century BC and ruins of their cities can be found at sites like Ulpiana. Since then it’s been ruled by Bulgarians, Byzantines, Ottomans, Serbians, Hungarians and (recently) Kosovars themselves. There are 13th-century mosques, old churches, Ottoman-style bazaars and crumbling ruins dotted throughout the country – more than enough to keep a history buff happy.

5. The people are unfriendly

Don’t mistake conflict with unfriendliness. The people of Kosovo have earned a reputation in recent years as some of the friendliest in Europe. Ask directions and it’s not uncommon you’ll be led all the way there. Invitations to family meals are common. It’s probably Kosovo’s exposure to international visitors: after the war over 200,000 international workers came to help the country get back on its feet, and the locals have never forgotten it.

Belgium: No – not required
Canada: No - not required
Germany: No - not required
Ireland: No - not required
Netherlands: No - not required
New Zealand: No - not required
South Africa: No - not required

Is tipping customary in Kosovo?









In restaurants, bars and taxis, travellers are expected to leave a small tip.







What is internet access like in Kosovo?









Internet access is fairly simple in Kosovo. The country has a good broadband network and there are plenty of internet cafes in city centres like Pristina and Prizren. Though more rural areas have been known to suffer outages.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone in Kosovo?









Most Kosovars communicate by mobile, and the coverage is pretty consistent across the country. Prepaid SIM cards are available in most convenience stores and supermarkets if you want to avoid international roaming charges.







What are the toilets like in Kosovo?









Most toilets in Kosovo are flush toilets, but access can be tricky. There are no public restrooms in Pristina, so your best bet is to call in at a cafe or restaurant. It’s not uncommon for Kosovo toilets to be out of toilet paper, so carry a stash of your own just in case.Using a public toilet or a toilet in a café will require payment, so it’s best to have some loose change on hand.







What will it cost for a…?









Beer: 50c
Coffee: 1 EUR
Simple lunch at a cafe: 3 EUR
Dinner for two in a restaurant: 17 EUR
Bottle of water: 33c







Can I drink the water in Kosovo?









Although the locals say the tap water is safe to drink, it’s probably best to stick with filtered water while in Kosovo, as there have been accounts of contamination.







Are credit cards widely accepted in Kosovo?









Cash is still the king in Kosovo. While major supermarkets and upmarket restaurants accept all major credit cards, there are plenty more who don’t, so be prepared and keep some euros on you at all times.







What is ATM access like in Kosovo?









ATMs are the safest and easiest way to get cash in Kosovo, and there are plenty around in major towns like Pristina and Prizren. You’ll struggle to find them in smaller towns though, so make sure to withdraw enough cash to see you through until the next big city.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling to Kosovo?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Top responsible travel tips for Kosovo

Be considerate of Kosovo’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Make an effort to learn some Albanian and Serbian before you go. Locals will appreciate the effort

Avoid discussing politics with anyone unless they bring it up first. The Kosovo War is still a very raw topic for locals

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, especially children.
