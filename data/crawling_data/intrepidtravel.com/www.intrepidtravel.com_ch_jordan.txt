Destinations

Middle East

Jordan



Modern cities filled with worldly citizens, mountainous regions dotted with small villages, and deserts inhabited by the nomadic Bedouin - Jordan has all this diversity and more.


With the cosmopolitan cafes of Amman, the peace of hilltop Dana and the historic treasures of Madaba, you may come to Jordan to see the ruins of Petra, but you’ll leave having encountered so much more.

Explore Jordan,
November 2017

Ann Docker

Jordan is a very safe country to visit and the sites are amazing, particularly Wadi Rum and Petra won't  disappoint.

Review submitted 03 Dec 2017











Explore Jordan,
October 2017

Francine Dappen

THIS IS NOT A REVIEW:  THIS IS ONLY FOR INTREPID STAFF:
Regarding this feedback form, we suggest that there should a comment box under each question as opposed to only certain ones.  The trouble being that giving an overall rafting when there was an issue with only one hotel/restaurant etc. disallows a higher rating.  In our case you may now need to read these end comments to understand our full review.

Sites: 
We loved everywhere we went, with the highlights being Petra and floating in the Dead Sea. I wish we had more time at Mt. Nebo as it was very rushed. I also would have loved a bit more time (maybe 30 minutes) at the Dead Sea (we were lucky as we were continuing on to Israel/Palestine to enjoy more time at the Dead Sea but if we weren’t we would have felt like we definitely wanted more time there). Jerash was also very interesting.
REFUND:
We were extremely displeased to discover that our flight from Cairo to Amman was only at 1700 (5pm). We had arrived on the night train back to Cairo at approximately 9am. We found out that there was a 1330 (130pm) flight from Cairo to Amman but Intrepid only booked us on the late 1700 (5pm) flight. This wasted our whole day and we couldn’t do much in Cairo and completely missed Amman. We were picked up at King’s Hotel in Cairo at 1300 (1pm), taken to the airport, waited several hours there before boarding our plane. By the time we cleared Jordanian customs, collected our bags, met our driver, drove to the hotel and met briefly .

Transport in Jordan

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Jordan, you may find yourself travelling by:







4x4

Head out for a day of dune-bashing in a 4x4. Scale the towering desert dunes and take in the sweeping views. A fun way to explore remote parts of Jordan.


Jordan Discovery




Accommodation in Jordan

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Jordan you may find yourself staying in a:







Desert Camp

Be welcomed by Bedouin for a night of camping under the stars. Enjoy traditional food and music then fall asleep in the supreme silence of the desert.

Best time to visit Jordan






×

Best time to visit Jordan




The weather in Jordan can get quite extreme. Overall, it tends to be hot during the day and cold at night (in desert areas, expect it to be extremely hot during the day and freezing at night). Yet during winter it can get bitterly cold, with snowfall occurring in some parts of the country.

Travelling during the summer months (June, July and August) can be challenging for those not accustomed to the heat, so visiting Jordan during spring and autumn is recommended for those who wish to escape the hotter temperatures.

As a Muslim country, Jordan observes Ramadan. If you are planning to travel during Ramadan, it's important to consider that many restaurants and shops will either be closed or operating on reduced hours during this time.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




As a Muslim country, Jordan’s culture is quite conservative, although not as conservative as some other Middle Eastern countries. Western influences (particularly in Amman and other large cities) have infiltrated Jordanian society so Jordan now possesses a mix of Arabian customs amid modern ways of life. Due to immigration, Jordan now has a significant Palestinian and Iraqi population, adding to the cultural diversity of the country.

Despite the outside influences, Islamic traditions are strong in Jordan with spectacular mosques signalling the call to prayer five times a day, Ramadan being observed each year and some segregation of the sexes occurring.

The desert-dwelling Bedouin have a distinct culture of their own, drawing on traditions that have been passed down for centuries. Living a largely nomadic lifestyle, the Bedouin rely on the herding of animals and the creation of handicrafts in the absence of a fertile environment to farm. With a strong musical heritage, traditional instruments are played and time-honored traditions are continued.

Hospitality is a crucial element of Jordanian culture. Most visitors will be humbled by the kindness, sincerity and genuine care showed by Jordanians. Being welcomed into peoples’ homes is common, and can probably be attributed to the custom of welcoming strangers and sharing food when travelling in the unforgiving desert.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Featuring typical Middle Eastern ingredients like lamb, chickpeas, garlic and a range of aromatic herbs and spices, Jordanian cuisine is delicious.

Things to try in Jordan

1. Meze

Like many other Middle Eastern countries, a plate of shared breads and dips is a great way to begin a feast.

2. Mansaf

This traditional Bedouin dish of lamb and yoghurt is usually served with rice and bread. This is the national dish of Jordan, so definitely try it before you leave.

3. Baklava

These small, sweet pastries made with honey and nuts will have you going back for more.

4. Coffee

The coffee in Jordan is strong. Often spiced with a hint of cardamom, coffee is strongly linked to the famed Jordanian hospitality, so drink up – it would be rude not to!








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Jordan is made up of a staggeringly diverse range of natural environments. From stark deserts to towering mountains, fertile wetlands, coastal reefs and urban cities, journeying through Jordan provides changing scenery and varying conditions.

Sharing borders with Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Jordan mixes modern architecture with heritage-filled buildings, well-manicured streets with historic alleyways and impressive mansions with simple homes.

Modern, developed cities like Amman and Aqaba feature unique architecture, spectacular mosques, five-star hotels and resorts. Small villages with rustic housing populate the less-built-up rural areas and Bedouin tents made of goat hair can be found in desert areas.








History and government

History and government




Early History

The country now known as Jordan was originally inhabited by the Nabataeans thousands of years ago. Over the centuries, Jordan has been a place conquered and inhabited by many different people including the Romans, Greeks, Assyrians, Ottoman Turks, Egyptians and Mamluks (people of Kurdish origins). All these influences can still be seen today in Jordan's ancient ruins, architecture, crafts and arts. Many battles were fought in Ancient Jordan, including the Christian crusaders who clashed with Islamic Forces in Jordan during the 11th and 12th centuries. The first Muslim Dynasty began with the Umayyad Empire in 661.

Recent History

In 1950, Jordan was renamed the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and in 1951, King Abdullah I was assassinated while visiting a mosque. His eldest son became king but was removed from his duties in 1952 due to mental illness. In 1953, his teenage son Hussein Ibn Talal became king, and continued to rule for over 40 years. In the 1960s, Jordan saw many immigrants arrive and settle – mainly Palestinians escaping the conflict in their homeland.

In 1999, King Abdullah II succeeded his father King Hussein and continues to rule Jordan now. His reign has been characterised by liberal policies, economic reforms and technological advances. His wife, Queen Rania of Jordan, has a visible public profile, is active in many social causes and is regarded internationally as a highly influential woman.

Top 10 Ways To Experience Jordan




1. Locate a Lost City

Spend a day exploring the astonishing lost city of Petra. Discover temples, tombs, a monastery and an amphitheatre in this fascinating, world-renowned archaeological site.

2. Take a Dip

Dive into the Dead Sea and relax in the famous waters thought to have therapeutical properties. The high salinity makes floating effortless so it’s easy to lie back and enjoy the view. This experience is a must-do for any visitor to Jordan.

3. Kick Back in a Cafe

The cafes of Amman are the perfect place to get acquainted with modern Jordan. From elegant, urban cafes serving international fare to earthy, family-run cafes offering traditional food and coffee, see both sides of modern Jordan when you eat.

4. Delve Into the Desert

Travel across hot, desert sands and spend the night camping under the stars with Bedouin hosts. Stargazing, eating traditional food and learning about the Bedouin way of life is an authentic experience to remember.

5. Admire Ancient Art

The city of Madaba is known for its amazing collection of ancient mosaics. Take a stroll around the city to scout out these handcrafted pieces of the past that are scattered throughout Madaba’s churches, museums and homes.

6. View an Icon

Behold the sight of legendary Mt Nebo. A revered holy site, Mt Nebo is home to the ruins of a church and monastery, and is an interesting place for believers and non-believers alike.

7. Meet Mother Nature

A hike through the changing landscapes of the Dana Nature Reserve offers wildlife encounters, quaint villages and majestic mountain views. Get back to nature and see Jordan’s natural treasures here.

8. Relax in a Resort

See a different side of Jordan in the laidback resort town of Aqaba. Chill out on the beach, feast on fresh seafood, soak up the sunshine and enjoy the change of pace in this piece of coastal bliss.

9. Uncover a Bit of History

Explore the fortified town and castle of Karak to gain insight into the fascinating history of this region. Walk through a network of tunnels and walkways and imagine what life was like centuries ago.

10. Discover Roman Ruins

Travel to Jerash to see some of the biggest and most preserved Roman ruins outside of Italy. Baths, theatres, temples and forums feature within the colonnaded streets and still-standing city walls.








Shopping

Shopping

Jordan travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Jordan?









Visas are required by all visitors entering Jordan. Single entry visas valid for 14 days and can be obtained by most nationalities on arrival at the airport in Amman or at the Jordanian border for approximately JOD40. It can be significantly more expensive to acquire your visa from the embassy in your home country. If you require a stay longer than 14 days, visas obtained from the embassy in your home country will be valid for two months.







Is tipping customary in Jordan?









Tipping is up to the individual in Jordan. Hotels and up-market restaurants typically add a surcharge that is included in bills, which is usually 10%. Rounding up bills and leaving spare change is a good idea when dining in smaller restaurants and when using taxis.







What is the internet access like in Jordan?









Internet access is growing rapidly in Jordan. Internet can usually be accessed from hotels and internet cafes in major cities. Expect little to no access in small towns, villages and other rural areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Jordan?









Mobile phone coverage is good in Jordan’s major cities and built-up areas like Amman and Aqaba. Expect limited to no phone coverage in more isolated areas like the desert. Ensure you have global roaming activated on your phone before leaving home.







What are the toilets like in Jordan?









Western-style toilets are common in modern hotels, malls and at popular tourist areas. Squat toilets are the standard throughout the rest of the country. Sometimes, you may need to pay and bring your own toilet paper when visiting public rest rooms.







What will it cost for a…?









Street snack = 3 JOD
Can of soft drink = 1 JOD
Dinner at a restaurant = 10 JOD
Embroidered shawl = 20-30 JOD







Can I drink the water in Jordan?









Drinking water from taps in Jordan can be safe, depending on where you are. It's considered safe to drink water from modern hotels that have filtered water but perhaps not so from smaller establishments and in rural areas. For environmental reasons, try to use a refillable water bottle rather than buying bottled water. Peel fruit before eating and avoid ice in drinks.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Jordan?









Major credit cards are widely accepted by stores in Jordan. Smaller cafes and shops may not accept credit cards so ensure you carry enough cash to cover small purchases.







What is ATM access like in Jordan?









ATMs are common in Jordan’s main cities so finding one won't be a problem. Rural and remote areas typically will have less ATMs so be sure to carry enough cash for purchases when away from the city.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Jordan?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Jordan

1. Be considerate of Jordan’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

3. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

4. Ramadan is the fasting month for all Muslims. During this month no food, drink or smoking is permitted during daylight hours. While non-Muslims aren't expected to fast, it's recommended to try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public during daylight hours.

5. Refrain from touching or interfering with ancient monuments, relics or historic sites.

6. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it. Simple greetings will help break the ice.

7. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

8. Ask permission and remove your shoes before entering a place of worship.

9. Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

10. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.
