Albania



If you think you know Albania, think again


This addictive country has a myriad of faces. In the rugged north, the Alps are so fierce they're 'accursed', while the south enjoys one of the least known and most beautiful coastlines in all of
Europe
. Tirana is filled with craziness, from its traffic to its nightlife, but on its doorstep are mosques, citadels, Ottoman architecture and a stunning dose of medieval Balkans. The real surprise of Albania is the people. Their warmth to strangers is infectious and youâ€™re bound to find yourself swapping stories over a glass of raki or three.

Western Balkans Uncovered,
September 2017

Jeannine Poulin

Intrepid is a wonderful tour company. We just completed our first tour with them and we know there will be more. Travelling in a small group with travellers from several areas of the world in itself is enriching.  Our tour leader was fun to be with and knowledgeable, even though he was of the same age of our own sons. ðŸ˜Š We look forward to booking our next trip with Intrepid.

Robert Rovers

I really appreciated the small group size (maximum of 12), the quality of the tour leader, and the emphasis on sustainable travel. Intrepid is a step ahead of it's competitors.

Best time to visit Albania






Ã—

Best time to visit Albania




While the interior of the country sweats it out, summers along Albaniaâ€™s Riviera are warm, fresh and bustling. When winter arrives so does the rain, but with temperatures above freezing for most of the country, itâ€™s still easy to get out and about. November to March can mean heavy snowfalls in the Alps, so if youâ€™re a fan of the white stuff itâ€™s a great time to head to the hills.








Geography and environment






Ã—

Geography and environment




Perched along the western coast of the Balkan Peninsula, Albania borders some of Europeâ€™s most colourful countries. Italy is within waving distance across the Strait of Otranto, Greece is to the south and Montenegro and Kosovo border to the north. This is one wild country. Most of the interior is covered with rugged mountain ranges and deep valleys. In the south, the snowy peaks give way to the sparkling waters of the Ionian Sea; Albaniaâ€™s Riviera where honeymooners flock and Corfu Island is just within armâ€™s reach.

Top 5 Albanian Citadels

1. Berat

Albania's most charming medieval town is home to an amazingly well-preserved citadel. Surrounded by ancient stone walls, the citadel encloses dozens of churches and historic buildings while the white Ottoman houses clambering up the hillside to the castle have earned the town the nickname â€˜City of a Thousand Windowsâ€™.

2. Gjirokastra

This 13th-century citadel is hammered into the mountain top and boasts beautiful examples of Ottoman architecture. Explore the kules and the fortress once used as a prison by the Nazis. Donâ€™t forget to look at the views of the valley plunging below and say â€˜Ohhhhhâ€¦â€™.

3. Kruja

Once the headquarters of Skanderbeg, Albania's national hero, Kruja Castle dates back to the 4th century, but it wasnâ€™t until the 15th century that it really started to earn its keep. For 30 years it resisted the advances of the Turks, before finally falling to the Ottomans. Now itâ€™s a little more peaceful and a nice spot to take in the views of olive groves, goats and the sprawling landscape.

4. Rozafa

Like all good citadels, Rozafa once rose imposingly over the region. Now in partial ruins, itâ€™s still impressive. A stroll along its walls will transport you back to Illyrian times.

5. Pertrela

Perched on a rocky hill near Tirana, the fortress of Pertrela was part of the signalling and defense system for Kruja Castle during the 15th century. Today, itâ€™s one of Albania's best preserved fortifications with spectacular views of the valley and surrounding mountains.

Top responsible travel tips for Albania

Be considerate of Albaniaâ€™s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
