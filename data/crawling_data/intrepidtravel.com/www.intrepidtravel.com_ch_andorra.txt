Andorra



If you like your countries monarchic, your cities few and your mountains snowy, Andorra is the place for you.


Squished into the eastern Pyrenees between
France
and
Spain
, this tiny little country is best known for its skiing, smuggling and lax tax laws. Even if you’re not much of a skier though (or smuggler for that matter), there’s still plenty to like about this Lilliputian land. The shopping is top-notch (and duty-free), the cuisine – drawing on the best of French and Spanish gastronomy – is predictably delish, and the scenery stunning. Plus, if for some crazy reason you decide you don’t like Andorra, it’s not like you’ll need to go far to escape it – at only 468 square kilometres in size, a foreign border is never too far away.

Summer Pyrenees Family Holiday,
July 2017

Marie Moynihan

The trip was great - with just the right level of activity. The guides were fab and were very good with the kids, always encouraging them and making it fun for them. This holiday was the first holiday I felt like I could totally switch off - every thing was organised for you, so you didn't have to think about anything - you could just enjoy. Andorra is beautiful. White water rafting was highlight for the kids. Highly recommend this as a family holiday with teenagers - 12 and 15.

Summer Pyrenees Family Holiday,
August 2017

Tania Testa

This is a great family holiday, full of activities - you will definitely sleep well each night! The guides make it an unforgettable experience and the white-water rafting is the highlight. I highly recommend spending time in this beautiful country and vow to come back to Andorra in the Winter for the skiing.

Best time to visit Andorra

Best time to visit Andorra




The best time to visit Andorra really depends on what you’re after. If it’s a temperate alpine escape, summer (June–August) is your man – though evenings can still get cold. If it’s the country’s world-famous skiing you’re seeking, then it’s winter (December–February) you’ll be wanting. Daytime temperatures from mid-November to May tend to hover around 6-degrees Celcius and the snow falls in abundance.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




With one road into the country, another out, and only a smattering of cities, Andorra’s landscape is all about the mountains. Gorges, valleys, gullies and rivers carve up the countryside, the majority of which is forested and plenty cloaked in snow.








Top 5 facts about the Andorran army

Top 5 facts about the Andorran army



1. Long-standing gripe

While it may not have actually seen any fighting, Andorra qualifies as the longest combatant in the First World War. Courtesy of being forgotten from the Versailles Peace Conference, it was technically at war with
Germany
from 1914 to 1958.

2. Conflict Free

Andorra has not seen actively involvement in any conflict for over 700 years.

3. Gun Laws

According to Andorran law, the head of each house is required to keep a rifle. The law also states that the police will provide said household head with a firearm ‘in case of need’.

4. Voluntary Budget

In 2003, Marc Forné Molné, the former Andorran Prime Minister, revealed that the country’s military budget relies exclusively on voluntary donations.

5. Flag-handling

As stated in the country’s official bulletin, the Andorran army’s primary responsibility consists of presenting the country’s flag at official ceremonial functions.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Andorra

1. Be considerate of Andorra’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Andorra’s tap water is considered safe to drink. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water and instead fill and refill a reusable water bottle or canteen.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. Learn some local language – Catalan and Spanish – and don't be afraid to use it; simple greetings will help break the ice.

5. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive and supports the local community.

6. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
