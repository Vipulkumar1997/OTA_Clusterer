Experience Madagascar,
November 2017

kathy andreoli

Madagascar is a unique island that    is not to be missed. While the roads and conditions may be tough you are treated to a passing scenery that is unique and timeless, from dry open plains to forested mountains, from leaping lemurs to crazy chameleons in all shapes and sizes. Not to be missed

Review submitted 30 Nov 2017











Madagascar: Hike & Bike,
October 2017

Fabienne Stettler

I enjoyed the Active Madagascar trip very much. We hiked through beautiful nature (with amazing camping sites), interact with local peoples and saw lots of wildlife. I liked the fact, that we traveled for almost 10 days without seeing lots of tourists. Active Madagascar is the perfect way to see that wonderful country.

Best time to visit Madagascar

Best time to visit Madagascar




With such a unique ecosystem and environment, going on holiday to Madagascar at different times of the year offers a variety of challenges and benefits. September to November is considered one of the best times to visit, as these months sit right in between the cool, dry winter and the hot, rainy season. This time is also considered the best time to view birdlife. July to August offers cooler temperatures and the best chances for whale watching on the coast. January to March is cyclone season, but this is also the best time to see flowering orchids.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




This iconic island nation sitting off the coast of East Africa in the Indian Ocean is home to one of the most precious and unique natural environments in the world. Its isolated location means that a distinct variety of animal and plant species have been able to thrive without outside genetic influences. Possessing extinct volcanoes, hidden waterfalls, cool highlands, grassy plains, pristine beaches and islands, Madagascar was once completely covered in forest - but due to high levels of deforestation, most forest cover has been lost. Some tracts of rainforest do endure today, but it's estimated that the current level of forest cover is only 1-2 percent of what it once was. Despite this loss, hundreds of species of plants and trees thrive all over the island, from huge, ancient baobab trees to thorny cacti and resplendent ferns.








Top 5 Strange Species of Madagascar

Top 5 Strange Species of Madagascar




1. Fat-Tailed Dwarf Lemur

Known to hibernate for up to eight months of the year, this cute critter lives off fat reserves stored in its hefty tail - saved especially for these months of inactivity.

2. Aye Aye

This odd-looking lemur can be found mainly on east coast of Madagascar. While it won't win any beauty contests, it can lay claim to being the largest nocturnal primate in the world. Its unique way of finding food (knocking on trees then gnawing through the wood to access the hidden grubs) makes the aye aye similar to the woodpecker.

3. Fossa

With a cat-like body and a dog-like face, this strange beast endemic to Madagascar is actually closely related to the mongoose species. A carnivorous predator, the fossa roams forests day and night in search of prey - preferably lemurs, rodents and other small mammals.

4. Tenrec

This bizarre little species can bare resemblance to many different animals due to the unique circumstances of its evolution. Sharing ancestry with animals as diverse as elephants, sea cows and aardvarks, most tenrecs look like small hedgehogs or otters and can range in size from a tiny 4cm to a robust 39cm.

5. Satanic Leaf-Tailed Gecko

Home to a whole raft of interesting and unusual reptiles, Madagascar's most devilish creation has to be the satanic leaf-tailed gecko. With red eyes, a tail shaped like a leaf and a head like Lucifer, it's no wonder locals are afraid of them.

Madagascar travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Madagascar?









MADAGASCAR:
Australia: Yes - Visa required
Belgium: Yes - Visa required
Canada: Yes - Visa required
Germany: Ye - Visa required
Ireland: Yes - Visa required
Netherlands: Yes - Visa required
New Zealand: Yes - Visa required
South Africa: Yes - Visa required
Switzerland: Yes - Visa required
United Kingdom: Yes - Visa required
USA: Yes - Visa required

All nationalities require a visa for Madagascar. If you have an embassy in your home country you can obtain the visa prior to departure. 30 day tourist Visas are also available for most nationalities on arrival at Antananarivo airport. Currently the visa fee has been suspended. Visa and other entry and exit conditions change regularly so we recommend that you contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate of Madagascar for the most up to date information.

Minors travelling to Madagascar with only one parent are required to carry a legal document signed by any non-travelling parents, giving approval for the child to travel, or other applicable documents, such as custody orders.







Is tipping customary in Madagascar?









Tipping isn’t mandatory, but a little generosity will be received positively especially when considering the low wages that most service workers are typically paid. Setting aside a small amount for porters, guides and drivers is wise, as is leaving spare change or rounding up the bill at restaurants.







What is the internet access like in Madagascar?









Cyber cafes are found in some of the larger cities like Antsirabe, Fianarantsoa and Antananarivo. Smaller towns and remote areas will have far less access, so prepare to disconnect when travelling out of urban centres.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Madagascar?









Mobile phone coverage is generally good in Madagascar's large cities and towns, but less so in rural areas and on remote islands. Ensure you have global roaming activated before leaving home if you wish to use your mobile phone.







What are the toilets like in Madagascar?









Squat/pit toilets are the standard in Madagascar except for western-style flushable toilets that are sometimes available in large hotels and other modern buildings. Carry your own supply of soap and toilet paper, as this is rarely provided.







What will it cost for a…?









Short city bus ride = 300 MGA
Snack at a market = 200-500 MGA
Bottle of beer in a restaurant or bar = 4,000 MGA
Basic meal in a café or restaurant = 8,000-12,000 MGA







Can I drink the water in Madagascar?









Drinking tap water isn't recommended in Madagascar. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water. Ask your leader where filtered water can be found, some hotels we stay in may have drinking water available. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Madagascar?









Major credit cards like Visa are usually accepted by large hotels and western-style restaurants in the capital but not by smaller vendors. Ensure you have adequate cash to cover purchases not able to be made on credit.







What is ATM access like in Madagascar?









ATMs that accept foreign cards can be found in large cities and the airport, although they're often unreliable or out of service. Be sure to carry a back-up method of payment in case ATM access becomes difficult.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Madagascar?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

For more information on insurance, please go to:

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Madagascar

1. While on holiday in Madagascar, be considerate of local customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

3. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

4. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

5. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

6. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

7. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

8. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

9. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.

10. Madagascar is one of the world's most bio-diverse places. Let's keep it that way by not removing any flowers, leaves, coral, wood or organic materials from the island.
