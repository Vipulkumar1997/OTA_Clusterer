Road to Zanzibar,
November 2017

Glenn Fraser

Africa was a destination on my bucket list for a very long time. My daughter and I choose Intrepid after reading all the reviews on their website. I am now one of those reviews. It was an adventure of a lifetime and exceeded my expectations every step of the way. Intrepid was amazing.

Transport in Kenya

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Kenya, you may find yourself travelling by:







Overland Vehicle

Travel through national parks and reserves in a customised safari vehicle, made for negotiating the rough African terrain and maximising wildlife-viewing opportunities.

Accommodation in Kenya

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Kenya you may find yourself staying in a:







Lodge

Stay in lodges perched in unforgettable locations - from the foothills of Mt Kenya to within national parks. Surrounded by forest and waterholes, you can enjoy the rare pleasure of waking up to the sounds of an animal orchestra.

Kenya in-depth: Modern Warriors










A night with the Maasai

It’s not every night you sleep out in the Kenyan bush, protected from lions by spear-wielding Maasai men. One traveller talks university, celestial navigation, Facebook and life around the campfire with five modern warriors. That – and how to keep elephants out of your vegie patch.

Best time to visit Kenya






×

Best time to visit Kenya




Kenya receives a lot of tourists in January and February when the weather is hot and dry and generally the most pleasant. It’s also the best time for bird watching, as birds migrate to the lakes of the Rift Valley in large numbers. It’s generally less busy from June to September, but the weather is still dry during this time. Wet season is from March to May and October to December. During this time tourist sites are less crowded, hotels have more rooms available and prices are usually cheaper. The annual wildebeest migration occurs between July and August, and again in October each year. Millions of wildebeest migrate from the Serengeti in search of greener pastures and then return. The Masai Mara National Park is the best place to see this event.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Kenya is one of Africa’s most multicultural countries, with a population as diverse as its terrain. There are more than 40 different ethnic tribes, each with their own language, culture and customs. The red-robed, beaded Maasai of the south are undoubtedly the most famous tribespeople of the region. The unique Swahili culture dominates the coastal regions and Islam is quite common in the North. Nairobi is home to a large swirl of humanity, with significant Indian, African and Western populations. As a result, you’re likely to see mosques, churches and temples, taste international cuisine from all over the world and hear the sounds of Kenyan hip-hop, traditional African drumming and Western pop.

Depending on where you are in Kenya, the culture and customs vary according to the area you are visiting. The northern and coastal regions tend to be more traditional, while Nairobi, as an international hub of trade and commerce, tends to be more liberal. The Maasai and other tribes typically lead pastoral lives based on agriculture and animal husbandry. Their daily life is based on centuries of tradition and if you get the chance to visit a tribal village, you’ll be able to see the customs of these fascinating people firsthand. Traditional clothing, dance, song and ceremonies keep this proud culture alive in the face of modernisation, which is sweeping through the country.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways of experiencing a country is by eating. Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

As a multiracial society, Kenya has many different cuisines for travellers to try. From traditional Swahili cuisine to Indian, European and Middle Eastern food, many cultures are represented, especially in large cities like Nairobi. While the average Kenyan lives mostly on maize, beans and vegetables, tourist areas and large cities offer much more variety for visitors.

Things to try in Kenya

1. Seafood

Kenya’s coastal areas, such as Mombasa and Lamu, are the best places to feast on fresh crab, lobster, oysters and kingfish cooked to perfection in sumptuous spices.

2. Nyama Choma

One strictly for the carnivores, Nyama Choma is a popular Kenyan style of cooking and eating meat. Goat, beef and chicken are roasted and served on a communal cutting board, sometimes with condiments such as chilli, salt, chopped tomatoes and avocado.

3. Curries

With a significant population hailing from India, Kenya is a great place to savour spicy curries made with an East African twist.

4. Tropical Fruit

For a cheap and cost-effective snack, head to the market stalls that sell a colourful array of tropical fruit. Pineapples, papayas, bananas, and passionfruit are usually plentiful in Kenya. Any fruit that you can peel is a more hygienic, easy option than one you have to wash.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Kenya is located in East Africa, sharing borders with
Ethiopia
, Somalia, Sudan,
Tanzania
and
Uganda
. With a diverse topography, Kenya has a wide variety of terrain – lofty mountains, dense rainforest, stark plains and soft-sand beaches.

This diversity also applies to the environments that Kenya’s people live in. Kenya’s crowded capital is a heaving melange of cars, buses, skyscrapers, street stalls, markets and people; the idyllic Loita Hills is the heart of Maasai country; the national parks run wild with exotic creatures; and rustic Lamu Island is a car-free piece of living history. Overall, most Kenyans either live a fast-paced existence in the modern metropolis of Nairobi or a quieter, agricultural-based life in Kenya’s rural towns and villages.








History and government

History and government




Early History

Recent archaeological findings in Kenya have revealed the remains of one of the earliest species of hominid, placing Kenya among the first places inhabited by humans. Before the arrival of outsiders, Kenya was inhabited by nomadic tribes who most likely entered Kenya from the north. The Maasai and the Kikuyu were the most dominant in numbers, although the Maasai were well known for their reputation as strong warriors who often raided their neighbours.

During the 19th century, Kenya came under the influence of outside cultures due to the arrival of traders from the Middle East and Asia, and settlers and missionaries from Europe. Britain and Germany both had vested interests in Kenya for its abundance of natural resources (especially ivory) and because it was an important point for trade. As such, settlers from Britain, Germany and other European nations flooded into the country in large numbers, setting up agricultural empires such as coffee plantations. These plantations relied heavily on local tribespeople for labour, much to the resentment of the indigenous populations. As a result of this, a large number of Indian labourers were brought to Kenya to work on plantations and build railroads. This Indian influence is reflected in the current population of Kenya.

Recent History

After much infighting, confrontation, uprising and reform, Kenya was granted its independence from British colonial rule in 1963. The “Mau Mau Uprising” of the 1950s was responsible for drawing attention to the plight of the African population, and was also the catalyst for the change in how Kenya is governed.

The 1970s saw Kenya’s international economic profile grow due to the successful development of a free-market economy, with agriculture and tourism creating more a more stable economy. More recently, Kenya’s tourism industry has continued to develop and flourish, mainly due to its wealth of exotic animals, national parks, coastal hot-spots and unique cultures. Standards of living have also improved in Kenya, with an overall improvement in life expectancy, infant mortality and fertility rates – probably due to the increased investment in family planning, education and health by both the Kenyan government and NGOs. Despite this, many Kenyans still live below the poverty line and struggle to provide the bare necessities for themselves and their children. Regardless of this, travellers will be touched by the generosity of spirit and genuine hospitality that Kenyans display to visitors.








Wildlife Encounters of Kenya

Wildlife Encounters of Kenya




Top 10 Wildlife Encounters of Kenya

1. Cheetah Chase

The cheetah, the Ferrari of the animal kingdom, is the fastest land animal on the planet. This slick predator can reach speeds of up to 120 km/hr and can accelerate to 103km/hr in just three seconds. Seeing a cheetah stealthily stalk, then pursue, a gazelle, springbok or an impala is a thrilling sight.

2. Lioness Kill

See the circle of life play out in Masai Mara National Reserve. Lions might be the kings of the jungle, but in Kenya, it's the lionesses that do the hunting. Working in groups, these big cats track down prey such as wildebeest, impalas, zebras and buffalo. If you are lucky, you will see a kill - the lionesses hunting together, encircling a herd then targeting the closest animal. The attack is swift and powerful - an experience you will never forget!

3. Wildebeest Migration

The annual migration of 1.5 million wildebeest across the grassy plains of Eastern Africa is an extraordinary spectacle of nature. The wildebeests risk drowning in rivers and attacks from big cats and crocodiles, to travel nearly 2,000 km in search of food and water. Around 200,000 zebra and 500,000 Thomson's gazelle also join this boisterous group each year, making it one of the greatest shows on earth.

4. Sea of Flamingos

See Lake Nakuru turn a shimmering sea of pink as millions of flamingos flock to feed in the shallow waters. The sheer amount of these long-legged creatures - among 400 species of birds that inhabit the area - is an incredible sight.

5. Elephant Bath Time

Elephants love water and, despite their size, they are excellent swimmers. To cool off from the scorching African sun, they splash about in lakes, paddle in rivers and give themselves a shower using their trunks. Witnessing these gentle giants having a bath is a truly memorable experience, but don't stand too close or you'll likely get very wet.

6. Rhino Love

A baby rhino stays by its mother's side for up to five years after it is born and, during this time, mum is extremely protective of her calf. With an adult white rhino weighing up to 3,600 kg and reaching speeds of up to 50 km/h when charging, you don't want to get between a mother rhino and her baby. The best place for spotting the rare black rhino is Kenya's Aberdare National Park.

7. Giraffe Parade

It's the classic African image – giraffes striding across the African savanna at sunset, nibbling on acacia trees and carving a graceful silhouette on the orange-tinged skyline. Kenya has the biggest giraffe population on the continent, so a dusk safari to see these unique creatures is a must.

8. Hippos Wallowing

One of Africa's best locations for hippo spotting is Lake Naivasha. Here, you can see large pods of these mighty animals submerged in the water and wallowing in mud. More than just social interaction, the water helps them cool down and protects their skin from drying out. With the exception of feeding, hippos spend most of their lives in the water - from childbirth and reproduction, to fighting with other hippos - so it's very likely you'll see them playing in their aquatic playground.

9. Zebra Crossing

For many, the highlight of the annual zebra migration is hundreds of thousands of these black-and-white-striped animals making the death-defying dash across the Mara River. Vulnerable to massive crocodiles lying in wait for a tasty meal, the zebras don't waste any time once they decide to take the plunge.

10. Monkey Business

That chatter from treetops above is most likely from cheeky colobus monkeys. As these creatures spend nearly all of their lives in the forest canopy, your best chance of spotting them is as they dart through the trees, a flurry of black and white fur. Treating branches like trampolines, they leap high into the air, then drop downward, using the long hair on their shoulders like a parachute. Listen out for males, whose croaking roars can often be heard resonating throughout the forest.








Shopping






×

Shopping




From the large, lively markets of Nairobi to the small, slow-paced markets of the villages, shopping in Kenya is definitely "market-centric". Nairobi and other large cities have a range of boutiques and malls but, as in most other African countries, the buzzing markets are some of the best places to shop, eat and mingle with locals.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to import certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand for example have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Kenya

1. Handicrafts

The wood and soap stone carvings in Kenya are of great quality. Peruse the carvings at city markets and shops, or alternatively, buy direct from artisans in countryside villages.

2. Maasai Jewellery

The colourful beaded creations of the Maasai make excellent souvenirs. Wear them as a bold, statement piece or hang them on walls at home as a unique reminder of your time in Kenya.

3. Fabric

Kenyan markets are full of vibrant fabric sarongs and wraps (also known as kikoys or kangas). Put these on your shopping list as they offer great protection from the African sun.

4. Kenyan Music

Reggae, afro-rap and African hip-hop are popular (especially in Kenya’s big cities), so stock up on some local music to bring a bit of Kenyan rhythm home with you.

Festivals and Events in Kenya




Jamhuri Day

Feasts, speeches, parades, music and dance all feature in this national holiday commemorating Kenya’s independence and the establishment of its republic. A mass celebration of freedom and unity, this is a big day for all Kenyan people. The day is celebrated on 12th December each year.

Maulidi

The birthday of the Prophet Mohammed turns Kenya’s Lamu Island from a sleepy village into a busy hub of activity. Pilgrims and visitors flock here for four days of devotional prayers and reverence, concluding with fun events such as donkey races, dhow sailing, traditional dance and drumming.

Visas can be obtained either on arrival in to Kenya or as an e-Visa online prior to travel. Single-entry visas (business or tourism) are USD50 and a transit visa (valid for three days) USD20. The single entry visa allows for multiple entries in to Kenya for a period of 90 days provided you have not left East Africa. The four-step e-Visa procedure is completed through the immigration website:
www.ecitizen.go.ke
and requires visitors to submit an application form and passport-sized photo. e-Visas can take around seven working days to process. Visitors will then be required to present their printed e-Visa upon entry to Kenya.

**IMPORTANT** If you are travelling on one of our itineraries that re-enters Kenya, you will need to take multiple copies of your e-Visa - one to present at each border crossing.







Is tipping customary in Kenya?









Tipping isn’t mandatory in Kenya but a little generosity will be received positively, especially considering the low wages that Kenyan service workers are typically paid. Setting aside a small amount for porters, guides and drivers is wise, as is leaving spare change at restaurants.







What is the internet access like in Kenya?









Travellers will be able to access the internet quite easily in the internet cafes of Kenya’s large cities, but should expect limited or no access in regional and rural areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Kenya?









Mobile phone coverage is good in Kenya’s large cities and towns, but less so in rural and mountainous areas. Ensure you have global roaming activated before leaving home if you wish to use your mobile phone.







What are the toilets like in Kenya?









Squat/pit toilets are the standard in Kenya, except for western-style flushable toilets that are sometimes available in large hotels and other modern buildings. Carry your own supply of soap and toilet paper, as this is rarely provided.







What will it cost for a…?









Street food (plate of stew) = 80 KES
Bottle of beer in a local bar = 150 KES
Food court or fast-food meal = 300-400 KES
Meal at a sit-down restaurant = 700-800 KES







Can I drink the water in Kenya?









Drinking tap water isn't recommended in Kenya. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water. Ask your leader where filtered water can be found; some hotels we stay in may have drinking water available. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and to peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Kenya?









Credit cards are usually accepted by large hotels and western-style restaurants but not by smaller vendors. Ensure you have adequate cash to cover purchases not able to be made on credit.







What is ATM access like in Kenya?









ATMs are easily found in large cities and tourist areas like Nairobi and Mombasa, but are rarer in small towns, rural areas and villages. Be sure to have other payment methods available when venturing out of the big cities, as ATMs aren't always an option.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Kenya?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Kenya

1. Be considerate of Kenya’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

3. Help protect endangered species by choosing not to buy ivory, coral or animal products.

4. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

5. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

6. When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

7. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it – simple greetings will help break the ice.

8. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

9. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

10. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

11. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.

12. Be aware that many coastal communities in Kenya are quite conservative. Beach attire, when swimming, is fine but topless sunbathing isn't. Don’t forget to cover up when leaving the beach and entering towns or urban areas.
