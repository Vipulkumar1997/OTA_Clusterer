Expedition trips: Brand new off-map adventures













Home

Themes

Expeditions




The way we see it, there are adventures, and then there are
Adventures
. The kind where you trek deep into the Congo jungle in search of gorillas or
meet warrior tribes in far east India
. Stuff you don’t find in your typical travel brochure. For us, adventures like this are at the heart of what it means to
be
Intrepid: something original, unexpected, and as far from ‘the usual’ as you’re going to get.

This year we’ve pulled out all the stops. We’ve turned the world upside down and shaken it until all the cool stuff falls out: stuff like a groundbreaking food expedition through
Armenia and Georgia
, trekking in Patagonia and
camping with Berber people in the Atlas Mountains
.

Welcome to our exclusive Expedition trips for 2018 and 2019. Wave goodbye to that beaten path.

Expedition highlights in 2018










Meet the Nenet tribe of Russia

Eking out a living on the edge of the Siberian wilderness, Nenet reindeer herders lead a rustic existence far from modern Russia. For the first time, this nomadic tribe is inviting travellers into their home to experience their way of life. Travel from St Petersburg to Salekhard and be hosted in traditional yurt huts, sweat it out in a
Russian
banya and try your hand fishing on the banks of Horomdo Lake.

Camp out in Patagonia

Curling south towards Antarctica, Patagonia is one of the few remaining tracts of unspoiled wildlife on Earth. Discover sprawling glaciers, mountains and wild pastures on a special expedition through Argentina and Chile, including visits to Tronador Volcano and Todos los Santos Lake. While you’ll spend days trekking through incredible landscapes, you’ll also camp on the homestead of a 200-year-old house and soothe your feet in natural thermal pools found deep in the Patagonian forest.

Plate up in the Caucasus

Italy, France and Greece might hog the gastronomic spotlight in Europe, but look a little further afield and you’ll find
Armenia
and
Georgia
can more than hold their own. Journey from Yerevan to Tbilisi and discover the centuries-old recipes that continue to thrive in this corner of Eastern Europe, with the opportunity to get hands on making Georgian dumplings and khachapuri (cheese-filled bread). With included visits to brandy distilleries, wineries and meals in family homes, this is an expedition crafted for adventurous foodies.

Journey to India’s edge

Everyone knows about the colourful chaos of Mumbai and New Delhi, but few visit the outer reaches of India’s wetlands and mountains. Climb aboard a steam-powered train for a captivating ride through the Himalayas, stopping to track one-horned rhinos through Kaziranga National Park, meet warrior tribes in Nagaland, and pay homage to Tibetan Buddhists in cliff-side villages. Beginning and ending in Kolkata, this is a unique opportunity to explore West Bengal.

Expedition Djibouti - Footsteps of the Afar,
November 2017

Shane Edwards

The Djibouti trip was fantastic. Spectacular sights and friendly people. It's a laid back place and a few words of Afar always elicits a smile.

Expedition Djibouti - Footsteps of the Afar,
November 2017

Stephanie Obst

This trip is not fot the faint-hearted, but if you have a sense of adventure you'll love it (unless you don't like rough desert landscapes).

Tamang Heritage & Langtang Valley Trek,
November 2017
