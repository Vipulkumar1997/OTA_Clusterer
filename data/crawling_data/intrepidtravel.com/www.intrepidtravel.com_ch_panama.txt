Central America

Panama



Home to one of the world's most exceptional modern engineering marvels, Panama invokes historic nostalgia.


Yet there's more to this nation in
Central America
than the mighty Panama Canal, and travellers lucky enough to end up in Panama will be delightfully surprised by the uncrowded beaches, sensational surf breaks, magical rainforests and splendid colonial towns. It's high time the world's wanderers added Panama to their adventure agendas.

Best time to visit Panama






×

Best time to visit Panama




Most of Panama revels in a tropical climate with year-round high temperatures and humidity. Travellers tend to visit during the dry season from around mid-December to mid-April, as the wet season (from May to November) usually results in sudden, frequent downpours mixed with bursts of sunshine. As with most other countries, the weather is cooler at high altitudes and much warmer in the lowlands.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean, Panama shares land borders with
Colombia
and
Costa Rica
. With a typical tropical climate and environment, Panama has an abundance of rainforest, jungle, mangroves, islands, beaches and natural harbours. With around 500 rivers flowing through Panama, this Central American land - full of biodiversity - also has mountain ranges that dramatically cut through the mainland. Though many of Panama's mountains have volcanic origins, most are considered dormant and pose no threat to residents.








Top 5 Beach Spots of Panama

Top 5 Beach Spots of Panama



Top 5 Brilliant Beach Spots of Panama

1. Starfish Beach

This small beach in the stunning Bocas del Toro area is named for the hundreds of vibrant starfish that live here year round. A walk along the peaceful shore will reveal colonies of huge orange and red starfish lurking quietly beneath the water.

2. Zapatillas Cays

Another of Bocas del Toro's beauties, these two postcard-worthy islands are home to seriously stunning beaches with crystalline water, powdery white sand and coral reefs teeming with turtles and fish.

3. Isla Coiba

This rugged, Pacific coast nature reserve is rich in an incredible range of species, making it a wonderful place for divers and snorkellers out to spot a host of creatures. Marlin, swordfish, groupers, rays, sharks and eels can all be found within the coral reefs surrounding the area, and the clear water only makes spying them all the easier.

4. Playa Chiquita

This rough and remote wonder located on the Caribbean Coast is one of Panama's best kept secrets. Its isolated location means it's a little difficult to get to, but the tranquillity, space and natural beauty make the journey worthwhile. Don't expect beach bars and boutiques - just long stretches of sand with few people in sight. Beach bliss!

5. Isla Grande

This laidback Caribbean island offers an authentic slice of Caribbean life for those wishing to escape the more frequented tourist spots. Featuring beaches speckled with leaves and palm fronds, and small shacks selling fruity cocktails and fresh beers, this haven hand delivers relaxation Caribbean-style.

Top responsible travel tips for Panama

Be considerate of Panama’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
