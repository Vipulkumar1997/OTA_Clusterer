Philippine Discovery,
May 2017

Bee Wan

Intrepid Travel involved traveller's participation. Small group tour does not involve time wasted in waiting but still certain destinations involved a lot of time and difficulties in getting there.  One must bear this in mind.  If you expect luxuries, forget about it.

Best time to visit Philippines

Best time to visit Philippines




With a year-round warm climate, expect hot weather when visiting the Philippines at any time of the year. Sea breezes prevail in the coastal regions between November and February, so travel during this time if you wish to take the edge off the heat. January to May are considered the optimum times to visit though, as it is best to avoid the typhoon season which runs from July to October and involves heavy rain, flooding and high winds.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Consisting of more than 7,000 islands, the Philippines archipelago is located in the South-East of
Asia
, in between the South China Sea and the Philippine Sea. Being a part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, the Philippines is home to many active volcanoes and a staggering amount of biodiversity, with thousands of plant, mammal, fish and bird species living on land and in the sea. As a very mountainous country, the Philippines is dotted with numerous peaks, which give way to deep valleys that are often studded with rivers and streams. Tropical rainforest occupies much of the landmass, with most of the population living on the low lying coastal areas.








Fun Festivals of the Philippines

Fun Festivals of the Philippines




Top 5 Fun Festivals of the Philippines

1. Ati-Atihan

With a history that dates all the way back to 1210, this flamboyant festival is considered one of the Philippines' best. Think massive ostentatious costumes, loud drumming, floats of parading dancers, riotous crowds and a healthy dose of partying and you've got Ati-Atihan - the Philippines' best shot at Rio Carnaval.

2. Grand Cordillera Festival

Baguio reserves the fourth last week of November to celebrate life and local culture with ethnic songs, dance, costume and food. This festival spreads peace and tolerance and provides an interesting snapshot of the lives of the ethnic people of the northern Luzon area.

3. Dinagyang

Iloilo City gets its chance to party with its own version of Ati-Atihan. City streets are decked out with colourful banners, street stalls sizzle with barbecued pork, and chicken and costumed dancers compete for glory.

4. Feast of Our Lady of Candles

This annual display of epic religious pageantry features a procession of the patroness, fiesta queen and court through the streets and town centre of Jaro. Locals carry candles and a statue of the Virgin Mary to the town cathedral, where crowds of people wait. This spirited and vibrant festival is a great introduction to Filipino culture and religious celebration.

5. Obando Fertility Festival

Want to see couples dance through the streets in aid of hopefully producing a child? Each year, the town of Bulacan holds this festival for childless couples who wish to produce children. Couples dance down the street to the local church, dance up the aisle and attend mass in honour of the three local patron saints.

Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in the Philippines?









Mobile phone receptivity is at a high rate in the large cities, but coverage may be patchy or less reliable in mountainous places, remote areas and on some islands. Ensure global roaming is activated before leaving home.







What are the toilets like in the Philippines?









You'll have to adjust to different standards of hygiene and sanitation whilst in the Philippines. The standard toilet is of the squat variety and this may take some getting used to although Western style toilets can be found in large hotels and some tourist areas.







What will it cost for a…?









Juice from a market stall = 10 pesos
Bottle of beer = 30-60 pesos
Basic lunch = 100-200 pesos
Sit-down dinner = 500-900 pesos







Can I drink the water in the Philippines?









Drinking tap water isn't recommended in the Philippines. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water. Ask your leader where filtered water can be found, some hotels we stay in may have drinking water available. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating







Are credit cards accepted widely in the Philippines?









Credit cards are usually accepted by large hotels, restaurants, shops and tourist-orientated retailers, but less so by smaller vendors like small, family-run restaurants, market stalls and guesthouses. Be sure to carry enough cash to cover small purchases as credit cards may not always be accepted.







What is ATM access like in the Philippines?









Travellers will be able to find ATMs that accept foreign cards in the large cities but less so in remote towns and rural areas. Be sure to have enough cash before leaving the city as ATMs may not always be available outside of metropolitan areas.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in the Philippines?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.
