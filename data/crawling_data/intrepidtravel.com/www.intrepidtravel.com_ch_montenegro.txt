Montenegro



Boasting a stunning stretch of Mediterranean coastline, gorgeous tucked-away mountain hamlets and charming small-town affability


It probably comes as no surprise that Montenegro is rapidly emerging as one of the world’s fastest-growing tourist destinations. Hit buzzing Budva during the two-month summer season and you’ll likely be beggared by the antics of Eastern Europe’s well-heeled pleasure seekers, yet venture beyond the glitz and be rightly rewarded with pristine natural landscapes and rustic towns oozing old-Europe charm. Subtle but seductive, stylish and schmick, this new kid on the Balkans block is fast moving to the top of its class.

Best time to visit Montenegro

Best time to visit Montenegro




Party to both Mediterranean summers and Balkan winters, the question of when to visit Montenegro really depends on what you’re after. The months of July and August, referred to locally - and somewhat dramatically - as ‘the Season’ sees coastal tourism at full-throttle with beaches, hotels and restaurants packed out by Europe’s summer sun seekers. As a result, either side of this period is the best time for a visit - with May, June, September and October still enjoying balmy days, pleasant evenings and warm waters. November through to April is the winter period when inland temperature can drop to below freezing, but it also marks the opening of the country’s ski runs and the coast can present a scenic - and quiet - getaway for the less adventurous.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Montenegro’s slim 294km-long coastline quickly develops into inland plains before rising to forested mountain peaks - some of Europe’s most rugged - along the country’s borders with
Serbia
and
Albania
.








Top 5 Creatures in Montenegro

Top 5 Creatures in Montenegro



1. Bears

Fairytale and soft-toy enthusiasts will be thrilled to learn that Montenegro is home to a stable population of European brown bears. Eternally vying with its polar cousin for the uber-cool title of ‘world’s largest land-based predator’, you may not like to encounter one unexpectedly (extremely unlikely), but it’s fun to know that they’re plodding about somewhere not too far off.

2. Wolves

As the most widely distributed large mammal on the planet, it’s probably not overly surprising to hear that the country boasting Europe’s highest index of species per area unit should also have its share of grey wolves – even if the government has made it legal to hunt them.

3. Otters

Much like the tourists who descend on the country’s beaches during July and August, these curious and cheeky critters can sometimes be spotted breaching the surface of Montenegro’s freshwater lakes or basking by their shores. So well liked are these little guys that in 2011, the Montenegrin Ministry of Culture launched ‘Otter Fest 2011’: a festival promoting the development of Skadar Lake’s local communities, which draws attention to its endangered otter population.

4. Lynx

Probably the fluffiest of Montenegro’s wildlife, but with a dwindling population thought to be less than 100 due to illegal poaching, the Balkan lynx is only very rarely spotted in the remote mountainous region of the country’s east.

5. Golden Eagles

Proudly emblazoned on the country’s flag, the majestic golden eagle is sometimes spied scouring its skies. One of the best-known birds of prey, it’s certainly one of the most powerful hunters, with reported sightings of sheep and goats being snatched up, and one confirmed account of a brown bear cub being carried off!

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Montenegro

1. Be considerate of Montenegrin customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Montenegro has some of the purest water in Europe.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

5. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive and supports the local community.

6. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
