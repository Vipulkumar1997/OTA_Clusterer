Transport in Colombia

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Colombia, you may find yourself travelling by:







Local bus

Rub shoulders with locals while travelling on a local bus – it’s a great way to mix with different crowds and a cheap way to get around.

Accommodation in Colombia

When travelling with us in Colombia you may find yourself staying in a:







Hacienda

Sleeping in a hammock while staying at a traditional hacienda is an authentic treat for travellers who are happy to forego a mattress for a few days in favour of a real life experience.

Best time to visit Colombia






×

Best time to visit Colombia




There is always a good time to visit Colombia, as the seasons vary throughout the country. While the climate generally remains constant throughout the year, the temperature can change depending on where you are. In the far north, the climate is usually tropical, warm and humid; while central Colombia can get quite cool - Bogota is known for its mild temperatures, particularly at night.

The wet season is roughly from March to May and September to November, although this varies around the country. December to March is the peak travel period due to the dry conditions and holidays and festivals that proliferate across the country. During this time, expect more sunshine, but also more people competing for space in the cities and tourist regions.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Colombian culture tends to revolve around the Four F’s: Festivals, Food, Fun and Family. While this bold and beautiful nation loves to party, it’s also a very traditional, family-centred society, with many Colombians choosing to live near their families and remain at home until marriage. With most Colombians being Catholic, religion plays an important part in daily life, and visitors will be able to see this themselves while travelling through Colombia. Hundreds of churches and cathedrals populate the large cities, while smaller chapels are dotted throughout the villages and rural areas. Religious festivals like Easter and Christmas are celebrated with gusto – after quiet times of reverence come the massive street parties, parades and feasts. A variety of cultural influences collide at these events - Spanish, African and Caribbean customs and traditions have been brought to Colombia over the centuries and shaped its vibrant culture.

The hallmarks and customs of daily life vary from region to region, with Bogota’s upwardly mobile citizens enjoying bars, driving cars and having access to a wide range of technology, cuisine and media. Colombia’s rural-dwellers (subsistence farmers, plantation workers and tribal groups) live a more simple existence in rustic housing and without traffic or the stresses of modern life. What unifies most Colombians though, regardless of living conditions or class, is a fierce love of Colombia, respect for God and loyalty to the family unit.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Colombia has rich culinary traditions, quality fresh produce and loads of cosmopolitan bars, cafes, food stands and restaurants to visit. For a summary of what to eat in South America, check out
our in depth guide
.

Things to try in Colombia

1. Arepas

These popular thick corn tortillas can be found almost everywhere in Colombia. Baked or fried, with beef, cheese, pork, chicken or beans, they make the perfect breakfast or afternoon snack.

2. Bandeja Paisa

Originating from the Andean region of Colombia, this dish is a staple of most Colombian diets. Consisting of a plate of rice, beans, avocado, fried egg, chorizo and other meats, it’s a filling feast fit for a king!

3. Ajiaco Bogotano

This hearty chicken stew is a Bogota specialty. Packed with succulent chicken meat, corn, potatoes and herbs, it’s a tasty and satisfying budget meal.

4. Tropical Fruit

Colombia is known for having some of the best fresh produce in the world. Bananas and plantains are among the best, and you’ll be able to find street vendors selling them fresh, fried and grilled. Fruit shakes are also widely available and offer travellers a chance to sample some exotic fruits that they may not have tried before.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Located in the northwest of South America, Colombia shares borders with
Venezuela
,
Brazil
,
Peru
,
Ecuador
and Panama, and is the only South American country to have a coastline on both the Pacific and the Caribbean. Home to a wide variety of natural environments and varying terrain, travellers can expect to see mountains give way to low lying plains and tropical rainforests meet balmy beaches. Add sprawling metropolises, small farming communities, far-reaching plantations, fishing villages and colonial-era towns, and you’ve got an ever-changing landscape at your fingertips.








History and government

History and government




Early History

The area now known as Colombia was inhabited by Caribbean and Andean groups who lived in small communities based on organised agriculture. Spanish explorers were drawn to the land and fascinated by the proliferation of gold. The myth of El Dorado soon abounded, and the search for this land of gold soon became an obsession. From the creation of Santa Marta in 1525, colonisation spread rapidly throughout the rest of the country, leading to interest from neighbouring countries that were also keen to exploit Colombia’s natural resources. Many Africans soon started to arrive as a part of the slave trade, and provided a much-needed labour force for the colonisers. Life was tough for the slaves; however, African song, dance and other afro-traditions helped to shape Colombian culture well into the future.

Recent History

Independence from Spain rose to the top of Colombia’s agenda after years of resentment. Simon Bolivar soon became a local hero, fighting for independence from the Spaniards. It took many years but in 1819, Colombia was granted its freedom – Bolivar had fought his way into the minds and hearts of Colombia, where he is still revered. However, this spirit of freedom was short lived as Colombia descended into confrontation and civil war in the following years. Colombia seemed to be at the mercy of political opponents and guerrilla groups, weaving between periods of peace and extreme violence. By the 1970s, Colombia had a new wave of criminal activity stemming from the lucrative cocaine trade. Pablo Escobar became one of the world’s most notorious (and wealthy) criminals by controlling most of the world’s drug trade. Colombia became a dangerous place to live (and travel in) during this period, yet has recently emerged victorious from these dark days. With vastly improved national security and a growing economy based on agriculture, textiles and mineral mining, Colombia is welcoming back tourists with open arms.








Top 10 Must-See Cities of Colombia

Top 10 Must-See Cities of Colombia




1. Medellin

What makes Medellin so magnificent? Once considered one of the most dangerous cities in the world, Medellin’s temperate weather, hospitable locals, gorgeous gardens and artistic enclaves have prevailed and this cultured city has emerged full of spirit, passion and optimism.

2. Popayan

This vibrant town may have been founded centuries ago, but nowadays Popayan has a youthful spirit due to the local university that attracts thousands of young Colombians to the region. Home to many of Colombia’s most celebrated poets, composers and painters, Popayan also has some of the most stirring Easter celebrations in the world.

3. Cali

Known locally at the ‘Capital of Heaven’, Cali’s museums and public art may dazzle you, but it’s the up and coming food and party scene that’s getting loads of attention. With modern restaurants serving international cuisine, local eateries offering traditional fare, lively salsa bars open until dawn and a fair worth travelling for in late December, Cali shouldn’t be missed!

4. Barichara

Less of a city and more of a colonial town, the faded charm of rustic Barichara has been endearing travellers for centuries. Coloured, whitewashed buildings with carved wooden doors and red roofs, quaint little churches and hilly streets make Barichara the perfect place to linger for a few days of quiet downtime.

5. Bogota

Colombia’s sprawling capital is a frenetic fusion of old and new, with skyscrapers towering over colonial buildings, wild traffic giving way to peaceful parks and cobblestone streets leading to bohemian night spots. With so much going on, you’ll be exhausted trying keep up with Bogota’s pace.

6. Tunja

Lofty Tunja’s historic architecture, spiritual sites and lively festivals make it an interesting destination for travellers from all walks of life. Whether you’re interested in magnificent art, colonial-era architecture or cultural enlightenment, Tunja delivers on all accounts.

7. Cartagena

Surrounded by walls built to guard against pirates, Cartagena captivates travellers with colonial mansions, cobbled streets, Spanish-style houses and brightly coloured buildings. History seems to drip from every street corner, especially when Cartagena takes on a golden glow by night.

8. Pamplona

Although one of Colombia’s less-visited spots, cultured Pamplona is well worth checking out. With a wealth of museums, galleries and churches nestled within its narrow streets and rousing Holy Week celebrations, Pamplona offers a peak into Colombian traditions and daily life.

9. Santa Marta

Seaside Santa Marta attracts flocks of tourists chasing sunshine, scuba diving and seafood. With beautiful beaches, atmospheric bars, chilled-out open-air cafes and heritage sites, Santa Marta should feature on every travellers list.

10. San Gil

This small city is emerging as one of Colombia’s hottest new destinations, mainly due to the plethora of adventure sports on offer in the surrounding areas. Test your limits with paragliding, caving, rafting and kayaking, and then relax in the pleasant botanical gardens and cafes of sunny San Gil.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Travellers might visit Colombia for the adrenalin sports, nature reserves and beaches, however retail therapy should also be included in that list, as Colombia’s shopping is surprisingly sensational.

It’s a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Colombia

1. Jewellery, Art & Handicrafts

Some of the best artisans in South America live in Colombia. Choose from handcrafted gold jewellery, bright textile bags and scarves, and vibrant contemporary art available in galleries, markets and boutiques all over the country.

2. Fashion & Accessories

Colombia’s more cosmopolitan cities have enough fashion-forward boutiques and malls to keep most clothes-hounds happy. Medellin in particular is well known for being Colombia’s fashion capital, and is a true hotspot in the Latin American fashion world.

3. Coffee Beans

As one of the world’s largest producers of coffee beans, Colombia is a great place to pick up top quality beans at lower prices than back at home. Buying straight from the coffee regions ensures quality and freshness.








Festivals and events in Colombia

Festivals and events in Colombia




Carnival of Barranquilla

With a slogan like “Who lives it, is who enjoys it”, Barranquilla’s Carnival is not one for the shrinking violets! One of the biggest and boldest carnivals in the world, travellers should relish the chance to get involved in this rich cultural celebration full of absurd costumes, frenetic dance, masked entertainers, deafening music and intense partying.

Cali Fair

Colombia’s capital of salsa springs to life late in the year with this happy celebration. Although salsa dance and music are the hallmarks of this fair, there’s also horseback riding, parades, concerts and feasts of traditional food to be enjoyed during this joyful celebration.

Medellin Flower Fair

See magical Medellin in full bloom every August, when this enchanting city’s balconies, gardens, terraces and courtyards burst into a symphony of floral wonders. With live music, classic cars, beauty pageants, dog shows, afro-inspired dance and flower exhibitions all competing for attention during this traditional festival, this is Medellin at its very best.
