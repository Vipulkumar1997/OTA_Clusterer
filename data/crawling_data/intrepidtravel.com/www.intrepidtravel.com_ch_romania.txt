Romania



A place of mythic legends and dark tales, modern-day Romania impresses with its fine collection of ancient monasteries, age-old churches and character-filled castles.


But it's the unexpected delights that also shine bright. Majestic mountains, forests made for hiking, a sophisticated capital brimming with architectural beauty and chic coastal resorts ensure Romania has plenty of aces up its sleeve.

Best time to visit Romania

Best time to visit Romania




July and August are the busiest months for tourists all over Europe because the weather is at its warmest. May and June are some of the best months to visit Romania, followed by September and early October as the weather is usually fine and the sites are less crowded than during peak season. Spring and autumn are considered optimal times for birdwatching in the Danube Delta. Romania has harsh winters, with most tourists choosing to travel to the ski resorts. Snow lingers as late as mid-May, and the hiking season doesn't begin in earnest until June. The resorts along the Black Sea coast get busy in late June and stay packed until mid-August. It tends to rain more in March, April, October and November.

Geography and environment




Bordered by

,

,

,

and
Moldova
, Romania also has a stretch of coastline along the Black Sea. Much of Romania's terrain is mountainous with the Carpathian Mountains and Transylvanian Alps occupying parts of the central and northern regions. Home to a large number of glacial and karstic lakes, rivers and lagoons, Romania's splendid scenery will take many by surprise. Considerable amounts of arable land, orchards, vineyards, rural pastures and farmland are significant features of Romania's countryside.








Top 5 Classic Castles of Romania

Top 5 Classic Castles of Romania




1. Bran Castle

Possibly Romania's best known castle, Transylvania's Bran Castle is linked to the legend of Dracula, although somewhat tenuously. Regardless, tourists flock in to see the heritage art, historic treasures and secret passages that all good castles are made of. A short trip from Brasov, this interesting attraction should be high on every traveller's list.

2. Hunyad Castle

Watch towers? Check. Drawbridge? Check. Dark History? Check. Hunyad Castle has all the classic hallmarks of a typical European castle. Once the prison of notorious Vlad the Impaler, Hunyad Castle's unique Gothic-Renaissance style is a result of extensive restoration after years of neglect.

3. Fagaras Castle

This ancient fortress and castle may lack the opulence of others, but is worthy of admiration for its enduring powers. Still surrounded by the moat which protected it for centuries, Fagaras Castle is a wonderful example of effective fortification - with enormous walls and towers built to withstand war and invasion.

4. Peles Castle

Nestled within the Carpathian Mountains, this gorgeous castle straight out of a fairytale is the perfect example of palatial bliss. With 30 bathrooms, an impressive collection of fine art, an extensive armour collection, manicured gardens, marble fireplaces and imposing statues, Peles Castle is one of Romania's grandest.

5. Pelisor Castle

Located within the Peles Castle complex, this castle is most famous for its decadent room made of gilded gold. Featuring Art Nouveau-style furnishings and art, plush interiors and an oak panelled lobby, Pelisor Castle certainly works its old-world charm.

Romania travel FAQs





Is tipping customary in Romania?









Tipping is expected by service workers who generally earn low wages and rely on tips for their livelihood. A tip of around 10% is sufficient for taxi drivers, wait and hotel staff but feel free to tip more for good service.







What is the internet access like in Romania?









Travellers will be able to access the internet at cyber cafes and hotels in Romania's cities. Regional and rural areas may have less internet access but, overall, Romania is well connected to the web.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Romania?









Mobile phone coverage is good in most parts of Romania but mountainous and remote areas may have patchy coverage. Be sure to activate global roaming on your phone before leaving home if you wish to use your mobile.







What are the toilets like in Romania?









Most toilets in Romania are of the flushable variety. Public toilets are quite scarce in Romania and expect to pay a small fee when visiting one, as is standard practice in many other European countries.







What will it cost for a…?









Local transport ticket = 1.50-2 RON
Glass of local beer = 2-5 RON
Cup of coffee = 5-6 RON
Bottle of imported beer = 5-8 RON
Simple lunch in a cafe = 20 RON
Dinner at a nice restaurant = 40-50 RON







Can I drink the water in Romania?









The tap water in Romania is considered safe to drink in most parts of the country unless otherwise marked. Ask your leader if you're unsure of the water quality of the region you're travelling in.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Romania?









Major credit cards are usually accepted by large hotels, restaurants, boutiques and shops. Smaller retailers like family-run restaurants, market stalls and small shops may not accept credit cards so always carry enough cash to cover smaller purchases.







What is ATM access like in Romania?









Travellers will be able to find ATMs throughout most of Romania, especially in large cities and tourist areas.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Romania?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Romania

1. Be considerate of Romania’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

5. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

6. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

8. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
