Guinea Bissau



Remote and untouched are two words that would beautifully describe Guinea-Bissau.


These words would apply to the country’s incredible forests, unspoilt beaches and remarkable wildlife. Throw in the words uber-friendly, genuine, chilled-out and unique, and you have the impressive country of Guinea Bissau described to a tee.

Best time to visit Guinea-bissau

Best time to visit Guinea-bissau



Guinea-Bissau has two main seasons: wet and dry. From June to October expect heavy rains and hot steamy weather. To escape the heat, simply head inland and uphill. The dry season is the best time to visit - it’s still hot but low humidity makes the temperature feel milder. The downside is that the dusty harmattan winds blow at this time of year.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment



Guinea-Bissau shares a beautiful Atlantic coastline with its neighbours Senegal and Guinea. Just off the coast are the stunning white-sand beaches of the Bijagos Islands. Further inland mangroves, rivers and swamps give way to forests and mountains.

Top 5 Treats of Guinea-Bissau



Top 5 Culinary Treats of Guinea-Bissau

1. Jollof

The staple meal of Bissau-Guineans is rice cooked with peanut oil and mixed with tomatoes, onions, peppers and chicken or fish.

2. Groundnut Soup

A moreish blend of peanuts, chicken, garlic, ginger and peppers.

3. Warga

Join the locals for a cup of this sweet green tea, a daily treat that can’t be missed.

4. Cashew Rum

Brewed from Guinea-Bissau’s main crop, this is one spirit with serious nut-appeal.

5. Palm Wine

This local wine can be deceptively strong – drink with caution!

Top responsible travel tips for Guinea-bissau

Be considerate of Guinea-Bissau’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
