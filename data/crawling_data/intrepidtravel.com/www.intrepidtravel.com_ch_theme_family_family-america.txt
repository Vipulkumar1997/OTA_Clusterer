Americas family tours




Stretching from the glacial lakes and boreal forests of Canada to the windswept wilds of Patagonia, the Americas are all about family Adventure with a capital A. Travelling with the kids to the lost city of Machu Picchu, snorkelling together over Cuban atolls, zip-lining through the cloud forests of Costa Rica or hiking glaciers in Alberta – anything’s possible when it comes to the world’s most colourful continents. Our trips in North, Central and South America are geared towards natural exploration and cultural immersion. Think of them as the cure for couch potatoes.

Accommodation in the Americas

From quality hotels in Costa Rica to camping along the Inca Trail, we always look to strike the right balance between comfort and authenticity. We want to make it fun and give you a cultural insight, but not at the expense of a comfortable holiday. In the Galapagos, we find it’s better to stay on land, rather than a boat (lots of extra space for the kids to run around). In Cuba we like to use a mix of Cuban hotels and traditional guesthouses (known as Casa Particulares).








A taste of what's in store..

Each of Intrepid's family trips has been built with a smooth blend of action-packed activities and flexible family time, just the way we like it. Want to know the sort of adventures you can expect with us? We’ve picked out a few of our favourites.











Venture into the Peruvian Amazon

From the coastal city of Lima we’ll fly you to the small jungle outpost of Puerto Maldonado, right on the edge of the Peruvian Amazon. From there you’ll head upriver with local guides into the heart of the forest. It’s a side of Peru not many outsiders get to see.

Peru Family adventure











Walk through the canopy of the Monteverde Cloud Forest

The cloud forests of Costa Rica are regarded as one of the natural highlights of Central America. This is coffee country – a cool, mist-soaked forest where resplendent quetzal birds sing in the trees and visitors can walk from tree to tree on specially built canopy platforms.

Costa Rica Family holiday











Hunt for buried treasure on Ilha Grande

Brazil’s tropical island Ilha Grande has a reputation as a bit of an old pirate haunt. But even if your search for buried treasure comes up empty, there are still plenty of jungle trails to explore, turquoise lagoons to snorkel and beaches to wander. Paradise never looked so good.











Stay on a working ranch in Wells Gray Provincial Park

Wells Gray is one of British Columbia’s underrated gems. We’ll set up home base at a working horse ranch and head out to explore the park’s backcountry trails, rivers, lakes and waterfalls, including Helmcken Falls, the fourth highest in Canada (and our personal favourite).

Galapagos Family Holiday,
November 2017

Ansel Edidi

Pack lightly.  Clothes dry quickly.  Walking stick is helpful for walking on lava rock trails.  Nice that Ecuador uses US currency.   Travel between islands is by smaller boat and can be rough.

Peru Family Trek - Teens on the Trail ,
September 2017

Cindy Scott

Teens on the trail was our first ever organised trip and first with Intrepid. It is overall a great concept, however there could be some more thought around what teens are really going to be interested in doing and seeing. Maybe some more down time either side of the trek and mountain biking would be good. Overall, a fantastic experience and worth doing.

Galapagos Family Holiday,

Jodie Johnston

Professional, well organised tours from start to finish. We were always in good hands with intrepid while still able to immerse in the local culture.

Peru Family Adventure,
September 2017

rohan fernando

Travelling in Peru is challenging. I would recommend any Australian family who cannot speak Spanish should travel with Intrepid. 
Intrepid provides a local guide who will ensure  travellers get transportation to the must see sites, stay at the safest hotels and use restaurants that serve healthy food. Without local knowledge getting the right transport to places, or finding a comfortable hotel becomes a hassle. Our Intrepid Guide, Alejandrina Vega, was outstanding for the entire trip: and made sure everyone in the group saw the best parts of Peru, ate at the healthiest restaurants and looked after us when we suffered from Altitude sickness. She really loves Peru, and was proud to show us the best parts of her great country. 
I believe the Intrepid family trip to Peru is great value for money considering you visit  Lima, the Amazon, Cusco,  Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu and much more.

Peru Family Adventure,
August 2017

Maria Gibbins

Wonderful and varied family tour of Peru.  We had never done a tour before, but would certainly recommend Intrepid.  Our guide Norma was amazing; well organised and fun - she made the trip.  I would never have dreamed we could have such a successful adventure around Peru with a 5 year old, but a well planned itinerary created specifically for families made it easy.  Would definitely use Intrepid again.  Thank you.

Costa Rica Family Holiday ,
August 2017

Nadine Storey

Fantastic trip and guide (Diego). Would just have been perfect if we had been with other families. If you are the first to book, keep calling to check before you run out of time to change your booking.
