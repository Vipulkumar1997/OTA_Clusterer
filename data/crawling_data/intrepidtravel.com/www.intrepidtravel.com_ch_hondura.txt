Central America

Honduras



If you’re after pristine beaches, a laidback lifestyle and some awesome Mayan ruins then look no further.


Honduras is resplendent with rivers, reefs, ruins and even the occasional (dormant) volcano. Explore the explosion of colour at the world’s second-largest barrier reef, cycle over hills and through banana plantations, hangout with locals over a licuado or gaze up at the swaying palms as you recharge on a perfect beach.

Best time to visit Honduras




Weather-wise, there isn't really a bad time of year to visit Honduras. The climate is tropical and while you may get rain at any time of year, even in the wet season (May to October) it tends to come in short spurts. The dry season from November to April is a popular time to visit, especially February to May when the country comes to life with festivals. Head to the mountains to escape the heat at anytime of year.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment



Honduras is a slice of tropical paradise with both Caribbean and Pacific coasts. The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef is the second-longest reef in the world and makes for stunning diving and snorkeling. It’s also home to the Bay of Islands, each with their own unique character and eco-reserves. For onshore adventure, head inland for fertile lowlands, banana plantations, slow-moving rivers and mountain ranges. Honduras shares borders with
Nicaragua
,
Guatemala
and
El Salvador
.








Top 10 Experiences in Honduras

Top 10 Experiences in Honduras



Top 10 Tropical Experiences in Honduras

1. Dive In

You can’t ask for better aquatic fun than in Honduras. Swim, dive or snorkel through turquoise waters in the company of thousands of fish, crazy coral and colourful creatures.

2. Two-Wheel Adventure

There’s plenty of adventure for landlubbers too. Hire a bicycle or scooter and head inland to explore volcanic landscapes, banana plantations and easy-going villages.

3. Rum and Rumba

Spend the evenings practicing your Spanish with the locals over a guaro (sugar cane liquor), then hit the dance floor to learn some Caribbean moves.

4. Explore Mayan Ruins

Explore Copan under the gaze of huge carved faces staring out from ancient walls. As you walk past monuments, statues and staircases it's hard not to wonder at the mysterious disappearance of such a creative civilisation.

5. Colonial Traditions

Visit churches and hang out in plazas for a very different taste of the tropics. Christian traditions introduced by the Spanish are still very strong here and Semana Santa celebrations are incredibly colourful.

6. Licuados

Cool off with a delicious fruit and milk licuado. Pick one up in any restaurant or a street stall as you explore.

7. Coconut Bread

This is a sweet treat that screams "I’m in the tropics and my tastebuds think it’s awesome!"

8. Beach Time

With all that sightseeing, drinking, eating and swimming under your belt, don’t forget to take time out to laze away on perfect white sand beaches.

9. Shopping

There are plenty of goodies in the local markets to fill up your backpack. For unusual mementos pick up woodcarvings, traditional instruments, paintings, straw hats and even cigars.

10. Go Bananas

If you’re in any doubt you’re in the tropics then grab a banana - they’re everywhere. Have a banana licuado, eat one fresh from the tree or try tajaditas (fried bananas)

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
