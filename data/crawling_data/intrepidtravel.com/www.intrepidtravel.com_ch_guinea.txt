Best time to visit Guinea






×

Best time to visit Guinea



The best time to visit Guinea is during the dry season (December to May), though the harmattan winds blow at this time of year so expect a dusty ride. Guinea is one of Africa’s wettest countries and in the wet season (June to November) rain can seriously slow travel down.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment



Guinea is one of West Africa’s most beautiful destinations. The ranges and plateaux of the Fouta Djallon highlands give ample fodder for hikers and several major rivers, including the Niger, originate in this area. The coastal plain has some mangroves and also small but lovely beaches.

Top 5 Overlanding Experiences in Guinea

1. The Camping

The beauty of camping is setting up home wherever you feel. Whether it’s out in the wilderness under millions of stars or near a village under the gaze of curious neighbours, you’ll always feel at home.

2. The Driving

Getting there is half the adventure. Whether your vehicle is throwing up clouds of dust or sprays of mud, you’re not just enjoying the landscape, you’re living every bump.

3. The Wildlife

Wake in the morning to the chatter of monkeys or gaze out of your tent at the scattering of footprints left during the night - boars, hyenas and baboons are favourite campsite visitors.

4. The Food

Fill up on fried plantains from a street stall, pick mangoes straight off the tree or shop in bustling markets for produce to cook over the camp stove.

5. The Surprises

You know you’re really overlanding when the road disappears, you get bogged or you end up in a football game with 25 local kids and a flat football.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Guinea

Be considerate of Guinea’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
