Netherlands



With a robust economy, formidable football team, rich artistic heritage and ever-progressive attitudes on… well, pretty much everything, The Netherlands punches well above its weight, even by European standards.


Idealistic and industrious, cosmopolitan and tolerant, it’s a country whose cities continue to set the world pace for all things innovative. In classic Dutch liberal-mindedness, Amsterdam’s colourful cafe culture exists right alongside The Hague’s International Criminal Court, while psychedelic poppy plantations, glistening lakes and the occasional windmill still adorn the countryside. Distinguished, distinctive and damn good fun, The Netherlands is about as impressive and irrepressible as countries come – all the more so given that it was practically built on a swamp.

Best time to visit The Netherlands




The Dutch weather can be somewhat unpredictable throughout the year so be prepared whenever you decide to visit. Most people visit between April and September when the weather is warm and the days are long, though showers are always a possibility and it's also a good idea to have a light jacket handy. You'll find smaller crowds during autumn and winter when conditions can be quite cold and wet, though temperatures rarely drop below freezing. The bulb fields near Amsterdam come into bloom from April to mid-May.

4. Stedelijk Museum

Focusing on various disciplines of modern and contemporary art, Stedelijk aims to represent all significant art and design movements of the 20th and 21st centuries through its world-class collection.

Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment



Known for its low-lying topography, large areas of The Netherlands were reclaimed from the sea and protected by dikes and seawalls, which means that 20 per cent of its land area is below sea level and more than half is no more than 1 metre high. There are slightly higher areas to the east and south in the foothills of the Ardennes. The Netherlands borders
Belgium
to the south,
Germany
to the east and has the North Sea to its north and west.
