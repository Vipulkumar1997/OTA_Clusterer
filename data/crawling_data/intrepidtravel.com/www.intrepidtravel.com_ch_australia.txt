Australia travel highlights

















The West Coast




Featuring the world’s most isolated capital city and cattle stations bigger than most European countries, the West Coast of Australia certainly feels like the Final Frontier. Perhaps visit the waterfalls and red rock gorges of Karijini National Park, take in a lazy sunset camel ride on Cable Beach, or unwind among the vineyards of the Margaret River.

The Kimberley




The Kimberley is where Western Australia really gets wild. While Broome could keep you occupied for days, it’s really the Kimberley’s natural beauty that lures you in. Cape Leveque and the Bungle Bungles are just the beginning. Away from the stretches of Cable Beach you find a region that rapidly unrolls into a world of dense rainforest, underground caves and boab-dotted horizons straight out of Africa.

Find out more









Kakadu




Kakadu National Park is packed with billabongs, waterfalls, strange rock formations and all types of native wildlife. This is where Australia runs wild. ‘Roos bounce through the bushland, dingoes are spotted along rocky outcrops, dugongs wallow off the coast and, despite the name, crocs patrol the waters of Alligator River.

Find out more









Uluru (Ayers Rock)




Even if you're not usually rocked by geology, put aside any reservations until you visit Uluru. 384 metres high, 10 kilometres in circumference, and concealing caves, cascades and rock art in its folds, this sandstone giant is at the heart of Australia in more ways than one.

Find out more











The Outback




From seemingly endless red desert to cooling pools, towering rock formations to night skies bursting with stars, there’s a whole new world to discover on our Australian Outback adventures. Experience the power of standing at the base of Uluru, hear tales of the Aboriginal Dreaming with an Indigenous guide, cross incredible scenery in a 4WD, and walk among a carpet of wildflowers in the Flinders Ranges.

Southern Ocean & The Nullarbor




At first blush this 1,600-kilometre stretch of highway might seem devoid of anything interesting. But ask those who have travelled along its dusty length and you’ll usually hear the road makes for surreal travel.

Find out more









Kangaroo Island




This mini Galapagos off the coast of South Australia is one of the country’s most beautiful and underrated wildlife sanctuaries. Grey kangaroos, fur seals, dolphins, echidnas, koalas and dozens of other species have flourished on the island without the threat of species introduced to the mainland.

Find out more









Great Ocean Road




Australia’s answer to Route 66 practically speaks for itself. The Great Ocean Road is a winding coastal route of sandstone cliffs and dense rainforest hinterland that stretches all the way from Torquay in the East to Allansford in the West. While the region is famous for its Twelve Apostles, there are plenty of local secrets to be found if you’re willing to take the time.

Tasmania




From less-than-glamorous beginnings as a penal colony island founded by the British, Tasmania has developed into one of Australia’s most treasured traveller destinations.

Australian native food

You might think the Australian Outback is an unforgiving place, but did you know it's home to thousands of edible plant species? You just need to know where to look. To make the flavours of the bush come alive, we've consulted with Aussie bush tucker specialist Andrew Fielke to create a set of special native food menus on each of our Outback and Top End trips. Now you can not only see and hear the bush, but taste it too.

Best time to visit Australia

Best time to visit Australia




Being such a large place, Australia has a wide range of climates so all year round there is somewhere great to visit.

Summer (December to February) can get very hot, but is perfect for beach-going and other outdoors activities. In the far north it is also the wet season, which can get quite humid and some beaches may be closed due to jellyfish or 'stingers'.

Winter (June to August) is pleasant and dry in the north but can get quite cold in the south, especially in Tasmania and Victoria where snowfall is common.

Spring and autumn are great times to visit Australia as the weather is milder, but still warm enough for swimming in northern areas.

Regardless of daytime temperatures, nights can get very cold in the desert areas of Central and Western Australia, so prepare accordingly.

The main school holiday period is from Christmas to late January, and is considered the peak travel time within Australia; expect popular tourist spots to be crowded during this time.








Shopping






×

Shopping




From large malls and boutique shopping strips to weekend arts and crafts markets and vintage shops, Australia is a top place to shop. Shopping in Australia may not be cheap, but there are plenty of unique finds and original souvenirs to bring home.

Before heading home, check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to import certain items back into your home country. New Zealand, for example, has strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Australia

1. Indigenous Art

The quality of Aboriginal art is excellent in the Top End and Central and Western Australia. Be sure to buy from reputable galleries and organisations to ensure authenticity and fair prices for artists. Community-run organisations are typically the better choice.

2. Opals

If you’re looking for one, Coober Pedy has the best quality and variety on offer.

3. Pearls

These precious gems are plentiful in Broome due to the booming pearling industry.

4. Modern Art

Melbourne and Hobart are modern art and craft hot spots, making them great places to pick up one-of-a-kind mementos.








Top 10 Places To See in Australia

Top 10 Places To See in Australia




1. Uluru

Nothing will prepare you for seeing Australia's most famous landmark for the first time. An important part of Aboriginal Dreamtime stories, this ancient monolith is a photographer's dream as it changes colours with the sun; from dazzling orange to dusty purple.

2. Great Barrier Reef

See the world's largest reef system - so big it can be seen from outer space! This World Heritage site, just off the coast of Queensland, is home to whales, dolphins, turtles, sharks, colourful coral and more than 1,500 species of fish. Go scuba diving or snorkelling to explore this incredible underwater world.

3. Twelve Apostles

Although there's actually only eight 'Apostles', these spectacular limestone rock stacks are a popular tourist spot along Victoria's Great Ocean Road. Formed by erosion that began 10-20 million years ago, the stacks rise majestically from the churning Southern Ocean. Hit the boardwalks, tracks and viewing areas for spectacular views.

4. Kakadu National Park

This region is a place of breathtaking beauty and incredible biodiversity. Steeped in Dreamtime history, Kakadu nurtures a staggering variety of landscapes and wildlife. Venture deep into the wilderness and discover gushing waterfalls, deep gorges, shimmering waterholes and rocky outcrops adorned with 20,000-year-old art.

5. Sydney Opera House

Set against a backdrop of that famous bridge which spans the sparkling harbour, the Opera House is one of Australia's most iconic sights. Those familiar sails, adorned with more than a million white tiles, host thousands of events and performances each year. Catch a show to admire the ornate interior, or take in the spectacular view from a ferry.

6. Kimberley

From deep gorges and dusty outback roads, and lush rainforests to idyllic billabongs, the landscape of this beautiful region is truly enchanting. A trip to the Kimberly can be as active or relaxing as you wish - hike past the strange 'beehive' domes of the Bungle Bungle Ranges, explore underground caves at Tunnel Creek or simply relax on white sand beaches.

7. Daintree

With verdant tropical rainforest stretching to white, sandy beaches, the Daintree is nothing short of spectacular. This complex ecosystem in Far North Queensland is home to a prolific amount of wildlife including frogs, reptiles, bats and butterflies, as well as the highest concentration of primitive plants species in the world. Australia's largest rainforest is a true natural wonder just waiting to be explored.

8. Wineglass Bay

With its white sand, crystal-clear water and distinct crescent shape, Wineglass Bay on Tasmania's gorgeous Freycinet Peninsula is a pristine paradise. It's easy to see why it's often voted as one of the top 10 beaches in the world! Hike a trail to the summit overlooking the bay for breathtaking views, or descend to the beach and set up camp. Go snorkelling to discover colourful fish and perhaps some playful dolphins.

9. Clare Valley

This beautiful wine-producing region is famed for its delicious local produce, picturesque scenery, friendly people and, of course, its fabulous wine. Explore back roads lined with vines and go wine-tasting to sample the very best drops this region has to offer.

10. Blue Mountains

Covering over one million hectares, the World Heritage-listed Blue Mountains is rich in verdant rainforest, dramatic waterfalls, looming forests and an abundance of wildlife. Greet the iconic Three Sisters and wander the boardwalks to soak up this breathtaking area of Australian bush.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




The continent of Australia is known for being one of the flattest, hottest and driest places on earth; but despite this there are an astounding variety of terrains and environments on this island nation. While large areas of Australia are covered in desert, there are also tropical rainforests, alpine snowfields, dense bushland, beaches, gorges, lakes and rivers to be found. Australia’s national parks are home to many species of birds and mammals not found in the wild anywhere else in the world including kangaroos, koalas, wallabies and wombats. Boasting many stunning white sand beaches, Australia has a coastline like none other. From busy Bondi to surfing icons like Bell’s Beach and Tasmania’s stunning Wineglass Bay, there are endless places to swim, surf, snorkel and paddle.

Despite Australia’s large landmass, most people tend to live in urban, coastal cities. Faster-paced cities like Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne hold much of the population, as do regional satellite cities such as Albury, Dubbo, Bunbury, Townsville, Newcastle and Geelong.

Outback towns have a unique flavour and a distinct way-of-life; things are slower here and due to smaller populations, space is plentiful with most locals relying on agriculture for a living. Venturing away from the city to visit the outback and rural areas of Australia is highly recommended as it gives travellers the chance to see a different side to Australia.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




With a strong history of immigration, modern Australia is made up of people from many different cultural backgrounds. This mix makes Australia an endlessly fascinating place to visit as travellers will be exposed to a variety of different customs and cultures during their stay. From the ancient, spiritual ways of the indigenous population to the wide array of faiths, foods and festivals on display in the big cities, Australia is a cultural melting pot.

Despite the differences, there are many things that unify the people of Australia. Sports, in particular cricket, soccer and football (Australian Rules) are played and watched by the masses, irrespective of age, race, gender or income. Large sporting events like the AFL Grand Final, Melbourne Cup Day and the Boxing Day Cricket Test have universal appeal for Australians.

Australians relish public holidays, with national and state holidays offering locals time to relax with friends and family over a barbecue or picnic. Making use of Australia’s natural environment is also paramount during this time, with outdoor activities like bushwalking, swimming at the beach or lazing in the park popular with locals.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways of experiencing a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Australia is a land that has been built by immigrants and these multicultural influences are evident in the wide array of food available. In the cities it’s possible to find world-class Vietnamese, Turkish, Italian, Greek, Chinese, Thai, Japanese and Indian restaurants, as well as excellent gastro-pub fare. Head to the outback and you’ll find authentic 'bush tucker', simple campfire meals and sizzling barbecues.

Things to try in Australia

1. Fresh Seafood

With such an impressive coastline, it’s no wonder fresh oysters, prawns, mussels and ‘balmain bugs’ are devoured by locals and savoured by visitors. For those on a budget, there’s nothing wrong with eating fish and chips on the beach.

2. Wine

Australia creates some of the best wines in the world at South Australia’s Barossa Valley, Western Australia’s Margaret River and New South Wales’ Hunter Valley. Don’t miss the chance to taste some.

3. Beer

Whether you’re downing a can of VB in Victoria or sipping micro-brewed ale in Sydney, sharing a beer with mates is a social experience not to be missed when in Australia

4. Hot Pies

An Australian classic – savoury meat pies (or vegetable pies for the vegetarians) are best eaten with tomato sauce, and are easily found served in city cafes, country bakeries and football matches around Australia.








Festivals and Events in Australia

Festivals and Events in Australia




Anxiously anticipated by many – the Australian Rules Football Grand Final is a great time to be in Melbourne. Tickets are notoriously scarce but pubs, clubs and backyards overflow with people watching the ‘Big Game’ and celebrating (or commiserating) afterwards.

Australia travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Australia?









AUSTRALIA:
Belgium: Yes - required in advance
Canada: Yes - required in advance
Germany: Yes - required in advance
Ireland: Yes - required in advance
Netherlands: Yes - required in advance
New Zealand: Not required
South Africa: Yes - required in advance
Switzerland: Yes - required in advance

USA: Yes - required in advance

All travellers, except New Zealand citizens, must obtain a visa or travel authority before travelling to Australia. Failure to do so means you may not be allowed to board your flight to Australia. Most nationalities can obtain an Electronic Travel Authority via the internet before arrival. Please check the following website or with your relevant Australian visa issuing office for your nationalities requirements.
https://www.eta.immi.gov.au/ETAS3/etas







Is tipping customary in Australia?









Tipping isn’t mandatory in Australia; however, rounding up the bill or leaving spare change is common practice. Restaurant staff, taxi drivers and other service workers welcome tips for good service.







What is the internet access like in Australia?









Internet access is widely available in most parts of Australia, with internet cafes and Wi-Fi hot spots commonly found in urban areas. Please note that internet access won’t be available in outback and remote areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Australia?









Mobile phone coverage is excellent in most parts of Australia, especially in large cities and urban areas. Remote, rural and mountainous places may have limited to no coverage, so be aware of this before venturing away from the city. Ensure global roaming is activated before leaving your home country if you want to use your mobile, or you can purchase a sim card when you arrive. The provider that will have coverage in the majority of Australia is Telstra, secondly Optus and then Vodafone. A hot tip – when you are in remote areas and don’t have mobile phone signal, turn your phone to flight mode which will conserve battery and prevent your phone from using data trying to search for internet signal.







What are the toilets like in Australia?









Western-style flushable toilets are the norm in Australia, and many of our campsites have proper facilities with flushing toilets. In remote areas such as the Kimberley, there is no established plumbing and therefore we have installed ‘drop toilets’. Some campsites we use are managed by the National Parks and have either eco-toilets or drop toilets, most of which are maintained regularly.







What will it cost for a…?









Newspaper = AU$2.00
Cup of coffee = AU$3.50
Pint of beer in a pub = AU$6.00
Basic lunch at a mid-range cafe = AU$10-20







Can I drink the water in Australia?









Drinking water from taps in Australia is considered safe, unless otherwise marked. For environmental reasons, try to use a refillable water bottle rather than buying bottled water.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Australia?









Credit cards are widely accepted by shops, restaurants and cafes in Australia. Smaller establishments may only accept cash or require a minimum purchase for credit card use, so be sure to carry enough cash for smaller purchases.







What is ATM access like in Australia?









ATMs are commonly found in large cities and regional towns in Australia. ATM access will be very limited in remote areas so be aware of this before heading into national parks or the Outback.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Australia?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Australians are not required to be covered for hospital care due to being covered by Medicare. However we strongly recommend that Australians have a domestic travel insurance policy which covers personal liability, cancellation, curtailment and loss of luggage and personal effects. It is also strongly advisable that Australians have current ambulance cover in the case of emergency evacuation or incidents requiring ambulance transportation.

For more information on insurance, please go to:
Travel Insurance
