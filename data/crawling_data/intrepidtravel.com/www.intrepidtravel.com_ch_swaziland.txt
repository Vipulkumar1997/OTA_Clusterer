This small but immensely beautiful country is home to one of Africa’s last remaining monarchs.


Tradition is important here and Swazis celebrate their country and their customs with pride. Match that with some outstanding wildlife spotting and Swaziland is an absolute winner.

Best time to visit Swaziland

Best time to visit Swaziland




While the Highveld remains cool and rain is common all year round, the lowlands are warmer and drier. Winter (from June to August) is the best time to visit. Rain is most prevalent from October to May but this can still be a pleasant time to visit as temperatures are mild and there’s plenty of sunshine.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Swaziland is blessed with four major rivers, making it one of Africa’s most fertile countries. The Lubombo plateau is the main farming area, while rolling hills and pine forests cover much of the Highveld, Middleveld and Lowveld. Swaziland shares borders with
South Africa
and
Mozambique
.








Top 5 Swazi Experiences

Top 5 Swazi Experiences




1. Walking Safari

Take wildlife spotting to a whole new level with a walking safari through Hlane Royal National Park. Spot rhinos, giraffes and vultures. You may even encounter lions… from a safe distance of course.

2. Umhlanga

Once a year, tens of thousands of young Swazi girls travel to the Queen Mother’s royal village. There they cut reeds to present to her before performing traditional dances.

3. Village Life

Get a taste of all things traditional at a Swazi cultural village. Explore domed grass houses, learn Swazi songs, try out some dance moves and help celebrate a culture that is being kept alive by passionate locals.

4. Incwala Ceremony

Catch a glimpse of the king at the annual Incwala ceremony. Celebrating the first fruits of the season, the ceremony includes a dance by the king and his regiments in their spectacular warrior dress.

5. Eat Street

Take your tastebuds on a tour of Swaziland’s street food. Mingle with locals over stewed or grilled meat, stamped mealies and corn roasted on the cob.
