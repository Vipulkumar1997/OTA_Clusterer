Mexico tours & travel













Home

Destinations

Central America

Mexico



Peel back the lucha libre mask and you’ll find a patchwork of cultures and customs mixed into one tequila-drenched country.


The gregarious locals are just as likely to pull you up for a dance at one of Mexico City’s hip-shaking salsa clubs as they are to show you the way to one of the country’s many ancient ruins, all with a casual ‘hola’ and an inviting smile. While our tours get you up close with locals, they also show you the best sights from on and off the gringo trail. You can party until dawn in Playa del Carmen, eat your way into a food coma in Oaxaca, or, best of all, kick back with a horchata in the lazy seaside port of Merida.

Transport in Mexico

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Mexico, you may find yourself travelling by:

Best time to visit Mexico






×

Best time to visit Mexico




Mexico is generally most pleasant in the cool, dry season between September and June. July and August can be very hot and humid, but perfect for swimming, snorkelling and lazing on the beach. It is, however, the busiest months for travel as this is the time of the North American school holidays. Highland areas such as Chiapas and Oaxaca tend to be cooler year round, with cold nights.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Mexico lays claim to one of the richest and most historic cultures in the world. Characterised by strong regional identity, locals are affiliated directly to the region they hail from with each region having its own unique customs, cuisine and even language dialect. Despite this, national identity is still strong with all Mexicans sharing common bonds over their love of sport, dance, food and religion. With most of the country belonging to the Roman Catholic religion, religious festivals and celebrations are plentiful in Mexico. Parades, street fairs and parties held in honour of local saints are commonplace, and offer travellers the chance to witness the customs and rituals of this vibrant culture.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

From the diverse fare on offer in Oaxaca and the regional Yucatecan cuisine of Merida, to the sizzling street food of Mexico City, there’s a wealth of culinary options to choose from.

Things to try in Mexico

1. Tamales

The origins of the tamale date back centuries to the Mesoamerican period. This simple dish of corn dough wrapped in a plantain leaf and steamed or boiled is often dressed up with the addition of meat and mole (sauce). Don’t forget to remove the leaf before eating.

2. Ceviche

Although not originally native to Mexico, ceviche has been served in Mexico for centuries. Best tried in coastal areas where the seafood is freshest, this light dish features shrimp, octopus or squid along with lime, onion, chilli and avocado.

3. Huevos Motulenos

This hearty breakfast favourite hails from the Yucatan area and consists of eggs, cheese, beans, tortillas and salsa.

4. Tostada de Pata

This melange of pork, beans, cheese, salsa and onions served on a toasted tortilla is a quick, tasty and cheap snack and is easily found around Mexico.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Mexico shares land borders with the
United States
,
Belize
and
Guatemala
, and has extensive coastline that runs along the Gulf of Mexico, Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Featuring a wide variety of natural environments, Mexico is home to tracts of tropical rainforests, vast areas of low-lying plains and desert, volcanic mountains and temperate beaches and lagoons. Its capital and major cities are typically built up, busy and lively – with a vast network of public transport, highways and roads. Rural areas, on the other hand, are distinctly less developed, with small-scale housing, unsealed roads and rustic farms.








History and government

History and government




Early History

People have been living in Mexico for more than 13,000 years. Mesoamericans occupied the area early on, with archaeological evidence pointing towards Mesoamericans leading a hunter-gatherer existence. Maize farming is thought to have become commonplace by 1500 BC, which led to the farming of other commodities as well. A variety of cultures contributed to the early history of Mexico, with the Olmec, Toltec, Maya, Teotihuacan and Aztecs all bringing unique cultural, religious and artistic styles to the region, with the Mayan and Aztec Empires having the greatest (and most enduring) impact on the region.

Mayan society can be traced back to 300 BC, while the Aztecs enjoyed prosperity from 1325 to around 1521 AD. Many ancient ruins and constructions from these periods are still standing all throughout Mexico, and can be visited and viewed today. By the 16th century, the Spanish had arrived in Mexico and what followed was a period of colonialism that lasted nearly 300 years.

During this time, Mexico was seen as a part of ‘New Spain’ along with Cuba and Puerto Rico. This was not a particularly good time for Mexicans who (under colonial law) were generally not allowed to travel outside of Mexico and were denied access to education. Mexico achieved independence from the Spaniards after the War of Independence (1810-1821) but peace was short lived as two decades later the Mexican-American War brought more confrontation and armed conflict to parts of Mexico.

Recent History

Mexico’s Revolution of 1910 - 1921 was a period of instability, marked by political turmoil and bloodshed. More recently, Mexico has enjoyed an economic resurgence after decades of economic hardship, which lasted from the 1970s to the mid 1990s. The earthquake of 1985 didn’t help matters, with wide-scale damage and loss of life compounding the economic problems and political uncertainty of Mexico. Currently, Mexico is benefiting from a period of improved economic conditions, although the gap between the wages earned by Mexicans and their northern neighbours continues to widen. Mexico is now operating in a free market economy and the growth of tourism, agriculture and industry has ensured an improved economy for the country, although financial inequality still exists within.








Memorable Moments of Mexico

Memorable Moments of Mexico




Top 10 Memorable Moments of Mexico

1. Ramble Among the Ruins

A visit to the famed ruins of Chichen Itza reveals history, ancient architecture and wildlife in equal measures. Walk through the complex and hear jungle animal calls as colourful birds fly among the canopy. This is a stirring experience to treasure.

2. Bittersweet Bites

The cult of chocolate is well and truly alive in Oaxaca! The flavours here are simply phenomenal and unlike mass-produced chocolate in the Western world. Spiced with chilli, cinnamon and cloves, you won’t soon forget the taste of Oaxacan chocolate.

3. Sunshine and Snorkelling

Mexico’s Caribbean coastline showcases expanses of clear blue water, white sand beaches, vibrant reefs and plenty of sunshine. Snorkelling over colourful fish and sun-lit coral is simply unforgettable.

4. Mountain Majesty

The cooler climate and fresh mountain air of San Cristobal de las Casas provides some respite from the city heat. Chilling out in this relaxed and visually stunning area is a magical Mexican moment.

5. Bus Buddies

Catching a local bus in Mexico is a never-ending source of amusement. Overcome the language barrier and make friends with local commuters to pass the time.

6. Tequila!

No visit to Mexico is complete without downing a little bit of the national drink. While you may not remember every detail the morning after, good times and memorable holiday snapshots are guaranteed when tequila’s involved.

7. Volcanic Splendour

Mexico’s volcanic landscapes are photo-worthy and awe-inspiring. Hiking past rocky escarpments and surreal scenery is a rewarding travel experience to remember.

8. Village People

Sharing smiles and laughs with locals while strolling through the rural villages of Mexico is a life affirming and touching experience to cherish.

9. Mariachi Melodies

Sway to the unique sounds of Mexico’s mariachi music in the streets and cafes of Mexico. The rhythms and beats will live in your heart for years to come.

10. To Market, To Market

Witness Latin America’s time honoured commercial traditions unfold at Mexico’s well-patronised markets. Hear the banter of stallholders, smell the fragrant scent of sizzling meat and admire the colourful array of wares on offer.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Travellers will be delighted with the range of good quality shopping available in Mexico. As usual, the markets offer some of the most cost-effective and fun ways to shop, although Mexico’s cities also showcase some excellent boutiques and galleries for more costly purchases.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Mexico

1. Tiles, Ceramics and Earthenware

Mexico has a longstanding tradition in creating good quality pottery. Hit the artisan markets for colourful pots, vases and jugs. Don’t forget to pack carefully.

2. Bright Textiles

Woven textiles can be found almost everywhere in Mexico. Hand-woven rugs, blankets, scarves and ponchos are a great reminder of your time in Mexico.

3. Jewellery

The silver in Mexico is among the world's best. Rings, necklaces and bracelets featuring bold Aztec designs are popular choices.

4. Lucha Libre Masks

This Mexican wrestling phenomenon is growing in popularity worldwide, so grab a colourful wrestling mask - it’s a great souvenir for kids (and big kids) at home.








Festivals and Events in Mexico

Festivals and Events in Mexico




Independence Day

Festivities for Mexico’s Independence Day usually kick off the night before, with large, spirited crowds gathering in the streets. The next day, patriotism hits a yearly high with street parades, marching bands, military displays and concerts.

Autumn Equinox

Equinoxes were highly significant to the Mayan people, and today crowds still gather at Chichen Itza to witness the sunlight and shadows play tricks on this ancient relic. During the autumn (and spring) equinox, the sun moves across Chichen Itza, illuminating parts of the temple to reveal the moving body of a snake. Not seen on any other days, this natural spectacle draws thousands of pilgrims.

Day of the Dead

This annual festival may seem morbid to some, but think of the Day of the Dead as a celebration of life and ancestry. Mexico stops for two days of street fiestas, graveyard picnics, papier-mache skeletons, candlelit vigils and rituals in honour of deceased relatives and ancestors. This moving and atmospheric festival with ancient roots reveals much about Mexico's culture and religion – don’t miss it!

Is tipping customary in Mexico?









Tipping is expected in most parts of Mexico. Service workers typically earn a low wage and rely on tips to earn a decent living. Add 10-15% to restaurant bills (if service charge is not already included), and leave a few dollars or pesos for housekeepers, porters, bartenders and guides.







What is the internet access like in Mexico?









Internet access is easily found in Mexico’s large cities, metropolitan areas and places frequented by tourists, but less so in more remote areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Mexico?









Mobile phone coverage is good in Mexico, especially in large cities. Coverage may not be available in more remote areas, especially if travelling in mountainous regions. Ensure you have global roaming activated with your mobile carrier before you leave home if you wish to use your mobile while in Mexico.







What are the toilets like in Mexico?









It's likely that you will encounter different types of toilets while travelling in Mexico. Western-style flushable toilets are commonly found in high-end resorts, hotels and restaurants, while squat toilets are common in rural areas and homes. Be prepared by carrying your own supply of toilet paper and soap, as these aren't always provided.







What will it cost for a…?









Short trip on public transport = 3 pesos
Street food snack = 10-15 pesos
Bottle of beer = 20-25 pesos
Meal in mid-range restaurant = 50-100 pesos







Can I drink the water in Mexico?









Drinking tap water isn't recommended in Mexico. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Mexico?









Major credit cards are widely accepted in tourist shopping areas and large hotels, but are less commonly accepted by smaller vendors, in remote towns and rural areas. Make sure you carry enough cash for purchases, since credit cards aren't always an option in Mexico.







What is ATM access like in Mexico?









ATMs are common in large cities and tourist hot spots like Cancun and Mexico City, and can be found in and near shopping centres and hotels. ATMs are less common in rural areas and smaller towns, so you're advised to prepare for this by having enough cash before travelling out of the city.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Mexico?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.
