Australia & Oceania

Papua New Guinea



Papua New Guinea’s complex culture and biodiversity mean an endless supply of amazing discoveries for even the widest-travelled adventurer.


While hiking the Kokoda Track is an act of pilgrimage for some, the insight into remote indigenous cultures and encounters with exotic wildlife are reason enough for many.

Papua New Guinea tour reviews


Our Papua New Guinea trips score an average of
4.17 out of 5
based on 6 reviews in the last year.










The Kokoda Track,
October 2017

Andy Templeton

The most arduous, but ultimately satisfying trek I've undertaken. Porters incredibly helpful and attentive. The early starts are worth it to minimise trekking during hottest part of the day - so you'll often get to your overnight camp early afternoon but then you can bathe in the river & relax. Fantastic wartime history lesson..

Review submitted 22 Oct 2017











Papua New Guinea National Mask Festival,
July 2017

ANDREW HICKS

Overall, this trip was good - a four out of five stars.  Being operated by an independent third-party tour company, the trip did not have the unique "feel" of a typical Intrepid "classic" trip though.  It felt more like what I believe an Intrepid "comfort" or perhaps a Peregrine tour would be like (so I've heard--I've only taken Classic and Geckos trips in the past).

Best time to visit Papua New Guinea






×

Best time to visit Papua New Guinea




The best time to visit PNG is during the dry season when cool breezes and low humidity on the coast make temperatures comfortable. Coastal areas can be very hot and humid during the monsoon and rainfall can be torrential. The highlands are much cooler and have even been known to experience snowfalls.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Papua New Guinea is part of a chain of islands stretching between
Asia
and Australia. It has over 600 islands, the largest of which, Bougainville, shares a border with
Indonesia
. The islands are notoriously rugged with heavily forested peaks hiding all manner of weird and wonderful flora and fauna.

Top 5 Kokoda Moments in Papua New Guinea

1. Village Stays

Days away from the outside world, the villages and villagers along the Kokoda Track have been able to maintain their customs, languages and traditions with little interference from the outside world.

2. Isurava Battlefield

Once a WWII battleground, now a moving memorial. The four pillars encapsulate the battle along Kokoda with the words: ‘Courage, Sacrifice, Mateship and Endurance.’

3. Mt Bellamy

It’s an arduous challenge to get to the track’s highest point, but at 2200m your efforts are rewarded with sprawling views across the Owen Stanley Ranges.

4. Fuzzy Wuzzy Friends

Thousands of Australian soldiers owed their lives to the actions of the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels and they’ve become legendary throughout the country. At Menari, we have the opportunity to meet with one of the remaining angels.

5. The Golden Staircase

The original stairs (built by Aussie soldiers) may no longer exist but the steep hill they climbed lives on!

All travelers also currently need to submit a health form along with their visa application:

Your completed visa application needs to be sent your nearest Papua New Guinean High Commission, embassy or consulate along with your valid passport (which must have at least 6 months validity on it from the date of intended travel) as well as a pre-paid, self-addressed and registered post envelope which will be used to return your passport to you. Please note that visa processing times can be subject to delays, particularly during peak periods, so we recommend you allow sufficient time when applying for your visa.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.









Top responsible travel tips for Papua New Guinea

1. Be considerate of Papua New Guinea’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

5. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

6. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

7. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

8. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

9. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
