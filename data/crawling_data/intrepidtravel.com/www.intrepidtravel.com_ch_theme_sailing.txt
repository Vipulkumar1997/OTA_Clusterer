Sailing tours in Europe, Asia and the Caribbean

Sailing




Is there a better feeling than clipping through the waves with the sun on your face? Or watching stars come out over the Aegean Sea with a glass of champagne?

Sailing holidays don’t have to be an intimidating tangle of ropes, nautical jargon and sea monsters – not with Intrepid. Whether you’re a fresh-faced novice or an old salt with callouses on both hands, we’ve got a sailing trip to suit you. Be as involved as you like. Help navigate, tack and steer; or simply kick back on deck with a copy of
Moby Dick
and let the world float by. These are small groups on small boats, but with big adventures.

Why choose an Intrepid sailing trip











Experienced skippers

Our skippers have years of experience sailing the high seas. There’s no-one better to show you the ropes (literally).











Best of both worlds

These sailing vacations aren’t confined to the ocean blue. There’s plenty of time scheduled on land to see the sights and check out the local culture.











Safety first

We know safety is of utmost importance on the ocean. That’s why our yachts are top-of-the-line and range from brand new to (at most) five years old.











No experience needed

If you'd like to pick up some sailing skills, your skipper can show you how. If not, just relax, kick back on deck and soak up some ocean breezes.







Our boats

Europe


















































In
Europe
, we like to go classic. A single-hulled, 50-foot yacht gives you a taste of traditional Mediterranean sailing, not to mention it looks pretty spiffy in pictures too. A typical Intrepid vessel may come with three twin/double cabins, as well as a couple of single berths. You’ll have a recreation lounge, kitchen, three shared bathrooms and plenty of deck space for lazing around and looking fabulous.



Asia & the Caribbean


















































When it comes to sailing in
Asia
and
Caribbean
, catamarans are the way to go. They’re smooth, comfortable, and nimble enough to reach those out-of-the-way cays and little island inlets. The twin hull means there’s plenty of space to stretch out –perfect for those balmy evenings and lazy afternoons. Most of the catamarans in our fleet have four twin/double cabins, three shared bathrooms, a galley (that’s nautical talk for kitchen) and a small living area. In Asia, there’s even kayaks and paddleboards for those that want to get a little active (and bean bags on deck for those that don’t!)



FAQs





Do I have to help sail the boat?









You don’t have to lift a finger if you don’t want to (unless you need to turn the page of your novel or eat a grape). But if you’d like to learn the ropes, that’s fine too. Your expert skipper can teach you everything you’d like to know – from tying knots to unfurling the sails.







How much time is spent off the boat?









There’s about a 30/70 split between land-based and water-based activities on our Asia and Caribbean sailing trips. In Europe this is closer to 50/50 however some evenings will be spent in port or a marina. Much of this depends on the weather conditions. There are usually at least a few hours each day spent exploring ports, trekking the surrounding areas or relaxing on beaches. Of course, depending on location, there will always be the chance to wine and dine at the local hot spots.







What will my fellow travellers be like?









We have travellers of all ages and nationalities travelling with us. Approximately 60% of our travellers are single travellers, followed by a mix of friends travelling and couples. The minimum age of travellers on our trips is 18, or 15 if accompanied by an adult. We don’t have a maximum age as we believe those choosing a sailing adventure are like-minded regardless of age.







Who decides the rooming configuration?









Your skipper will allocate rooms on arrival to the boat. Single travellers will be paired up with another passenger of the same sex, and this may mean sharing a double mattress or twin mattresses side by side.







What are the sleeping arrangements like?









This is our most common question. People are often hesitant about the idea of sharing a double mattress with another traveller of the same sex. Sailing boats tend to be very compact (and we use realy sailing boats), and the close-quarters nature of this travel is part of the adventure.

Sleeping quarters are designed to utilise the minimum amount of space in order to keep the communal areas as big as possible. In practice, lots of travellers end up sleeping out on deck under the stars, as it’s warm and there’s no air conditioning on a sailing boat.

Our boats have a mix of double, twin (two separate beds or two separate mattresses side by side) and bunks.







Can I get a cabin to myself?









Yes. Single supplements are available on all trips subject to availability. A single supplement is normally twice the regular price, however where trips have inclusions such as meals there is a slight reduction in the supplement price. If you are interested in having a single supplement please contact us to check availability and price.







Do the cabins have ensuites?









On many boats bathroom facilities are shared, however some boats have ensuites in each cabin that allow two people to share one bathroom. Our monohull yachts in Europe will have no more than two cabins sharing a bathroom. Most of our catamarans have four cabins and four bathrooms, however these bathrooms are shared between travellers and crew. Check the Essential Trip Information of your trip for more specific details about your boat. Fresh and hot water is available for showers, and toilets are either electronic or hand pump.







Will I get seasick?









Seasickness comes in a variety of forms. Common symptoms include fatigue, uneasiness, dizziness, and headaches. The majority of these symptoms usually subside after taking some time to adjust (usually a few hours to a day). Paracetamol tablets can help ease the transition. Heavy seasickness, characterised by vomiting, is uncommon, and it can be treated using medication. There are also a number of other self-management techniques you can try – such as sitting out in the fresh air, drinking ginger tea or watching the horizon.

For more information about beating seasickness, click
here
.







What will I eat?









All Caribbean, Asia, Zanzibar and Galapagos Island trips feature an on-board chef, who will prepare three delicious meals each day, plus snacks. In Europe and the British Virgin Islands, we operate with a trip kitty* that everyone contributes to. This is because there’s so much great local produce to taste in each place that it makes a lot of sense to buy food at each stop! This kitty will keep cover some of your food and beverage costs. On all our trips there will be an opportunity to enjoy a meal at a local port – we’ll be able to show you where all the good tavernas are. Please check your Essential Trip Information for more specific details.

*See below for information about what is kitty.







What about alcoholic drinks?









You are welcome to drink on board - in fact, nothing enhances a sunset more than a gin and tonic – however alcohol is BYO (bring your own). So make sure you buy what you need before departure. Some of our boats have alcoholic drinks on board that are available for purchase at local bar prices. Drinking water is free of charge.







How much luggage should I take?









Due to the compact size of the boats and the sometimes rocky nature of a sailing trip, it is advisable that you bring fabric/canvas luggage. It’s a good idea to pack light as there will usually be a gap between the boat and pier. While the skipper or a fellow traveller can give you a helping hand, you’ll need to be able to lift your bag onto the boat.







What should I pack?









Sailing trips are a little different to regular group tours. There’s a finite amount of space on the boat, so it’s best to leave the grand piano, pet llama and foldout four-person mattress at home. Same goes for bulky suitcases, ten pairs of shoes and the surfboard.

This isn’t designed to be a comprehensive packing list, but it’ll get you thinking like a real sailor.

A medium-sized fabric bag that can be flattened or stored easily

A small day pack for shore excursions

Some flip flops or deck shoes that can get wet

Sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat

Seasickness tablets (just in case)

Swimmers (don’t worry about the snorkel and fins – we provide those)

Waterproof camera (for those sweet underwater shots)

A light weatherproof jacket (just in case of high seas or seasonal showers)

For a more detailed packing list please refer to the Essential Trip Information of your trip.







What are the arrival and departure times?









These will vary from trip to trip – be sure to check your Essential Trip Information for more specific details. Some sailing trips will head out to sea on the afternoon of the first day. Others will remain in port overnight, however we still ask that you join the trip at the requested time as the skipper will need to deliver a welcome and safety briefing before organising a visit to the supermarket to buy provisions for the trip. All travellers will have an input into the provisions and this will be purchased from the kitty*.

Please note that due to sailing being a heavily weather-dependent activity, sometimes itineraries may need to change. We recommend allowing an additional night at the beginning and end of the trip to ensure nobody misses any onward flights.

*see ‘What is a kitty’ for more information on.







What is a kitty?









A kitty is a fund or pool of money that all travellers can choose to contribute to at the beginning of a trip. It’s not compulsory however we’ve found pooling the group's money in one place makes it easier to arrange non-included group meals and tips where necessary. You'll usually eat most breakfasts and some lunches and dinners onboard the boat, so it's best to buy supplies from a nearby supermarket or grocery store at the beginning of each trip. For meals off the boat, our skippers will suggest locally-run restaurants that specialise in local produce and delicacies.







What is the maximum group size?









The maximum passenger capacity on our boats changes depending on which country you are sailing. Here’s a quick breakdown, but you can always find more specific details in the essential trip information of each tour.

Burma: 8

Phuket: 14

Caribbean: 8

Europe: 8 – 11 (depending on the boat)

Cuba Sailing Adventure,

Sailing in Cuba was a great experience but be prepared for 2 long days at sea. The beaches are beautiful and the waters warm and inviting. The snorkelling is good and itt was amazing to swim with a pod of wild dolphins who turned up to see who we were.

This is a great trip to unwind and relax. You will find a lot of time to sit and contemplate life. Take a book! I took the three day option and was happy with that. Had I taken the longer option, personally, I think I would have risked becoming a bit bored.

Sardinia & Corsica Sailing Adventure,
June 2017

Anne MacIver

I would just like to encourage any solo travelers in their 20s to 50s to seriously consider taking this trip. I am a 48-year-old female (mother of two back home), and I had the best trip I have possibly ever taken...and this is coming from a frequent global traveler! The islands and waters are stunning, the culture and food fantastic, and my skipper and shipmates were A+. It felt great to cook together, clean together, work the sails together, live an organized, respectful and communal life in small quarters for a week, doing something completely out of the ordinary, and get to know people from all over the world. I'm just lucky I was able to keep my ugly American accent after 8 days with 3 Aussies, a Kiwi, and a South African. ;-)

Zanzibar Spice Islands Sailing Adventure,
September 2017

Kylie Shields

This is a definite WOW trip and sailing is the best way to explore the exquisite waters of the Zanzibar archipelago. The trip includes a fabulous itinerary - which takes in incredibly beautiful beaches, the crew are super attentive and competent, the food prepared by David is ridiculously delicious.  Just take note, all accommodation is onboard, so you need to adaptable and prepared to share fairly confined spaces with strangers and be comfortable in doing so.

Croatia Sailing Adventure - Dubrovnik to Split,
September 2017

Conor McKeown

More information on the size of the ship, closeness of quarters, and toilet facilities (campaign at best) would have been more useful and ultimately would have made us consider a more expensive alternative to make our travels a little more luxurious. The inability to flush toilet paper was difficult for my partner and I , therefore we could only go to the public toilet at marinas moored at.

Bahamas Sailing Adventure,
May 2017

Sam Malhotra

Fabulous, once in a lifetime trip!  The Bahamas was one of the most beautiful locations I have ever been to, the weather was incredible and sailing enabled us to see The Bahamas in a really special way - getting into remote spots, breathtaking snorkeling everyday and some truly unique opportunities to interact with the natural world!  Skipper Judy is a complete star - she looked after a very international group with relaxed confidence and charm that engaged the group and inspired trust.  In particular, she helped me (a novice snorkeler) gain confidence in the water and so enabled me to have one the of the most spectacular experiences of my life!  Adriann (our cook) added even more warmth and personality by not only conjuring up delicious food and drinks every day (incredible!) but by also spending time to get to know everyone and look after them on an individual basis.  Between them, they created a fun, friendly and incredibly comfortable environment and made the trip for me.  I really can't recommend this trip enough!

Zanzibar Spice Islands Sailing Adventure,
September 2017

Nicola Hodson

A fabulous sailing trip. Expect a couple,of long sailing days with little activity but time to relax on the boat. Highlights include good food including freshly caught fish on the boat, very few tourists in many places, great snorkelling, options to kayak and paddle board and see fab sunsets while on board. Plus visits to islands and meeting locals...be aware that there will be no shops etc on the trip so stock up,in advance on sun cream, snacks, drinks etc if you need (wine, beer and some soft drinks can be bought on board at a reasonable price). Cabins were more spacious than other cats I have been on and had an en suite although showering at the back of the boat at sunset still the best option!  Highly recommended.

Amazing experience, varied age brackets, really good to experience a country in a short period of time. Very close quarters and have to be willing to chip in, make an effort with cleaning and cooking and be open to getting to know new people. Giorgos was amazing if you ever get a trip with him.

Gabrielle Wilson

I loved the sailing trip because it was very beautiful sailing around untouched islands. The scenery was unreal and it was great being able to get out and about and explore the islands and to chill out on the beaches and do activities such as paddles and nature and village walks. The boat was very comfortable, the food great and the people very friendly and accommodating. As a tip I would suggest making sure that you bring a lot of sunscreen and be sun safe as you will probably be out on the front of the boat and the sun can be quite intense.

This sailing trip is sensational for sampling pristine waters, delicious cuisines, and meeting wonderful like minded travellers! Intrepid provide a great insight into local cultures wherever they take you, while using local transport in smaller groups, rather than jamming you into a cattle car (coach). The intrepid way is a far better way!

You need to understand sailing is different to other forms of travel. Boats have special traits. Catching fish should be added to trip notes as part of the experience. Overall it was a great trip, made nicer by the personalities of the skipper, the cook and the two local crew.

You will make life long friends as well. Our group was made up of ages 30-69 and we bonded like family, helped by our amazing skipper. Definitely put this trip on your bucket list!

This is a very unique experience for anyone looking to get off the beaten path and truly explore the serenity and nature of Zanzibar and the surrounding islands. From spotting whales and dolphins, to catching fresh tuna for dinner, to snorkeling and exploring secluded islands, and visiting a remote village in Pemba, you will have a very memorable and fun experience.

Sardinia & Corsica Sailing Adventure,
August 2017

Emily O'Donovan

An absolutely beautiful part of the world, and sailing is a great way to experience it! If you are expecting any luxuries this is not the trip for you, and those with previous sailing experience who feel confident assisting the skipper are likely to get the most out of it. However if you are willing to try something new and go beyond your comfort zone this is a great adventure!

Amalfi Coast Sailing Adventure,
August 2017

Clare Collins

Beautiful coastline which can be taken in slowly, relaxing on the boat. Interesting walks and activities including Pompii the scale of which is jaw dropping. The experience, knowledge and cooking of a well skilled skipper made this trip truly magical and one I will hopefully never forget.

Absolutely fabulous trip. Make sure you take a good book and some cards. BYO your alcohol and snacks if you need them. There are no ATMs outside of stone town so make sure you are prepared.

Amalfi Coast Sailing Adventure,
June 2017

Sian Ashton

This trip is an incredible way to see the Amalfi Coast. It was wonderful to sail to new places and visit local restaurants and markets and then return to our lovely yacht at night. This is the second Intrepid sailing adventure my sister and I have done and we loved it just as much as the first which was in Thailand. If you're lucky you will get Captain Paolo whose enthusiasm and joy for life is contagious. Paolo made sure we went to the most authentic local restaurants and went out of his way to ensure his passengers were safe and happy.

Check out this article about the trip:

Enjoy!
