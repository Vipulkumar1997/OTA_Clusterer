Bosnia and Herzegovina tours & travel

Europe

Bosnia



Long overshadowed by stories of war, modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina shines.


Its dramatic mountain countryside, cobbled streets, age-old cultures, minarets and temples entice you to turn another corner and keep exploring. Get back to nature, step back in time or back up onto the dance floor to party the night away with Sarajevo’s young and beautiful.

Best time to visit

Best time to visit




Summers in Bosnia and Herzegovina are hot and sunny. The country is at its sparkling best between May and September. In winter it can get bitterly cold. Don’t be surprised to see snow, especially in the hills where the white stuff can hang around until April.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Little heart-shaped Bosnia is almost completely landlocked - it has only 20 km of beautiful coastline along the Adriatic. But what it lacks in coastline, it more than makes up for with stunning rivers and plunging valleys. It shares borders with
Croatia
, Montenegro and
Serbia
.

Top 5 Historic Sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina

1. Stari Most

When Mostar’s 16th-century bridge was rebuilt after the 90s conflict, it became a new symbol of unity and hope. The only turmoil here these days is the fast-flowing river, into which young Bosnians dive, from 24m up, to test their mettle.

2. Bascarsija

Sarajevo’s Old Town is filled with mosques, artisan workshops, Jewish temples and bars that buzz all night long. Do as the locals do and down a cup of coffee, fill up on bosanski cevapi and start walking the cobbled streets.

3. Ilidza

Ilidza is one of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s longest continuously inhabited sites. Neolithic ruins have been found and the Romans and Ottomans both had their time here. Contemplate the history as you soak in the town’s famous thermal baths.

4. Tunnel Museum

During the war, a tunnel was used to smuggle food, fuel and injured soldiers between the city and the free zone. The 20 m of the tunnel which still exists has been turned into an emotional insight into life during war.

5. Jewish Museum

This fascinating museum is housed in a 16th-century synagogue. Its bare stone walls and timber floors breathe the history of Jews in Sarajevo over the past 400 years.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Bosnia & Herzegovina

Be considerate of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
