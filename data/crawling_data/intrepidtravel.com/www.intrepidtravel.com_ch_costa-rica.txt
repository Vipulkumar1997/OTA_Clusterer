Costa Rica tours & travel













Home

Destinations

Central America

Costa Rica



Costa Rica hangs its jaunty Panama hat on two things: eco-tourism and adventure sports.


It helps when more than a quarter of your country is protected rainforest with more biodiversity than USA and Europe combined, and the rest is a jaw-dropping combo of bubbling volcanoes, Pacific surf beaches and laid-back towns like Quepos and Sarapiqui. Costa Rica tours are all about nature putting on a show –you’ll quickly become a pro at spotting keel-billed toucans in the cloud forests of Monteverde or listening out for the distant whoop of white-faced capuchins – but really it’s the pace of life here that gets you. ‘Hustle’ and ‘bustle’ aren’t really in Costa Rica’s vocab. Pretty much what you’d expect from a country’s whose unofficial motto is pura vida (the pure life).

Costa Rica Express,
November 2017

Barbara Hayers

The holiday was good saw alot of the country but didn't realise how busy the parks would be we were travelling on the bus all day which I like as you do see the country side but I am sure there would be somewhere closer to see more off the wildlife as I wasn't interested in sitting on the beach I think I should have gone for some thing with more walking and quieter as the Antonio national park was crowded with hoards of people so we saw  loads of monkeys who were used to people.I didn't find it a unique experience .

Raft, Snorkel & Kayak in Costa Rica,
November 2017

Susan Zebrowski

This trip was the perfect blend of adventure, education, and pure fun.  The flowers, insects, animals and various locations were fascinating.  Everywhere you turn, there is something wonderful to see and experience.  The rafting was so much fun and an activity that really turned the group into a team.  Intrepid has flawlessly designed this trip.

Best time to visit Costa Rica

Best time to visit Costa Rica




Year-round tropical warmth means there really isn’t a bad time to visit Costa Rica. December to April are normally the driest months; however, Costa Rica’s diverse topography and blanket of rainforests suggest that you should be prepared for at least some rain - a very small price to pay for such incredibly lush scenery. The good news is that even during the rainiest of seasons, the rainfall tends to be limited to a couple of hours a day… just enough time for you to enjoy a cup of Costa Rica's world-renowned coffee in one of its many cafes. Temperatures vary with altitude, with San Jose's temperatures ranging between 15C and 21C and the coastal areas experiencing much warmer climes.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Wedged between the mighty Pacific Ocean and the picturesque Caribbean, Costa Rica is best known for its incredible beaches and magical rainforests. While Costa Rica’s name (meaning ‘Rich Coast’) suggests that Costa Rica’s beauty is limited to its golden beaches, the backbone of this coastal nation consists of some truly stunning mountain ranges, many of which contain active and dormant volcanoes. For this reason, adventure sports such as zip-lining, whitewater rafting and cycling are popular in inland destinations such as La Fortuna and Montverde. Geographically, Costa Rica shares borders with Nicaragua to the north and Panama to the south, serving as a perfect starting point for exploring this fascinating part of the world.

Apart from being a beach lover’s paradise, Costa Rica is renowned for its incredible biodiversity. Over half of the country is blanketed in forest, and those seeking to spot local wildlife will be enthralled by Costa Rica’s unique species of plants and animals. Scuba diving is another popular activity, with Costa Rica boasting some of the most beautiful bays, beaches and reefs in the world.








Top 5 Beautiful Beaches in Costa Rica

Top 5 Beautiful Beaches in Costa Rica




1. Tortuguero National Park

One of Costa Rica’s best-kept secrets, this national park is the unspoilt paradise you’ve been searching for. Will you slip effortlessly into Tortuguero’s warm turquoise waters or simply relax on its idyllic shores? The choice is entirely yours.

2. Manuel Antonio

Leave the hassles of modern life behind and discover an eco-playground surrounded by unlimited coastal delights. Spend a day exploring misty rainforests before cooling off on one of Manuel Antonio’s delightful beaches, or head into town for some famous, fiery nightlife.

3. Jaco

Once a sleepy beach town, Jaco’s proximity to San Jose has made it a one-stop shop for those seeking big waves and even bigger parties. Not exactly a remote oasis, but there is no denying Jaco’s uber-cool surf-town vibe.

4. Playa Tamarindo

An upmarket alternative to Jaco’s backpacker bliss, Playa Tamarindo is an elegant town that delivers a ton of truly exquisite beaches. Pristine blue waters meet a backdrop of bottle green forests – it's no wonder that Playa Tamarindo is one of Costa Rica’s most famous destinations.

5. Corcovado

Well off the tourist trail, Corcovado’s ebony sands are not your average beach-going experience. Boasting diversity in colour, landscape and wildlife, Corcovado is perfect for those seeking beaches with character and charm.

Ask your leader where filtered water can be found as some hotels provide this. Remember to peel fruit and vegetables before eating and avoid ice in drinks.

ATMs are easily found in the large cities and airports, although are less common in rural and remote areas. When travelling out of the city, come prepared by having enough cash as ATMs aren't always an option.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling to Costa Rica?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Costa Rica

Be considerate of Costa Rica’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.

Admire coral while diving and snorkelling, but never remove coral from a reef or buy coral items from markets. Coral belongs in the sea.
