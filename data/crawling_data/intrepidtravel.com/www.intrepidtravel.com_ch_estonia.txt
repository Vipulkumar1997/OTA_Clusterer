Destinations

Europe

Estonia



Lakes, forests and beaches make up one of Europe’s smallest but prettiest countries.


Estonians have fiercely defended their culture through decades of Soviet influence, and now it’s celebrated everywhere you turn. Fabulous food, gorgeous medieval towns and a sense of joyful independence set Estonia apart.

Top 10 Estonian Tastes

Top 10 Estonian Tastes




1. Marineeritud Angerjas

If you want the real Estonian food experience, it’s best to start with this slippery little number - marinated eel served cold.

2. Sult

Pork is a staple of Estonian food, and no pork dish is more popular than sult - boiled pork in jelly. Step inside an Estonian home to see jar after jar of jelly setting on the shelves.

3. Mulgikapsad

Dig in to a hearty serving of sauerkraut stew with pork and boiled potatoes. It’ll keep you going all winter, and well into spring.

4. Koduolu

This beer is made from rye or oat malts filtered through straw and juniper twigs. It’s claimed to be one of the world’s oldest continuous beer-making traditions, drawing inspiration from Babylonian beer-making methods.

5. Saku Originaal

For a more modern taste, join the locals in a Saku Originaal - a fine lager, and the most popular in Estonia.

6. Silgusoust

There’s nothing like sprats if they’re accompanied with bacon and lashings of sour cream.

7. Kali

This non-alcoholic drink has been nicknamed ‘the Estonian Coca-Cola’ for its sweet, slightly fizzy taste.

8. Vervivorst

If you’re lucky enough to spend Christmas in Estonia, be sure to try this blood and barley sausage. It’s similar to black pudding and served with berry jam.

9. Kama

A thick dessert drink made with sour milk (kefir) and a mixture of ground grains - rye, oat barley and pea flour.

10. Keel Hernestega

Not for the faint hearted, this dish of cold tongue is usually served with horseradish for added pizazz.








Best time to visit Estonia

Best time to visit Estonia




July and August are the hottest and busiest months in Estonia. From May to September, days are mild and the nights cool. Though snowy in winter, there’s regular, mild to moderate rainfall throughout the year, becoming slightly heavier towards spring. Slush under foot is something you have to cope with in autumn, when snow falls then melts, and in spring, when the winter snow thaws.

Geography and environment
