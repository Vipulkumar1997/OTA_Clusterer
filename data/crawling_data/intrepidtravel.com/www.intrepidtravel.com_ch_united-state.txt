Southern Comfort USA,
November 2017

Peter Hills

Southern Comfort offers a great opportunity to get a flavour of the food, music, and culture of these otherwise lightly visited states.
Travelling in a group gives a great collective experience stimulating conversation over dinner and whilst travelling.
Unlike some group/coach tours there is plenty of opportunity to explore all of the towns and cities at your own leisure, but the included activities are some of the key attractions any visitor to the region would wish to experience

Hawaii Discovery,
November 2017

Vicki Miezis

This  trip was pretty amazing. When I booked it I thought I would be lazing on a beach but it turned out to be adventurous and the hikes were challenging. So very glad it was more than just beaches. Loved the turtles and the manta rays.  The volcano was amazing.  One of the best trips I have done.  Our leader, Charlie, was really great.

Transport in United States

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in the US, you may find yourself travelling by:







Ferry

Be amazed by enormous glaciers and stunning, icy landscapes while travelling on a ferry in Alaska.











Bicycle

Use pedal power to see the best of Venice Beach and Santa Monica. Cycling is a great way to see the sights and get fit at the same time.











Streetcar

Take in the sights while enjoying a ride on one of San Francisco’s icons – the streetcar.





Accommodation in United States

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in the US you may find yourself staying in a:







Hogan

Spend a night sleeping in a hogan – a traditional Navajo structure built with an open roof to view the stars.


Bright Lights & Canyons of the USA

Western USA Highlights

Utah Parks Circuit










Cabin

Get back to nature and enjoy staying in quaint cabins throughout the beautiful national parks of America.

Best time to visit United States






×

Best time to visit United States




Being such a large country, the weather in the US is different depending on which area you are in. This means that it’s always a good time to visit, as the sun is always shining somewhere in the United States.

Summer (June to August) is the peak season due to school holidays. It can be uncomfortably hot in the desert areas and the south, but more pleasant in the north. The shoulder seasons of spring and autumn are generally considered to be the best times to visit, but the weather is still highly variable and these may be the wettest times in some parts of the country (such as Seattle). Winter can be cold in the north, and expensive in the ski resorts, but quiet in other areas, which can make it a pleasant time to visit.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




With immigration playing an important part in the development of America, it's now a nation made up of many different cultures. The population is made up of immigrants hailing from Asia, Africa, Europe, Central America and beyond - it’s no wonder modern America is rich with a variety of cultural traditions, cuisines, religions and festivals. Because of this, a large diversity of holidays are celebrated in America. You’re just as likely to see Kwanza, Hanukah and Chinese New Year celebrated, as Christmas and Easter. Annual holidays like 4th of July and Thanksgiving are usually celebrated by all regardless of religion or political persuasion, and give people a chance to reconnect with family and friends around the dinner table or grill.

From sports to soul music, popular culture to philosophy, and fine art to folk art, the tastes and desires of Americans vary around the country - from north to south, cities to small towns. A love of sport unifies the nation - it doesn’t matter if you live in a city loft or a trailer, sports like ice hockey, basketball, baseball and gridiron all attract a strong following, regardless of age, sex, income or race.

With an emphasis on freedom and achievement, entrepreneurs like Oprah, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Donald Trump and Mark Zuckerberg are respected, celebrated and held up as an example of how anything is possible when living in America. Sporting legends, celebrities, actors and pop stars are viewed as valuable commodities by most, leading to the recent explosion of ‘celebrity culture’.

In contrast to this, many Native Americans live on reservations and fight to retain their traditions and preserve their heritage, although when visiting reservations don’t be surprised to see Native Americans wearing modern clothing. With much of the language and many of the customs lost over the years, Native Americans strive to live a life of deep spirituality and in connection with the earth, as their ancestors did for centuries.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

In the United States, the portions are large and the calorie-count even larger. With a variety of international influences, try Creole cuisine in New Orleans, traditional Jewish fare in New York, and southern cooking in Texas. America’s got everything, from burger joints to taco shacks, organic cafes to refined Michelin-starred restaurants.

Things to try in United States

1. All-You-Can-Eat Buffets

The staple diet of most Vegas-visitors, a buffet session may not be for everyone, but you can’t argue that it’s not an economical choice. Fill up on soups, seafood, wings and ribs and you’ll be able to skip your next meal.

2. Bagel With a ‘Schmear’

Popular in New York and beyond, a bagel and ‘schmear’ (small amount of cream cheese) is a great, low-cost breakfast option.

3. Pies

A stock standard menu item in most diners, cafes and roadside truck stops, American pies are simply delicious. Choose from cherry, apple, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry or peach and wash it down with an endlessly refillable cup of hot coffee with cream.

4. Hot Dogs

Take a bite out of the Big Apple with a hot dog bought from a street vendor. Smothered in mustard and ketchup, this is a fave budget bite with cash-strapped travellers.

5. Donuts

In need of a sugar hit? Then indulge in a donut made of sugary, doughy goodness. Whether you head to a Dunkin’ Donuts chain or a cafe, in America you’re never far from a donut. On the road? There’s even drive-thru donut stores in some states.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




From the lush everglades of Florida, through the red-hot deserts of Nevada and on to the urban jungles of New York and Philadelphia, the United States has many different environments and ecosystems within its boundaries. Sharing borders with
Canada
in the north and
Mexico
in the south, the United States has deserts, glaciers, freshwater lakes, rapid-filled rivers, mountain ranges, sprawling plains, forested national parks, beaches and bays.

The major national parks of America – Yellowstone, Zion, Yosemite, Bryce Canyon, Denali and Joshua Tree offer a glimpse into what much of America looked like before development. Lush vegetation, majestic mountains and sparkling lakes give deer, moose, bears, bison and many other species of wildlife a fertile home to live in.

When travelling, you’re likely to see modern cities filled with traffic, skyscrapers and high-density housing, as well as sleepy towns, trailer parks and Native American reservations. A complex network of highways connect the major cities, making overland travel a popular choice with visitors and locals alike. The great American road trip is still alive and well.








History and government






×

History and government




As one of the world’s most influential nations, major moments and events in American history ripple throughout the rest of the world.

The First Settlers interrupted the traditional way of life that Native Americans had been living for centuries, and soon brought disease, famine and dispossession of land to the tribes of North America.

Over the years, America has seen battles fought between its citizens (like the Civil War) and externally with other nations (Vietnam War and Gulf War). It has also endured terrorist attacks, natural disasters, depressions, recessions and other hardships. The American people are known for their resilience and irrepressible nature, and it is this spirit that allows them to continue to contribute to the world economically, scientifically and creatively.

In recent history, America has enjoyed the historic highs of the moon landings and the devastating lows of Hurricane Katrina. The world has seen American companies like Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Starbucks change the face of the world. And people like Steven Spielberg, Lance Armstrong, Maya Angelou and Sidney Poitier create masterpieces, break records and win countless awards.








Top 10 Must-See Cities in the US






×

Top 10 Must-See Cities in the US




Top 10 Must-See Cities in the US

1. New York

You can be anyone you want to be in NYC. Indulge your artistic side at MoMA, mingle with the Gordon Geckos on Wall Street, cheer like a pro at a Yankees game or kick back at a bar with a Manhattan and a new pair of Jimmy Choos.

2. San Francisco

San Francisco is made of sunshine, seafood and a whole lot of hills. This is the place to embrace your inner (or outer) bohemian. But it's not all 'flowers in your hair' and free thinking, be sure to take a ferry to Alcatraz and scoff down a clam chowder at Fisherman's Wharf.

3. New Orleans

The Caribbean meets France and Africa in New Orleans. Music is everywhere, and so are the friendly faces. The city comes to life after dark so have an afternoon nap, get some comfortable shoes on and get ready to bar hop the night away.

4. Las Vegas

Hello Lady Luck! Days somehow disappear in the hedonistic blitz of colour, light, showgirls, casinos and offers too good to refuse. Try to escape the endless buffets to catch a show; there's everything from death defying acrobats to Elvis on offer.

5. Chicago

The financial and political powerhouse of Chicago has been the home of two of the most influential people in the world - President Obama and Oprah. Famed for its distinctive architecture, booming performing arts scene and sports-mad locals, the 'Windy City' shouldn't be missed.

6. Miami

The air is warmer, the clothes smaller and the colours are somehow brighter in Miami. Jewish, Latin and Caribbean cultures blend to make a heady mix of great food, even better music and a nightlife filled with the spirit of fiesta. Hang out on perfect beaches, spot classic cars and gaze at the beautiful people as they strut their stuff.

7. Los Angeles

Search beyond the stardust of Hollywood and the excessive price tags of Rodeo Drive, to find the true essence of Los Angeles. Home to a melting pot of cultures, uber-cool restaurants, a hip art-scene and the eclectic vibe of Venice Beach, LA is so hot right now!

8. Seattle

The birthplace of grunge music and iconic super-companies like Microsoft, Boeing and Starbucks, Seattle offers so much more than great coffee. Markets packed with fresh produce, a harbour perfect for boating, vibrant public art and a thriving live music scene combine to make Seattle a must-see city.

9. Memphis

History comes alive in the heritage-filled streets of Memphis. Whether it's at Elvis Presley's Graceland, the lively blues clubs and restaurants of Beale Street or the moving Civil Rights Movement Museum, it could be said that the soul of America lives in Memphis.

10. Boston

One of America's oldest cities, Boston is evolving. Working class neighbourhoods are being gentrified, industry is giving way to tech start-ups and modern architectural treasures sit alongside brown-stone buildings. Despite the change, get chatting to locals about the Red Sox and you'll soon find you're definitely in Bosto








Shopping






×

Shopping




It’s no wonder many people choose to do their clothes shopping in the United States. With iconic department stores like Bloomingdales and Macy’s offering a wide range of labels, and vintage/charity stores stocking American fashion classics like distressed denim jeans and leather cowboy boots, shopping in America is fun. Known for having great sales and even better customer service, it’s well worth leaving room in your backpack for a few extras. Please note that unlike in many other countries, tax isn’t included in the ticketed price.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in United States

1. Sephora

One for the ladies – this amazing institution of hair & beauty stocks a wide range of cult skin care and glam make-up products at great prices.

2. Amoeba Music

With stores in Los Angeles and San Francisco, this independent music store stocks an enormous range of music, posters, dvds and tour T-shirts. In-store artist appearances and concerts only add to Amoeba’s awesomeness.

3. Dean & DeLuca

Foodies will love perusing the gourmet goods on offer at Dean & DeLuca stores. Pick up some coffee to take home and try later or sample savoury bites from the specialty cheese counter.








Festivals and Events






×

Festivals and Events




Burning Man Festival

Although entrance tickets start at $250, this unique, ‘cashless’ event, held in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada is based on the theme of radical self-expression. Festival-goers are expected to bring something to share with everyone, so trading is used as a form of currency. Expect to see art, music, nudity, body painting, tarot, dance and performance art before the ‘Burning Man’ statue is set alight, signifying the end of the festival.

New Orleans Mardi Gras

Witness a chaotic collision of lively music, colourful costumes, masquerade masks, spicy food and joyful people at the parades, parties and masquerade balls of the New Orleans Mardi Gras.

Coachella

Tens of thousands of people flock to this iconic Californian music festival to see the hottest rock, electronica and folk acts from around the world. Art installations, camping and a karaoke lounge add to the fun.

United States travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to United States?









Entrance requirements to the USA have changed in recent years so please read the following instructions carefully, even if you have travelled to the USA before.

Many countries now operate under a visa waiver program (meaning a visa isn't required) however you still need to obtain an authorisation which confirms that you have been approved to travel. This authorisation must be obtained in advance of travel.

Many citizens from Visa Waiver Program countries can travel to the USA without a visa for a 90 day stay, if they meet certain requirements. Travellers from all Visa Waiver Program countries must present a machine-readable passport (which meets US requirements) at the port of entry to enter without a visa, otherwise a US visa is required. You can get further information from the US Department of State website:
- http://travel.state.gov/visa/tempvisitors.html

Also please note, all travellers from Visa Waiver Program countries must obtain an electronic travel authorization prior to their flight from the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) website: https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov

All ESTA registration applications or renewals require a US$14.00 fee paid by credit or debit card. You should apply for your visa waiver authorisation at least 1 week prior to travel to avoid any last minute delays. You will require your passport details and your address in the US (you can use the starting point hotel/hostel address).

Please note that if there is any discrepancy between the name on your ESTA, your passport, your tickets and even your frequent flyer membership, you may be detained at Immigration and subject to a secondary inspection which could take a few hours. If you have recently changed your name, please check that your details have been updated everywhere.

If you are from a country eligible for the visa waiver program but are a dual citizen of Iran, Iraq, Syria or Sudan, or if you have travelled to Iran, Iraq, Syria or Sudan since 1 March 2011, you will not longer be eligible for the visa waiver program and will instead need to apply for a non-immigrant visa. Please see the Department of State website for more information: http://travel.state.gov//content/travel/en.html







Is tipping customary in the US?









Tipping is very much a part of the culture in the US. Tips are expected at restaurants, cafes and diners, as well as by taxi drivers, valet attendants, porters and hotel maids. People working the service industry generally receive the minimum wage, which is quite low and therefore rely upon tips as a major source of their income. In general, leave 15% of the bill at places serving food, $1 to bar tenders and a few dollars for hotel staff who provide a personal service like carrying bags or cleaning your room.







What is the internet access like in the US?









Internet access is excellent in the US, and internet cafes and Wi-Fi hot spots are easily found in most cities and major towns.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in the US?









Mobile phone coverage is excellent in most parts of the US although coverage may be patchy in remote, mountainous areas like national parks and canyons. Ensure global roaming is activated before you arrive.







What are the toilets like in the US?









Western-style flushable toilets are the norm in the US.







What will it cost for a…?









Cup of coffee = US$1.50-2
Hotdog from street cart = US$2-3
Newspaper = US$0.50-$2
Cinema admission = US$10-12







Can I drink the water in the US?









Drinking water from taps in the US is considered safe unless otherwise marked. For environmental reasons, try to use a refillable water bottle rather than buying bottled water.







Are credit cards accepted widely in the US?









Major credit cards are widely accepted by stores in the US. Smaller cafes and shops may not accept credit cards, so ensure you carry enough cash to cover small purchases.







What is ATM access like in the US?









ATMs are common in the US, so finding one won't be a problem in most towns and cities.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in the US?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.
