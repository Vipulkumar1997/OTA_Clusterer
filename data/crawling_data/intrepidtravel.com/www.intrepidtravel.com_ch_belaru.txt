Belarus tours & travel













Home

Destinations

Europe

Belarus



This former Soviet republic may still be more Soviet than European, but it has plenty to offer the trailblazing traveller.


Strangely beautiful and remarkably clean, Minsk is a fascinating blend of Stalinist architecture, Soviet-era monuments, museums, theatres, and parks. Outside the capital, pastoral countryside gives way to quaint villages, pristine lakes and forested national parks, including Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park – the oldest wildlife reserve in Europe. Although the country was largely destroyed by WWII, a smattering of centuries-old castles and historic towns offer a glimpse of pre-communist Belarus. Be among the first to discover the understated appeal of this emerging nation.

Culture and customs

Culture and customs




Belarusians are frequently misunderstood. Their reserved and polite manner can, at first, be taken to be unfriendly but get to know a local and you’ll quickly learn hospitality is an important part of their culture. Many Belarusians are generous, kind and keen to show visitors the positive aspects of their country.

In many ways, Belarus is still trying to form its identity. After numerous conflicts with Lithuania, Poland, and Russia, Belarus was absorbed into Russia at the end of the 18th century. Each country left its mark on local culture, though Russia in particular tried to quash any sense of national identity. They banned the Belarusian language, erected Soviet-style buildings and replaced local customs with their own. Even after gaining independence in 1991, the Russian language, images of the hammer and sickle and other remnants of Soviet influence can still be found across the country.

On the other hand, a distinct Belarusian culture and identity are beginning to emerge. Belarusian arts – such as literature, music, and theatre – are now flourishing. A number of impressive museums and monuments dedicated to Belarusian history and culture have also been built. There’s a renewed interest in ancient rituals and festivals, such as Kupala Night and Dziady, which have come to represent national identity, and a great deal of pride is associated with traditional clothes, folk dancing, and rural life.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Belarusian cuisine shares many similarities with its bordering countries, particularly Poland, Lithuania and Russia. Meals are largely meat-based, hearty and feature plenty of filling soups and dumpling. Belarusians have developed a number of ways to create soft and savoury dumpling morsels – kolduni are thick potato dumplings stuffed with meat; kletsky are pastry dumplings stuffed with mushrooms, cheese or potato; while pyzy is a potato dumpling made with cottage cheese.

Potatoes are a dietary staple and used in a variety of dishes, from the above-mentioned dumplings to pancakes (draniki), stews and salads. Mushrooms also feature heavily – perhaps because mushroom picking is a favourite traditional pastime. They might be added to a soup (such as hribnoy sup) or used to make a creamy sauce or gravy.

A short growing season means vegetables aren’t usually found in traditional cuisine, however, some root vegetables such as carrots, parsnips, and beets thrive in Belarus. Various berries and cabbage also feature in many dishes. Pork is the most commonly used meat. It might be stewed or made into sausages and served with pancakes and sour cream.

All-night kiosks and food shops sell beer and vodka 24-hours a day. Crystal luks and Belaya Rus are among the best local vodkas. Another local favourite is a fermented drink called kvass. Local stores sell a bottled version of kvass year-round, though it’s best enjoyed fresh from street vendors in the summer.

Must-try foods in Belarus

1. Machanka

This hearty pork stew is usually served with pancakes, which are rolled up and dipped into the stew like bread.

2. Borshch

Popular across Eastern Europe, borshch is a hot beetroot soup. Belarusians usually add chunks of meat and potatoes to their version and top it with sour cream. Served cold, it’s called kholodnik.

3. Draniki

A dietary staple, these fried potato pancakes can be made plain or stuffed with meat, often pork, or mushrooms.

4. Kvass

A fermented drink made from malt, flour, sugar, mint, and fruit. This refreshing drink used to just be available during the summer, though bottled kvass is now available year-round in shops and grocery stores.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Located on the eastern edge of Europe, Belarus shares its border with Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. Much of the terrain is flat and low-lying, crisscrossed by thousands of lakes, streams, and rivers, including the mighty Dnieper River. About one-third of Belarus is covered in thick forest. Rich and rare wildlife, glacial lakes and old primeval forest are preserved in four national parks, including the UNESCO-listed Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park. Large stretches of swampy marshland occupy the south, including an off-limits area contaminated by the Chernobyl disaster. The rest of the country is largely made up of cornflower fields and picturesque villages.








Shopping

Shopping




Belarus is not particularly known as a shopping destination. Stores tend to lack choice and are often overpriced, though if visiting a Belarusian shopping centre is on your travel itinerary, try Stolitsa Shopping Centre in Minsk. This three-level underground mall houses some of the best stores and boutiques in the city.

A better idea would be to shop for traditional arts and crafts. Belarus has a strong tradition of producing linen products from flax, which grows in abundance in the country’s vast fields. Shopping linen goods such as tea towels, tablecloths or bags both support the local industry and makes a good eco-friendly buy.

Belarus is also known for its intricate straw crafts, such as woven baskets and traditional hats. Matryoshka dolls (Russian nesting dolls) are more famously associated with Russia but they are popular in Belarus as well.

Minsky Vernisazh is an outdoor market in Minsk and a great one-stop-shop for folk crafts as well as Soviet-era military trinkets. Keep in mind that markets usually accept cash only and bargaining is accepted.








Festivals and events in Belarus

Festivals and events in Belarus




Many of the biggest festivals in Belarus celebrate the country’s rich and vibrant heritage. Some of the best ones to keep an eye out for include:

Kupala Night (Ivan Kupala Day)

Many Eastern Slavic countries celebrate the summer solstice (on June 23 or 24) with Kupala Night, however it has become a symbol of national identity for locals in Belarus. Part Pagan, part Christian, part theatrics and part games, people wear flower wreaths and traditional clothing as they sing, dance, and jump over campfires to purge their sins and improve their health. Festivities take place along rivers and banks across the country.

International Festival of Arts (also know as the Slavonic Bazaar)

This celebration of all things Slavic draws performers from dozens of countries to Vitebsk each July. The festival, which promotes peace and mutual understanding through art, gets bigger each year. Vitebsk becomes abuzz as hundreds of concerts and performances take place in venues across the city. Vendors also pop up in streets and squares selling kebabs and kvass.

Dziady

Each October or November, Belarusians honour their deceased by visiting the graves of dead ancestors. An ancient Slavic tradition with pagan roots, Dziady has also come to represent resistance to the Soviet regime and a revival of Belarusian nationalism. In 1988, the first mass demonstration against Soviet rule was held on this day. Today, a memorial for the victims of Soviet political repression is held in Kurapaty each Dziady.

Victory Day

One-quarter of Belarusians died during WWII, which makes this festival celebrating the defeat of Nazi Germany particularly poignant. Each year on May 9th, the whole country celebrates with battle re-enactments, concerts and flower-laying ceremonies. A huge parade takes place in the nation’s capital, with a fireworks display over Victory Square in the evening.

Belarus experiences a temperate continental climate, meaning it has four distinct seasons. Winters are cold and snowfall can occur any time between December and March. Summers are warm and pleasant, though thunderstorms can develop on hot and muggy days. So long as you are willing to deal with the occasional thunderstorm, the summer months of June, July and August are the best time to visit, when temperatures can reach highs of 25°C (77°F). Don’t worry about dealing with high season crowds – most travellers are yet to discover this beautiful nation.

Can I use my mobile phone while in Belarus?









Mobile phone coverage is generally good in Belarus. Ensure global roaming is activated with your service provider before leaving home.







What are the toilets like in Belarus?









A mix of Western-style flushable toilets and squat toilets can be found in Belarus. Keep in mind that most flushable toilets can’t handle toilet paper. Instead, make sure to put used toilet paper in the bin provided. Public toilets are common but you may need to pay to use them.

Simple meal at a local restaurant = USD 7

Are credit cards widely accepted in Belarus?









Credit cards are usually accepted by hotels, large retailers and tourist sites but are less commonly accepted at markets and smaller cafes and hotels. It’s a good idea to carry enough cash for smaller purchases in case credit cards are not an option.







What is ATM access like in Belarus?









ATMs are widely available throughout Belarus. Cities and large towns have more ATM access than small villages or rural areas, so plan ahead before travelling out of urban areas.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling to Belarus?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip.
