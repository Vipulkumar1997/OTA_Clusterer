Caribbean sailing




Typically the haunt of America’s rich and famous, sailing in the Caribbean is now officially open to all.

There’s a reason this equatorial paradise draws so many people each year in search of some R&R. Nowhere else will you find that unique blend of sultry Latin culture, postcard-worthy beaches, colonial history, world-class diving and lip-smacking Caribbean food. And what better way to explore the island chains and tiny archipelagos than your own private catamaran? Book a sun-soaked sailing Caribbean vacation today, then thank us tomorrow when your friends go green with envy.

Highlights of the Caribbean











Discover Cuba’s hidden archipelago

While not as well-known as its Caribbean neighbours, Cuba’s Canarreos Archipelago is home to stunning fine white sand beaches and turquoise waters filled with marine life. Very limited access to phone and internet means you can spend your day tracking iguanas on deserted islands, lounging on deck chairs (mojito in hand, of course) and tucking into freshly caught lobster dinner as the sun dips on the horizon.

Explore on the
Cuba Sailing Adventure











Drop anchor at Dead Man's Bay

It sounds like something from Pirates of the Caribbean, but Dead Man's Bay is the real deal. When the British Virgin Islands need a beach for their postcards, they usually turn to Dead Man's Bay. Park your yacht just offshort and spend the day chilling on chalk white sands or paddling in the warm shallow waters. No pirates guaranteed.

Explore on the
British Virgin Islands Sailing Adventure











Take a dip at The Baths

Take a few volcanic leftovers, leave them to cool for about 70 million years, then flood the area with warm blue waters and you have something similar to The Baths – British Virgin Island’s most photogenic spot. Park your yacht close to the massive boulders, go for a snorkel, then hike through the ‘Caves’ to the white sands of Devil’s Bay.

British Virgin Islands Sailing Adventure







Life on the boat

Curious to see what life in the Caribbean is really like? Here’s what to expect onboard an Intrepid sailing tour.










Welcome to your new floating home – a catamaran with up to four twin-share cabins, three shared bathrooms and two hot showers. Each boat comes with plenty of deck space, a communal lounge area and kitchen below decks.











Steaming bowls of pasta, fresh spicy tacos and a mountain of pancakes for breakfasts, anything is possible with one of our resident expert chefs on board. Bon appetit!











Learn the tricks to ‘tacking’, ‘reaching’ and ‘coming about’ with your skipper and perhaps try putting your new skills to the test while helping to sail the boat.











Stretch out on deck and relax with a good book in hand while the winds carry you across wide open waters. Getting hot? Ask your skipper to drop anchor for a refreshing dip.











Head ashore during the day and discover the history and culture of each destination with your skipper. Every tour gives you plenty of time to get out and explore on your own while also offering optional activities.











Incredible sunrises and sunsets are all in a day’s work in the Caribbean. Hang out with your new crew while soaking up the sun’s last rays, then stay up late swapping stories over a glass of rum.















Meet your skipper














'I’ve sailed since I was a child. I was lucky enough to professionally skipper my first yacht at 21 from the UK to Southern Spain, though I’m sure I was skippering rubber rowing boats long before that! For me, it’s the fresh air and sense of self-dependence that draws me to sailing. I’ve always felt closer to the real world on water than I ever have on land. It just makes sense somehow.'  – Dean,

British Virgin Islands
























'Since my first visit over 30 years ago I’ve had a fascination and love affair with the Bahamas…everything from the gin clear water to the friendliness of the native people, the sea life, history, the loyal “pot cake” island dogs, the uncrowded unspoiled anchorages….and did I mention turquoise is my favourite colour?'  – Judy,

Bahamas

FAQs





When’s the best time to visit the Caribbean?









If you’re looking for sunny weather and smooth sailing (and who isn’t?) the best time to
head to the Caribbean
is December through to April. With more sunny days on average than any other time of the year, you’re increasing your chances of a rain-free trip. It’s worth remembering that topography of each island plays a part too: mountainous islands will attract more cloud cover, while chances of clear skies increase around the smaller archipelagos.

Cuba Sailing Adventure,
November 2017

Paulette Baker

Sailing in Cuba was a great experience but be prepared for 2 long days at sea. The beaches are beautiful and the waters warm and inviting. The snorkelling is good and itt was amazing to swim with a pod of wild dolphins who turned up to see who we were.

Bahamas Sailing Adventure,
May 2017

Sam Malhotra

Fabulous, once in a lifetime trip!  The Bahamas was one of the most beautiful locations I have ever been to, the weather was incredible and sailing enabled us to see The Bahamas in a really special way - getting into remote spots, breathtaking snorkeling everyday and some truly unique opportunities to interact with the natural world!  Skipper Judy is a complete star - she looked after a very international group with relaxed confidence and charm that engaged the group and inspired trust.  In particular, she helped me (a novice snorkeler) gain confidence in the water and so enabled me to have one the of the most spectacular experiences of my life!  Adriann (our cook) added even more warmth and personality by not only conjuring up delicious food and drinks every day (incredible!) but by also spending time to get to know everyone and look after them on an individual basis.  Between them, they created a fun, friendly and incredibly comfortable environment and made the trip for me.  I really can't recommend this trip enough!

If you love being on the water and seeing lots of sea life then this trip is for you. As a group everyone got along and we all talked about how great it was to get to know Judy and Adrian.

I have an amazing experience and checked a few things off my bucket list. I got to see a lot of wildlife including my favorite swimming with a sea turtle. I suggest keeping an open mind because you will have to share a bed with a stranger. It is a bit roughing it with the showers but it was well worth it. My bank card did not always work so bring enough money that you would need in advance. And also bring money to tip the cook as well, it was not included in the tipping. Wear lots of sun cream and smile and laugh!

This trip has been awesome. A week in paradise aboard of a dream catamaran. Enjoy many snorkeling spots, exploring little island villages and anchorages on dream beaches. All you need for this amazing adventure are swimwear, flip flops, some t-shirts, sunscreen, and sunglasses. An experienced crew will take care of the rest.

This is a spectacular sailing experience in a spectacular location. Judy, the skipper is a happy, enthusiastic, inspirational woman, with hips of sailing knowledge and experience. Adriann, the chef is a brilliant guy, spoiled us to the limits with his wonderful food and constantly took care of us. We had a small, but great bunch of people and had lots of fun be it while snorkelling, feeding sea pigs or playing card games in the evening. I had a wonderful time and fell in love with emerald waters of the Sea of Abaco. I'd definitely recommend this trip to anybody who loves sea, sunshine and fun!

Pack light... be prepared for anything and open to everything!   It's an amazing opportunity to learn new cultures and meet new people.  The destinations are amazing, but , it's the new friends that make the most impact!

Darren Seyler

If you are an avid snorkeller, then this trip is exactly what you are looking for. We snorkelled every day and visited some amazing reefs. Spending a week on a caravan was also a unique experience, but there were also many opportunities to go ashore as well. Judy, the Captain of the Abel,  is a very experienced sailor, and knows the places we visited like the back of her hand. All this and the fact that Adrian, the cook, was a certified chef, and a really good one at that, made the trip one of the best trips I have ever experienced! Sailing with Adrian and Judy was an absolute pleasure.
