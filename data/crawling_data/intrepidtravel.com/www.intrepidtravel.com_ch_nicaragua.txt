Central America

Nicaragua



Central America’s largest, but least densely populated, country overflows with natural beauty.


It can be hard to choose between chatting with monkeys, climbing volcanoes or picking a banana straight from the tree. The locals are incredibly welcoming and you’ll find new friends at every turn.

Best time to visit Nicaragua




There are three distinct regions in Nicaragua: the Pacific coastal area, the north central mountains and the Caribbean lowlands, also know as the Mosquito Coast. Temperatures and rainfall vary depending on the region. Typically, the dry season is from December to May. Between June and October, the countryside is lush and fresh but humid. March and April are the hottest months, even in the north central mountain area. The Mosquito Coast experiences heavy rainfall even in the dry season.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment



Central America’s largest country is blessed with one of the most pristine and varied landscapes in the region. Most famous are its perfect coastlines (both Caribbean and Pacific) and Lake Nicaragua with its 310 islands. There are jungles, volcanoes and beaches to explore and with
Honduras
to the north and
Costa Rica
to the south, Nicaragua is in good company.

Top 5 Island Experiences in Nicaragua

Top 5 Island Experiences in Nicaragua



1. Beach Bliss

Lying back on a perfect sandy beach is, quite literally, the least you could do while in paradise. For slightly more strenuous activities, take a dive into the Caribbean, Pacific or Lake Nicaraguan waters; or get to know the fishermen as they haul in their daily catch.

2. Get Fruity

Head inland to taste the real treats of Ometepe’s volcanic soil. Wander through watermelon crops, pick bananas off the tree, inhale the smell of citrus and gaze over miles of coffee plantations.

3. Climb a Volcano

If those steamy peaks have you hankering after toasted marshmallows, pack your sense of adventure and head uphill. Volcano Maderas reaches 1340m and a climb up here is certainly not for the faint hearted.

4. Monkey Around

Go on safari, island-style, and spot howler monkeys, colourful parrots and diverse plant life.

5. Go Petroglyph-ing

The call of Lake Nicaragua’s islands have been attracting people for centuries. Discover cultural artefacts strewn across the islands and try to decipher the petroglyphs’ meaning.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

5. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

6. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

7. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

8. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

9. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
