El Salvador Explorer,
September 2017

Melanie Roberts

This tour gives you a good taste for each three countries. Very different from North America, so been with a tour was ideal, as the guide has lots of local knowledge and knows all the places to visit making it all easy. Knowing the basics of Spanish is helpful.

Review submitted 27 Sep 2017











El Salvador Explorer,
May 2017

Zeynab Ozbek

Friendly, informal but basic trips that include just enough tours and give the traveller plenty of options to choose what they wish to do and see, but still arrange these with local companies they have used previously.

Best time to visit El Salvador

Best time to visit El Salvador



The coast can be hot all year round making it a haven for sun lovers. To cool down, head inland to higher altitudes where the climate is milder, but rarely cold. The dry season (November to April) is an ideal time to explore. For spectacular afternoon storms, come during the wet season (May to October).








Geography and environment

Geography and environment



The home of the point break, El Salvador’s biggest natural attraction is its beaches. Drag yourself away from the waves of the Pacific and you’ll find volcanoes, lakes and cloud forest aplenty. El Salvador is bordered by
