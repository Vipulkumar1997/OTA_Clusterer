Argentina



Visitors come to Argentina and fall in love with the leafy boulevards, hip galleries, elegant architecture and effortlessly smooth citizens of Buenos Aires.


But it's important not to forget the other delights of Argentina - the Pampas that remain the realm of the gauchos, the icy wilds of Patagonia, thundering Iguazu Falls and the vineyards of Mendoza. Argentina's captivating cavalcade of natural environments is simply astounding.

Buenos Aires to Rio Unplugged,
November 2017

Richard Hulett

This trip was not physically difficult for over 65 year olds. Provided you are generally mobile. But a flexible outlook is required. Group will be international and the accommodation and transport good but varied.

Local culture of Argentina

Local culture of Argentina



Like many other aspects of Argentinian life, its culture and customs are influenced by the waves of European immigration that landed here in the 1880s and during the two World Wars. As a result of immigration, parts of the country feel notably more ‘European’ than other areas of South America.

Argentinians are famously affectionate, loud, passionate about football, and big fans of a good plate of homemade spaghetti. They have strong ties with family and friends, and the major religion is Catholicism.

As a general guide, these are some key things you should know about Argentina:


A kiss on the cheek is the most common way of greeting someone – particularly a friend but it’s not uncommon between strangers, particularly if being introduced by a mutual friend. This is true whether it’s female on female, female on male or male on male.

If you befriend someone, expect a farewell hug and greeting hug thereafter. Again, this is true whether it’s female on female, female on male or male on male.

Expect to be late. Being late for social or cultural events is almost fashionable in Argentina but it can be an annoyance for travellers.

Siesta time is still common, particularly in provinces such as Mendoza, San Juan, Salta. Shops may close from 1pm to 4pm and reopen until around 8-9pm. Dinner with locals can be very, very late. Having dinner at 9pm, 10pm and 11pm is perfectly normal and accepted in Argentina, but can cause a few rumbling tummies with travellers. The best thing to do is keep some snacks with you and try and fall into the local pattern.

Nightlife is well and truly nightlife. Pubs, clubs and events don’t kick off until 1-2am…no kidding!

The majority of Argentinians are Catholic (between 70-80%), and you should be respectful when visiting churches, cathedrals and religious events. The dress code at religious sites is quite relaxed and no one will get in trouble for attending mass in t-shirt, shorts and thongs. However, closed shoes and trousers are preferred. Swimwear is a big no-no and it can be very offensive to the locals.

The Falkland Islands war is a topic that still evokes raw emotions amongst Argentinians and it's well-advised not to raise the topic with people you don’t know.









Shopping guide to Argentina

Shopping guide to Argentina



Leather goods are normally top on the shopping list of every traveller to Argentina – and rightly so! The quality of leather products is excellent and prices can be significantly cheaper than at home. The most popular items are jackets, handbags, shoes, boots and belts. A word of warning though – be wary of cheap imitations!

Argentina is also home to Malbec, a purple grape variety that is used to produce premium wine. A bottle or two of this popular tipple is never a bad move – particularly when you can pay between USD 5-10 for a good quality one!

If shopping works up an appetite, indulge your sweet tooth with a box of alfajores – a shortbread cookie sandwich filled with dulche de leche. Dulche de leche is a caramel spread that is hugely popular in Argentina and right around South America. You’ll find it in biscuits, ice creams, cakes and even as a spread on toast.

If you’re looking for an unusual souvenir, consider buying a mate cup or mate set. The spherical shaped mug, which is used to drink tea, is usually made of wood and comes with a metal straw. The unusual shape and material will certainly make it a talking point around the office or at home.

Many travellers are entitled to shop tax free in Argentina – which means 13-14% cheaper shopping. Just shop away, then ask for a Global Blue form from the retailer and process the refund at the airport before going home! You can find more info

Best time to visit Argentina




Argentina's temperate climate means it experiences four distinct seasons. Summer (December to February) is the best time for visiting Patagonia as the weather is at its mildest. In contrast, summer can be very hot and humid in Buenos Aires, with spring and autumn offering milder weather. Autumn is a good time to visit Mendoza, Cordoba and the Lake District. The busiest times to travel in Argentina are during the main vacations - January, February and July.

Top 5 Tango Spots of Argentina

1. Confiteria Ideal

Be charmed by the grand building, old waiters, genuine tango classes and shows that this Buenos Aires institution has been producing for more than 100 years. It might be a bit rough around the edges but authenticity is guaranteed in this historic gem.

2. Barrancas de Belgrano

On the weekends, head to this leafy park at dusk to see unpretentious locals tango as the sun sets. Try out your tango steps, mix and mingle with Argentines and tourists, and enjoy the casual, fun vibe that proliferates under the park's gazebo.

3. Plaza Dorrego

This relaxed San Telmo favourite is a top spot for alfresco people-watching, tango viewing, wine drinking and socialising.

4. La Catedral

For a slice of old Argentina, head to this bewitching warehouse of kitsch where you can learn the art of tango with locals amid walls of old posters and a giant glowing, red heart. Lessons are taught in Spanish and while the dancers here may not be technically great, their passion and love of tango is unquestionable.

5. Caminito

Purists may dismiss La Boca's showy street performers as 'tacky tangoists' but the colourful streets, flamboyant moves and suave outfits do have a bit of flair and provide quintessential Buenos Aires photo ops.

Eating and drinking



Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.
As many other aspects of Argentinian culture, its cuisine has been heavily influenced by European immigration. Mix Spanish and Italian favourite dishes with Argentina top quality (and affordable!) beef and dairy products and you have a combination worth jumping on that long-haul flight for. For the low-down on all things food in South America, check out our guide that we put together

Things to try in Argentina

1. Asado

With Spanish origins, asado describes succulent barbequed meat, slow-cooked on a metal frame over an open fire or a bed of hardwood charcoal. In Argentina, asado is in equal parts a dish and a social gathering – both of which you will want to experience.

2. Mate

A tea-like beverage made from the leaves of the yerba mate plant, is typically consumed in Argentina from a hollowed-out gourd and drunk through a metal straw. It is common to share mate between friends in Argentina, so don’t be surprised if someone offers you a sip!

3. Chimmichurri

A piquant combination of diced garlic, chopped parsley and oregano, olive oil and vinegar, this classic Argentinean condiment is the quintessential accompaniment to grilled meat.

4. Fernet and cola

According to a recent survey, Argentina now consumes over 75% of all fernet branca produced globally. This bitter, aromatic Italian spirit is certainly an acquired taste, yet an essential ingredient of any self-respecting Argentinean asado gathering. Most commonly served mixed with Coca Cola.

5. Alfajores

Argentina’s favourite sweet biscuit. Two round shortbreads, filled with dulce de leche (a decadent caramel made from condensed milk), often coated in chocolate.

6. Helado

Argentineans take ice cream seriously. Do not miss helado de dulce de leche, the national flavour of Argentina.

7. Pizza

Yes, pizza. It’s impossible to ignore the Italian influence in Argentina’s culinary repertoire, with a huge wave of Italian migration at the beginning of the 20th century. Keep your eye out for fugazetta – a type of Argentinean pizza with a cheesy base and topped with onions. You will not find this in Italy!

Common scams:

Snatch and run:

This scam is where a thief (either quietly or sharply and fast) snatches victims belongings such as phones and cameras resting at a restaurant or café’s table – particularly while seating outside. While dinning outside, make sure you keep your belonging in your bag and your bag at your feet.

Ride-by:

This is a common scam in Buenos Aires where a thief riding a bike or motorbike snatches a traveller’s camera or bag. To avoid this, walk on the shops side of the footpath and keep back from the street when waiting to cross a road.

Stain on shirt:

This is a sophisticated form of pick-pocketing where passer-by “accidentally” spills a drink or food on unsuspecting victims. The thief then offers help cleaning up robbing you from your belongings in the process. If this was to happen to you, simply keep walking, accept no help from strangers.

Taxi:

The vast majority of taxi drivers in Buenos Aires are honest and hardworking people. However, there is a small number of them that will target travellers overcharging them or handing back counterfeit bills. To avoid this problem order taxis from hotels, restaurants or flag them at official taxi ranks.

Toilets in Argentina are modern flushable toilets. It's a good idea to carry your own soap and toilet paper as these aren't always provided in public toilets.

Bottle of beer in a bar/club = 60-80 pesos, 1lt: 120-150 pesos
Glass of wine in a restaurant = 50-70 pesos
Simple lunch = 150-200 pesos
Dinner at a restaurant = 250-350 pesos (in a basic restaurant)

What is ATM access like in Argentina?









ATMs are readily available in Argentina's big cities and towns. Rural and isolated areas will have fewer ATMs, so be sure to have enough cash before travelling out of urban areas.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Argentina?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip.
