Win a CHF 3.500 travel voucher to explore Asia

Tropical beaches and temple-topped mountains; ancient cities and booming metropolises; neon Love Hotels, fried grasshoppers and the craziest traffic you’ve ever seen – is there a more diverse destination than Asia?

Lucky we offer a huge range of small group tours all over the continent – from family trips in Vietnam to foodie adventures in South Korea and expertly guided treks through the Himalayas.

Even better? We’re offering you the chance to win a €3000 Intrepid Travel voucher to put towards the Asia trip of your choice. Yep – you’ll get to choose when, where and how. Japan by bike? Indonesia by sailboat? Ah, the possibilities! Just enter your details in the form and cross those fingers (and toes).
