Madrid to Marrakech,
November 2017

emily naylor

Fantastic trip, covers so much. Don't ignore the 'pack light' suggestions. Also I'd definitely recommend the extra nights, pre and post tour for in depth city exploring. Madrid and Marrakech are both such interesting and uniquely beautiful cities and they deserve your attention.

Transport in Spain

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Spain, you may find yourself travelling by:







Train

Spain’s trains are a reliable, fast and cost-effective way to travel around (and between) the cities. Many Intrepid trips in Spain incorporate rail travel, giving passengers the chance to take in the scenery and interact with locals and fellow travellers.

Best time to visit Spain

Best time to visit Spain




The months of May, June, September and October are ideal for visiting Spain. July and August, can get extremely hot (particularly in the south) and is the peak period for Spaniards to travel. During these months there is a mass exodus from the cities to the coast. The ‘Costas' become a hive of activity and the cities are fairly deserted.

Generally, pleasant weather can be found in different areas of the country, depending on the season. Why not retreat to the north of Spain and enjoy the beaches and mountains in the height of summer? In winter, the north can become quite cold so perhaps this is the time to enjoy the mild winter of the south?








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Spaniards are known for their love of food, passion for partying and penchant for siestas. This is the home of vibrant fiestas, flashy flamenco, heaving nightclubs and wild foam parties. But it doesn’t end there - to visit Spain is to be welcomed into a world of creative genius. From visionary architects to passionate painters, controversial film directors to literary greats, Spain has a strong creative tradition evident in the gothic cathedrals, abstract art and much-loved movies to come out of this nation. Spain can lay claim to such influential names as Dali, Goya, Miro, Picasso, Gaudi and Almodovar, so travellers can expect to be spoilt by Spain’s many cultural treasures.

With most Spaniards being Roman Catholic, Easter, Christmas and other religious holidays are observed. Additionally, different Patron Saints are honoured by regional areas – with cities and villages celebrating with bonfires, feasts and parades. Many regional areas of Spain are culturally different from others (especially the Basque and Catalonia areas) where unique traditions, customs, holidays and language are observed.










Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Food doesn’t get much better or fresher than in Spain. An abundance of fresh seafood, vegetables, fruits, wines and pastries ensures there’s plenty to try in the bars, restaurants, cafes, street fiestas and markets of Spain.

Things to try in Spain

1. Tapas

Who would have thought that little bowls of seafood, pork, beef, vegetables and olives could be so filling? Have fun hopping to different tapas bars, trying classics like patatas bravas, croquetas, pulpo a la gallega and jamon serrano.

2. Wine

Don’t leave without trying a glass of tempranillo or sherry, both native to Spain. The Jerez area is famous for its sherry varieties, so have fun visiting local cellars for some taste testing.

3. Beer

Although Spain has a strong wine culture, local beer is still a great choice, especially on a hot summer’s day. Try Moritz, San Miguel or Estrella for a refreshing afternoon beach treat.

4. Coffee

Spaniards serve their coffee espresso-style, which is perfect considering the amount of caffeine required to stay up partying with the locals until the sun rises.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Located in south-west
Europe
, Spain shares borders with
France
,
Andorra
,
Portugal
,
Morocco
and Gibraltar, as well as the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Occupying most of the Iberian Peninsula, Spain’s topography is mainly a blend of mountains and low-lying plains. Spain’s coastline and islands are world-renowned, and draw in millions of tourists who come to bask at the beaches during the day and party all night long. Tenerife, Ibiza, Mallorca and Menorca are among the most popular with tourists chasing sunshine and good times.

Spain’s major cities (Madrid and Barcelona) are busy, urban centres, yet have managed to retain their historic charm while encouraging contemporary development. In comparison, Spain’s vast countryside offers picturesque landscapes dotted with rustic villas, traditional stone cottages, olive groves, farms and rivers. Life is slower here – perfect for hiking, indulging in fresh produce and enjoying the sense of peace that often can’t be found in big cities.








History and government






×

History and government




Spain has a rich and complex history. As conquerors (and the conquered), Spain has seen many different outside influences come and go via war, invasion, immigration and trade. From the Moors to the Romans, the British to the Portuguese, Spain has been influenced both by its neighbours and by far-flung lands. This is evident in the different styles of architecture, art, cuisine and culture that are present in modern-day Spain. Emerging from social upheaval, civil war, international conflict, devastating pandemics and terrorism, Spain’s spirit is both irrepressible and irresistible.








Top 10 Must-Try Foods






×

Top 10 Must-Try Foods




1. Albondigas

This dish of meatballs swimming in a spicy tomato sauce is a Spanish tapas staple. Typically made from a combination of veal and pork mince, they are simple to make and even easier to eat.

2. Olives

The hills of Andalucia are covered in olive groves, making this region a top place to savour these salty delights. You don’t have to go far to find them, a wide variety of olives and oils can be found in the markets, restaurants, farms and shops of Andalucia.

3. Paella

This delectable combination of rice, chorizo, mussels, prawns and saffron is a firm favourite with travellers, and rightly so! Although a speciality of the Valencia region, quality paella is available throughout Spain.

4. Sangria

Jugs filled with chunks of apple, lemon and orange floating in spiced red wine are the perfect accompaniment to a golden, Spanish sunset. But it doesn’t end there – Sangria is a one-way ticket to extended late night revelry.

5. Calamares a la Romana

This dish of deep-fried, crispy calamari is popular in the coastal regions of Spain. Eat a plate of it at a beachside restaurant or head to a bar and include it in your tapas mix.

6. Churros

For a sugar hit, try Spain’s version of the donut. Churros are sweet crunchy strips of deep-fried goodness, dipped in chocolate for extra calories! Find them at open-air food stalls and cafes.

7. Jamon

Spain is world-renown for its legendary jamon (cured ham). You’ll find salty jamon hanging in shop windows, displayed at markets and featured on menus all throughout Spain.

8. Gazpacho

For a fresh, healthy and oh so Spanish dish, you can’t go past Gazpacho. This raw, chilled tomato soap is a cool answer to Spain’s summer heat.

9. Tortilla de Patatas

Potato tortilla (or Spanish omelette) is a slice of authentic Spanish culinary tradition. A simple dish that’s often served at tapas, it’s a great option for vegetarians wanting something hearty.

10. Sherry

Native to the Jerez region of Spain, locals call this dry, fortified wine ‘vino de jerez’. When visiting the area, stop at cellar doors to sample the world’s best straight from the source.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Home of cult-fashion brand ZARA, Camper shoes, Lladro porcelain, Mango clothing and some of the best wine and olive oil in the world, shopping in Spain may not be cheap but quality is pretty much guaranteed if you stick to authentic brands and handmade goods, rather than fake imports.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Spain

1. Leather

Spain is known for its excellent leather products, which generally offer good value for money. Bags, belts and footwear are the best picks, and will often last a lifetime.

2. Moorish Mementos

Elaborate Moorish-style decorated tiles, jewellery and scarves are great buys when travelling in Seville, Toledo, Cordoba and Granada.

3. Modern Art

With such rich artistic traditions, Spain is a good place to pick up a souvenir piece of art to hang at home. Whether it’s an iconic reproduction from a museum or an original piece from an up and coming artist, there’s enough variety here to satisfy most tourists.










Festivals and Events in Spain






×

Festivals and Events in Spain




Las Fallas

Valencia’s Las Fallas is a sizzling cacophony of colourful firecrackers, smoky bonfires, roaring rockets and massive effigies. Celebrated each year in honour of Valencia’s patron saint, this is a week of fiery fun and extensive late night partying.

Wine War

Every June, the Spanish town of Haro explodes into a Wine War known to locals as ‘Batallo de Vino’. Unforgiving residents pump red wine out of water pistols, hoses and other vessels in this grand example of wine warfare. Be warned: no one is spared - this is not a spectator sport!

La Tomatina

A relative newcomer to the Spanish festival scene, La Tomatina draws in travellers, tourists and the world’s media who come to see ripened tomatoes splattered across the city of Bunol. Thousands of people cram into the narrow town plaza to smash tomatoes into each other – a chaotic, strange and super fun experience
