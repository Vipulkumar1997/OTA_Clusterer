Africa




Isak Dinesen wrote, ‘When you have caught the rhythm of Africa, you find that it is the same in all her music.’ And it's not just the tribal drums, but the rhythms of the land: the sound the Serengeti makes as it wakes each morning, a mountain gorilla rustling through the Rwandan jungle or the thunder of wildebeest hooves across the Masai Mara. Kick back on the chalk-white beaches of Zanzibar, chat with vendors in the spice-filled souqs of Marrakech and watch plodding elephants from the snowy summit of Kilimanjaro. Africa is calling. Come and get rhythm.

Reflections from the road: Kenya and Tanzania Overland

Travelling overland through East Africa is something special. There’s very little between you and the world – and on safari, that world is pretty wild. Lucky you’ve got an expert local crew and small group of fellow travellers to share in the experience. Across the plains of the Serengeti and the Masai Mara, through corn fields, mountains and remote villages, one traveller reflects on her trip through
Kenya
and
Tanzania
. This is
overland adventure
– Intrepid style.






Podcast – East Africa Overland with Intrepid

What should I pack for a safari? What are the toilet facilities like? What do you do if there’s a lion in your campsite? Two Intrepid travellers answer the big questions about East Africa overland travel in this 30-minute podcast, recorded in a tent in the heart of the Masai Mara. They discuss how to prepare for a trip (packing, visas, health) and what to expect on the ground (camping, game drives, life in the truck) – plus run through their personal highlights of two Intrepid Basix tours: the 8-day Serengeti Trails tour in Tanzania, and the 8-day Kenya Wildlife Safari. It’s kind of like a chat with your most helpful friends.
