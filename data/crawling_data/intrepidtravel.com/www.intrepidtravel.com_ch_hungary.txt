Hungary



Hungary offers travellers a slice of classic, Central European grace and grandeur.


With cobbled streets, charming castles, magnificent concert halls and historic churches, Hungary is all class. But what might surprise travellers is that Hungary is also a burgeoning wine-producing region, home to bucolic villages, thermal lakes, steaming hot springs and markets filled with organic produce - what's not to love?

Cycle the Danube,
September 2017

Lorraine Stirling

The trip was great, just make sure you do a bit of practice, and if your feeling tired, just get on the bus.

Review submitted 08 Oct 2017











Cycle the Danube,
August 2017

Deborah Leiter

Intrepid is a great way to travel in a small group for an affordable price.  You tend to meet more like minded people while enjoying a cultural mix of travel companions.  I had never done a bike trip,  but this was definitely the right decision!

Best time to visit Hungary

Best time to visit Hungary




July and August are the busiest months for tourists in
Europe
, outside of these times it tends to be less crowded. The Hungarian summer is warm, sunny and unusually long, but the tourist areas tend to get very crowded in late July and August, so some of the best months to visit are May, June and September. Hungary can be a little wet in May and June, but spring is just glorious. Autumn is beautiful, particularly in the hills around Budapest and in the Northern Uplands. Hungarian winters are typically cold and bleak, with museums and other tourist sights often closing.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Located in Central Europe, landlocked Hungary shares borders with
Slovakia
,
Ukraine
,
Romania
,
Serbia
,
Croatia
,
Slovenia
and
Austria
. While most of Hungary is flat, there's some mountainous terrain to be found in the north and near the Austrian border. While Hungary has no coastline, the country is rich in rivers, brooks, lakes and hot springs, with the Danube and the Tisza flowing through, as well as other tributaries. Blessed with a vast amount of arable land, Hungary has an extensive agriculture/viticulture industry, with vineyards, orchards, farms and grazing livestock a common sight when travelling out of the city.








Classic Castles of Hungary

Classic Castles of Hungary




Top 5 Classic Castles of Hungary

1. Vajdahunyad Castle

A blend of many different architectural styles, this urban castle located in Budapest showcases Gothic, Romanesque, Baroque and Renaissance features. Modelled on a Transylvanian castle, this unique building is now home to a museum dedicated to Hungarian agriculture, wine making and forestry.

2. Fisherman's Bastion

Providing exceptional panoramic views of Budapest, this white stone castle-like structure was built in 1905. Retaining a distinct 'Disney-like' air, this charming building has winding staircases, towers, parapets and a conical roof - hallmarks of all good fairytales!

3. Festetics Palace

This Baroque palace located in Zala County may technically not be a castle but definitely has all the opulence and grandeur of one. Built in the 18th century for the wealthy Festetics Family, this palace is now home to a coveted book collection (considered the greatest surviving aristocratic library in Hungary) as well as a museum and concert hall.

4. Castle of Eger

This ancient castle has survived invasions, explosions and the ravages of time to become one of Eger's most popular attractions. Surrounded by cobbled streets, the panoramic views from atop the fortress walls are splendid in clear weather.

5. Brunswick Castle

Built in 1775 for Count Antal Brunswick, this grand neo-gothic castle once played host to Beethoven. Now surrounded by a nature reserve and home to a museum, church and research institute, this impressive castle just outside of Budapest is well worth a day trip.

Responsible Travel

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

8. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
