Central & South America food tours




It’d be hard to find a continent with more fun and flavour packed into it – from bittersweet cocoa in Oaxaca to a heavenly dulce de leche in Buenos Aires, are a smorgasbord of surprises. We’ll introduce you to Malbec winemakers in Mendoza and teach you the secrets of Peruvian ceviche. Que bueno.

Real Food Adventure - Mexico,
November 2017

Jasmin Schoch Kumar

Very interesting trip where we had the Feeling that we experienced a broad variety of things in a short time but without rush. Good Balance between included activities & meals and free time. We Extended our trip for 2 more days at the last place on the itinerary; Mazunte and we would recomend it to other travellers too.

Real Food Adventure - Mexico,
October 2017

Ashleigh Fitzgerald

If you enjoy food, this is definitely the trip for you. There are a wide variety of options covered on the trip from central to coastal Mexico. The use of local produce and vendors ensures fresh and flavoursome food. A great way to be introduced to Mexico!

Real Food Adventure - Mexico,
October 2017

Debbi Chodyniecki

This tour offered everything that we were looking for and more, especially since we were lucky enough to be there for Day of the Dead.  The food was so flavourful you didn’t want to stop eating.  We tried everything from tongue tacos, tamales, chilaquiles, ceviches, churros, grasshoppers (which are delicious with beer), fresh tuna, chocolate, moles, mezcal and so much more.  We never went hungry.  The planned activities were all a lot of fun and we thoroughly enjoyed them all.  We especially liked the taco crawl, the cooking class and the boat ride followed by ceviche and guacamole making.  Pack your walking shoes, your appetite and your sense of adventure and enjoy!!
