Tailor-made holidays



Tailor-made is all about creating the perfect holiday for you.

We will work with you to design your itinerary from scratch, whether you want to explore Vietnam from top to bottom, trek Peru’s Inca Trail and discover its Inca Heritage, or get up-close-and-personal with Costa Rica’s wildlife.

A tailor-made holiday offers complete flexibility. You can choose the dates, activities, accommodation, transport, special highlights and things you’ve
always
wanted to see – and we will work hard to deliver it to your budget, whatever that might be.

We have a range of accommodation options to suit all budgets and wishes, from homestays to jungle lodges to indulgent beach properties. We can also guide you on whether it’s best to get from A-to-B by plane, train or any type of automobile. Our favourite part? We’ll let you in on all of our secrets about the best real-life experiences to include – that might be a day with a local tribe in the Ecuadorian jungle, the locals’ market that visitors don’t know about or dinner with a Thai family.

We have the operational capacity, and expertise, to make your dream trip a reality at a great price.

So whether you are a couple looking for a romantic getaway, a family wanting to experience the world together, or a large group looking for an interest-specific trip (photography, cycling, food, corporate etc.…), we can help.

Want more info? Call our team of specialists; Jo, Rena and Vicky are here to guide you through every step of planning and booking the holiday that's right for you. Contact us on 020 3308 9763.

Intrepid private groups – why we’re special

Founded in 1988, Intrepid has nearly 30 years’ experience of taking travellers to far-flung corners of the globe. Our operational credentials are second-to-none and you’ll have the full backing of our worldwide team 24/7.

We have a network of local suppliers, who will pull out every stop to make sure your trip runs smoothly. You’re in safe hands.

We’re especially proud of our leaders and guides - born and raised in-country, they know the destination better than anyone. So you’ll do more than just see a place, you’ll live it. We deliver lots of fantastic experiences while travelling responsibly. We’re passionate about the world we live in and we strive to travel sustainably.

One of our greatest assets is our team of specialists. They have travelled to and researched, the countries we offer so they know the hidden treasures within each one. They have been planning people’s dream holidays for many years. We can take you to the little noodle bars, hidden galleries and family-run guesthouses that others can’t find.

They will make recommendations on where to stay, what to see and how to get there. We also have
a few suggested itineraries
that will help to provide that first inspiration.

You have our commitment that your personal specialist will design, book and deliver your ideal trip. This can take months from the first phone call until you board your flight and you can count on your specialist every step of the way. We know how much time it can take to plan the perfect holiday, so we’ll take the hassle out.

Meet the team









Jenny Hendry, Groups and Specialist Product Manager

After a long-ish jaunt around Australia, South America and South East Asia, I decided the travel industry was for me and got myself a job writing brochures. Since then I have planned itineraries, and made sure all of them ran well, for a number of adventure and specialist companies. During that time, I’ve climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, Ararat, Elbrus and Toubkal, led groups in Morocco and Brazil, and travelled to all sorts of different and exciting places – including Vietnam, Iran, the Arctic, India, Uzbekistan, Cuba, Botswana, to name a few… I love seeing the insider view of the destination, and that’s exactly what I love about Intrepid!










Victoria Wilkinson, Groups Sales Specialists

At the age of 18 I decided to pack-up my rucksack and go off travelling around Australia for a year. When I got back, I wasn’t ready to settle so spent the next few summers sailing around the Med working as a Flotilla hostess and delivering yachts. The winters were either spent in South Africa or skiing. When I decided to come back to the UK, I worked for a sailing company for five years and travelled to some wonderful places including the British Virgin Islands, St Vincent, Croatia, Italy and Turkey. From here I moved to Intrepid and have never looked back! I have been fortunate enough to visit Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and my latest trip, Borneo. I love our tours as you get a real insight into the countries you’re visiting whilst immersing yourself in their culture.










Joanna Reeve, White Label and Groups Sales Specialist















How to book a private group





1. Find your inspiration









If you’re looking for a private departure of one of our existing group trips, search the website for one of our 1,000+ itineraries and let us know which one you’re interested in.

If you’d like us to create a tailor-made itinerary just for you, we can either start from scratch, with a few ideas from you as to what you’d like us to include, or use one of our suggested itineraries as a starting
(Link).
They’ve all been planned by our team of specialists to make sure you experience the country’s highlights and hidden treasures.







2. Get in touch









Call, email or fill out our online form, giving us a few details on what you’d like from your holiday and we will take it from there. If you contact us via our website, we’ll call or email you back as soon as possible to discuss your requirements in detail.

3. Itinerary planning









For private departures, we’ll make sure we can deliver a pre-existing trip on the date you wish to travel. The idea is that you will experience the itinerary as many others have enjoyed it before you, but sharing those special moments just between you and your friends.

If you’re creating your very own tailor-made holiday, your specialist will work with you to design your trip – choosing your international flights (if required), hand-picking accommodation, working out how best to get between each destination and finding those distinctive experiences to show you the real side of the country you’re visiting. We can guide you as much or as little as you want and we will keep tweaking it with your feedback until it’s just perfect.

We’ll give you a detailed itinerary, inclusions and price so you can see exactly what you’re getting.







4. Confirm your holiday









Once you’re happy with your trip, we will take a deposit and start to confirm all of your holiday arrangements. We will keep you up-to-date as we put the finishing touches to your trip of a lifetime.







5. Departure









If you’ve got questions at any time, you can always call your personal specialist who will be looking after your booking from start to finish. They will know all about your holiday and be able to answer or find out anything you may wish to know. We will send you final information about your trip about three weeks before departure.







6. Enjoy your holiday









Your trip will be run by one of our close network of local suppliers. They will do everything they can to make sure your holiday is perfect, and you’ll also have the back-up of a 24/7 global operation. Our on-the-ground team, leaders and guides really are second-to-none.






Frequently asked questions





What’s the difference between a standard group trip and a private group?









On a standard group trip you travel on a set date and itinerary with other people who you may not know. A private group – whether that’s a private departure or tailor-made - is yours exclusively for your family and friends.







What’s the difference between a private departure and a tailor-made itinerary?









On a private departure, you travel on one of our 1,000+ pre-designed group trips on a date of your choice. The idea is you experience the itinerary as many others have enjoyed it before you, but sharing those special moments just between you and your friends.

A tailor-made holiday offers complete flexibility. You can choose the dates, activities, accommodation, transport, special highlights and things you’ve
always
wanted to see – and we will plan you an itinerary for your budget, whatever that may be.







Do you go anywhere in the world?









Intrepid has 1,000+ group trips that cover most of the world. We can plan a private departure for you on most of these. There will be exceptions, usually because logistics and price make it prohibitive to offer the trip but, as a rule, we can do it!

For tailor-made, the suggested itineraries you see on our website are in our favourite destinations. We know these countries well and can deliver a fantastic, bespoke experience in each of them. Because we’re Intrepid, we also have a vast network of global suppliers and trust them to operate wonderful holidays for our customers worldwide. If you don’t see an itinerary or country on our website that you fancy, call us, and we’ll most likely be able to help you.







Can you book international flights?









To and from the UK - yes, we certainly can. And we only add a nominal fee to do it. You can also book your own flights, if you wish. Those travelling from outside the UK would be best to book their own, because it’s likely to be cheaper.







How much will it cost me?









For private departures, it depends on which trip you’d like to travel on. For bigger groups – eight upwards – we can often give you the itinerary at the price you see on the website. We also offer a discount for larger groups, and can include a free-of-charge place for 10+ people, so it might work out cheaper.

A tailor-made itinerary is designed to your budget, so you set the price. You tell us what you want to spend and we will do our very best to deliver your itinerary to that specification. We also have to be realistic – 5* hotels are, of course, a lot more expensive than a hostel. But we have lots of ideas, knowledge and operational experience to help you get the holiday you want at the price you want – and we’ll make suggestions to help you achieve that. For example, we might suggest using a train or local bus for one journey, rather than a private charter; that way you save money, as well as getting a fantastic local experience!







What type of accommodation will I be staying in?









Whatever you choose. We can book anything from homestays to jungle lodges to indulgent beach properties. We always try to use locally-run, characterful properties where we can.







How will I get around?









We use a variety of transport to suit the itinerary, destination, terrain and budget for the trip. We could take you from Ho Chi Minh City to Nha Trang by overnight train, or plane. Hop aboard a local bus in Thailand, or sit back in the comfort of an air-conditioned vehicle in India. 4WDs are a great way to safari and camels are the ships of the desert. Getting there is all part of the fun.







How does it work when I get there?









If you’ve asked us to, we will make sure someone is there to pick you up on arrival at the airport and take you to your first accommodation. Here, your leader or guide will brief you on your itinerary. From there, Intrepid takes care of the logistics. Together with our local suppliers, we will arrange your accommodation, transport, guides and excursions, where they are included. We will smooth the way, so you can get on with enjoying your travels.

You’ll have the full backing of our 24/7 emergency contacts. The joy of a private group? As it’s just you and your friends if you do want to make a slight tweak to the itinerary along the way, such as an extra photo stop, we’ll do our best to accommodate…







Does the Intrepid loyalty programme apply on a private group?









Yes, it does!
