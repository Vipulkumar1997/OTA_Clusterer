Asia sailing tours




Our Asian sailing trips follow a simple recipe. Start with a generous scoop of aquamarine water and secret strips of golden sand (remember to remove all traces of tourist crowds). Throw in a handful of rare corals and tropical fish, then add a dash of nautical navigating. Leave to simmer while you nap and work on that Thailand tan, then take off the heat and slow it right down with a guided trek to some jungle-covered ruins. Serve with a sizzling stir-fry courtesy of your on-board chef and a jaw-dropping island sunset for good measure. Want to try the recipe for yourself? We’ve got just the sailing tour for you…

Highlights of Asia sailing











Explore the caves of Ko Hong

Ko Hong is regarded by those in the know as the most beautiful island on the Andaman Coast. And that’s a big call. Most tourists need to organise day trips from Krabi to visit Ko Hong’s limestone cave system and secluded beaches, but not you. Pull up the catamaran and go for a swim right off the deck, or wander ashore and start exploring.

Phuket Sailing Adventure











Hang with Moken fisherman on Bo Cho island

If you want to picture Burma’s Myeik (Mergui) Archipelago, try to think of Thailand about 150 years ago. Well away from the tourist trail, islands like the beautiful Bo Cho are time capsules inhabited by the Moken – a tribe of free-diving fisherman who live off the land (no phones, power or internet required). You won’t find a port like this anywhere else.

Myanmar (Burma) Sailing Expedition











Hike to a waterfall on Ko Phangan

Ko Phangan is one of our favourite Thai islands, and Than Sadet one of our favourite waterfalls (you know you’re doing well when generations of Thai royalty have visited you for a dip). Hop off your catamaran and hike along lush river trails on your way to Than Sadet. Cool off in the falls, then relax at sunset with a beachside barbecue on Ko Phangan.

Sail Ko Phi Phi to Phuket







Life on the boat

When cruising the waters of the Andaman Sea, a twin-hulled catamaran is our vessel of choice. The size of the yacht may vary depending on the group, but the boat will usually have four twin-share cabins, 1-4 shared bathrooms, hot water showers and flushable toilets. Most meals, including lunches and dinners, are included on our Asia sailing trips, prepared by our resident chef on-board. Life on the boat is designed to be flexible: take a turn as skipper or kick back with a mai tai and a island sunset – it’s up to you.

Meet your skipper














'I’ve been skippering boats since I was 21. I’ve sailed the Indian and Atlantic oceans, the Mediterranean and Caribbean seas, and now the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. Sailing has to be one of the most peaceful forms of transport on the planet. If you have not experienced it, you’ll never know how incredible this feeling is. I see sailing as a great adventure. No two days are ever the same. You become acutely aware of your surroundings and the calming effect of the ocean.' – Michael,
Myanmar (Burma)



















Best time to travel

Thailand is lucky in that it’s very close to the equator and outside the cyclone zone of the Pacific and Indian Ocean, which means calm waters and idyllic sailing almost all the year round. The dry season (November to April) is generally the best choice however: there’s less chance of monsoonal rain and the balmy 30 degree days make for some wonderfully refreshing swims off the back of the boat. During the wet season (May to October), winds are better for sailing, but heavy rains can often blow in unpredictably. We run two sailing trips: on the west coast Nov through April, and on the east coast May through October.







Reviews











Sail Phuket to Ko Phi Phi - Quad Share,
November 2017

Denis Duval

Excellent relaxing way to travel, no packing or repacking,  travel light, remember to pack something for sea sicknesses if susceptible or inexperienced.

Sail Phuket to Ko Phi Phi - Quad Share,
November 2017

Judith Martin

This is a great trip to unwind and relax. You will find a lot of time to sit and contemplate life. Take a book! I took the three day option and was happy with that. Had I taken the longer option, personally, I think I would have risked becoming a bit bored.
