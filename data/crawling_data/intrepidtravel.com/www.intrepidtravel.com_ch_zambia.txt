Zambia tours & travel

Destinations

Africa

Zambia



Zambia is home to emerald green national parks with abundant crocodile, elephant and hippo populations.


While the village communities holding centuries of traditional wisdom will stop you in your tracks, it's Mother Nature's 'Smoke that Thunders' (known as Victoria Falls to most) that steals the show as Zambia's standout attraction. Adrenaline-charged sports, markets full of tribal mementos and thrilling safari adventures play worthy supporting roles to Victoria Falls show-stopping spectacle.

Best time to visit Zambia

Best time to visit Zambia




August, September and October are some of the best months to spot wildlife, though the days heat up towards the end of this period, especially in the national parks. For cooler weather and greener landscapes, May to August is the time to visit as the weather is cooler but still dry. Wet season generally runs from November to April. At this time many of the national parks are closed and the animals are harder to spot.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Landlocked Zambia shares borders with Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
Tanzania
,
Botswana
,
Zimbabwe
and the Democratic Republic of Congo. While Zambia is one of the most urbanised countries in
Africa
, there are still areas of natural beauty to enjoy, with woodlands, savanna, grassland and forested national parks providing a home to mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and insects. As the source of the mighty Zambezi River (which flows through five other countries), Zambia can lay claim to one of the world's longest rivers. World Heritage-listed Victoria Falls (which is shared with neighbouring Zimbabwe) is an iconic feature of the Zambezi, inspiring awe and wonder for centuries.








Top 5 Adventure Activities in Zambia

Top 5 Adventure Activities in Zambia




Top 5 Adventure Activities in Zambia

1. Canoeing

Going on a canoe safari is a must-do adventure when travelling in Zambia. Take advantage of the Zambezi's many channels and estuaries and glide along, spotting animals, admiring the scenery and stopping for breaks along the way.

2. Bungee Jumping

Here's an adventure option for travellers with nerves of steel. Bungee jumping is a popular adrenaline sport for tourists visiting Zambia, with the Zambezi providing the perfect 'landing' (or dip) for brave jumpers. While not suitable for everyone - fit, healthy travellers with a lust for pushing their limits will love it.

3. Gorge Swinging

With plenty of sheer cliff walls and deep gorges, Zambia is the perfect place to try gorge swinging. Considered a little less intense than bungee jumping, this is a great way to have a memorable time while avoiding the deep panic and fear often induced by bungee jumping.

4. White Water Rafting

The powerful Zambezi provides low and high rapids suitable for experienced and novice rafters. Bring your energy and fitness, as this adventurous option isn't for passengers - you'll need to paddle hard and hold on tight at times.

5. Scenic Flying

Seeing Victoria Falls from a helicopter or micro aircraft may break the budget - but to experience the wonder and majesty of one of the Seven Wonders of the World from the air is surely worth the investment. This may not be one for those with a fear of heights (or flying) but definitely a worthy experience for thrill seekers with a sense of adventure.

Can I drink the water in Zambia?

Credit cards are accepted by some large hotels and tourist-driven establishments but usually not by smaller places like markets, shops and cafes. Ensure you have other modes of payment when travelling in Zambia.

Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Zambia?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Zambia

Be considerate of Zambia’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
