Ghana



West Africa's gregarious Ghana is home to historic slave forts, wildlife to rival East Africa and some of the world's biggest (and brightest) markets.


From the lively city bars and clubs to lush national parks abounding with elephants and golden beaches just waiting to be enjoyed, Ghana is a dynamic destination to meet with enthusiasm and energy.

Best time to visit Ghana

Best time to visit Ghana




Ghana is hot and humid all-year round, with the temperature usually around 30 degrees Celsius - the perfect, tropical climate to hit the beach. The most comfortable time for travelling is during the dry season from November to March, when less rain is present. April to October is the wet season with the amount of rainfall varying throughout the country.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Located in West Africa and bordered by
Burkina Faso
,
Togo
, Cote d'Ivoire and the Atlantic Ocean, Ghana has a vast array of different terrain. From savanna and woodlands in the far north to steamy rainforests, palm-studded beaches and lagoons, modern cities and tiny villages, travelling through Ghana reveals a cavalcade of topographic change. Lake Volta and Lake Bosumtwi act as important sources of water for farmers, with many rivers, tributaries and channels carrying the water throughout the country. Furthermore, Lake Volta's Akosombo Dam generates large amounts of hydroelectricity for Ghana and neighbouring countries.








Street Food Favourites of Ghana

Street Food Favourites of Ghana



Top 5 Street Food Favourites of Ghana

1. Fufu

This Ghanaian staple can be found all over the country and isn't only a food but also an eating utensil too. Consisting of pounded cassava or yam, mixed with mashed plantain, fufu is rolled up into a ball and used to scoop up soup or stew, then eaten - a tasty multi-tasker!

2. Jollof Rice

Thought to have been created in Gambia, this big pot of seasoned rice is one of Ghana's most flavoursome dishes. White rice is cooked in coconut oil and stock with tomato paste, sale, spices and chilli to create a spicy, hearty, dish perfect for backpackers on a budget.

3. Kelewele

This dish of fried plantains spiced with cayenne pepper, chilli powder, nutmeg, cloves and salt is a popular snack food sold by street vendors and market stalls. Choose to eat alone as a snack or served with stews or rice.

4. Kenkey

This staple dish popular throughout West Africa is made by fermenting ground maize, then cooking in banana leaves or foil. Kenkey can be served alongside hot sauce, gravy and/or fish.

5. Kyinkyinga

With beef representing a luxury to many in Ghana, this West Africa version of the kebab is a true street food delicacy. Featuring seasoned meat (usually beef), onions, peanuts, capsicum, tomatoes, garlic and chilli served with rice, salad or bread, this is a tasty meal full of flavour.

Credit cards are used in Ghana, but not all establishments will accept credit. Large hotels, restaurants and tourist service providers usually accept credit cards, but expect smaller operators and shops to accept cash only.

Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Ghana

1. Be considerate of Ghana’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

4. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

5. When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

6. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

7. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

8. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

9. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

10. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
