Discover Israel  & the Palestinian Territories,
November 2017

Bharathi Narayanan

In relation to this particular trip, we would suggest that it is best to do this trip in autumn or spring . As there is quite a bit of walking to do, it might be difficult to do it in summer.

Discover Israel  & the Palestinian Territories,

Abby-Maree Clayton

Great trip - so much packed into a week. Helped to get a better understanding of the region. Completely fell in love with Israel and definitely will be going back! This is a great introductory tour.

Best time to visit Israel

Best time to visit Israel




Israel generally has a Mediterranean climate, with the summer months providing loads of sunshine and scorching temperatures that can reach 40ºC. June to August usually sees the highest temperatures, with milder weather prevailing during autumn (September and October) and spring (April and May). Winter (around November to March) provides cooler temperatures and light rain. Snow fall can sometimes occur in the highlands and even in Jerusalem. It's important to note that travel will be affected during religious holidays, with the majority of shops, businesses and public transport shutting down for major Jewish holidays. Israel offers a range of things to do in any weather, from skiing in the highlands to enjoying the sun near the Red Sea, so no matter what time you choose to go, it's a great place to travel all year round.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Travelling through Israel will reveal a wide range of environments and terrain. With beaches and chalk cliffs on the Mediterranean coastline, parched desert in the north, mountains in the south and fertile valleys in the centre of the country, Israel has diverse landscapes to traverse, depending on which part of the country you're visiting. Bordering
Egypt
,
Jordan
, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the people of Israel live in vastly different ways - from the modern, upwardly-mobile population of faced-paced Tel Aviv to the quiet simplicity of village life in the mountains.

Gorgeous Gardens of Israel




Top 5 Gorgeous Gardens of Israel

1. Haifa's Baha'i Gardens

Haifa's incredible UNESCO World Heritage-listed gardens dedicated to the Baha'i faith are among the world's most impressive. Featuring more than 450 plant species, landscaped terraces, shrines and breathtaking views of the city and the sea, these immaculately maintained gardens are infused with a sense of spirit and grace.

2. Yarkon Park

This huge public park provides a place of recreation, respite and relaxation to Tel Aviv's busy citizens. Home to sports, outdoor concerts, picnics and festivals, there are many different elements at play - from rock gardens, to rivers, tropical gardens, lakes and an impressive six acres of cacti.

3. Wohl Rose Park

With more than 400 different varieties of rose, ancient mosaics, fish ponds, sculptures and waterfalls, Jerusalem's Wohl Rose Park is one of the only rose parks in the whole of the Middle East.

4. Akko's Baha'i Gardens

These tranquil gardens filled with historic buildings, potted flowering plants, clean-cut hedges and manicured lawns are cared for with love and precision. Ancient olive groves and sycamore figs add a historic dimension to this horticultural triumph.

5. Utopia Orchid Park

Home to thousands of orchid species from around the world, a beautiful butterfly garden, strange carnivorous plants, spectacular fountains and a plant maze, this vast tropical garden area proves there is much more to Israel than desert.

ISRAEL:
Australia: No - not required

Canada: No - not required
Germany No - not required
Ireland: No - not required
Netherlands: No - not required
New Zealand: No - not required
South Africa: No - not required

It is important to be aware that many Arab and Islamic countries deny entry to any person that has evidence of a visit to Israel. Syria, Iran, Libya and several other countries are included in this list. If you are planning to visit any of these countries with the same passport you must request that your Israeli ‘tourist visa’ be stamped on a loose leaf ‘Form 17 L’ instead of in your passport. Likewise, if entering Israel through the land borders with Jordan please ask the Jordanian officials not to stamp an exit stamp in your passport. If you have evidence in your passport of visits to certain Islamic countries, Israeli border officials will scrutinize you regarding the purpose of your visit to Israel. They can sometimes appear difficult and the delay can be lengthy however patience and a friendly demeanor are advised.







Is tipping customary in Israel?









Tipping 10-15% for good service is standard practice in restaurants, bars and cafes. Taxi drivers and other service workers like hotel staff generally don't expect tips.

Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Israel?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Israel

1. Be considerate of Israel’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Dress modestly and respectfully when visiting Orthodox communities and areas. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

3. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with tap or filtered water.

4. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

5. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

6. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

7. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

8. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
