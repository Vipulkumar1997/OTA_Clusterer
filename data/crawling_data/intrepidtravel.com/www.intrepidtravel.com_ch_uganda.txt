Gorillas & Game Parks,
November 2017

Alanna Dennis

Super fun trip. You’ll see all sorts of wildlife that you won’t see at home! Be prepared to be uncomfortable at times, and be aware that the facilities are not always up to a western standard - and know that these things will fade into the background once you look back on the truly exceptional experiences you’ve had, and the stunningly beautiful places and things you’ve seen. Well worth it!!

Gorillas & Game Parks,
October 2017

Katherine Grigg

This trip was incredible, from the socially and environmentally sustainable practices of the whole trip (this was super important us and we were not disappointed once) to the things you experience and the places and animals you get to see. We were in great hands and felt safe, secure and immersed in the experience the whole time. Ken, the cook, was exceptional and very attentive to making sure any dietary requirements are well met and everyone stayed healthy. David, the guide, made the whole trip run super smooth. Kose and Chris driving skills were exemplary. It is honestly worth it and would recommend it to anyone!

Best time to visit Uganda






×

Best time to visit Uganda




For sunshine and hot weather, visit Uganda from late December to late February as this is the dry season. June to September is also a good time to travel as you can expect warm temperatures and little rain. The wet seasons run from March to May and October to November – during this time downpours are frequent and often create less accessibility on roads and within some national parks.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Uganda is home to many different tribal groups, and a wide variety of different customs and traditions can be observed depending on where you travel in Uganda. Spontaneous dance and song is a hallmark of African culture and this is not an exception in Uganda, where tribes and villages will often greet groups of newcomers with rousing song and dance. Greeting others is a very important part of Ugandan culture and not greeting or acknowledging someone you are passing or meeting can be seen as impolite, especially in rural areas and villages. Shaking hands is an appropriate greeting when meeting someone for the first time and often both hands are given for a handshake.

Food or drink is often extended to visitors, even though many Ugandans have very little, and it is viewed as impolite to decline an offer of food or hospitality. Accept willingly and graciously eat or drink what has been offered to you. Generally, most of Uganda’s population lives in rural or regional centres, although urban areas are rapidly expanding and modern influences are infiltrating Ugandan society at a fast rate. With this modernisation, some of the old ways are dying out as younger Ugandans become more adept at using technology, although many still live tribal lives based on hunting and agriculture.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Things to try in Uganda

1. Matooke

This local dish of mashed plantains, often cooked in a nut sauce and served with meat or fish, is a favourite with locals and can be found pretty much everywhere in Uganda

2. Chai Tea

While coffee is grown widely in Uganda, most is shipped out for international sale so locals drink tea instead. Chai tea is popular, which you’ll find at markets, kiosks, cafes and restaurants.

3. Fresh Fruit

Mango, pineapple, avocado, banana, plantain, passionfruit and jackfruit are all plentiful in Uganda. Buy from a market or roadside stall as a refreshing, cheap snack.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Uganda sits in East Africa and shares borders with Sudan,
Tanzania
, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Rwanda
and
Kenya
. Despite being landlocked, Uganda still has access to fresh water via surrounding lakes (Lake Victoria, Lake Edward and Lake Albert). As a well-watered country with rich soil, much of Uganda’s land is used for agriculture and cash crops. Coffee, cotton, tea and tobacco plantations are common sights, as are farms of plantains, corn and cassava. The rest of the country is a combination of woodlands, swamp, forest and savanna, as well as pockets of protected nature reserves and national parks.








History and government






×

History and government




Early History

Inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribes for centuries, it's thought that the Hamitic people from neighbouring countries arrived sometime before 1000 AD, bringing with them knowledge of animal husbandry and agriculture. Migration from neighbouring countries continued, with tribespeople from Kenya and Tanzania flowing into Uganda well into the 16th century, as well as Arab traders moving inland from the coast and Christian missionaries arriving during the 1800s.

Recent History

Uganda came under colonial rule during the late 1800s, and was known as the Kingdom of Uganda under British rule. Colonial rule continued for many years until independence was granted in 1962. From 1971 to 1979, Uganda came under the rule of Idi Amin, hallmarked by a time of economic decline and human rights violations. By the time Amin had fled to Libya, many Ugandans were suffering from extreme economic hardship and social difficulties. Conflicts with neighbouring countries in the 80s and 90s created more turmoil and upheaval, although more recently, Ugandans have enjoyed a time of relative peace with an improved economy largely due to an increase in tourist numbers and agricultural export.








Top 10 Amazing Animals of Uganda

Top 10 Amazing Animals of Uganda




Top 10 Amazing Animals of Uganda

1. Mountain Gorilla

Be transfixed by the wonder and majesty of Uganda’s highly endangered mountain gorillas. The challenging trek through the steamy jungle of the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park is all worth it once you’re beholding these beautiful beings.

2. African Elephant

Population numbers of the mighty African Elephant continue to grow in Uganda’s nature reserves and national parks. Catching sight of one of these brilliant beasts while on a game drive is a truly breathtaking experience.

3. Black and White Colobus Monkey

These curious creatures are fond of grunting, roaring and croaking – so they aren’t hard to find. Look for their white faces in the treetops while walking in Uganda’s national parks.

4. Black Rhinoceros

Although critically endangered, it’s still possible to see black rhinos in the Ugandan wild. Conservation projects have gone a long way in seeing the population numbers improve so with luck, you’ll spot a couple while on a game viewing safari.

5. Leopard

These stealthy predators are relatively difficult to spot as they are masters of staying silent and blending in with the scenery. Watching a leopard stalk prey is a tense, exciting and riveting experience.

6. Lion

There is simply nothing more thrilling than casting your eye on a pride of regal lions. Whether they are lying in the sun or going in for the kill, lions are captivating creatures to watch.

7. Hippopotamus

Hippos are synonymous with the African bush. Spot them lurking underwater and basking on the riverbanks along the rivers and channels of Uganda.

8. Chimpanzee

It’s fun to watch cheeky chimps swinging and playing in unadulterated bliss in the trees of Uganda’s forests.

9. Golden Cat

You’ll be lucky to catch a glimpse of this famously elusive feline. The African Golden Cat is a solitary creature, which favours living alone in the tropical and cloud forests of Africa. If you’re lucky enough to see one, count your blessings as they are simply remarkable.

10. Ostrich

These flightless feathered friends are commonly found in the savanna of Northern Uganda. Be amazed at their size and impressive plumage, as well as their remarkable ability to run at top speed.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Uganda has loads of interesting markets to visit, although many handicraft items are produced in neighbouring Kenya.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Uganda

1. Basketry

The practise of making traditional baskets is quite developed in Uganda. Choose from assorted shapes – from shallow dish-shaped basketry to deeper bowls and baskets. Materials range from raffia to millet and banana fibre.

2. Paper Beads

Throughout Uganda there are many workshops and organisations that sell beautiful and colourful beaded necklaces made from recycled paper. These creations not only cut down on waste by utilising recycled paper, they also usually provide employment for local women.

3. Bark Cloth

Tribes from South Uganda have been creating bark cloth for centuries, and it’s still available for sale. Nice finds include journals, notepads and photo albums made from a combination of bark cloth and recycled paper.








Festivals and Events in Uganda

Festivals and Events in Uganda




Christmas

For Ugandan Christians, Christmas Day is a time of holy reverence and family get-togethers. Most Ugandan’s dress up in their finest attire, go to church for a long service and spend the afternoon and evening eating beef. With many Ugandan’s living simple lives, eating beef is a rare pleasure reserved for Christmas.

Uganda travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Uganda?









UGANDA:
Visas are required by most nationalities, including the EU, US and Australia. Visas are available at point of entry to most nationalities. Some nationalities are required to obtain visas in advance - you MUST check before departure. If you plan to purchase your visas on arrival, you will need new (post 2003), clean American dollars cash and the cost is around US$100. When on one of our gorilla itineraries visiting Rwanda, you may require a double entry visa to Uganda. This is dependent on the border guard of the day and can be easily purchased on re entry from Rwanda for nationalities which qualify for visa on arrival. Please allow US$100.







Is tipping customary in Uganda?









Tipping isn’t mandatory in Uganda but considering that most Ugandans earn little, tips will be appreciated. As a guide, adding 10% in cafes and restaurants is acceptable, although not necessary.







What is the internet access like in Uganda?









Travellers will be able to access the internet quite easily in the internet cafes of Uganda’s capital and large cities, but limited to no access should be expected in regional and rural areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Uganda?









Mobile phone coverage is generally good in Uganda’s large cities and towns, but less so in rural and mountainous areas. Ensure you have global roaming activated before leaving home if you wish to use your mobile phone.







What are the toilets like in Uganda?









Squat/pit toilets are the standard in Uganda, except for western-style flushable toilets that are sometimes available in large hotels and other modern buildings. Carry your own supply of soap and toilet paper, as these are rarely provided.







What will it cost for a…?









Can of soft drink = 1,500 UGX
Bottle of beer = 2,500 UGX
Street snack = 3,000-4,000 UGX
Meal at a cafe = 10,000-20,000 UGX







Can I drink the water in Uganda?









Drinking tap water isn't recommended in Uganda. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water. Ask your leader where filtered water can be found; some hotels we stay in may have drinking water available. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Uganda?









Credit cards are usually accepted by large hotels and western-style restaurants (particularly in the cities) but not by smaller vendors. Ensure you have adequate cash to cover purchases not able to be made on credit.







What is ATM access like in Uganda?









ATMs are easily found in large cities and tourist areas, but are rarer in small towns, rural areas and villages. Be sure to have other payment methods available when venturing out of the city, as ATMs aren't always an option.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Uganda?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Uganda

Be considerate of Uganda’s customs, traditions, religions and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
