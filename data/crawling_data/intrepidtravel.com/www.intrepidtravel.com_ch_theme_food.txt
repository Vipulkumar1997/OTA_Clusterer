Food




Uncover a world of authentic, mouth-watering food tours designed to suit any budget, appetite and time frame. By pairing the classic grassroots Intrepid travel style with a special food focus, our itineraries aim to really get you under the skin of the world's most exciting food cultures. It might be spoiling your tastebuds with flavour-filled curries in
Sri Lanka
, bottling your own wine in
Spain
, making soba noodles in a cooking class in
Japan
, or tucking into Buddhist fare on an overnight monastery stay in
South Korea
.

These are real-world experiences with a foodie twist: one part culture, one part adventure and three parts delicious. From bite-sized trips to gastronomic odysseys, we’ll get you munching, crunching, sipping and slurping just like the locals.

Our Food Adventure tour styles










Real Food Adventures

8-15 days

These are cross-country food tours designed to fully immerse you in a destination's food scene. Taste the freshest market produce, meet artisanal producers, find the best street food and learn the subtle changes in regional cuisine. But although these trips are packed with flavour, we haven't left out the essence of Intrepid travel: each real food adventure is filled with cultural exploration, historic highlights and plenty of grassroots travel. They're just seasoned to perfection - food travel at its best!

Find a Real Food Adventure










Bite-Sized Breaks

2-3 days

If you’re looking to take a bite from a particular region and don’t have a lot of time to do it, Bite-Sized Breaks are for you. They’re more focussed food itineraries, usually 2-3 days each, which dig down into the heart of a specific area. Whether it’s
Beijing’s street market
scene, Lima’s distinct local flavour or the cooking techniques of Northern India. They make a tasty add-on to a longer itinerary, delving a little deeper into what makes a region’s cooking unique. While these food tours may be a little shorter, they pack a punch.

Find a Bite-sized Break










Urban Appetisers

2-6 hours

These are our compact food tours, carefully designed to pack the most flavour into the shortest time. When you arrive in a new city, it’s always a challenge to unearth the most authentic local cuisine. But with Urban Appetisers, we’ll give you a quick 3-4 hour intro into the hidden gems and secret bars that really make a place tick. Cook up a storm in a local family’s own kitchen, kebab crawl your way through Istanbul, or find the trendiest eats in the backstreets of Brooklyn.

FAQs





What food can I expect?









Expect to eat the local way. We didn’t call these trips ‘food adventures’ for nothing. Forget Michelin stars and 20-course degustations – our local leaders will help you get behind the scenes of a local food culture, track down the freshest street food, discover the most authentic local restaurants and reveal the traditions and techniques that make these destinations so deliciously mouth-watering. From lining up with locals for fresh tortillas in a Mexican market to hopping between Logrono’s thriving tapas bars, they’ll show you local food from the perspective of those who eat it every day.







How does a Food Adventure differ to a regular Intrepid trip?









All of our food trips have been designed with one thing in mind – experiencing the best local food on the planet. But we all know that there’s much more to food than just eating it – so whether it’s browsing markets for fresh produce, sizzling up a storm in a cooking class or meeting a local street-food legend, we’ve stuffed your plate to the brim. And once you’ve devoured all the local food you can handle, we’ve made sure our Food Adventures are rolled up into a burrito with the lot so you won’t miss out on the iconic sights and authentic cultural experiences that are found on all our Intrepid trips.







Is there any freedom & flexibility in the itineraries?









Like all Intrepid itineraries, we’ve made sure our food trips provide free time between activities, allowing you to digest a destination either with your group or on your own. You might spend the morning exploring a buzzing local market with your guide and cooking a delicious local dish with your group before heading off on your own to wander the marbled halls of a museum or cycling through ancient alleys. We’ve also left plenty of mealtimes free of organised activities, which gives you the flexibility to ‘get your gourmet on’ at a fine dining restaurant or simply seek out your own ‘real food’ adventure. Needless to say, your leader will be there every step of the way with suggestions and recommendations.







What transport is used?









Sometimes, the best way to eat like a local is to travel like one too. That could mean jumping on a boat to discover the flavours of the Mekong Delta, riding the Tokyo subway to a sake bar or rattling along in a rickshaw in pursuit of Agra’s finest chaats. We love to use local transport because it gives us a chance to experience everyday local life from a new perspective.







What is the accommodation like?









Whether you’re spending the night in an ancient fortress or in the home of a local family, most of our trips include a memorable overnight stay that is designed to make your trip extra memorable. When we do choose to use hotels, all of our accommodation options are in our Original style, which means a mix of 2-3 star establishments that are safe, clean and comfortable.







How do Food Adventures benefit local communities?









It goes without saying that by eating in local restaurants, buying things from street-side sellers and using local guides, our trips help support local economies. But that’s just the start of it. Many of our itineraries incorporate visits to community projects and we offer carbon offsetting on all of our food trips. Above all, we are committed to a style of travel that is culturally, environmentally and socially responsible.

We Extended our trip for 2 more days at the last place on the itinerary; Mazunte and we would recomend it to other travellers too.

Real Food Adventure - Sri Lanka ,

Rahel Kübler

Real Food Adventure - South India ,
November 2017

Mark Limacher

South India was a revelation for me, as I had no idea how different and how culturally rich it would be.  I've spent lots of time in Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia and now see the powerful cultural influence of South India on the surrounding countries. The food, the lavish, mysterious temples and the wonderful Kerala "Backwater" region, kind of a crazy dream of canals, rice fields, water lilies, birdlife, obedient ducks and relaxing accommodation all made this a really fun tour.  Santo, our tour leader, worked hard, in an easy-going way, to makes sure we had a great time.

You don't meet local people as a tourist - most importantly you meet local people directly!
