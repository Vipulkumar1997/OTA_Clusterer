Alaska



Even in the age of the iPhone, planning a trip to Alaska still has that Klondike-y gold-rush feel to it, like you’re setting off into a Wilderness branded with a capital W.


America’s most remote and northerly state, famously bought for 2 cents an acre in 1867, is still a world apart in a lot of ways, from the old mining town of Nome and frontier settlements full of subsistence-hunting locals, to the snowy slopes of Mt McKinley and the bear-studded salmon runs of the Kenai River. Alaska
tours
might not be the right word. In Alaska they call them ‘Adventures’.

Anchorage to Mexico City,
July 2017

Franz Odermatt

Really great trip with non stop activities, Sometimes it was good to relax and do nothing. Everything was organised really well by Jodie. A wealth of knowledge that everyone could benefit from. Paul drove safely sometimes long days and everyone on the bus was asleep. The school bus is not ideal for baggage and equipment for 20 people. A bit thight.
The wildlife and scenery were so much more then I expected and I can recommend to everyone feeling adventurous

Explore Alaska,
August 2017

Danielle Brown

A holiday thoroughly enjoyed. The tour was well planned, with a positive, enthusiastic tour guide. I will definitely travel Intrepid again.

Alaska travel highlights

















Denali National Park




For a lot of travellers, Alaska tours begin and end with Denali. And it’s fair enough. People travel a long way to see a grizzly bear or a moose or an Alaskan wolf, and Denali National Park is odds-on their best chance.






Best of Alaska, 12 days








Alaska Adventure, 14 days











Wrangell-St Elias National Park




Not to be outmuscled by its glitzy northern neighbor, Wrangell-St Elias is
almost
as spectacular as Denali, but with about a 10
th
of the tourists. On our Alaska tours, we’ll set you up with a glacier walk and even a little ice climbing if you’re game (it’s like regular climbing, but colder).

Seward




Only Queenstown on the South Island of
New Zealand
could potentially rival Seward for its picturesque mountain setting: perched on the inky Resurrection Bay and crowded all around by jagged, snow-capped peaks.

MacLaren River




Flowing down from the epic MacLaren Glacier, MacLaren River is one of those Alaskan secrets that’s beginning to get out. We’ll drive through the high alpine country to the Lodge, before continuing via canoe up the river to a remote ‘Glacier Camp’ where you’ll sleep out under the stars.

Valdez




A cracking little adventure town, bordered on three sides by some of the highest coastal mountains in the world (topping 7000ft in some places). Valdez itself isn’t a work of art: it’s pretty flat and industrial as a rule, but it makes a fantastic gateway to Alaska’s best hiking and other outdoor activities.

Best time to visit Alaska



Stuck in a chilly latitude between 50 and 70 degrees north of the equator, Alaska is dark for a lot of the year. The exception is May to late June when the sun shines pretty much all day and night (except for a patch of darkness at around 3am). Peak season for Alaska tours is from mid-June to mid-August, when the temperatures are balmy (by Alaskan standards anyway) and there’s plenty of daylight for exploring. Temperatures should hit around 24 degrees Celsius in the summer time.

Shoulder seasons (April – May and September) are also good, and May in particular comes with very little rain. Overall it’s best to visit Alaska with an open mind about the weather: Alaskans have learned that if they don’t like it, they need only wait five minutes.








How to get to Alaska

How to get to Alaska



Perhaps fitting with its end-of-the-earth aesthetic, Alaska does have a reputation for being difficult when it comes to finding flights. Anchorage is the state’s main gateway, with flights coming in from Chicago, Denver, LA, Vegas, and Portland year-round. In summer you can also find direct flights from Frankfurt, Reykjavik (how’s that for an epic itinerary!) or Vancouver. Obviously you can visit Alaska from anywhere, it’s just a question of stopovers and stamina.

You can drive of course, if world-class mountain vistas are your thing (and since you’re going to Alaska, we’re guessing they are). The Alaska Highway used to be a bumpy dirt road, but these days it’s a paved vein that pumps adventurers in through the British Columbia border. When you touch down and start your Alaska tour, we’ll handle all the internal transfers (in a private vehicle…with heating).
