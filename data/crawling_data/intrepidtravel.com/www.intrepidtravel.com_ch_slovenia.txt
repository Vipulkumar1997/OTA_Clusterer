Destinations

Europe

Slovenia



Known as ‘Europe in Miniature’, tiny Slovenia has a huge heart and a wealth of diversity


The soaring Julian Alps capture a touch of
Switzerland
, the radiating coastline oozes Mediterranean charm and Bled’s sweet island church appears to have come straight out of a fairytale. There is plenty of action for adrenaline junkies, from cycling, hiking and skiing, to canyoning, caving and boating. For those who prefer a slower pace, just sit back and take in the postcard-perfect views.

Best time to visit Slovenia

Best time to visit Slovenia




Slovenia is a beautiful destination no matter what time of the year it is, and every season has its attractions. While the coast heats up over summer, the Julian Alps continue to experience more moderate temperatures. In winter, snow falls over the mountains and can get very cold, but the lowlands and coastal areas of the south enjoy much milder weather. Spring sees bursts of wildflowers through the alpine meadows and autumn brings gorgeous reds and oranges.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Squeezed between
Austria
,
Italy
,
Hungary
and
Croatia
, Slovenia is covered in snow-dusted peaks, mountain meadows and alpine lakes. The Julian Alps dominate the landscape in the north. Further south the limestone Karst hides intricate networks of caves. Slovenia’s Adriatic coastline leads into Croatia.

Top 5 Active Adventures in Slovenia




Top 5 Active Adventures in Slovenia

1. Cycling

Get the legs pumping with a ride around Lake Bled, past 19th-century villas, grand hotels and the cliff-clinging castle. For some more two-wheeled adventures, head out to Vintgar Gorge.

2. Hiking

The Julian Alps beckon to be explored. Hike one of the numerous trails, or take a cable car to Mt Vogel for a bird’s-eye view of the lake below.

3. Canyoning

Slovenia is filled with underground and ‘between’ ground canyoning opportunities. So if you don’t mind small spaces, discover some of Slovenia’s most secret places on a canyoning adventure.

4. River Rafting

Try out some of Europe’s best white-water rafting. But be prepared to get wet.

5. Boating

Hire a traditional pletna and enjoy a boat ride across Lake Bled to its fairytale church. Ring the bell to have your wish granted.
