Short Breaks




Whether it's the ultimate holiday add-on or a mini adventure you seek, Intrepid's Short Break Adventures are sure to tick all the boxes. They are loaded with value, take the hassle out of planning and help you squeeze every last drop out of your next trip away.

Short Breaks are the ideal add-on to a longer holiday – or a mini adventure of their own. With a duration of 2-8 days, they range from beach breaks to guided excursions, or are centred around an experience like hiking or cooking. Departures are frequent and usually guaranteed. Short Breaks are slightly different to our group tours, with the idea being that you maintain a level of independence during down time e.g. at night. You'll most likely travel on a join-in basis, which means you may or may not be joined by others for activities and transportation, depending on demand. However, we do offer some independent options where you'll travel on your own or with your own party.

Asia

Remember that dream? The one that began on a pearly white beach fringed by waters of sapphire blue. Where waves of incense flooded tiny laneways, and in a small village, a rooster crowed until the rice fields were bathed in warm sunlight. But this is no dream. This is Asia - and it will take your breath away
