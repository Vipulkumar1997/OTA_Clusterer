Bali tours & travel













Home

Destinations

Asia

Bali



Over 17,000 islands make up the Indonesian archipelago, but for a lot of travellers, there’s only one that really matters: Bali.


A volcano-dotted, beach-fringed paradise that’s serene and sensational by turns, from the green slopes of Mt Batur to the Bintang bodegas on Seminyak’s main party strip.

For us though, Bali tours are all about the little treasures. An out-of-the-way village stay at Sidemen, reef-diving the impossibly blue waters off Lovina, soaking up some tranquility in the Banja hot springs, or sipping lime-spiked smoothies in Ubud’s organic cafes. As always, when it comes to paradise, the hardest bit is choosing what to do first.

Eliza Fletton

Beautiful Bali & Discover Longbok was two very beneficial trips to experience and learn about the Indonesian culture. You experience and learn much more than visiting the tourist destinations

Beautiful Bali,
November 2017

Robert Chretien

I love using Intrepid. The accommodations are beautiful and run by the local people. Much better than staying at a chain hotel. It is great having a local guide that deals with all the logistics, so you can just relax and have fun. It is also a pleasure interacting with people from across the globe.

Bali travel highlights

















Ubud




Believe the Eat, Pray, Love hype. There’s a reason pilgrims flock to the rice paddies and quiet temples of Ubud, and it’s not just spiritual fulfillment. On our Bali tours, we like to explore Ubud on foot.









Mt Batur




A Bali tour without a
sunrise over the slopes of Mt Batur
is a Bali tour not worth having.
Gunung Batur
(as the locals call it) is an active volcano, just to the northwest of Mount Agung, the island’s tallest peak. We’ll drive you along the crater rim road to a little village we know on the edge of Lake Batur – a picture perfect spot.









Lovina




Not many who make the trip to Bali bother with Lovina, way up on the northern coast. Which is a shame. Lovina is a low-key beachside town, pretty much the opposite of Kuta, which vibrates to a very different frequency. Join our Bali tour for a spot of dolphin watching off the coast, or just chill beachside with a massage and a fruity cocktail.









Sidemen




While 90% of travellers stick to the touristy beaches and late-night bars of Kuta, we prefer a more…authentic approach. Enter the little village of Sidemen. Most of our Bali tours include a stop at Sidemen, and it’s a slice of Balinese life a lot of people will never see: incredible views of Mt. Agung.











Banjar Hot Springs




Imagine eight hissing, stone-carved naga heads, dispensing mineral-rich waters to a shaded pool surrounded by the tropical plants of the Balinese jungle. Tours in Bali often stop off at Banjar because it offers a tranquil counterpoint to some of the island’s crazier urban areas (mainly Kuta and Denpasar).

When to visit Bali

When to visit Bali



Sitting a snug 8 degrees from the equator, Bali’s climate is classic tropics. There’s a dry season and a rainy season, and not a whole lot in between. The best time for a Bali tour (weather-wise) is the July to August peak season, or from December to the first week of January. Although if you’d like to avoid the crowds (and why wouldn’t you) shoulder months like April, May, June and September make an excellent alternative. The weather is dry and slightly less humid, and the island in general is a lot more relaxed. October isn’t too bad either, especially if you’re into water sports like scuba diving, surfing or snorkeling (the rainfall is much lighter than November).







Bali travel FAQs





Do I need a visa for a Bali tour?









Passport holders for most nationalities are now permitted to enter Visa Free for up to 30 days for tourism purposes. In March 2016 Australia and Ireland have been added to the list of countries now exempt from visas for visits for tourism purposes under 30 days. Please check with your relevant consulate or embassy.

Entry requirements: presentation of onward or return tickets, passport which is valid for at least 6 months. Visitors on Visa-Free Short Visits must enter AND exit from certain airports and seaports in Indonesia including: Jakarta (Soekarno-Hatta Airport), Bali (Ngurah Rai Airport), Yogyakarta (Adisucipto Airport) and Surabaya (Juanda Airport). This currently excludes entry and exist from Lombok (Bandar Udara International Airport). Visa-Free Short Visits cannot be extended and cannot be transferred to another type of visa.

Some nationalities are required to obtain a visa on arrival, or in advance. Citizens of countries who aren't on the visa on arrival or visa free lists are required to apply for a visa overseas before travelling to Indonesia.

Nationals of all countries planning to stay for more than 30 days in Indonesia have to apply for the appropriate visa at an overseas Indonesian consulate or embassy before their departure.

Local laws require that you must be able show your valid passport at any time when required to do so by an immigration office. We recommend taking a clear photocopy of your passport photo page, and visa (after arriving), to carry with you.







Should I tip on a Bali tour?









Tipping isn’t compulsory in Bali, or anywhere else in Indonesia. But, like most countries, it’s very much appreciated. Tip as you see fit.







What’s the internet access like in Bali?









In tourist centres like Kuta, Seminyak, Denpasar and Lovina internet access should be fine, and there will be plenty of internet cafes to choose from if your Wifi isn’t up to scratch. In more rural areas, there could be little or no coverage, particularly during homestays. Just remember to plan ahead.







What are the toilets like in Bali?









Again, restaurants and hotels in developed tourist centres will have western-style flush toilets. In more rural areas however, the traditional squat toilet will be pretty common.







Can I drink the water on a Bali tour?









Drinking water from taps isn’t recommended in Indonesia, but for environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water every day. There are a number of filtered canteens you can purchase, or bring a supply of water filtration tablets that you can drop into your bottle wherever you go.







Do I need to buy travel insurance for my Bali tour?









Yep, you sure will. All passengers on Intrepid Bali tours will need to have travel insurance booked before the start of the trip. Your leader will record you insurance details on Day 1, so make sure to bring your policy documents. For more info, check out our
Travel Insurance
