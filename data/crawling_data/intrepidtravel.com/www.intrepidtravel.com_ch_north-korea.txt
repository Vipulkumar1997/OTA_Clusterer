North Korea Highlights,
September 2017

Cyril STURM

With the present hostilities around the Korean Peninsular I still recommend that if u r interested in peculiar or hard to get countries to visit this is 4 u.The roads r in need of repair no seatbelts in bus but u r sometimes the only traffic.Only hardcore travellers should apply. u will b amazed by the cleanliness scenery and they do have a decent beer.

North Korea Highlights,
September 2017

Bob Ross

Organizing a trip to North Korea would be daunting at the best of times, but Intrepid arranged a flawless adventure, even as a third of the participants cancelled out at the last minute because of the rising tensions with America. N Korea detonated a hydrogen blast the week before we entered and fired a missile over Japan the day we returned, but Intrepid ensured that our 6 days in N Korea were free of anxiety or stress.

Culinary Delicacies of DPR Korea

Culinary Delicacies of DPR Korea




Top 3 Culinary Delicacies of DPR Korea

1. Kimchi

Kimchi is hailed as a nutritional powerhouse, packing a healthy punch of nutrients, vitamins and beneficial bacteria that makes it one of the world's healthiest superfoods. But most people don't eat these fermented vegetables for health reasons – it's the uniquely, tasty flavour and versatility that makes kimchi so popular in Korean cooking.

2. Pansanggi (in Kaesong city)

This banquet-style meal of 11 dishes – including rice, soup, kimchi – served separately in small bronze bowls used to be served only to the King and honoured guests in the past. Today it’s served in the traditional Korean style house and at the traditional table setting.

3. Insam dakgom

This delicious steamed chicken is stuffed with world famous Insam (ginseng) and other materials. It’s though to be good for health and one chicken will feed 2-3 people.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for DPR Korea

Be considerate of DPR Korea’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship, memorial halls and special day celebrations.

For sanitation reasons, try to avoid tap water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children. No photos of military personnel.

If you would like to give a gift when on community visits, speak to your leader to find out what, if anything, is appropriate.











Government regulations to be aware of when visiting DPRKorea

All visitors must respect the laws of DPRK and keep to the rules during their stay. You must not do anything that will be detrimental to tourist activities or the government. The country takes it’s image very seriously. Avoid political talk and actions, and negative comments about the country or its people. The government can and will apply the law strongly to anyone that they consider having violated these rules, regardless of their nationality.

Photography around the country is permitted, but images must not bring the country into disrepute. All cameras, mobile phones and laptop computers are subject to search by customs – all images and videos will be inspected. Please be aware of the contents documents or files on devices – especially very personal images, videos or documents – and be sure they will not cause problems at customs or go against the law.
