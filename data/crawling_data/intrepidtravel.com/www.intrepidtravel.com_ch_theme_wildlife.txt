Wildlife




Get closer to nature. From the jungles of India to the African bush, our small group tours take you to the heart of nature. From elephants silhouetted against an Africa sunset to orangutans swinging in the treetops high above, spotting wildlife in any part of the world is a thrilling way to spend your time.

That’s why we’ve created trips that focus on wildlife viewing and get right into the heart of an animal’s world. Stay in a range of accommodation, from safari lodges to wilderness camps for a truly wild experience. We only use expert local guides.

Gorillas & Game Parks,
November 2017

Alanna Dennis

Super fun trip. You’ll see all sorts of wildlife that you won’t see at home! Be prepared to be uncomfortable at times, and be aware that the facilities are not always up to a western standard - and know that these things will fade into the background once you look back on the truly exceptional experiences you’ve had, and the stunningly beautiful places and things you’ve seen. Well worth it!!

Vic Falls to Cape Town,
November 2017

Karen Gregory

The trip was great but I did think that the office staff were not as efficient as they should have been. Be very careful to check all details of a booking and question any vague or ambiguous trip notes.

Vic Falls to Cape Town,
November 2017

Sharon Lovison

AMAZING! That word was used after every activity, after every scenery change and literally after everything that we did.

When I met Victor and Dan for the fist time, all I noticed was their smile. Sometimes you don't need words when you meet people. Dan helped me with my luggage and found me a locker, after that I was now part of the family. 

From Day One, Victor, Dan and Henry were so kind, caring and made me and everyone feel at ease and so welcoming. It was refreshing to only meet someone for a few hours but then realise how comfortable they made you feel. 

We had such a wide range of ages on our trip, but that didn't stop anyone from not being friends. From the first night, everyone just clicked. 

Everyday was different and there was always something to see or do. Victor was very knowledgable and told us as much as he could at each place we went to. Especially on the safaris he was just as excited as we were when we saw a new animal. 

Henry's food on the trip was fantastic. I really didn't think we would get the type of food that we did. On the days that we were out and about and on our own, we often said "It's not as good as Henry's" I never went hungry and hats off to him to make all these different meals and satisfy 17 different people. 

This trip has been one of the best experiences of my life. So many memories. Victor, Dan and Henry made it the best trip possible for everyone and of course the other people on the trip too. I never imagined that I'd see all that I have. It exceeding my expectations way beyond belief.  I cannot recommend this trip to anyone enough, and if you're lucky to have these boys on your trip, then you are in for an amazing trip! There are too many words to describe this trip, just book it and see for yourself!
