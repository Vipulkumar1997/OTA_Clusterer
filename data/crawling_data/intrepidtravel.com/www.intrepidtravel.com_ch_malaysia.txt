Transport in Malaysia

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Malaysia, you may find yourself travelling by:







Bus

Rub shoulders with other commuters while riding a local bus. An easy and economical option, you’ll get where you need to go on the cheap.

Longtail Boat

Hop aboard and cruise down rivers and channels in a classic South-East Asian mode of transport - a longtail boat.

Accommodation in Malaysia

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Malaysia you may find yourself staying in a:







Homestay

Stay with a local family in their traditional home, built on the shore of a peaceful lake. With a chance to explore nearby villages and swim in local waterfalls, this authentic getaway offers immersion in the local way of life.

Best time to visit Malaysia




The climate in Malaysia is generally hot and humid throughout the year. Temperatures do not fluctuate much and stay in the 30s most of the day, dropping back to the mid to high 20s at night. This makes Malaysia a great place for swimming, snorkelling and relaxing in the sun.

Humidity is higher during the wet season and can be quite oppressive for those not used to it. The wet season changes from coast to coast. From November to April, the wet season hits the east coast of the peninsula and it is dry on the west coast. During May to October it is dry on the east coast and wet on the west.

Some people of Malaysia observe Ramadan. If you are planning to travel during Ramadan, it is important to consider that some restaurants and shops will either be closed or operating on reduced hours during this time.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Malaysia truly is a modern melting pot – with Chinese, Indian, Malay, Eurasian and indigenous groups making up the population. With this cultural diversity comes a mix of religions, customs, foods and languages. Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Taoism and Hinduism are the main religions practiced, although most of the world’s religions are represented somewhere in Malaysia. The Muslim call to prayer, Hindu Festivals and Buddhist ceremonies all coexist with relative peace, with the South-East Asian concept of ‘saving face’ leading most people to strive for harmony.

Regardless of cultural background, elderly people and those of high rank in society (business people, government officials etc.) are afforded much respect. Food plays an important part in daily life, with religious celebrations and holidays characterised by family gatherings and elaborately prepared feasts. Alcohol isn’t a large part of Malaysian society (probably due to the significant Muslim population), but is widely available for purchase and consumption.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Malaysia’s melting pot of cultural influences is evident in its cuisine.

Things to try in Malaysia

1. Malay

Delicious roti, chicken rice, spicy sambal eggplant and kopi peng (iced coffee).

2. Baba Nonya/Peranaken Cuisine

Fresh spring rolls, babi chin (stewed pork belly) and Mee Siam (rice noodles).

3. Indian

Aromatic curries, cool lassis, delicious daal and sweet fried coconut balls.

4. Chinese

Hearty noodle broths, Peking duck pancakes and chrysanthemum tea.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Balmy beaches, fish-filled reefs, wild jungles, verdant highlands, relaxed ports, colourful cities and simple villages – Malaysia has it all. Sharing land borders with Brunei,
Indonesia
and
Thailand
, Malaysia’s environment is as diverse as its population. From the urban cityscape of Kuala Lumpur and the colonial charm of Penang, to the old-world streets of Melaka, a journey through Malaysia will reveal changing landscapes and evolving environments.

While the large cities are typically built-up, busy and full of buzz, Malaysia’s provincial towns and remote highlands remain delightfully relaxed, with people living simple lives based on agriculture, animal husbandry or other small enterprises. With such a rich range of environments, Malaysia offers beaches and islands for swimming, snorkelling and diving; jungles and highlands for trekking and adventuring; and villages and cities for exploration and relaxation.








History and government

History and government




Early History

The first recorded historical mentions of Malaysia date back to 7th and 8th-century Sanskrit and Chinese texts. During the following centuries, Malaysia came under the influence and control of Indonesia, Thailand and India – with the accompanying religions, cuisines and languages spreading in the region. In the 16th century, Malaysia came under the influence of Portuguese and Dutch settlers, who increasingly expanded their reach throughout the region to create the Dutch East Indies. Under this influence, Malaysia did well in trade, and flourished as a result of the economic gains of being located on one of the most important trade routes of the time.

Recent History

During the 19th century, the British took control of the Malaysian Peninsula, with the Federated Malay States being officially formed in 1865. Malaysia remained under British rule until Japan invaded during World War II – but once Japan was defeated in 1945, British rule returned and the Federation of Malay was born in 1948. In 1963, the Federation of Malaya formed with Singapore, Sarawak and Sabah to create Malaysia. Only two years after, Singapore became an independent state, leaving Malaysia in its current form. In the 1970s, Malaysia’s economy grew rapidly until the late 1990s, when the Asian Financial Crisis slowed economic growth in the region. The economy soon recovered, and Malaysia enjoyed the international exposure that came with hosting the 1998 Commonwealth Games (held in Kuala Lumpur). Currently, Malaysian standards of living continue to rise, and Kuala Lumpur has emerged as one of Asia’s premier cities.








Culinary Experiences of Malaysia

Culinary Experiences of Malaysia




Top 10 Culinary Experiences of Malaysia

1. Baba Nonya Banquet

The port town of Melaka is known for its unique Baba Nyonya style food. A fusion of Straits Chinese and Malaysian food (with hints of Portuguese, Thai and Indian), chowing down at a Nyonya restaurant is an elaborate affair filled with spicy flavours and tangy sauces.

2. Savour a Street Eat

The streets of Malaysia are filled with locals pushing street carts selling everything from hand-made roti to fresh fruit, delicious satay and steaming bowls of laksa. Malaysian street food offers convenience, variety and flavour on a budget.

3. Taste Some Tea

Traditional tea is made a little differently in Malaysia. Order ‘teh tarik’ and watch as your condensed-milk tea is frothed and cooled by being poured dramatically between two metal cups, which are held metres apart.

4. Tuck Into a Hot Curry

Beef Rendang is a Malay culinary favourite and is made at home, served at restaurants and prepared for special occasions. This spicy curry is packed with lemongrass, cinnamon, cloves, chilli and melt-in-your-mouth beef — an unforgettable fusion of flavours!

5. Seek Out Cool City Eat Streets

The hip cafes and bars of Kuala Lumpur are a great place to mix with locals and connect with modern Asian culture. Head to the Jalan Bukit Bintang area in KL and check out the new-age teahouses, cool cafes and international dining options.

6. Down a Luscious Lassi

With a large Indian population, it’s not hard to find a refreshing Lassi when in Malaysia. Made from yoghurt and fresh fruit, sipping a cool Mango Lassi is the ideal antidote to a humid summer’s day.

7. Relish Some Rice

Chicken–rice is a favourite with locals and travellers alike. Available at small neighbourhood eateries, night markets and from street carts, this option is a great, low-cost meal for travellers on the go.

8. Slurp a Bowl of Laksa

Chicken, prawn, tofu and fish; there are many different varieties of spicy laksa to try while in Malaysia. Noodle types and ingredients may vary around the country - a good excuse to try laksa in every town you visit.

9. Chill Out With a Coconut

Quench your thirst with a fresh coconut juice. Sold at roadside stalls and on beaches, a straw is simply slipped into a stripped back coconut for a refreshing post-swim pick-me-up.

10. Feast on Roti

No visit to Malaysia is complete without encountering roti. Walk down any busy street and the sight of people kneading roti dough at street stalls and shop windows will be common. Often served with lentils, potatoes, onions and rice, roti is an excellent option for vegetarians looking for a meat-free meal.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Malaysia has a shopping experience to suit travellers on all budgets. From dazzling, modern malls and exciting night markets to boutique speciality stores, the opportunity to buy something special is never far away.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Malaysia

1. Kuala Lumpur

The capital’s huge malls offer loads of variety and opportunities to shop. Shoes, bags and accessories are all great buys - from haute couture labels to chic chain-store fashions.

2. Melaka

Home to a diverse range of artisans and craftsmen. Browse the markets, galleries and shops to pick up antiques, art and bespoke items. Handcrafted wooden ornaments, leather sandals, vibrant woven bags and antique coins are the best picks.

3. Penang

Boasts an eclectic mix of sleek malls, independent stores, interesting boutiques and open-air street markets. Head to Little India to source Indian-inspired saris, garlands and silver jewellery or stroll along Rope Walk to find one-of-a-kind antiques and treasures.

4. Langkawi

This island has duty-free status, making it a great place to buy fragrances, watches, cameras and other technology. For art lovers, the Craft Cultural Complex showcases locally made fabric, ceramics, baskets and jewellery.








Festivals and Events in Malaysia

Festivals and Events in Malaysia




Thaipusam

Kuala Lumpur’s Batu Caves light up in honour of the Hindi deity Subramaniam (also known as Lord Murugan). Pilgrims arrive after sunset and watch as brave individuals thread hooks and skewers through their body to carry decorative steel arches to the Gods. This is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before!

Malaysian Grand Prix

For a bit of high-octane fun, see the fastest cars in the world in action at the Malaysian Grand Prix, held near Kuala Lumpur each year.

Ramadan and Eid

Ramadan is observed by the Muslim population of Malaysia. During the ninth and holiest month in the Islamic calendar, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset - refraining from eating and drinking during daylight hours. Eid marks the end of fasting with three days of feasting and celebration.

Malaysia travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Malaysia?









Most nationalities do not need visas to visit Malaysia as a tourist for up to three months. Please check with your relevant Malaysian embassy or consulate.







Is tipping customary in Malaysia?









Tipping isn’t expected in Malaysia. Some restaurants include a 10% service fee in bills. Feel free to leave a tip at restaurants or with taxi drivers if you’re feeling generous – it will be appreciated.







What is the internet access like in Malaysia?









The internet is easy to access in Malaysia’s large cities, with internet cafes and Wi-Fi hot spots quite common, especially in tourist spots, hotels and hostels. Regional areas and rural communities might have little to no internet access, so be aware of this before heading out of the city.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Malaysia?









Mobile phone coverage is excellent in Malaysia’s large cities; however, it may be patchy in regional areas. Ensure you have global roaming activated on your phone before leaving home.







What are the toilets like in Malaysia?









Malaysian public toilets are a mix of western-style toilets and squat toilets. Up-market hotels and malls will usually have both options, whereas rural areas will almost certainly only have squat toilets. Be aware that soap and paper aren't always supplied, so be prepared and carry your own.







What will it cost for a…?









Hawker food snack = 3 MYR
Cup of teh tarik (tea) = 1-2 MYR
Beer in a bar or pub = 8 MYR
Souvenir t-shirt = 10-20 MYR







Can I drink the water in Malaysia?









It's not recommended to drink the tap water in Malaysia. Filtered water is a better option; try to use a refillable canteen or water bottle rather than buying bottled water. Remember to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Malaysia?









Credit cards are widely accepted by malls, hotels and large restaurants in Malaysia. Smaller guesthouses, shops and cafes may not accept credit cards, so ensure you have enough cash to cover purchases in smaller establishments.







What is ATM access like in Malaysia?









ATMs are easily found in large cities and towns but are far less common in rural and remote areas. Ensure you have enough cash before heading to isolated areas, as ATMs might be sparse.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Malaysia?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Malaysia

1. Be considerate of Malaysia's customs, traditions, religions and culture.

2. Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

3. Ask permission, remove your shoes and cover your shoulders with a jacket or wrap before entering a place of worship.

4. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

5. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

6. When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

7. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

8. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

9. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

10. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

11. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.

12. Ramadan is the fasting month for all Muslims. During this month no food, drink or smoking is permitted during daylight hours. While non-Muslims aren't expected to fast, it's recommended to try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public during daylight hours.
