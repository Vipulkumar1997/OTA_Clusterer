Azerbaijan



Think Azerbaijan only holds appeal for travellers looking to tick off every country on the map? Think again.


Imagine an enigmatic country squeezed in between the Caspian Sea and the Caucasus Mountains, scattered with small fishing towns and remote mountain villages far from the tourist trail. Envisage the capital Baku and picture

meeting
Asia
with a Gulf States flair – a brash cosmopolitan metropolis flaunting the latest in futuristic architecture sitting alongside ancient mosques, walled cities and old-world Russian opulence. Think how bemused your friends will be upon hearing of your latest holiday choice. Fascinating, austere and intriguing by turns, this back-of-beyond nation won’t fail to charm and perplex.

Best time to visit Azerbaijan

Best time to visit Azerbaijan



April through to June is the best time to visit Azerbaijan, when the temperatures are warm, the flowers are out, and skies at their clearest. September and October are also good temperature-wise, though the countryside isn’t as scenic. The heat and humidity can be oppressive in Baku during the summer months of June, July and August, and from November to March temperatures can fall below zero.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment



Azerbaijan is a mountainous country on the western coast of the Caspian Sea. Over half of the country’s landscape consists of ridges, crests and foothills, while the remainder is characterised by lowland plateaus and plains traversed by rivers.








Top 5 Iconic Sights in Azerbaijan

Top 5 Iconic Sights in Azerbaijan




1. The Walled City of Old Baku

Constructed sometime in the 12th century, this walled fortress was granted UNESCO World Heritage listing in 2000. A bustling labyrinth of alleyways, old buildings and boutique hotels, where the locals still live and go about their day, it retains the quintessential elements of a medieval town. It’s one of the few World Heritage sights in which you can actually bed down for a night.

2. Shirvanshah’s Palace

This ornate sandstone palatial complex received World Heritage status at the same time as the Walled City (in which it’s located). Largely destroyed by a bombardment, courtesy of the Russian Navy in the 18th century, the Palace has since been meticulously restored and is clearly visible from the sea and the city’s surrounding heights.

3. Maiden's Tower

Another World Heritage-listed sight inside the Walled City, Qiz Qalasi – translated as the Maiden’s or Virgin’s Tower – is one of Azerbaijan’s foremost architectural accomplishments and recognisable emblems. Standing 29 metres high and cylindrical in design, the history of this spiralling and mystifying structure remains a point of debate between historians, while its top offers 360-degree views of surrounding Baku Bay and the town’s alleys and minarets.

4. Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape

The ancient carvings and petroglyphs of the Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape, less than 70 km from Baku, provide a rich and fascinating insight into how life was for people in the area over 40,000 years ago. More than 6,000 depictions of flora, fauna and people engaged in hunting and fishing activities reveal both cultural continuity between prehistoric and medieval times, and seismic geographical change. The site received UNESCO listing in 2007.

5. The Khan’s Palace

Currently on the tentative list of sights seeking World Heritage listing, the former summer residential palace of Shaki Khans is an ornately tiled and patterned two-story structure built in 1797. Renowned for its exquisite stained-glass windows, murals and frescos, the palace’s beauty is only enhanced by verdant natural surroundings.

Azerbaijan travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Azerbaijan?









AZERBAIJAN VISA:

All travellers to Azerbaijan require a visa. It is not possible to get a visa on arrival at Baku Airport or at any land border into Azerbaijan. All travellers must apply for  a Single Entry Tourist E-Visa to Azerbaijan in advance.

We have partnered with The Visa Machine to provide your e-visa for Azerbaijan. This service is included in your trip cost. We advise that you apply for your e-visa no later than 3 months before your trip to allow time for processing. Azerbaijan e-visas are processed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Azerbaijan and usually take around 4 weeks to be processed, with up to 6 weeks in peak travel season not uncommon.



INSTRUCTIONS:

1. To obtain your Azerbaijan e-visa use this link:
http://intrepid-visa-support.thevisamachine.com/

2. Use the Checklist to make sure you have everything you need before you start as you will not be able to save once your start filling in the application.

3. Once you are satisfied you have all information with you to apply for your Azerbaijan e-visa click on the ‘Apply Now’ link and follow the instructions.

4. If you have any trouble with the online form or want to check the status of your Azerbaijan e-visa application please contact The Visa Machine on
visasupport@thevisamachine.com
or during UK working hours on +44(0) 207 148 6402.







Is tipping customary in Azerbaijan?









In established restaurants, bars, hotels and taxis, a 5-10% service charge is usually added to the bill - though feel free to tip more than this for exceptional service. At restaurants where a service charge isn’t included, 10% is the acceptable gratuity. Although tipping at other places isn't mandatory it will be well received, and setting aside a small amount for porters, guides and drivers is also a good idea.







What is the internet access like in Azerbaijan?









Internet cafes with reliable and fast connections can easily be found in all of Azerbaijan’s major cities and towns.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Azerbaijan?









Mobile coverage is extensive throughout the capital and major cities, but pretty much non-existent in the remote mountainous parts of the country. Roaming agreements are in place with most international cellular companies.







What are the toilets like in Azerbaijan?









Clean and flushable Western-style toilets are generally the go at established tourist attractions across the country, though one should be prepared for some pretty ordinary squat/pit toilets elsewhere. Carry your own supply of soap and toilet paper, as these aren’t always at hand.







What will it cost for a...?









1.5 litre bottle of water = .60 AZN
Bottle of local beer = 2.5 AZN
Meal at an inexpensive restaurant = 8 AZN
Meal at a mid-range restaurant = 40 AZN







Can I drink the water in Azerbaijan?









Tap water isn't safe to drink in Azerbaijan. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, bring water purification tablets or ask your leader where filtered water can be found.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Azerbaijan?









Some major credit cards will be accepted at some high-end restaurants and hotels, but it's best not to rely on these.







What is ATM access like in Azerbaijan?









ATMs are prevalent in Baku and other major towns, though won’t necessarily be internationally connected or reliable. Be sure to have other payment methods when visiting the country.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling to Azerbaijan?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Azerbaijan

Be considerate of Azerbaijan’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Only use your right hand for eating and passing things to locals. The left is used for ‘unhygienic tasks’.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered and shoes removed when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water or use water purification tablets.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive and supports the local community.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
