About

The Intrepid Foundation




The Intrepid Foundation is a not-for-profit fund established in 2002 by
Intrepid Travel founders
Darrell Wade and Geoff Manchester. Set up to empower travellers to have a positive impact on the communities they visit, our Foundation now supports over 50 local, grassroots projects around the world. Over the past 15 years, The Foundation has distributed over AU $5 million to projects tackling areas such as sustainable development, human rights, child protection, environmental conservation, wildlife protection, education and healthcare.

The Five P’s

Based on our knowledge and experience, The Intrepid Foundation supports projects in areas where we
know
we can make a real impact. To simplify things, we categorised these projects under five themes known as the ‘Five P’s’:









Planet



Wildlife and environmental conservation.








People



Education, health and gender equality.








Prosperity



Skills training and loans for small businesses.








Peace



Support services for refugees and protection of human rights.








Partnerships



Engaging in collaborative partnerships with other non-profits and businesses.






Our aim

The Intrepid Foundation aims to fully understand the deeper issues in the communities we’re involved with. Because of this, we choose to support established local projects rather than presuming to know what’s needed and where. We’ll always act with integrity and measure our impact. After all, we’re accountable for the trust placed in us by our partners, travellers, donors and beneficiaries.

Why donate to the Intrepid Foundation?

We match all donations dollar for dollar*. When you donate $1, so do we!

We cover all the administration costs, so your donation goes directly to the project you’re supporting

Even the smallest contribution makes a huge difference – this is your chance to give back to the places you’ve travelled and help improve the lives of others

We support local projects directly



*All donations will be
matched
up to a total of AU $400,000 per financial year, with a maximum of AU $1,000 per individual donor. Emergency appeals are not matched unless specified.
