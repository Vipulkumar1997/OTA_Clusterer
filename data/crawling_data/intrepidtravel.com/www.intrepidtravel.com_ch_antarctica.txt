Antarctica



Early explorers didn’t have the luxury of booking their expeditions online.


They just assembled a valiant crew, trained a few huskies and worked on their ‘First to reach the South Pole’ victory speech. These days it’s a bit easier: we run a variety of Antarctica tours between November and March each year, cruising in comfort on state-of-the-art polar vessels. But don’t be fooled: as adventures go, this is the big one. You’ll cross the infamous Drake Passage and set foot on the Antarctic Peninsula, explore ice-dotted bays by zodiac and get up close with Gentoo penguins and migrating blue whales. ‘Antarctic trips’ doesn’t really do it justice. These are Antarctic
adventures
.

This 3 week trip to the Falklands, South Georgia and Antarctica was fantastic, we saw so much wildlife and experienced so many places.  The expedition team are passionate about what they do and ensuring you have the trip of a life time. It has been a life changing experience.  The trip went far beyond my expectations.

Best time to visit Antarctica

Best time to visit Antarctica




Antarctica has a strict summer window for visitors. In winter the ice pack extends out and darkness closes in almost 24 hours a day. With mid-year temperatures reaching down to -50 degrees Celsius, even the most outgoing adventurer would think twice. In summer, the sun is out most of the day and temperatures can reach a heady 2 degrees C. This is the ideal time to spot penguin chicks hatching, whales migrating and seals frolicking.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




As the world’s highest, driest and coldest continent, it’s no surprise that Antarctica is the only one to have no permanent human population. This vast wilderness is covered with an ice sheet 4 km thick, broken only by mountain ranges and ice streams. Despite the huge amount of frozen water (90% of the world’s ice is here), Antarctica is a desert and conditions are harsh. Antarctica’s nearest neighbours are across the Southern Ocean, past icebergs and whales, in
Argentina
,
Chile
and
New Zealand
. It’s a long way to go for a cup of sugar.








Top 5 Antarctic Experiences

Top 5 Antarctic Experiences




1. Take a Walk

Words can’t describe the feeling of setting foot on the Antarctic Peninsula. Surrounded by ice and knowing that you’re walking where only a handful of people have ever gone before is simply incredible.

2. Whale of a Time

The Antarctic summer is peak whale watching time in the Southern Ocean. Eight species head to the krill-rich waters to feast. It’s not uncommon to see massive blue whales breeching, orcas hunting seals or pods of humpbacks playing. Take a cruise and be amazed!

3. Penguin Encounters

It’s thought that 20 million penguins live in the Antarctic region, and if you find yourself in the midst of a colony, you’ll feel like every single one of them is there with you.

4. Zodiac Cruising

An Antarctica cruise by Zodiac is by far the best way to get close to all Antarctica has to offer. Enjoy almost daily landings on beaches, zip around icebergs, get close to whales, or land near a colony of penguins.

5. Polar Plunge

Entertain the resident Gentoo penguins by stripping down to your swimwear and taking a dip in the bracing waters of Neko Harbour. It might be the shortest swim you ever take, but the bragging rights will last a lifetime.

Antarctica travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Antarctica?









No specific visa is required to enter Antarctica beyond the requirements of the country your trip departs from - most likely Argentina or Chile.







Is there a laundry on board the ship?









Yes, a laundry service at a reasonable cost is included on every ship.







What will we eat on board?









The menu changes every day. Breakfast is buffet style. Lunch often features a buffet. Dinner is plated service, with a choice of three main dishes. A vegetarian choice is always offered. Afternoon tea, with pastries or cookies, is provided every day. Fresh pastries arrive warm from the oven for early birds about 6am.







How often can I go ashore?









With luck you’ll go ashore most days once we reach the Antarctic. You’ll have the opportunity to go on zodiac excursions to research stations, penguin colonies, pebble beaches and around icebergs. However, we operate under IAATO guidelines that limit the number of travellers and expedition staff allowed ashore during each landing. No more than 100 people can be ashore at any one time, and in some locations that number is 50. None of our Antarctic vessels carry more than 128 travellers.







Any tips for great penguin experiences?









Pick a spot no closer than 5 metres (15 feet) from the penguins. Sit or kneel - you're making yourself smaller, therefore less threatening. Wait quietly, with your camera ready to take some incredible photographs. Penguins are curious. They may come to you.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Antarctica?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

For more information on insurance, please go to:
Travel Insurance





Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while on holiday in Antarctica.







Top responsible travel tips for Antarctica

1. Don’t use aircraft, vessels, small boats, or other means of transport in ways that disturb wildlife, either at sea or on land.

2. Don’t feed, touch, or handle birds or seals or approach or photograph them in ways that cause them to alter their behavior. Special care is needed when animals are breeding or molting.

3. Don’t damage plants, for example by walking, driving, or landing on extensive moss beds or lichen-covered scree slopes.

4. Don’t use guns or explosives. Keep noise to the minimum to avoid frightening wildlife.

5. Don’t bring non-native plants or animals into the Antarctic, such as live poultry, pet dogs and cats, or house plants.

6. Know the location of areas that have been afforded special protection and observe any restrictions regarding entry and activities that can be carried out in and near them.

7. Don’t damage, remove, or destroy historic sites or monuments or any artifacts associated with them.

8. Don’t interfere with scientific research facilities or equipment.
