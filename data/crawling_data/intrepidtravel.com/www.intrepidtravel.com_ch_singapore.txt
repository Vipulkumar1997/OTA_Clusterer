Singapore



Welcome to Singapore!  With flourishing retail hot spots, a booming, cross-cultural culinary scene and one of the world's best airports, it's not hard to see why Singapore acts as a launching (and finishing) point for many of our Asian odysseys.


From the traditions and heritage of Chinatown to the aromatic delights of Little India and the modernity of glitzy hotels, a few days in sizzling Singapore is the perfect bookend to any Intrepid adventure.

Best time to visit Singapore




Singapore has a typical tropical climate year round - hot and humid with equal amounts of sunshine and rain. The temperature range stays mostly in the 30s (Celsius) and rarely drops below 20 degrees at night. Although there are two monsoon seasons, rain is present year round, usually in the form of thunderstorms and short bursts of torrential rain. Thankfully the sun also shines year round - so although the weather can be unpredictable, the sun will usually prevail.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Tiny Singapore occupies little more than a dot on the world map, although it's still not small enough to rate as one of the world's smallest. Located in South-East Asia on the southern end of the Malaysian Peninsula, most of Singapore is highly urbanised, with most residents living in flats and skyscrapers in built up areas. A small proportion (about 10%) of Singapore's land is dedicated to forests and agriculture, with the rest being considered developed, urban environments.








Top 5 Food Finds of Singapore

Top 5 Food Finds of Singapore




Top 5 Food Finds of Singapore

1. Chilli Crab

Singaporean Chilli Crab could be considered one of the world's favourite dishes from this region. Invented back in 1950, chilli crab can now be found everywhere in Singapore - from high-end restaurants to simple hawker stalls.

2. Fish Head Curry

This aromatic, spicy dish with a South Indian and Chinese heritage features a whole red snapper stewed in coconut milk, tamarind juice, spices and chilli. The strong flavour and presence of a whole fish head may turn some people off, but for those with a strong stomach and desire for heat in their food, you can't go past this curry.

3. Chicken Rice

This Hainanese-style Singaporean stalwart is unofficially considered Singapore's national dish. Featuring poached or fried chicken and steamed rice with sides of chicken stock, soy, and chilli, this is the ideal dish for those wanting simple flavours and ingredients done well.

4. Ice Cream Sandwich

Head to the mobile ice cream carts located along Orchard Road to find this indulgent sweet treat. Traditional flavours (like chocolate and strawberry) get a run alongside more exotic flavours (durian or sweet corn ice cream anyone?). This slice of creamy sugar wrapped in sweet bread is the perfect antidote to the steamy Singaporean climate.

5. Fried Carrot Cake

No, this dish isn't made by putting a sweet carrot cake in a deep fryer. Rather, it's a popular savoury meal in Singapore also known as Chai Tow Kuay. And it just gets stranger when you consider that there are no carrots in this dish, but rather white radish, garlic, chilli and coriander. Oddities aside, this street-food fave is a cheap and easy meat-free meal, a top choice for vegetarian travellers.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Singapore

Be considerate of Singapore’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts. Littering is taken very seriously in Singapore.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
