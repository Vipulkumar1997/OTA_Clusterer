About




Intrepid Travel has come a long way since its humble beginnings in 1989. A company that began with two bearded backpackers, a typewriter and a kitchen table now leads 100,000 travellers across the globe each year.

And although we’re a bit larger these days – with 1,000 local staff based around the world and over 800 different trips across every continent (not to mention multiple kitchen tables) – our mission remains the same. We still get a kick out of responsible travel, small groups and very (very) big adventures.









Our story



The year was 1988… While most of the world was dreaming of hoverboard-mounted lasers, joining wild pyramid schemes and listening to Milli Vanilli, two mates from Melbourne spurned these distractions and instead turned their youthful, entrepreneurial beards toward the thing they loved the most – travel.

Why travel with Intrepid?



The sixty-four thousand dollar question. Finding a travel company that fits just right is pretty important (and pretty difficult). But instead of bragging about what we do – great value group tours, local leaders, added extras etc. – we’d rather tell you why we do it. When it comes to adventure, attitude is everything.

Why small group travel?



The world’s a big place and it’s human nature to get out there and explore it. The only thing is, it’s a really big place. And there’s a heap of different languages to learn, borders to cross and cultures to negotiate. Small group adventure travel makes these things easy. Instead of worrying about logistics, you can focus all your energy on having the experience of a lifetime.

Our trip styles



Every Intrepid small group adventure has been carefully designed to make sure you have an unforgettable grassroots travel experience. Over the years, we’ve developed several trip styles and themes to cater for a diverse range of travellers. Take a look below to find out what your ideal Intrepid adventure might look like.

Real life experiences



What is travel but a search for something that can’t be Googled? We love the highlights, but the real magic for us happens well away from a beaten path. It’s the little noodle bars, hidden galleries and backstreet bodegas and real life experiences you won’t find in a search engine.

Responsible business



The world’s a pretty amazing place, and we like to do what we can to keep it that way. Travel should benefit the places it touches, and to that end we’ve made a commitment to be a responsible business. That means, amongst other things, we carbon offset our trips, we don’t ride elephants in Asia (or anywhere else), and we live sustainable travel every single day.

Loyalty program



Loyalty should be rewarded don’t you think? If you suffer from incurable wanderlust and end up taking nine Intrepid trips, we’ll give you a legends reward to put towards your tenth trip, plus the coveted title of Intrepid Legend. It’s just our little way of saying thanks.

Our services



The last thing you want to be doing before your big trip is running around trying to organise visas, lock in travel insurance and decipher the murky world of airfares. Intrepid is a full service travel agency, so think of us as a holiday without the hassle.

Intrepid blog



We all need a little destination inspiration from time to time. That’s why we created the Intrepid blog (good name, right?) It’s packed full of handy tips, travel articles, country guides and a few bad puns (forgive us). If you’re planning your next trip, or need some daydream material to make the workday fly by, read on.
