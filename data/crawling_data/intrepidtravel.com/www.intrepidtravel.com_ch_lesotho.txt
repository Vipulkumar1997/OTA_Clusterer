Geography and environment




Lesotho is completely surrounded by
South Africa
. Perched on the highest part of the Drakensburg escarpment, this mountainous kingdom is filled with valleys and peaks. The lowland areas, which still soar 1000m above sea level, are home to most of the population, while the highlands are a magnet for adventurers looking to hike or pony trek between villages.

Top 5 Mountain Activities in Lesotho




Top 5 Mountain Activities in Lesotho

1. Hiking

Pull on your boots and head to the hills to explore Lesotho’s mountains. The views are spectacular and you’re more likely to encounter a waterfall or San Bushman rock art than another human being.

2. Meet the Basotho

Take a walk through Malealea village and leave with a bevvy of new friends. Curious kids and friendly adults will proudly show you around and introduce you to their traditions.

3. Pony Trekking

If you prefer four legs to two, then there’s nowhere better to get on a horse (or pony) and ride than Lesotho. Set out with a guide to explore the countryside on a short or overnight trek.

4. Explore Canyons

Take a hike to the stunning Pitseng Canyon. Walk under overhanging cliff faces and past cascading rockpools where, if it’s warm enough, you can take a dip.

5. Wildlife Spotting

Lesotho boasts some spectacular wildlife-spotting opportunities. Keep an eye out for rare birds, vultures, meerkats, jackals, mountain reedbuck and baboons.

Top responsible travel tips for Lesotho

Be considerate of Lesotho’s customs, traditions, religions and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.

Avoid purchasing products harvested from endangered animals.
