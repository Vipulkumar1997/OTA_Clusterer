Best time to visit Portugal

Best time to visit Portugal




Good news - Portugal is one of the warmest European countries. Yearly temperature averages are about 15°C (55°F) in the north and 18°C (64°F) in the south. Spring and summer months are usually warm and sunny, with July and August averaging maximums between 35°C and 40°C (86°F - 95°F) in the interior of the country, 30°C and 35°C in the north and occasionally 45°C (113°F) in the south. The months of May, June and September are considered some of the best times to see Portugal as the weather is usually fine (yet not too hot) and the attractions are less crowded than during the peak months of July and August. Autumn and winter are typically rainy and windy, yet sunny days aren't rare either.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




With a long stretch of coastline along the North Atlantic Ocean, Portugal's location on the Iberian Peninsula translates to beautiful cliff beaches, rocky islands and volcanic lakes. Sharing an extensive land border with
Spain
, Portugal's north is more mountainous than the south, with the River Tagus running through the centre of the country from Spain through to the western coast and Atlantic Ocean. With more than 35% percent of land being forested, Portugal offers a nice mix of rolling plains, woodlands, mountain ranges and beaches.








Top 5 Delectable Dishes of Portugal

Top 5 Delectable Dishes of Portugal




1. Caldeirada

This stew packed with several different types of fish is one of Portugal's most popular and enduring dishes. Expect sardines, cod, haddock, tuna and mackerel, doused in white wine and olive oil, served with a chunk of crusty bread. Simple but effective!

2. Carne de Porco á Alentejana

The popular Portuguese version of surf and turf hails from the Alentejo region but can be found served all throughout Portugal. Featuring pork and clams as the hero ingredients, white wine, paprika and coriander add flavour that is difficult to resist.

3. Feijoada

Brazil's national dish was actually invented by the Portuguese and this stew still endures as a common favourite in Portugal. Featuring beans, pork or beef and vegetables, this hearty stew is typically served with rice, although regional differences make this dish a different proposition every time.

4. Entrecosto com Mel

Meat lovers will salivate over these succulent pork ribs marinated in honey, garlic and liquor. Served with a side of chilli sauce, this oven-roasted feast is perfect for a decadent celebration.

5. Arroz Doce

For dessert, this traditional Portuguese rice pudding dish should satisfy those with a sweet tooth. Typically flavoured with citrus and cinnamon, it's a fresh, creamy, zesty, sugary delight.
