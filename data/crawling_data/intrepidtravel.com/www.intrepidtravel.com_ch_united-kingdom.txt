Best time to visit United Kingdom




The UK shines from June to August, though there’s never any guarantee that their summer is full of sunshine and warmth. The days are long, tourist crowds are abundant and the country wakes up from its dark slumber and celebrates – a lot. Spring and autumn can be cool and wet but with some sunny days, and the days are still long enough to enjoy this country’s diverse and beautiful scenery. But winter – December to February - brings short days, grey skies and sometimes snow, though this is more often in Scotland and England’s northern counties.

History and government




Early History

The United Kingdom came into being in 1707 with the political union of England and Scotland (Wales was classed under the Kingdom of England). In 1800, the Act of Union with the Kingdom of Ireland formed the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The last major change was in 1922, when the Anglo-Irish Treaty saw the Irish Free State form and secede from the UK, and Northern Ireland becoming part of the UK (though it wasn’t until 1927 that the UK formerly changed its name to United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland). Though united, each country had their own laws, churches and education systems.

Recent History

The 18th and 19th centuries were notable for the UK’s countless wars with France, colonisation in the Caribbean, the loss of colonies in North America, the gain of Canada, the discovery of Australia, the second wave of the British Empire in India, Asia and Africa, the beginnings of the industrial revolution, the abolishment of slavery and the long and successful reign of Queen Victoria. Needless to say, this is but a snapshot.

The first half of the 20th century was marred by two devastating world wars, which not only devastated the population but the wealth of the country. It also saw the crumbling of the British Empire, with independence being sought and won in Ireland in 1922 and India in 1947, and by the 1980s Britain had withdrawn from all of its colonies. In 1997 devolution was established in Scotland and Wales.








Top 5 British Subcultures

Top 5 British Subcultures



1. Mods

Stylish in tailored suits and classy shoes, mods’ hey-day was the early to mid sixties. They rode around on vespas, listened to modern jazz, were attracted to late night cafés and got into rumbles with rockers.

2. Skinheads

Originally nothing to do with hooligans, racists and fascism, skinheads were born in the 1960s in working class areas of the UK. Skinheads fashioned themselves on Jamaican rude boy style, listened to ska and wore tight jeans, white t-shirts, braces, checked shirts and cherry red docs.

3. Glam rockers

Glam rockers wore high shoes, outrageous clothes, dramatic makeup, lavish hairstyles and plenty of things that glittered. This subculture rose to prominence in the early 1970s and faded out about 5 years later, but went on to influence punk, goths and new romantics. Think David Bowie’s androgynous phase and Garry Glitter.

4. Punks

Though not originating in the UK, when punk hit the UK’s shores in the mid 70s, it was hard to miss. UK punks were on the whole more theatrical than those in the US. Armed with anti-establishment views, mohawks, ripped clothes held together by safety pins (anti-fashion), piercings and thrashing around to punk rock, punk caused a big stir, which died down not long after it exploded.

5. Goths

An offshoot of the post-punk scene, goth became popular in the early 1980s. Although there are many styles of goth, they are characterised by wearing dark clothes, heavy make-up and dark hair.
