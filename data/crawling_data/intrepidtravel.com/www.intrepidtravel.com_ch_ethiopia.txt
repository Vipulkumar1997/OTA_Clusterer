Ethiopia



The great land of Ethiopia is one of Africa's veiled treasures.


Archaeological, cultural and natural riches await for travellers keen to delve into this ancient yet often overlooked destination. Trekking rugged ranges, visiting simple mountain villages, marvelling at time-worn relics dipped in mysticism and meeting genuine, unaffected people who have overcome famine and war makes for a life-affirming journey.

Incredible Ethiopia,

Hiking at altitude along mountain paths requires a good level of fitness.
There are beautiful things and landscapes to see in Ethiopia very worthwhile.
This trip involves some very long drives.

Best time to visit Ethiopia




Travellers can expect plenty of sunshine while visiting Ethiopia. Temperatures are typically warm and balmy, although they can vary greatly with altitude. The lowland areas tend to be more hot and humid, while the highlands offer cooler temperatures. Rain is common from July to September but otherwise, sunshine prevails for the rest of the year.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Landlocked Ethiopia is bordered by
Kenya
, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea and
Djibouti
. Home to some of the most stunning and varied landscapes in
Africa
, Ethiopia is easily the most mountainous country in Africa, with the Simien and Bale ranges providing the highest peaks. The iconic Blue Nile (which is considered holy by locals) originates in Ethiopia's Lake Tana and runs through the country into neighbouring Sudan.








Top 5 Must-See Sights of Ethiopia

Top 5 Must-See Sights of Ethiopia




1. Churches of Lalibela

These miraculous, ancient churches cut from rock are the main reason travellers journey to the town Lalibela. Surrounded by myth and legend, these unique churches have stood for centuries and remain a sacred site for Ethiopians.

2. Aksum Ruins

This UNESCO World Heritage-listed archaeological site is home to some of the most impressive ancient ruins in the world. Located in the north of Ethiopia and featuring obelisks, royal tombs and remnants of palaces, fables suggest that this was once the home of the Queen of Sheba.

3. The Palace of Fasiladas

The city of Gonder is home to many incredible buildings, but the restored Palace of Fasiladas counts among the most impressive. Located within the Royal Enclosure, this castle possesses an intriguing fusion of Portuguese, Indian and Moorish decorative styles.

4. Blue Nile Falls

Meaning "smoking water" in Amharic, these legendary falls are best seen during the rainy season when the water levels swell, creating a thunderous amount of white water.

5. Debre Berhan Selassie Church

This unusual little church located in Gonder was built in the 17th century and features an elaborately decorated interior like no other - more than 100 winged cherubs are painted on the ceiling. A must see when in Ethiopia.

Ethiopia travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Ethiopia?









Most nationalities require a visa for entry to Ethiopia. Please see this website to find your closest embassy or consulate: http://www.embassiesabroad.com/embassies-of/Ethiopia. If you are flying into Addis Ababa you can obtain a visa on arrival. You'll need two passport photos and approximately US$40. You may be asked for proof of a return ticket - please carry your tour notes as proof that you are leaving overland. If you are entering at any border other than Addis Ababa airport you MUST obtain your visa in advance.







Is tipping customary in Ethiopia?









Tipping isn’t mandatory in Ethiopia but is considered polite in restaurants and bars. It's up to the individual to choose to tip or not but rounding up a bill for good service or leaving 1-2 birr is appropriate.







What is the internet access like in Ethiopia?









Internet cafes can be found in cities and large towns but less so in rural and remote places.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Ethiopia?









Mobile phone coverage is quite good in Ethiopia's urban areas, but less so in rural, remote and mountainous areas. Ensure you have global roaming activated before leaving home if you wish to use your mobile phone.







What are the toilets like in Ethiopia?









Squat/pit toilets are the standard in Ethiopia, except for western-style flushable toilets that are sometimes available in large hotels and other modern buildings. Carry your own supply of soap and toilet paper, as this is rarely provided.







What will it cost for a...?









Cup of coffee = 10-15 ETB
Bottle of beer = 30-40 ETB
Simple lunch = 40-60 ETB
Nice dinner in a restaurant = 150-200 ETB







Can I drink the water in Ethiopia?









Tap water isn't considered safe for tourists to drink. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Ask your leader and accommodation provider for local advice on where drinking water can be accessed. Also, avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Ethiopia?









Credit cards are accepted only by a few large hotels in Addis Ababa as cash is the main mode of payment in Ethiopia. Ensure you have adequate cash to cover purchases not able to be made on credit.







What is ATM access like in Ethiopia?









There are a few ATMs that accept foreign cards in Ethiopia, mainly in Addis Ababa and other large cities. Withdrawing cash from ATMs can't necessarily be relied on, so carrying foreign currency (like US dollars) is recommended.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Ethiopia?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Ethiopia

Be considerate of Ethiopia’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
