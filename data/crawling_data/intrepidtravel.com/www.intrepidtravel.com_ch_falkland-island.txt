Falkland Islands



Welcome to the final frontier, where penguins outnumber people by the hundred-thousands.


Standing on the gentle slopes of this peaceful birdwatcher’s haven, it’s hard to believe that just a few decades ago the Falkland Islands were the site of war. These days, the focus is on the archipelago’s incredible wildlife. Crags dotted with seabirds, beaches covered with penguins, sprawling nature reserves edging on outpost towns, whales and walruses and seals competing for space off-shore – the Falklands are a nature lover’s paradise. Days of wildlife-spotting are finished with a drink down the local pub.
