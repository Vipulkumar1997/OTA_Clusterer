Accommodation on Europe & Turkey trips


For our continental adventures, we like to stay in small, locally run hotels where hospitality is key and family-friendly facilities are available. Fortunately Europe has plenty of great old buildings and character-filled properties to choose from. On our Turkey Active Holiday we sleep for two nights on a traditional Turkish gulet, and on our Italy Family Holiday we stay at a lovely guesthouse – Villa Giovanna, a locally run hotel surrounded by olive trees and Sorrento lemons, with great views over the Bay of Naples (and a pool, of course).




A taste of whats in store...

Each of Intrepid's family trips has been built with a smooth blend of action-packed activities and flexible family time, just the way we like it. Want to know the sort of adventures you can expect with us? We’ve picked out a few of our favourites.











Explore the ruins of Pompeii

History lessons don’t have to be dry and dull affairs. We’ll guide you and the kids through the old stone streets of Pompeii and bring the familiar story of its AD79 destruction to life. Learn about the city’s last few minutes at ground level, then climb Mt Vesuvius for a bird’s-eye view over Campania.

Experience on
Italy Family Holiday











Cruise the Lycian Coast in a real Turkish gulet

A gulet is an all-timber, handcrafted Turkish yacht, built specially for cruising the deep blue waters of the Mediterranean. It’ll be your home for a couple of nights on our Turkey active trips, the perfect base for island hopping, snorkelling and exploring the coves of the Lycian Coast.

Experience on a
Turkey Family Holiday











Go cycling in the Pyrenees

Ah the Pyrenees, Andorra’s classic summer destination and one of the best places to soak in the fresh mountain air. We’ll set you and the kids up in a chalet in Soldeu for a week of hiking, cycling, horse riding and even a wild white water rafting expedition.

Experience on
Summer Pyrenees Family holiday











Try your hand at cheese making in Slovakia

Kids plus farm animals plus a hands-on cheese making class in the gorgeous farmland of the Janosikove Diery Canyons is a recipe for fun. Meet the farm animals, milk the cows and join local artisans in making some of Europe’s best cheeses. It’s a rare glimpse into real Slovakian rural life.

Italy Family Holiday ,
October 2017

Melissa Smith

Intrepid trips are full of interesting activities, cutting out the boring touristy bits and getting straight to the interesting local stories. The guides are passionate about what they do. It's also so relaxing to know that all the details are taken care of whilst being sure that every day of your holiday is going to be even better than you could plan yourself.

Summer Pyrenees Family Holiday,
July 2017

Marie Moynihan

The trip was great - with just the right level of activity. The guides were fab and were very good with the kids, always encouraging them and making it fun for them. This holiday was the first holiday I felt like I could totally switch off - every thing was organised for you, so you didn't have to think about anything - you could just enjoy. Andorra is beautiful. White water rafting was highlight for the kids. Highly recommend this as a family holiday with teenagers - 12 and 15.

Italy Family Holiday ,

Richard Askey

Please read comments herein. One addition I would suggest - optional would be the walk up to Ravello - I did this alone - its 1500 steps up hill -.quite a killer but a fantastic UNESCO village when you arruvev

Tania Testa

This is a great family holiday, full of activities - you will definitely sleep well each night! The guides make it an unforgettable experience and the white-water rafting is the highlight. I highly recommend spending time in this beautiful country and vow to come back to Andorra in the Winter for the skiing.

Summer Pyrenees Family Holiday,
August 2017

Sarah Cooke

Great family holiday, challenging enough to feel you have accomplished something but not daunting.  Guides were fantastic, they really knew what they were doing so we always felt safe. Options to take it at your own pace.  We had a fantastic time, would definitely recommend.

This holiday was awesome! The guides were absolutely fantastic, brilliant with the kids and full of fun. The physical activities were challenging though, don't be fooled into thinking that a family holiday won't have long walks!!

David Overall

Outstanding Holiday. Kids loved it especially the White Water Rafting. The team headed by Nick were amazing as was the food. Slight criticism was the transfers in that the coach drivers seemed to not be interested and were unwilling to go the extra mile that the rest of the team were.

A great trip for families, both my children enjoyed this trip immensely, much to their surprise.  The most active part is the trip up to Vesuvius  which is worth it.

Christine Kelly

The trip was seamless. It was the best family holiday we have ever been on. Everything was pitched perfectly, the transfers, the hotel, the activities just everything. Nuria and Nick were amazing hosts their hotel was perfect and the home cooked food every night simply couldn't be faulted.  Our guides were just fabulous ...we were sorry to leave everyone behind. Well done Intrepid and massive, love and thanks to Nick, Nuria, Stuart and Adele...we will be back!
