British Virgin Islands



The sands are of a striking chalky white, the seas a shimmering crystalline blue and the sunsets second to none – welcome to the British Virgin Islands, one of the world’s most illustrious havens for sun-seeking hedonists.


Typically the privileged domain of moguls, models and millionaires, this smattering of lushly forested islands offers countless secluded bays, pristine coral reefs and an infectious Creole vibe that will sweep you off your feet and into a hammock before you can say: “another rum cocktail”.

British Virgin Islands Sailing Adventure,
March 2017

Brett Scott

Sailing in the British Virgin Islands was a great way to spend my Spring Break. It was a relaxing, sun-filled time full of sailing, snorkelling, and seafood. We saw sea turtles, stingrays, many different types of fish, pink flamingos, and swam through so many different coral reefs that we started to loose track of where we were and what day it was. This was a great trip, and it was a shame it had to end.

Best time to visit British Virgin Islands

Essentially there exists no bad time to visit the British Virgin Islands: just good and better. Blessed with balmy nights, cooling trade winds and average afternoon temperatures that tend to hover around the mid-twenties, the weather is pretty idyllic year-round. This being said, the winter months of December to May are the driest, with rains on the increase during the summer months and peaking in September. Hurricane season is from June to November, but they aren’t a very frequent occurrence.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




The 60+ islands comprising this tropical archipelago come in two varieties: steep volcanic rises with a typically rugged terrain (the great majority) and smaller, relatively flat, coral islets. Only 16 of these are inhabited (and some of these privately owned). At a paltry 550 metres, Tortola’s Sage Mountain is the territory’s highest point and Anegada – commonly referred to as ‘the Drowned Island’ – the lowest lying.








Cocktails of the British Virgin Islands

Cocktails of the British Virgin Islands




Top 5 cocktails of the British Virgin Islands

1. The Painkiller

The British Virgin Islands boast some seriously fabulous fruity rum cocktails – the most legendary being The Painkiller. Essentially just dark rum mixed with orange and pineapple juice and topped with shaved ice, a dollop of coconut cream and sprinkle of nutmeg, the drink is so-named for its ability to dull morning pains invariably incurred from downing too many of these the night before.

2. The Bushwacker

An icy blend of rum, vodka, Kahlua, Baileys, amaretto and chocolate, this milkshake makes for one delectable dessert – albeit one you’ll want to steer the kids well clear of.

3. Beach Tomato

Not quite as common as The Painkiller and Bushwacker but fare more potent, the Beach Tomato is a heady fusion of banana rum, pineapple and orange juice, Cointreau and generous lashings of Bacardi 151. Despite the name, it doesn’t include tomatoes.

4. Limin’ de Coconut

All across the Caribbean, ‘limin’ is Creole slang for hanging out. So think of this as you spending some quality time with a coconut. If that sounds a bit too Tom Hanksy for your liking, know that you’ll also be becoming acquainted with 1½ oz of light rum, 1 oz of lime juice and a glass full of crushed ice. This one also doesn’t include tomatoes.

5. The Honesty Cocktail

Just up from Little Harbour on Jost Van Dyke, perched above chalky white sands with exquisite views over turquoise waters, is the aptly named ‘Ivan’s Stress Free Bar’. Things are so stress-free at this bar that instead of a bartender there will sometimes just be a note saying: ‘make your drink, start your tab, pay it when you leave.’ So this is the place to put tomatoes into your cocktail if you really want to.
