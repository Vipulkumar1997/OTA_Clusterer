Poland tour reviews


Our Poland trips score an average of
4.6 out of 5
based on 5 reviews in the last year.










Northern Poland & the Baltics,
September 2017

Melanie Mair

Loved this tour! It was a great way to experience some of the less visited countries in Europe and learn about their history and unique cultures that they've managed to maintain despite their tumultuous past. Their location between Scandinavia, Germany and Russia means they have a rich history to explore, especially the more recent events of WWII and communist occupation. The food was delicious, the scenery amazing and the locals you get to meet offer a great insight too.

Best time to visit Poland

Best time to visit Poland




Like many other European countries, Poland's climate features relatively warm summers and cold winters. Snowfall is common through winter, but more so in the mountainous areas. Rainfall features throughout the whole year, although the rain is usually in the form of brief showers rather than torrential downpours. Travelling from May to September usually offers optimal weather, with July and August being the hottest (but busiest) months for travel.

Geography and environment




Located in Central Europe, Poland shares borders with
Germany
,
Czech Republic
,
Slovakia
,
Ukraine
, Belarus,
Lithuania
, and
Russia
. Poland also has a stretch of coastline along the Baltic Sea, providing two natural harbours. The coastal areas are marked by dunes and lakes, while the north and central parts of Poland are characterised by lowlands and plains, interrupted by rivers and valleys. Segments of the Carpathian Mountains mark the south-east part of the country, while the Tatra Mountains act as a natural border between Poland and Slovakia.








Top 5 Heritage Spots of Krakow

Top 5 Heritage Spots of Krakow




1. Collegium Maius

Meaning 'Great College' in Latin, this 15th-century building, located in Jagiellonian University, has hosted such famous students as revolutionary astronomer Copernicus and spiritual leader Pope John Paul II. A visit here is a mind-expanding experience in art, science, history and architecture.

2. Wawel Cathedral

Standing for more than a thousand years, this is the place where Pope John Paul II conducted his first Mass. If that's not impressive enough, add a crypt holding the bodies of some of Poland's most influential leaders and public figures and you've got one of Poland's most interesting and important buildings. Don't miss it!

3. Wawel Royal Castle

Sitting on the edge of the Vistula River, this remarkable Gothic-style building acted as a home for Poland's royal family centuries ago. Featuring a valuable collection of historic paintings, tapestries and murals, this is a top spot to delve into European art treasures and classic architecture.

4. Remuh Synagogue

While this small yet elegant synagogue may not be the grandest in scale or design, its historic value is unquestionable. Founded in 1553, it remains a place of worship for the local community and a place of pilgrimage for the world's Jewish people.

5. Cloth Hall

Krakow's Renaissance-style Cloth Hall is a splendid building with a retail heritage. Once used as trading place for textiles and cloth back in the 14th century, nowadays the building houses shops, cafes and a museum. Located in the Main Square, this historic building looks best illuminated at night.

5. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

6. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

8. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
