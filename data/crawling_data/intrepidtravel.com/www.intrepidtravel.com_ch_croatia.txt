Transport in Croatia

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Croatia, you may find yourself travelling by:







Bus

No tourist coaches here! Travel through Croatia the way the locals do, aboard a local bus. It's a cheap, reliable and authentic way to get around.


Explore Croatia










Ferry

Amazing views and quick access to the islands - what better way to see Croatia's splendid coast than aboard a ferry?

Best time to visit Croatia






×

Best time to visit Croatia




Croatia's peak season runs between July and August, with temperatures in the high 20s or 30s on the coast. But in this region you can expect plenty of sunshine from May to October, which are the best times to visit if you want to take advantage of Croatia's beautiful beaches and islands. The inland areas are also hot in the summer but can get cold in the winter with low temperatures and snowfall. Winter on the coast is milder and frequent rain can be expected.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Generally, Croatians are very proud of their country and cultural heritage. While this may not be obvious in everyday life, the Slavic heritage of Croatian people becomes more evident during festivals and national holidays, where cities and villages come to life with traditional costume, folk music and feasts. While most of Croatia's population are Roman Catholic, there are also groups of people who identify as Serbian Orthodox, Muslim, Protestant and Jewish. Having endured war, hardship and frequent earthquakes, the people of Croatia have a great amount of national pride and connection to their country and family. It's quite common for extended families to live together and children to remain close to their parents well into adulthood. Time with family is viewed as a necessity of life, so work and business affairs rarely encroach on family time, meaning most people spend weekends and holidays with family and friends.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways of experiencing a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Croatia's location ensures that its food options are phenomenal. With loads of fresh seafood, fruits and vegetables, visitors will be able to taste Greek, Italian and Hungarian influences in many of their meals.

Things to try in Croatia

1. Seafood

When in the coastal cities or on the islands, you'll be able to sample fresh seafood at its finest. Prstaci is a good choice for shellfish fans; while brodet is a hearty fish stew you'll be able to find almost everywhere. Octopus, squid, cuttlefish, pilchards and lobster are all easily found too.

2. Local Wine

Croatia's climate is near perfect for vine-growing, so take the chance to try locally-made wines produced from traditional grape varieties. Try Dingac, Plavac, Malmsy and Babic.

3. Meat

Vegetarians may struggle in Croatia as meat is very popular in this part of the world. Those who favour meat will love trying roast lamb, cured ham, spicy pork sausages and grilled skewers of beef and chicken.

4. Truffles

For those with expensive tastes, Croatia is a large producer of rare truffles, in particular white truffles. You'll find them in salads and cooked in pasta dishes in Croatia's more upmarket restaurants.

5. Cheese

Croatia produces many top-quality artisan cheeses that travellers will be able to find in markets, shops and restaurants all over the country. Paski sir is a sharp, sheep milk cheese from the island of Pag and is the most famous and awarded of Croatia's cheeses.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Sharing borders with
Bosnia and Herzegovina
,
Slovenia
,
Hungary
,
Serbia
and
Montenegro
, Croatia benefits from more than 5,000 km of coastline that spans along the Adriatic Sea. In addition to the mainland, Croatia also has many islands, some inhabited, some not. Croatia's terrain is very diverse and varies from flat plains to low mountains and highlands, limestone karst cliffs, wetlands, lakes and forests of cypress. Nature reserves and wetland areas are home to large populations of migratory birds, deer, bats and bears. Visitors will also see much of the land is used for agriculture with vineyards, lavender fields, olive groves and orchards being prevalent in rural areas. Croatia's cities, while developed, have managed to maintain a high level of charm with cobblestone streets, ancient housing, historic squares and heritage buildings being preserved and still used by the current population.








History

History




Early History

Archaeological evidence suggests that the land now known as Croatia has been occupied by humans since the Stone Age. Croatia's geographical position in
Europe
allowed a great amount of influence from neighbouring regions, with tribes and people from different cultures and groups making their mark. Over the centuries, Greeks, Romans, Celts, Huns and Goths have all occupied the territory, with Croats arriving by the 7th century. The first Kingdom of Croatia was formed in 925 but by the 12th century Croatia had formed a union with Hungary, with a Hungarian King instated as leader of both territories. During the 15th century, Croatia lost territory to the Ottoman Empire and, in later centuries, once again came under Hungarian rule. Evidence of these many cultural influences can be seen in the architecture, cuisine and archaeological ruins of contemporary Croatia.

Recent History

Croatia, Slovenia and Serbia formed a union in 1918 to create the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, but the occupation of Axis forces during World War II lead to the creation of the Independent State of Croatia, which only lasted a couple of years during the war. By the end of the war in 1945, Croatia had become a Socialist Republic (within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, together with Bosnia, Serbia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Montenegro), with the constitution of 1963 attempting to alleviate tensions surrounding the balance of power between Serbians and Croats. By 1980, after the death of President Tito (founder of modern Yugoslavia), economic and political difficulties (in addition to regional tensions in other parts of Yugoslavia) resulted in a near collapse of government. What followed was years of conflict, polarity and political turmoil. The referendum of 1991 resulted in an overwhelming vote for independence, with Croatia and Slovenia declaring independence from Yugoslavia in June of the same year. Much armed conflict followed and lasted until 1995, leading to great loss of civilian life and displacement, creating large populations of refugees. The last two decades have been a time of peace and reconciliation for the people of Croatia. Tourism has opened up and the government has focused on ensuring further economic growth for the country. Croatia has joined the European Union in 2013.








Top 10 Historic Buildings of Croatia

Top 10 Historic Buildings of Croatia




1. Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary

One of Zagreb’s most visited historic sites, this grand neo-Gothic cathedral has been renovated and reconstructed many times since it was originally built in the 13th century. With massive twin spires, a marble interior and 800-year-old treasury, this is a monumental masterpiece.

2. Church of St Donatus

Considered one of the most impressive examples of early Byzantine architecture, this church in Zadar was built way back in the 9th century. With much historical value, its simplistic, circular design is quite unlike other buildings in Croatia, making it a standout, must-see church in a country with so many churches and cathedrals to see.

3. Croatian National Theatre

Built in 1895, this national treasure located in Zagreb is an elegant example of neo-Baroque style architecture. Visitors lucky enough to catch an opera, ballet or classical music concert here will be able to revel in all the fine details, from the luxe furnishings to the excellent acoustics.

4. Diocletian’s Palace

One of Split’s main attractions, this UNESCO World Heritage monument is considered one of the best-preserved Roman palaces in the world. The sprawling complex is home to many fine examples of Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture, so visitors will be able to admire open air courtyards, marble arches, columns, gates and walls from a variety of different periods.

5. Cathedral of St Lovro

This cathedral located 30 minutes from Split is well known for its distinct Romanesque portal crafted by one of Croatia's most celebrated sculptors, Radovan. Mythological creatures and biblical figures all feature heavily, with saints, lions, sirens and centaurs all gracing the spectacular doorways.

6. Rector’s Palace

Also known as Dubrovnik Museum, Rector’s Palace is an impressive building in itself. With soaring arches, period furniture and a dramatic staircase, this structure steals the show from the museum exhibits it holds within.

7. Dubrovnik Synagogue

Reported to be the second oldest synagogue in Europe and the world’s oldest Sefardic synagogue still in use, Dubrovnik’s synagogue is still a place for the local Jewish community to worship on holy days. Sustaining damage from earthquakes and wars, this small but well cared for structure stills stands today due to its historical value and unique design.

8. Marco Polo Tower

While not the most elaborate or opulent building in Croatia, the Marco Polo Tower of Korcula has much historical significance. It is believed that Marco Polo was born in this medieval, walled city and this tower named in his honour rises above the town as a reminder of his legacy. Climb to the top for phenomenal views and panoramic photo opportunities.

9. Franciscan Monastery

Featuring 14th century cloisters, intricately carved columns and a striking, sculptured facade this Dubrovnik wonder is also home to the third oldest pharmacy in Europe, so you can get a prescription filled while seeing the sights.

10. Trakoscan Castle

This lovely castle located in northern Croatia was inhabited from the 13th century right up until the 1940s. Featuring all good things a castle should have - including a dungeon, hunting room and tower - visiting here is like stepping back to a time where castles weren’t just historical monuments, but valid places to live.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Croatia has an interesting mix of quaint outdoor markets, modern malls and hip clothing boutiques. There's plenty of options that make better souvenirs than the usual lurid magnets or tourist t-shirts.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country.
Australia
and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Croatia

1. Local produce

If you're able to take food products back to your home country, then Croatia's markets are filled with delicious gourmet produce. Honey, olives, cheese, wine and lavender products are good choices which help to support local farmers and the rural economy.

2. Traditional Handicrafts

Embroidered table cloths, handmade dolls and lace from the island of Pag make authentic gifts for friends back home.

3. Natural cosmetics

Croatia has many brands of natural soap, body butter and shower gel derived from ingredients like olive oil, goat's milk, lavender, almond oil and seaweed.

Croatia travel FAQs





Is tipping customary in Croatia?









Tipping isn't mandatory in Croatia, although feel free to round up the bill or leave spare change for wait staff. Tip more if the service has been particularly good. Some restaurants and cafes will already include a 10-15% margin in the bill, to account for taxes and tips. In this case, generally no further tip is required.







What is the internet access like in Croatia?









Travellers will be able to access the internet at internet cafes and hotels in Croatia's large cities and tourist-orientated towns. Expect less internet accessibility in rural areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Croatia?









Mobile phone coverage is generally very good in Croatia's large cities and urban areas. Islands and remote areas may have less reliable service. Ensure global roaming is activated with your service provider before arrival.







What are the toilets like in Croatia?









Western-style, flushable toilets are the norm in Croatia's cities and urban centres.







What will it cost for a...?









Cup of coffee in a cafe = 5-15 HRK
Beer in a pub = 20 HRK
Short bus ride = 20 HRK
Simple, budget meal = 50-80 HRK







Can I drink the water in Croatia?









Tap water is considered safe to drink in Croatia; however, due to the different mineral content, some people may get stomach upsets from the drinking water if they aren't used to it. A better option is finding filtered water rather than relying on bottled water.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Croatia?









Large hotels, restaurants and tourist sites will most likely accept credit cards. Always carry enough cash for smaller purchases and when shopping at vendors like market stalls and smaller cafes and hotels, which may not have credit card facilities.







What is ATM access like in Croatia?









ATMs are readily available throughout Croatia. Cities and large towns will have more ATM access than small villages or rural areas, so prepare accordingly if travelling out of urban areas.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling to Croatia?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Be considerate of Croatia’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.
