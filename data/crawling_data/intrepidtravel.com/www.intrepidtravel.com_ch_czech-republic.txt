Czech Republic



The Czech Republic is an exquisite reflection of Europe’s cultural and architectural diversity.


With over 2000 castles, keeps and ruins, it boasts one of the highest densities of architectural history in the world – so much so, Hollywood regularly rolls into town when it needs to shoot ‘Ye Olde Europe’.  There's no better place to step back in time than on the cobbled streets of Prague’s Old Town, where the scent of chestnut and linden trees fills the air on a warm summer’s eve.

Best time to visit Czech Republic

Best time to visit Czech Republic




The Czech Republic enjoys a pleasant central European climate, which means the summers are hot and dry, and the winters are often a wonderland of snow-covered cobblestones. If you’re after the more balmy weather, then June through to August is perfect. Although, this is the high season for tourists, so expect to be darting between the crowds. The cooler spring months of April and May are usually sun-filled, and you’ll find the attractions less busy. For those who want to experience the quintessential ‘winter wonderland’, why not head over from December through to February - there’s even a strong chance of a white Christmas.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Geographically, the Czech Republic is nestled at the core of the central European scrum, landlocked between
Poland
,
Slovakia
,
Austria
and
Germany
. Often referred to as an eastern European country due to its historical communist and Eastern Bloc influences, the Czech people however, are prompt to remind us that this is very much central
Europe
- and that Prague is in fact further west than Vienna!

The west of the Czech Republic is known as Bohemia, and is surrounded by low European mountains that stem from the Alps. The foothills lead into lush rolling plains and beautiful green countryside. In the east, Moravia is blessed with a variety of dramatic landscapes, with hilly countryside punctuated by the famous limestone cave system - the Moravský Kras.








Top 10 Czech Beer Moments

Top 10 Czech Beer Moments




1. Beer Spa

The Czech Republic is famous for both its spa towns (Karlovy Vary and Marianske Lasne) and its beers. Enjoy a combination of the two in the country’s first beer spa, where you can submerge yourself in a specially brewed bath full of your favourite brew.

2. Brewery Wars

Visit the epicentre of Czech beer in the town of Ceske Budejovice (Budweis in German). Decide for yourself which of the two breweries is master of the genre - Budvar or Burgerbrau. After a long legal stoush over the Budweiser name, the Czech makers have retained the right to call their beers 'Budweiser' and limited the American brand's naming rights in some European countries.

3. Brew with a View

With an incredible view of Prague’s Old Town, visit Letna Hill, Prague’s very own beer gardens, where cheap beer is sold from kiosks for you to enjoy from the comfort of a park bench.

4. Travelling Ales

Ride the tram pub. That’s right, the Czech Republic has its very own tram pub - the Prvni Pivni Tramway.

5. Festival Flavours

Head to one of the Czech Republic’s many beer festivals – pivni slavanosti. Held on almost every weekend of the year in various towns and cities, breweries will celebrate their particular tipple and provide some apt entertainment alongside the beer-swigging.

6. Tank Tipples

Discover the sweet taste of the world’s only unpasteurised variety of Pilsner. Sold in special ‘tank’ pubs, where kegs are replaced by high-volume brewing tanks, treat yourself to this Czech Republic speciality.

7. Savour Something Strong

Push your beer-drinking limits with the Czech Republic’s specialty strength beers. Try U Medviku’s X-33, where the alcohol level of 12.6% will have you pushing the limits of sobriety.

8. Gallery Gulps

Take a trip to Prague’s beer gallery where one can peruse the aisles that house over 200 different varieties.

9. Pass the Beer Glass

The Czech Republic is famous for its incredible glass and crystal, so why not head to the Novosad Glassworks in Harrachov, where the glass-blowers are lucky enough to have their own brewery on site.

10. Beds n' Beer

At the end of all this beer drinking, you’ll need a suitable place to rest your weary head. So why not camp down in one of the Czech Republic’s brewery hotels and finish off with a night-cap in front of the fire.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.
