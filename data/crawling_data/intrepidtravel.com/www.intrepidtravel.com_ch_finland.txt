Finland




With winter skies painted in dancing lights, a capital city steeped in Nordic culture and plenty of chic Scandinavian style, there's much more to this northern gem than snow and saunas.

Best time to visit Finland

Best time to visit Finland




Finland has pleasant summers, with July being the warmest month (temperatures usually average around 15°C). Outdoor activities like hiking, mountain biking and fishing are popular during summer and spring. In Lapland midsummer is also the time of the midnight sun, a phenomenon where the sun barely sets. Winter runs from November to March and during this time expect plenty of snowfall - perfect for skiing, snow boarding, snowshoeing and sledding. With temperatures regularly hitting -20°C, Finland's winters are particularly cold, so pack accordingly if travelling at this time.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Finland is home to large tracts of forest, a multitude of pure lakes and hundreds of islands, making it one of nature's most blessed landscapes. The north of Finland (known as Lapland) is characterised by relatively flat terrain, demarcated by long rivers and due to its Arctic location, extreme snowfall and ice can be found, particularly in winter. Bordering
Sweden
,
Norway
and
Russia
, Finland also has long stretches of coastline along the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Bothnia. The coastal areas are home to thousands of rocky islands (which are mostly uninhabited) while the interior of the country is dominated by forests and lakes.








Top 5 Culinary Delights of Finland

Top 5 Culinary Delights of Finland




1. Karelian Pasty

This traditional, savoury pie can be found widely throughout Finland. Featuring a rye crust filled with rice and served with egg and butter, this is a simple yet tasty snack ideal for vegetarians.

2. Berries

Finland is home to some of the world's best fresh produce, and the variety of berries on offer is astounding. Blessed with ideal climatic conditions for berry-growing, visitors can expect to snap up superior tasting, fresh cloudberries, blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and lingonberries, See them offered fresh at markets and shops, served alongside meals in sauces, jams and spreads or baked in delicious pies.

3. Kaalikaaryleet

These baked cabbage rolls are a standard entry on most Finnish restaurant menus. Featuring ground beef, rice, onion and cream wrapped in cabbage rolls and served with cranberry or lingonberry sauce, they may be hard to pronounce but they sure are easy to eat.

4. Graavilohi

Finland has a proud heritage steeped in fishing, so it's no surprise that the quality of seafood is very high. This simple meal of salted salmon doesn't need any dressings or condiments as the pure, natural flavours of the salmon are the main attraction.

5. Pulla

These sweet bread treats have numerous varieties, from cinnamon, to almonds and raisins. Typically eaten with a coffee, pulla are an inexpensive cafe snack - a great, budget choice in a notoriously expensive country.

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
