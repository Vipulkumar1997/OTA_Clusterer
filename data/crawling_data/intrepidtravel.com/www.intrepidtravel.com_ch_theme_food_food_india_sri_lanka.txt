India & Sri Lanka food tours




It’s one of the great tragedies that the spice-filled splendour of Indian and Sri Lankan cuisine, which draws inspiration from dozens of ethnic subcultures and centuries of history, has been sold to the western world as simply ‘One butter chicken, one lamb Rogan Josh and three garlic naan.’ But not on this trip. Taste fresh paratha bread fried in ghee, tamarind chutney and vegetable pickle, onion bhaji from a Delhi street stall, home-cooked Rajasthan curry and real Sri Lankan tea, picked straight from the plantation. Butter chicken will never be the same again.

Reviews











Real Food Adventure - Sri Lanka ,
November 2017

Rahel Kübler

A perfect way to experience wonderful Sri Lanka with eyes, nose and palate!

Review submitted 03 Dec 2017











Real Food Adventure - South India ,
November 2017

Mark Limacher

South India was a revelation for me, as I had no idea how different and how culturally rich it would be.  I've spent lots of time in Southeast Asia, especially Indonesia and now see the powerful cultural influence of South India on the surrounding countries. The food, the lavish, mysterious temples and the wonderful Kerala "Backwater" region, kind of a crazy dream of canals, rice fields, water lilies, birdlife, obedient ducks and relaxing accommodation all made this a really fun tour.  Santo, our tour leader, worked hard, in an easy-going way, to makes sure we had a great time.

You don't meet local people as a tourist - most importantly you meet local people directly!
