South Africa



The whole ‘country of contrasts’ thing has become a bit of a cliche.


But what else do you call a place where (in a three week period) you could happily slalom between penguins waddling on the Cape and lions stalking the bushveld, cinematic coastal switchbacks and burnt Kalahari sand, the oldest wine industry outside Europe and cutting edge fusion cuisine? ‘Contrast’, doesn’t really do South Africa justice. The beauty of a South Africa tour (besides the peace of mind that comes with an expert local guide) is being able to fit so much Africa into so little time. From the Stellenbosch winelands to Kruger, Blyde River and beyond, this is a place where you can take your safari with a side of espresso

Kruger, Coast & Cape,
September 2017

Ian Bowman

Kruger Coast & Cape was an awesome trip full of highlights every day. From seeing unbelievable amounts of animals up close in the Kruger to the amazing landscapes of Drakensberg & Lesotho, no two days were the same. The camp sites are all great and so much is packed in the 3 weeks. Would definitely recommend this trip!

Kruger & Cape Town by Plane,
November 2017

Ione Gearing

I would recommend this trip to anyone, especially animal lovers the lodge you stay in is amaking and you get two safaris included with the opportunity to do more - our lodge even organised a night drive for us which was an incredible experience.

Best time to visit South Africa

Best time to visit South Africa




South Africa is an excellent year-round destination. Winters are mild, dry and good for wildlife viewing. Summers can get very hot and humid, but are a great time for visiting beaches and festivals. Spring is a great time for viewing wildflowers in the Northern and Western Cape provinces, and very little rain falls anywhere in autumn but the days are warm and the nights cool. Overall, there’s always a good time to head to South Africa.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




South Africa’s culture is one of the most diverse in the world. From indigenous tribes like the Zulu, San Bushmen and Xhosa to the Afrikaners of Dutch heritage, and immigrants of British descent, visitors will be able to experience a magnificent melting pot of customs and traditions. The significant Indian and Jewish populations also add to the ethnic mix. From the proud, beaded Zulu warriors that have inhabited the land for centuries to newly arrived immigrants from
Europe
and
Asia
, South Africa’s culture has been shaped by millions of people.

The cuisine is generally a combination of Indian, Dutch, English and tribal flavours and techniques, while dress can range from modern fashion in the big cities to simple traditional, tribal dress in the bush. Although South Africa has made significant inroads towards peace and reconciliation since the end of apartheid, racial tensions are sometimes evident and it is generally best not to contribute to this in any way. Overall, most travellers will find South Africans to be welcoming, appreciative of your visit and ready to share their homeland and stories.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Things to try in South Africa

1. Wine

South Africa is fast becoming one of the most interesting wine producing regions in the world. Quality has risen steeply in the past decade so if you’re visiting the Stellenbosch Wine Region, be sure to sample some fine reds, which are world-class.

2. Seafood

With such easy access to the Indian Ocean and Southern Atlantic, South Africa boasts some of the best seafood dining experiences you’ll ever have. From an indulgent oyster platter at a Cape Town restaurant to a spicy seafood curry in Durban, the seafood here is fresh, cheap and flavoursome.

3. Biltong

Biltong tends to divide people. Some find this preserved, spiced meat snack impossible to refuse and others simply can’t stomach it. Either way, it’s extremely popular and readily available in markets, supermarkets and shops throughout South Africa.

4. Boerewors

Another one for the meat-lovers, this coiled, spicy sausage is a South African delicacy best done on the barbecue. Flavoured with coriander, cloves and nutmeg, this is a meat born from South African and Dutch traditions.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




South Africa showcases one of the most diverse and stunning natural environments in the world. Visitors are able to soak up golden rays on sun-drenched beaches, journey through acre upon acre of dry savannah, admire lush, green meadows, walk through tropical forest and stop to take in views of wide, ancient canyons. It’s also possible to stroll the streets of an urban city one day and meander along a dirt track passing small farms and villages the next. South Africa truly is a land of contrasts and this begins with the landscapes and environment.

Located on the tip of Southern Africa, South Africa shares land borders with Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Swaziland. It also shares a long stretch of coastline with the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans. The topography of the land changes remarkably around the country, from the lofty plateaux of the inland region to the low-lying coast and mountainous ranges of the Cape. This variance in topography makes South Africa rich in many species of flora and fauna, something that attracts many tourists and travellers from all over the world.








History and government

History and government




Early History

The land of South Africa has been inhabited for centuries by tribes hailing from different areas of the African continent, including the San and Bantu people. Most tribes relied on hunting and gathering, but gradually were introduced to agriculture and animal husbandry over the years. From around 1200 AD, the tribal people of South Africa started to become influenced by outsiders, including Muslim traders, the Portuguese and the Dutch, who established a settlement in the mid 1600s.

The Dutch continued to dominate the country until the 1800s, when the British became interested in the Cape Colony. During this time, the native population had become increasingly dissatisfied with being marginalised and treated poorly by their European colonisers. Many native people were used as slaves on plantations and were treated brutally by their ‘employers’ and many resented losing their land, culture and traditional way of life. Further to this, the Dutch descendants (known as Boers) didn’t appreciate the arrival of the British in a territory they had inhabited for years before their arrival. This frustration and anger regularly resulted in confrontation and armed conflict between the British, Boers and Zulus, culminating in a series of wars – most notably the Boer Wars.

Recent History

More recently, South Africa has managed to overcome the Apartheid era, a time where discrimination of black people was legalised. Until 1994, black people were unable to legally own land or vote in elections. Further to this, education, healthcare, beaches and public places like cinemas were segregated. During this time, South Africa was ruled and controlled by the white minority, much to the dissatisfaction of the black population and ultimately, the world. After much international pressure and many attempts at reform, the Apartheid era was finally ended in 1994, with Nelson Mandela stepping up to lead the nation as President. Due to this challenging history, modern day South Africa has many social issues to work on and resolve, but many of its people are filled with hope and optimism. In 2010, South Africa successfully hosted the FIFA World Cup, much to the delight of its citizens and the world.








Top 10 Places of South Africa

Top 10 Places of South Africa




Top 10 Photo-Worthy Places of South Africa

1. Drakensberg Mountains

Use your wide-angle lens to capture the majestic Drakensberg Mountain Range in all its panoramic glory. This impressive mountain range is the highest in Southern Africa and provides a wide and wonderful scope for impressive postcard-worthy shots.

2. Stellenbosch

Rolling green pastures, vineyards and orchards combine to create classic photo moments straight out of a guidebook. This cultured and charming area showcases a different side to South Africa, and will no doubt have people guessing where your photo was taken.

3. Knysna

This quaint seaside town located on South Africa’s Garden Route is one of the most photogenic in Africa. Whether you’re snapping the boats in the harbour, the dolphins frolicking in the waves or the wild and rocky coast, it’s hard not to snap Knysna in a good light.

4. Soweto

Fans of street art will love capturing the murals and memorials of spirited Soweto. The gritty urban landscapes and candid faces make it simple to capture the soul of this endearing, inspiring community.

5. Cintsa

This gem of the South African Coast has retained a village atmosphere despite its growing popularity with tourists. The beaches, bays and rock pools provide sensational photography moments, especially at dawn and dusk when the sun gives off incredible, moody light.

6. Cape Town

Easily one of the most picturesque cities in the world, Cape Town has some of the most photo-worthy landscapes in the world. From breathtaking Table Mountain to the stunning coast and beautiful beaches, Cape Town has profound natural beauty coming at you from every angle.

7. Durban

Sure, Durban’s beaches are special but the interesting mix of Indian, Muslim, African and European influences makes for great photography. Durban’s cultural cornucopia of markets, mosques and galleries offers rich fodder for snap-happy travellers looking to capture a different side of Africa.

8. Lamberts Bay

The tremendously large colony of Cape Gannet birds who live off Lamberts Bay is often photographed - and with good reason. The sight of hundreds of birds tightly packed into a small space against a backdrop of azure ocean provides a unique, snap-worthy photo subject.

9. Blyde River Canyon

This canyon is every bit as stunning as America’s Grand Canyon, yet in a different way. Lush greenery grows over most of the area and a diverse range of animal and plant life is supported within its deep cliffs and valleys. It’s difficult to take a bad photo here, as Mother Nature has kindly provided a near perfect canvas.

10. Kruger National Park

This iconic national park has some of the ‘most-photographed’ animals in the world. Visitors love capturing shots of lions hunting prey, elephants drinking at waterholes and cheetahs sleeping under trees. Mesmerising amber sunsets and rolling savanna only add to the atmospheric magic of it all.








Shopping






×

Shopping




From the provincial markets of sleepy towns, through the malls of Johannesburg and to the galleries and cafes of Cape Town, there are many options for parting with money in South Africa. From budget market souvenirs to more indulgent bespoke buys, visitors will be pleased with the variety on offer here.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in South Africa

1. Zulu Beads

Zulu beadwork acts as a form of communication for Zulu people but visitors are usually drawn to buy beads for their vibrancy and visual appeal. Necklaces, bracelets and head pieces are particularly popular.

2. Township Art

This urban art form involves recycling common landfill items like soft drink cans, telephone wire, paper and tyres, and turning them into jewellery, ornaments, key rings, bags and toys. Township art makes a unique souvenir or gift as it supports local artists and keeps excess waste out of landfill.

3. Gourmet Goodies

The Cape area has loads of amazing providores and food producers, so this is the best place to stock up on chutneys, jams and preserves made from local mango, fig, oranges and grapes.

4. Rooibos Products

This caffeine-free herbal tea has been drunk in South Africa for generations, and is a cheap souvenir option for friends and family back home. You will also be able to find rooibos skincare and beauty products too

Festivals and Events




Freedom Day

This national public holiday commemorates the anniversary of South Africa’s constitution democracy – a very important sentiment to Africans living in the post-apartheid world. Marked by military flyovers, song, dance and other entertainment, this is a time of celebration, peace and unity.

Cape Town Jazz Festival

Cape Town shines with two days of hot jazz performances from African entertainers at this very popular festival. Although many of the shows sell out well in advance, the free outdoor concert ensures no one misses out.

Knysna Oyster Festival

This annual festival held over 10 days in winter offers so much more than oysters. Sure, indulge in some oysters but don’t forget about the fun runs, marathons, wine tastings, eating competitions, live music and cooking demos.

Failure to present an e-passport will result in denied entry. Passengers with a valid visa issued in a non-machine readable passport will be handled on a case by case basis, but a fine will still be applicable.

Entry Requirements - Yellow Fever Certificate:
A valid Yellow Fever Vaccination Certificate is required for all passengers over one year of age who arrive or are transiting through South Africa, from a country or region listed by the World Health Organization as infected by yellow fever. Travellers unable to present a valid yellow fever vaccination certificate issued at least 10 days before arrival in South Africa will be refused entry. There is no option for travellers without a vaccination certificate to be vaccinated on arrival. Please note this also includes transiting through an infected country or region.

Entry Requirements - Travelling with Children:
Parents need to produce an original unabridged birth certificate if they are travelling with children. This regulation has been put in place to protect children from being abducted, kidnapped and child trafficking. The Department of Home Affairs has urged all parents to apply for unabridged certificates for their children. Additionally, further documentation including permission to travel, may be required if only one parent is travelling. These are requirements of the immigration regulation 6 (12)(a) for parents travelling with children. More information can be found here:
http://www.dha.gov.za/index.php/civic-services/traveling-with-children

We recommend travellers check all entry and visa requirements before travel as they can change.







Is tipping customary in South Africa?









It's considered polite to tip service workers in South Africa, as most receive a small wage. As a general rule, add 10-15% to bills at cafes, bars and restaurants (if it hasn’t already been added). Tour guides, drivers, valets and porters also should be tipped (5-10 ZAR should be sufficient).







What is the internet access like in South Africa?









Travellers will be able to access the internet quite easily in the internet cafes of South Africa’s large cities but limited to no access should be expected in rural areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in South Africa?









Mobile phone coverage is very good in South Africa’s large cities and towns, but less so in rural and mountainous areas. Ensure you have global roaming activated before leaving home if you wish to use your mobile phone. However a cheaper option may be to buy a sim card at the airport and purchase a plan with both calls and data.

South Africa is modern country with mostly flushable toilets. However, areas like national parks and villages may have squat toilets.







What will it cost for a…?









Can of soft drink = 6 ZAR
Coffee in a cafe = 12 ZAR
Beer in a bar = 15 ZAR
Simple takeaway meal = 30 ZAR
Bottle of wine = 30 ZAR
Three-course restaurant meal = 300 ZAR







Can I drink the water in South Africa?









Tap water can be drunk in South Africa’s cities, however drinking tap water in rural areas isn't recommended. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water. Ask your leader where filtered water can be found, some hotels we stay in may have drinking water available. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in South Africa?









Credit cards are usually accepted by large hotels, modern shops and western-style restaurants but not by smaller vendors. Ensure you have adequate cash to cover purchases not able to be made on credit.







What is ATM access like in South Africa?









There are many ATMs in the big cities and regional towns of South Africa. Rural areas, national parks and small villages will have limited to no ATMs, so be sure to carry other payment options before travelling out of the big cities.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in South Africa?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.
