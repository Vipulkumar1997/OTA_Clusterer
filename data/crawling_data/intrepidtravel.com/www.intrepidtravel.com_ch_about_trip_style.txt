About

Travel styles




Every Intrepid small group adventure has been carefully designed to make sure you have an unforgettable grassroots travel experience. Over the years, we’ve developed several trip styles and themes to cater for a diverse range of travellers. Take a look below to find out what your ideal Intrepid adventure might look like.










Basix

For travellers on a budget

Basix trips keep things simple to give you amazing experiences for travellers of any age on a budget. We use simple, clean and centrally located accommodation, use local transport where we can and include plenty of free time so you can do the things that suit your budget and interests.

Original

The original Intrepid style

The trips we built our reputation on! They're the perfect choice for those after a great mix of included activities and free time to explore a destination on their own. Original trips use well-located, tourist-class hotels and include some meals.

Comfort

More creature comforts

We’ve smoothed away some of adventure travel’s rougher edges to craft a style of travel that has an added degree of, well... comfort. Enjoy a more relaxed pace of travel, comfortable accommodation, more included activities and many meals along the way.

How do our styles compare?

Accommodation

Where we stay ensures we keep our travellers firmly entrenched in a region’s people and culture, and provides them with unique local experiences that benefit the community too. Across all of our styles, many of our itineraries also include homestay experiences – what better way to get to know a culture than by sharing a meal and time with a local family.



Basix

Simple, clean and centrally located accommodation

Typical accommodation types include: budget hotels, local guesthouses, camping or homestays



Original

Mostly standard tourist-class hotels

Local guesthouses and homestay experiences are featured on many itineraries

Some trips include a bit of camping



Comfort

Comfortable hotels with pivate amenities and often plenty of local character

Some itineraries feature homestays or unique accomodation



Inclusions

All our group trips include an amazing
group leader
, accommodation, transport and good times. Depending on the trip style you choose, there are also a number of group activities and meals included.



Basix

Plenty of free time and optional activities on offer, so you can choose how to spend your time and money

Meals are generally not included, which means you can eat what and where you want.

Experienced leader, local to the region



Original

Has a balance between free time to explore at your own pace and included activities that help you experience things you may not discover on your own

Some meals are included along the way

Experienced leader, local to the region



Comfort

While we leave some free time for you to explore at your own pace, we have taken the hassle out of travel by including many of the activities

More meals included

Experienced leader, local to the region



Transport

Half the fun of travel is the travelling itself. That's why all Intrepid adventures come with all manner of transport modes – from the slightly unusual to the downright bizarre!



Basix

Mostly uses local transport (tuk-tuk anyone?)

Specialist overland and safari vehicles in some areas



Original

Uses a mixture of private and local transport

Think tuk-tuk, camel, private safari vehicle, bus, train, canoe – whatever is the best way to get around



Comfort

Primarily uses private transport

Local transport is occasionally used when it adds to the experience, like hopping on the back of a camel in the Sahara









Solo traveller?



Not anymore! You're about to meet a bunch of potential new friends who want to explore the same destination as you. Best of all, when it comes to accommodation, there's no extra charge when you share with a member of the same gender. Although, if you want to spare others from your snoring or you're simply after a little more privacy with your own room, we offer a single supplement on many of our itineraries.
