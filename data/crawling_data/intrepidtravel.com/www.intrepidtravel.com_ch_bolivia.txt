2017 Bolivia Highlights,

David Jerram

The trip to the Bolivian Alti Plana was a highlight of our extensive trip through South America. I am not sure how we would have managed this without using Intrepid. It was a fantastic trip.

Best time to visit Bolivia

Best time to visit Bolivia




May to October (winter) is generally considered to be the best time to visit Bolivia, as days are usually dry and clear. Summer (November to April) is the rainy season, and during this time it can get hot and humid. The peak tourist season runs from late June to early September. This season holds the best weather for travel, but is Bolivia's main fiesta season and holiday period, so some disruptions can be expected at times.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




One of only two landlocked nations on the South American continent, Bolivia is a mixture of highland plains, lush valleys, steep canyons and tropical forests. Bordering
Peru
and
Chile
in the west, Bolivia extends across the Andes ranges, cradling its capital city (La Paz) within the high plateau of the Altiplano. Over 40% of Bolivians live in this mountainous area, a landscape of volcanic flats and craggy peaks. Further west are two of Bolivia’s most contrasting features. To the southwest lies the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on earth, while the far northwest encompasses Lake Titicaca, the world’s highest lake.








Top 10 Bizarre Bits of Bolivia

Top 10 Bizarre Bits of Bolivia




1. Giant Frogs

No, Lake Titicaca’s high altitude isn’t causing you to hallucinate – you may have just caught a glimpse of the world’s largest aquatic frog. Measuring in at up to 50 centimetres long (the size of an adult foot!), the extremely rare Titicaca Water Frog can weigh up to 3 kilograms.

2. Lost City of Titicaca

So you weren’t hallucinating when you thought you saw a giant frog, but surely there's nothing else hiding beneath Titicaca’s surface? Wrong again. In 1988, taking hints from a local legend, divers descended to Titicaca’s murky depths and discovered a real-life lost city. The temple complex, believed to be pre-Inca, is said to be over 1,500 years old.

3. El Tio and the Potosi Mines

A sombre experience at the best of times, the plight of the Potosi miners is one of Bolivia’s more tragic tales. In many ways emblematic of this are the ghastly effigies of El Tio, the guardian of the mines and the god of the underworld. Workers offer cigarettes and coca leaves in the hope that they will receive good fortune, paying their respects to this terrifying spirit on each descent into the darkness of the mines.

4. Macho Valley

Not known for their subtlety, Bolivians have named this valley ‘Macho’ for a reason. Meaning ‘male’ in Spanish, this collection of phallic shaped rock formations is a sight for sore eyes.

5. Bolivian Bus-Train

Looking for a cheaper way to travel from Sucre to Potosi? Look no further than the Bolivian bus-train, a transport innovation like no other. Faced with the dilemma of having a complete railway but no train, locals simply converted a bus, swapping its tires for tracks. The result? A scenic and thrilling way to ascend this 4,000 metre climb - all for the very fair price of $3.50!

6. The ‘Death Road’

If the Bolivian bus-train doesn’t get your blood pumping, the harrowing ‘Death Road’ may literally send you over the edge. Snaking its way across the Yungas toward the Amazon rainforest, this road is among the world's most dangerous. But try telling that to the locals, who insist on driving massive trucks and buses at brisk speeds along its narrow, twisting path – at least affording their terrified passengers the views of a lifetime.

7. Women’s Wrestling

Bolivia’s newest sporting phenomenon comes in the form of feisty 'cholitas' (women). These ladies compete in professional wrestling bouts around the country, much to delight of their adoring fans. Part circus, part sport, all female - these unique sportswomen are undoubtedly some of wrestling’s fiercest competitors.

8. Witches’ Market

Creepy masks and odd trinkets sold by astrologists and sorcerers - Bolivia’s famous Witches’ Market never fails to leave a lasting impression. See real-life witches selling potions, casting spells and stirring cauldrons - this madhouse market is full of wacky characters and strange souvenirs.

9. Salt Hotel

Apart from being one of Bolivia’s most famous attractions, the Salar de Uyuni salt plain offers one of the quirkiest accommodation options on the market. For 30 dollars a night, visitors to the world’s largest salt flat can stay in a hotel made entirely from salt. That’s right, salt floors, a salt roof, a salt bar and even a salt dining table. One things for sure, you won’t be asking anyone to “pass the salt” in this zany hotel.

10. The Dinosaur Wall

Discovered by Bolivian construction workers in 1994, Cal Orko (or the Dinosaur Wall) is a prehistoric oddity of epic proportions. Found on the banks of a cement quarry, this collection of over 5,000 tracks from 330 different species of dinosaurs is a rarity in the world of palaeontology. Over 68 million years old, it's thought that this quarry was previously a gigantic lake, its steep slopes once traversed by gravity-defying dinosaurs keen for a drink. Nowadays, this precious landmark is beginning to crumble - resulting in conservation efforts from the Bolivian government.

Bolivia travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Bolivia?









BOLIVIA TOURIST VISA
Australia: Not required
Belgium: Not required
Canada: Not required
Germany: Not required
Ireland: Not required
Netherlands: Not required
New Zealand: Not required
South Africa: Not required
Switzerland: Not required
United Kingdom: Not required
United States: Yes - in advance

a copy of the Intrepid voucher that you receive after purchasing your trip

a copy of the Itinerary which you can obtain from the Trip Notes for your specific trip on our website.








Is tipping customary in Bolivia?









While tipping isn't mandatory in Bolivia, it's customary to add spare change or a small amount to restaurant bills. Although most restaurants and bars may already include a 10% service charge within the bill, feel free to add more if the service was good. Taxi drivers generally don't expect tips.







What is the internet access like in Bolivia?









Internet cafes can be found in Bolivia's large cities and towns frequented by tourists. Internet availability is less widespread in rural and remote areas, so be prepared to disconnect for a while when travelling out of the city.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Bolivia?









You should be able to use your mobile phone in Bolivia's cities, but prepare for less coverage in remote or mountainous areas. Ensure you have global roaming enabled before leaving your home country.







What are the toilets like in Bolivia?









Bolivia has a mix of flushable toilets and squat toilets so expect both. It's a good idea to carry your own toilet paper and hand sanitiser, as these aren't always provided.







What will it cost for a...?









City bus fare = 1.50 BOB
Cup of coffee in a cafe = 10 BOB
Bottle or can of beer = 10 BOB
Simple lunch = 20-25 BOB
Dinner in a restaurant = 80 BOB







Can I drink the tap water in Bolivia?









Drinking tap water isn't recommended in Bolivia. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water - ask your leader where filtered water can be found. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Bolivia?









Credit cards can be used at most top-end hotels, restaurants, shops and other tourist establishments. Expect to pay cash when dealing with smaller vendors, family-run restaurants and market stalls.







What is ATM access like in Bolivia?









ATMs can be found in most of Bolivia's major cities and tourist areas. ATMs are far less common in rural areas and small villages so have enough cash to cover purchases when travelling away from the larger cities.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Bolivia?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment.

Top responsible travel tips for Bolivia

Be considerate of Bolivia’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
