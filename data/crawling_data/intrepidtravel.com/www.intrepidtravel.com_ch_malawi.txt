Malawi tours & travel

Destinations

Africa

Malawi



Nestled between some of East Africa's blockbuster destinations is Malawi, a country small in geography but large in appeal.


Malawi is full of contrasts, the most obvious being that it's a nation of fisherman - despite being landlocked - owing to the clear waters of Lake Malawi; it boasts verdant highlands and tropical forests, undulating valleys and exceptional game viewing within its national parks. Malawi is also home to some of the continent's friendliest folk, meaning it's a country well worth considering on your African agenda.

Best time to visit Malawi

Best time to visit Malawi




The dry season from late April to October or November is the best time to visit Malawi. For wildlife viewing, late in the dry season is best as this is when animals converge at water holes, although the afternoons can be long and hot. The scenery is at its best from May to July when the weather is also less oppressive - although nights can be chilly and local wildlife harder to spot. The wet season runs from December to March and, while weather can be quite unpredictable, during this time the vegetation will be at its most lush.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




With the third largest lake in Africa running almost the entire length of its eastern flank, visitors to Malawi often make a beeline to the idyllic shores of Lake Malawi and choose to explore no further. And, with pristine water that's ideal for all forms of water-based fun, it's easy to see why! But venture a little further afield and you'll discover much natural diversity and a changing terrain of lush forests and game parks, rugged mountains and fertile plateaux.
