Benin



As the birthplace of voodoo, Benin oozes the exotic.


With its glittering palaces, floating villages and python-filled temples, this is a country that has always moved to its own beat. From filling your belly with fried beans and yams, to paddling across a lagoon or following in the footsteps of slaves, Benin is filled with engaging, curious and amazing experiences.

Ghana, Togo & Benin,
February 2017

Faye Turner

Fantastic trip through Ghana, Togo and Benin, with a really variety of things to see and do.  Even the drive days are fantastic to see everyday life happening around you and absorb the culture, which is relatively untouched by tourism.  A real escape from first world problems (and wifi)!!

Best time to visit Benin

Best time to visit Benin




The most pleasant months to visit Benin are between November and February when temperatures drop along with the humidity. From April to July and September to October expect heavy rains. The dry and dusty harmattan winds from the Sahara blow between December and March, and this period (particularly February to April) can be uncomfortably hot, with temperatures in the mid-40s (Celsius).








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




This relatively small slice of
Africa
has a beautiful coastline dotted with palm trees and beaches. Behind the coast is a network of lagoons which flood during the rainy months. Further inland the plateau gradually rises into the highlands and the Atakora Mountains. Benin shares a border with Nigeria to the east,
Burkina Faso
and Nigeria to the north and
Togo
to the west.








Top 5 Distinctly Beninese Moments

Top 5 Distinctly Beninese Moments




1. Paddle a Pirogue

A good chunk of Benin is under, over, or around water and when the roads disappear, there’s only one way to travel – by pirogue! These dugout canoes have serviced the Beninese for centuries.

2. Step in the Footsteps of Slaves

Ouidah was often the last bit of Africa slaves saw as they were sent around the world to be traded and worked. The Portuguese, English and French all constructed forts here to protect their trading interests, one of which now houses a museum that gives you a unique glimpse into the terror and destruction that the slave trade wreaked on this part of the world.

3. Stay in a Stilt City

Over 10,000 people call the waters of Ganvie home. Perched up above the lagoon in stilted houses, they eat, sleep, fish and live miles away from dry land. Stay in an auberge for a taste of life on the water.

4. Learn Voodoo

Over 60% of Beninese practice voodoo. Dive right into the traditions and everyday rituals as you travel through villages. The Musée d'histoire d'Ouidah gives an interesting insight into voodoo history and culture in the area.

5. Tuck Into Yams

They’re the favourite, number one food of the Beninese. Mashed, fried, as chips or slathered in peanut sauce - it’s not a meal until it’s been yammed.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Benin

Be considerate of Benin’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
