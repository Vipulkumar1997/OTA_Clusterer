Central America

Bahamas



If we had to pick one place to live out the rest of our days, it would probably be somewhere like the Bahamas.


Home to powdery white cays, year-round good weather and the clearest, bluest water in the world, this archipelago of 700 islands is what you might call a little slice of paradise. But there’s a lot more to the Bahamas than millionaire-dollar views and diamond-studded millionaires. Dive a little deeper (or sail a little further) and you’ll discover virgin reefs, historic shipwrecks, pink sand beaches and mangroves flush with exotic birdlife, not to mention some of the most gregarious and welcoming locals you’ll ever meet.

Bahamas Sailing Adventure,
May 2017

Sam Malhotra

Fabulous, once in a lifetime trip!  The Bahamas was one of the most beautiful locations I have ever been to, the weather was incredible and sailing enabled us to see The Bahamas in a really special way - getting into remote spots, breathtaking snorkeling everyday and some truly unique opportunities to interact with the natural world!  Skipper Judy is a complete star - she looked after a very international group with relaxed confidence and charm that engaged the group and inspired trust.  In particular, she helped me (a novice snorkeler) gain confidence in the water and so enabled me to have one the of the most spectacular experiences of my life!  Adriann (our cook) added even more warmth and personality by not only conjuring up delicious food and drinks every day (incredible!) but by also spending time to get to know everyone and look after them on an individual basis.  Between them, they created a fun, friendly and incredibly comfortable environment and made the trip for me.  I really can't recommend this trip enough!

Bahamas Sailing Adventure,

Kathleen Cleversley

If you love being on the water and seeing lots of sea life then this trip is for you. As a group everyone got along and we all talked about how great it was to get to know Judy and Adrian.

Best time to visit Bahamas

Best time to visit Bahamas



The Bahamas see an average of 300 sunny days per year, so there’s no bad time to visit, really. The tropical southern islands in particular are warm all year round. Temperatures are fairly consistent and rarely get below 16 degrees Celsius, even during the wintertime. The rainy offseason takes place between May and November; if you want to avoid the crowds, this is the best time to visit. Although hurricanes do occur in the Bahamas, they are no cause for alarm (and are in fact less common then on the mainland of the USA).








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment



The 700 cays and atolls of the Bahamas are actually the tops of three ancient ocean banks – the Little Bahama Bank, the Great Bahama Bank the Cay Sal Bank in the region’s west. At 63 metres (over 200 feet), the highest point in the archipelago is Mount Alvernia on Cat Island. Many of the islands, particularly in the more tropical south, are home to lush foliage and swampy mangroves.

Blue holes and shallow coral reefs are prolific; in fact, around 5% of the world’s coral is found in the Bahamas. You’ll find white, sandy beaches everywhere, sometimes tinged a distinctive pink due to the presence of microscopic shelled organisms known as Foraminifera. The islands are also home to a vast array of wildlife, including birds, frogs, insects, sharks, dolphins, fish, turtles and the wild horses of Abaco.

Top responsible travel tips for Bahamas

Be considerate of the Bahamas’ customs, traditions, religion and culture

Bahamians dress conservatively. Confine swimwear to the beach (wearing it elsewhere is considered disrespectful), and if visiting a church, avoid t-shirts, shorts and trainers.

Keep public displays of romantic affection to a minimum.

When meeting and addressing someone, offer a handshake. First names are reserved for friends and family, and should only be used if initiated by a local.

Bahamians are a polite people. It’s good manners to introduce any conversation with some brief salutations, even when asking a basic question.

Tourism is the mainstay of the Bahamian economy. If you are given directions or taken to a requested destination by a local, it is polite to tip them accordingly.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children

Never touch or remove coral from reefs. Also, avoid buying souvenirs that have been illegally removed from the reef.
