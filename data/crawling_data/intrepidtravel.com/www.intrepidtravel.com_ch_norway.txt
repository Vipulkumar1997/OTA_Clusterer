Norway tours & travel

Destinations

Europe

Norway



This Scandinavian land of great glaciers, isolated islands, dramatic fjords and multi-hued houses looks stunning all year round - blanketed in snow, drenched in sun or under the glint of the dazzling Aurora Borealis.


From hiking over alpine meadows in the spring time, through hitting the slopes in winter to kicking back on lakes during summer, Norway may not be the cheapest travel destination, but is well worth the investment.

Best time to visit Norway

Best time to visit Norway




Because of the Gulf Stream, the climate in Norway is noticeably warmer than what would otherwise be expected at such high latitude. Summers can be moderately warm (up to 30 degrees Celsius), even in northern areas, but only for limited periods. The length of the winter and amount of snow varies around the country. In the north there is more snow and winters are dark; on the southern and western coasts, winters are moderate and rainy, while further inland the temperature can get below -25 degrees Celsius. March, April, October and November tend to be the rainiest months. Snow usually starts to fall in October/November in the northern areas (and in higher altitudes) and generally melts by the end of April. The Northern Lights are visible from parts of Norway, with September to April usually presenting the optimal conditions for viewing.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Sharing borders with
Sweden
,
Russia
and
Finland
, Norway occupies the northern corner of the Scandinavian Peninsula, with the North Sea, Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea providing coastline on the rugged northern, southern and western sides of the country. Possessing more than 50,000 islands, majestic mountain ranges, pristine fjords, glacial lakes and dramatic waterfalls, Norway has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the world. On the flipside, Norway is also home to vibrant, modern cities and charming rural towns, with most of the population living in the more hospitable south of the country.








Must-Visit Museums of Oslo

Must-Visit Museums of Oslo




Top 5 Must-Visit Museums of Oslo

1. Munch Museum

Oslo's comprehensive museum dedicated to the stirringly dark works of Edvard Munch is well worth a visit. Norway's best known artist is given the royal treatment with no less than 1,200 of his paintings and 18,000 of his prints displayed here.

2. Nobel Peace Centre

A museum dedicated to the promotion of world peace can only be a good thing. Home to photography exhibitions, informative lectures and interactive galleries dedicated to Peace Prize Laureates, this place takes the concept of peace and gives it a high tech makeover.

3. Holmenkollen Ski Museum

Found at the base of Oslo's iconic ski jump, the world's oldest ski museum showcases the 4000-year-old history of the sport. Who knew people had been skiing that long? Take the elevator to the top of the tower for supreme views of the city.

4. Vikingshipshuset

This museum dedicated to the preservation of Viking ships and artefacts features an astonishing array of intact ships, utensils and tools. Showcasing classic Viking design and decoration, it's astounding to think many of these boats were built in the 9th century.

5. Norwegian Folk Museum

Home to the world's oldest open air museum, this celebration of Norway's culture, history and customs is a one-stop shop for everything 'Norway'. From wonderful examples of folk dress, Sami artefacts and art, to rare musical instruments and toys, photography and prints from the 1800s, you could easily spend a whole day here.

Top responsible travel tips for Norway

1. Be considerate of Norway’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with tap or filtered water.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

5. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

6. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
