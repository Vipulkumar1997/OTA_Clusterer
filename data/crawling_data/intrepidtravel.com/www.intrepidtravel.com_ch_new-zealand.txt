New Zealand Adventure Northbound (ex Christchurch),
October 2017

Eileen Emery

This was a brilliant trip, visiting a lot of places in a relatively short period of time, with a great variety of landscapes and available activities. To achieve this involved a lot of overland travel, staying for just one or 2 nights in each place, so quite a full on itinerary, with very little relaxation time, however it was well worth it to see so much of this amazing country.

Amparo Llanos

A different way to travel, off the tourist track experiences, friendly tour leaders and a great variety in tours, just take your pick, from nature to cities.

Best time to visit New Zealand




The most pleasant time for travelling throughout New Zealand is summer (December to February); however, this is also the busiest period, especially during school holidays (late December to late January). Winter can get very cold with frequent snowfall - but this is the perfect time to travel if you’re looking to ski or snowboard, particularly in the South Island.

Culture and customs

Culture and customs




Due to immigration, modern New Zealand is home to a diverse blend of people from far and wide. Maori, Pacific Islander, European and Asian influences blend peacefully to create a vibrant culture. Known for being friendly, down-to-earth, laidback and open, most visitors will find New Zealanders from all ethnicities to be helpful, approachable, generous and up for a laugh.

Maori culture has its origins in Polynesia so some aspects of Maori language, customs and traditions are quite similar to those of neighbouring islands. With strong traditional values based on respect for the family, ancestors and the land, Maori culture is hierarchical and steeped in centuries of tradition. Maori families typically come together for special occasions, celebrations and ceremonies filled with sacred dance, spiritual song and traditional food. Visitors will see traditional Maori art and carving almost everywhere they go in New Zealand, from elaborate tattooing to carved necklaces. Although Maori culture experienced a decline after the arrival of European settlers, it experienced a renaissance of sorts in the 1960s, which continues to grow today.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways of experiencing a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

With award-winning wineries, cool bars, indulgent restaurants and a multitude of farmers' markets, eating in New Zealand is a real treat.

Things to try in New Zealand

1. Wine & Beer

Producing a huge variety of top quality wines, visitors will have fun visiting vineyards and cellar doors all around the country. But it’s not all about the wine in New Zealand - microbreweries are well represented too. So be sure to savour a boutique brew before you leave.

2. Seafood

New Zealanders are spoilt for choice when it comes to seafood. Being an island nation has its advantages – fresh prawns, lobster, mussels and oysters are in abundance all year round. For those on a budget, fish and chips on the beach provide a seafood fix at an affordable price.

3. Lamb

With sheep playing a huge part in New Zealand’s agricultural economy, it’s no wonder succulent lamb can be found in most restaurants. If you’re a meat lover, don’t leave New Zealand without tasting the lamb.

4. Kiwi Fruit

It comes as no surprise that New Zealand grows a lot of kiwifruit. Try it fresh from a market stall or fruiterer, cut up in fruit salad, in desserts like pavlova or even as a jam.

5. Pavlova

Even though the creator of this desert is hotly contested by their trans-Tasman cousins, the pavlova - a dessert with a meringue-like base and topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit - was the invention of a Wellington chef to honour Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova's tour of Australia and New Zealand in the 1920s. A trip to New Zealand is not complete without indulging in a slice of this national icon.








Top 10 Wine regions of New Zealand

Top 10 Wine regions of New Zealand




1. Marlborough

New Zealand’s wine capital produces top quality chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot gris but it’s the sauvignon blanc that has achieved cult status around the world. Also producing first-class seafood and olive oil, Marlborough is a fave with foodies and wine lovers.

2. Canterbury

With the ideal climate for grape growing, Canterbury produces many internationally acclaimed wine varieties, including pinot noir, pinot gris, chardonnay and Riesling. Pegasus Bay Winery is one of the most popular in this area, and with a restaurant attached to the winery visitors can indulge in the complete culinary experience.

3. Bay of Plenty

This picturesque area may be well known for its pristine beaches, but it’s also got a few small wineries well worth visiting. Surrounding berry farms, orchards and lavender fields add to the charm.

4. Auckland

There are many boutique wineries creating note-worthy drops in and around Auckland. Kumeu, Henderson and Waiheke Island are hotspots for wine tourism – with awarded wines coming from many small, up-and-coming estates.

5. Central Otago

Spectacular mountain ranges, azure lakes and rolling rivers combine to create one of the world's most scenic wine regions. The vineyards of Central Otago produce a wide range of grapes, but the pinot noir is considered the best.

6. Northland

Way up north, the vineyards populating the historic Northland area produce a wide range of reds and whites. From iconic chardonnay to the more complex chambourcin and exotic syrah, there are loads of cellar doors waiting to welcome you.

7. Hawke’s Bay

New Zealand’s oldest wine growing region also produces most of New Zealand’s most sustainable wines. This commitment to sustainability in the industry has garnered worldwide attention, as has its bold, full-bodied reds. The Art Deco town of Napier is well worth a visit too.

8. Gisborne

If you like your wines a little fruity then the Gisborne region will impress. Merlot, gewurztraminer, syrah and chardonnay are among the best on offer in this region, which is on the same parallel as Malaga and Melbourne.

9. Nelson

Winemaking is considered an art form in cultured Nelson. With many unique producers in the region, it won’t be hard to find some smooth wines to savour. Local delis, cafes, providores and galleries add to the artistic, gastronomic mix.

10. Wairarapa

This relatively small winemaking region is made up of three sub-regions: Martinborough, Masterton and Gladstone. Although only a small amount of New Zealand's wine is produced here, the quality is superb with a great track record in pumping out world-class pinot noir.








Shopping






×

Shopping




With a nice little mix of malls, boutiques, galleries, fresh produce markets, cellar doors and providores, New Zealand has enough variety to keep most keen shoppers happy. Look beyond the tourist shops selling stuffed toys and flags and dig a little deeper to find unique art, locally-made crafts and gourmet goods.

It’s a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in New Zealand

1. Tasty Treats

New Zealand is home to many producers of fine food. Home grown wine, olive oil, honey, jam and avocado oil are among the best picks.

2. Wool

With a huge sheep population, the quality and variety of wool is superb in New Zealand. From hand knitted jumpers (jerseys to the locals) to sheepskin rugs and top quality knitting yarn, it’s easy to find a warm and woolly souvenir

3. Art & Handicrafts

From ceramic bowls to metal sculptures, woodcarvings to greenstone jewellery, you'll find traditional Maori techniques and influences in many of New Zealand’s art and crafts. Try to find authentic, locally made items rather than imported (and inferior!) goods.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Sitting in the South Pacific Ocean, this island nation is split in two – comprising two major landmasses surrounded by several smaller islands. The mountainous South Island is larger (but less populated) and features New Zealand’s highest peak (Mt Cook) as well as glaciers, rugged bush and a rocky coast. The North Island is more volcanic – typical environmental features include geysers, lakes and mud pools. Forest growth can be found all over New Zealand, with large national parks and reserves preserving the nation’s heritage bushland.

History and government




Early History

Maori tribes, descended from Polynesia, lived in New Zealand for centuries before the arrival of Europeans in the 18th century. Relying on fishing, hunting and foraging, these people were able to live off the land and develop a deep connection with the earth as a result of this. European settlers caused wide-scale disruption and land loss for the Maoris, which resulted in conflict and displacement in the early days of colonisation. The 1840 Treaty of Waitangi officially recognised Maori land ownership, of which the British and Maoris were signatories. This historic agreement is viewed as a pivotal moment in New Zealand’s history and the first important step towards reconciliation between the original inhabitants and settlers.

Recent History

In 1852, New Zealand was granted the right to self-govern and in 1907, independence was granted (although the British monarchy remain as head of state). More recently, New Zealand voted in its first female prime minister in 1997. Jenny Shipley held office for two years, before handing over to another female leader - Helen Clarke, who continued to lead until 2008.

In the last ten years, New Zealand has enjoyed a surge in tourism, partly due to the wealth of wineries, ski fields and nature reserves. The film industry has also been a great champion of New Zealand, with filmmakers enjoying the rugged terrain and relatively cheap costs associated with filming in New Zealand. The Lord of the Rings franchise is probably the most well known film to be shot in New Zealand, and has been largely responsible for putting New Zealand in the international spotlight.

A devastating earthquake hit Christchurch in 2011, resulting in widespread loss of life and infrastructure. Although Christchurch is still rebuilding, visitors are encouraged to visit this spirited city.
