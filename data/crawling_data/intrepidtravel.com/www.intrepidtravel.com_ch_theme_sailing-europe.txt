Europe sailing tours




Sailing trips in Europe can feel a bit like you’ve stumbled into a Bridget Bardot movie: sleepy Italian hamlets perched on limestone cliffs, the sun-drenched glitz of the Cote d’Azur, lazing the day away on deck with a handful of Grecian olives. It’s one of the best ways to explore the continent, although you are faced with some tough decisions: spend the afternoon snorkelling that secluded cove, or sail Croatia’s favourite archipelago? Indulge in a family-run taverna banquet, or burn the calories on a bike ride through the hinterland? To take that evening cocktail before or after Santorini’s marmalade sunset? Ah, decisions, decisions…

Highlights of sailing in Europe










Drop anchor at Capri

Ah, Capri. The Romans knew a good island when they found it. Hence the giant Roman palace built on Monte Tiberio. These days Capri is known for royalty of a different kind, with celebs dropping in to do some boutique shopping or chill out in the aquamarine grottos nearby. A day or two exploring here and it might be hard to get you back on the boat…

Explore on the
Amalfi Coast Sailing Adventure










Wander the cobbled lanes of Amorgos

Amorgos is a mountainous little island in the south-eastern corner of the Cyclades. As far as Greek Islands go, this one is more concerned with activities and archaeology than perfecting your tan. White washed streets, a burgeoning rock climbing scene, ancient ruins and one of the most spectacular monasteries in the Med – it’s a real gem.

Explore on the
Greece Sailing Adventure - Cyclade Islands










Kick back in the Îles d’Hyères Archipelago

France’s Cote d’Azur isn’t just good for celebrity spotting, shopping and mingling with the glitterati (although a little mingling couldn’t hurt) – it’s also the home of the Îles d’Hyères Archipelago. A little collection of shining, mica-rich islands with secluded coves around every headland. Finding an idyllic beach here isn’t hard. Picking your favourite could be.

Life on the boat

We use classic monohull yachts for our European sailing adventures (it helps to get into that old-school Euro vibe). As a guide, a typical 50ft yacht for eight travellers is equipped with four twin/double cabins, two or three shared bathrooms and two showers. You’ll be lead by one of our experienced skippers who knows these waters like the back of their hand.

Life on the boat goes at your own pace: help out on deck as much as you wish, or just lie back and enjoy the ride. The choice is entirely up to you. Just keep in mind: cabin arrangements can be quite cosy so as to leave more room for onboard communal areas.

FAQs





When’s the best time to go sailing in Europe?









Peak season for sailing holidays in the Mediterranean is between June and August, when the sun is hottest and many Europeans have their summer holidays. But if you want to beat the crowds while still enjoying that trademark Med sun, try travelling in spring (mid-April to May) or autumn (September to mid-October): temperatures are more pleasant, the waters are still calm, and you won’t have to fight for that beachside sunbed.







Will I get seasick sailing in Europe?









The extent and severity of seasickness varies from person to person. Some may be lucky enough to experience no symptoms at all while others may suffer headaches, dizziness and vomiting. Usually all symptoms of seasickness resolve after some time to adjust to life onboard.

The Dalmatian Coast is protected from rough seas thanks to the belt of islands just off mainland Croatia. As a result, many passengers will not experience prolonged symptoms of seasickness in this area. While the Mediterranean Sea can be choppy, especially in the fall, sailing between the Greek islands is usually a peaceful voyage.

Sailing conditions on and around the Amalfi Coast are typically mild with frequent periods of calm. Expect no more than a light 8-12 knot (8-13 miles) per hour south easterly wind in the afternoons; perfect for the experienced and novice sailor alike. While we can’t guarantee pristine conditions, you are unlikely to encounter any rough, open seas with the tidal range a minute 30-60 centimeters (1-2 feet).

If you are prone to experience motion sickness, we recommend consulting with your doctor before arriving to see what medical solutions might work for you.

You can also
read our guide
to beating seasickness for alternative methods of combating seasickness.







Can I learn to sail the boat?









Absolutely. The best bit about our small group sailing adventures is we cap our group sizes at 8 travellers. That means our skippers have more time to get to know you and, if you’re interested, teach you all about sailing. Our skippers have years of experience sailing and relish the opportunity to share their passion with their groups.







Are cabins above or below deck?









All cabins on our Europe sailing trips are located below deck.







What cabin configurations are available on the boats?









Each sailing vessel typically comes with three twin/double cabins, as well as a couple of single berths for staff. Your skipper will allocate rooms on arrival. Passengers travelling in pairs will be accommodated together while solo travellers will be placed with a fellow passenger of the same gender wherever possible. This may mean sharing a double mattress or twin mattresses side by side.

Solo travellers have the option of booking a cabin to themselves for an additional fee, please ask our team at the time of your booking for more details.

If you do not identify with the gender assigned on your passport, please let us know at the time of booking so we can make an adjustment to your sleeping arrangements.







Where does the skipper sleep?









The skipper sleeps in his/her own quarters, which are typically allocated at the front of the boat. Refer to the detailed deck plans of our boats for more information on bunk locations.







Can I charge my appliances onboard?









Yes, all cabins come equipped with electrical sockets. Travellers simply need to bring an adaptor with them. See below for electrical outlets by country:

France: Type C (European 2-pin), Type E (French 2-pin, female earth)

Italy: Type C (European 2-pin), Type F (German 2-pin, side clip earth), Type L (Italian 3-pin)

Croatia: Type C (European 2-pin), Type F (German 2-pin, side clip earth)

Greece: Type C (European 2-pin), Type F (German 2-pin, side clip earth)







Is there internet access onboard?









WiFi is not available onboard our boats, but travellers may be able to access WiFi while docked at ports and marinas.







Is there air conditioning onboard?









Airconditioning isn't available on our boats but some boats do have fans in the cabins. All boats will have hatches that can be opened for ventiliation. During warmer months, travellers can even choose to sleep on deck under the stars.







What extra expenses do I need to pay for?









You will need to allow budget to pay for any addtional meals that aren't included in the itinerary (see your Essential Trip Information for more details on meal inclusions), as well as money for souvenirs and alcoholic drinks. It is also recommended you contribute towards the group kitty at the start of your trip. See your Essential Trip Information for more information about group kitties.







Is there a security deposit required?









No, we do not require our travellers to pay a security deposit on any of our sailing trips.






Reviews











Greece Sailing Adventure - Cyclades Islands ,
September 2017

Grace Cho

On this trip I fell in love the Greek islands.  It's a good way to see the famous Cyclades islands like Mykonos and Santorini together with some smaller, lesser known islands which are beautiful and charming in their own ways because you have a sail boat and you're not having to work out the ferries.  If boating and seeing the islands is the main goal, you will enjoy the trip.  Probably best to go in summer.  I went in October and it was cold and windy on the water.  Also there is quite a lot of time spent on the water, which is great if sailing, not so much if by motor.  The islands are not that close together by sail boat so it can take at least half a day to reach them and once you do, sometimes you don't have a lot of hours in the day to spend there like Syros or Folegandros which were a couple of the best islands. Still a good trip and worth doing to see the best of the Cyclades, it's just the weather can be unpredictable and makes a big difference to the trip.

Greece Sailing Adventure - Cyclades Islands ,
September 2017

Nathanael Palmatier

Sailing life leads to interesting use of space; a floormat for the shower would be a nice comfort. Several of the ports had laundry service which could reduce the luggage taken on-board.
