Destinations

South America

Patagonia



Sandwiched between two oceans and sprawled across two countries, Patagonia is as ‘end-of-the-world’ as it gets.


Advancing glaciers, gushing waterfalls, snow-topped granite pillars…it’s no wonder Chile and Argentina both stake a claim over this beautiful slice of South America. Where else can you hike past herds of guanaco, hear giant shards of ice crash into the sea, sail the Beagle Channel past unique flora and fauna, and drop by the world’s southernmost city? If anywhere makes you feel small, it’s Patagonia. Adventure to the end of the world and appreciate our planet at its most wild and spectacular.

Patagonia Trekking,
November 2017

Patricia Markovich

Intrepid provides exciting itineraries with experienced and knowledgeable guides.  Hotels are good to adequate ( with the exception of Buenos Aires - do NOT book additional nights there at the end of your trip! (Reina del Plata)).  Overall, Intrepid travel gives you a pretty intimate experience with the local environment and provides lots of education and great support through their guides.
