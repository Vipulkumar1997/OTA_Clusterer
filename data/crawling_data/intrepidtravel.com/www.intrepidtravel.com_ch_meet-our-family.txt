Meet our family






Run by travellers, for travellers. We’re a family of adventure travel companies, who together make up the world’s largest provider of adventure travel experiences.

For more than 27 years, we’ve specialized in creating immersive, off-the-beaten-path adventures for every type of traveller – from the young to the young-at-heart – with over 1,000 itineraries in 100 countries catering to all budgets, travel styles, and appetites for adventure.

Adventures for every type of traveller

Love the idea of Intrepid, but looking for more options? One of the other adventure companies in our family might be just what you're looking for.















Urban Adventures

Run by passionate locals in more than 150 cities around the globe, Urban Adventures showcase both the world famous sites and local hotspots that make a place tick. From home-cooking classes to history lessons, or cycling excursions to social enterprises, Urban Adventures were created to give travellers a taste of what an Intrepid small group adventure feels like and can be as short as a couple of hours, or as long as a whole day.

Adventure Tours Australia

Adventure Tours Australia has been leading travellers through this diverse land for 25 years. Now 100% Aussie owned, the only thing our expert local guides love more than their country is the chance to show it off. Seeing the sunset over Uluru or snorkeling Great Barrier Reef is pretty special, but we reckon it’s the stories of our people and an understanding of our indigenous culture that is fundamental to truly bringing the real Australia to life.

The Intrepid Foundation

We’re committed to having a purpose beyond profit: supporting the economies and people of the communities we visit, reducing our global footprint by carbon-offsetting our trips, and respecting local customs and culture. Responsible travel is a big reason we do the things we do. It’s why, way back in 2002, we set up The Intrepid Foundation. Its purpose was pretty simple: to empower travellers to make a difference and to help communities in the places we visit. We cover 100% of the administration costs and for every $1 a traveller donates we double it.

Tailor-made Trips

If you would like an Intrepid Real Life experience but prefer to travel with your own private group, our Private Groups Department can help.

For groups of all sizes, we can organise a special departure of one of our pre-existing adventures, or tailor-make an Intrepid-style itinerary to one of our destinations around the world. Special interests or requirements? No problem! We can customize the itinerary and activities just for you by giving your trip an educational, physical or even historical focus!
