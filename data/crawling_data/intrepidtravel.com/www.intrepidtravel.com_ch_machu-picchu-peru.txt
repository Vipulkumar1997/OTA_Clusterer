Machu Picchu Trek & Tours













Home

Destinations

South America

Machu Picchu




These days, Machu Picchu is recognisable to people all over the world. It springs up in history books, on our friends’ Facebook walls and in – ahem – many a travel brochure. But it wasn’t always so. After the Incas abandoned their citadel in the 1500s, Machu Picchu remained hidden from the Spanish conquerors for centuries, used sporadically by local peasants until its discovery by an American archeologist in 1911.

It’s easy to understand why so many tourists embark on a Machu Picchu trek each year, and why the site recently became one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Standing at the Sun Gate as the mist lifts off the mountains, it’s impossible not to feel just this: a worldly sense of wonder.

We incorporate a Machu Picchu tour into all of our small-group Peruvian adventures. Whether you want to hike through cloud forests along the classic Inca Trail, challenge yourself on the quieter Quarry Trail or simply take the train, our local leaders will keep you safe, informed and inspired every step of the way.

Classic Peru,
November 2017

Edward Guinea

Intrepid delivered on their promise for the “Classic Peru” trip. It was amazing to meet so many people and see so many treasures that are the result of Inca and other cultures in this incredible place!

Review submitted 03 Dec 2017











Peru Encompassed,
October 2017

Kelsey Low

This was my first time travelling with Intrepid.   I didn't  want to travel to South America alone as a single woman so I picked a group trip. It has been a wonderful experience and I highly recommend them.  The itinerary covered every highlight I wanted to do and see. Mainly though it was the two guides I had that made the trip. Absolutely loved the trip and would book again with Intrepid in the future!

Classic Peru,
November 2017

Pat Sgro

Intrepid is my first choice for touring because they always try to create an experience that I simply could not find on my own. It's a balancing act to pack in enough stuff yet also include enough free time - Intrepid work hard to get this right. The local guides are fantastic too. With Intrepid I can experience and learn a lot more about a destination and people in a fraction of the time it would take otherwise. Great people to travel with!

Classic Peru,
September 2017

Stephen Wetton

Strongly recommend training prior to travelling. Although we didn't have a lot of walking in our tour, my pre-training helped my ability to particpate, particularly at altitude. And drink water!
