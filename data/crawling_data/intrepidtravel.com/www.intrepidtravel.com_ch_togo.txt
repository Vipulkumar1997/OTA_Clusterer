Togo



Despite its unruly past, Togo has been charming travellers searching for West African paradise for many years.


It’s beautiful, quirky, chilled out and full of diverse cultures. There are perfect beaches, butterfly-filled mountains, charming colonial towns and fishing villages where voodoo is part of everyday life. Explore fetish markets, paddle a pirogue, eat yams and get into the Togolese way of life.

Best time to visit Togo






×

Best time to visit Togo




November to February is generally considered the best time to visit Togo as the weather is at its mildest and driest. This is also the time when the harmattan winds blow sand from the Sahara and the air can sometimes be thick with dust. The rainy season, from May to October, brings spectacular rain, sometimes forcing the closure of unsealed roads. Mid-February to April is the hottest period.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment



Togo lies in a narrow strip, bordered by
Burkina Faso
,
Benin
and
Ghana
. Its coast is small, tranquil and oozes easy living. Further north, seaside charm gives way to a network of lagoons and swampy plains, and eventually savannah, hills and forest.








Top 5 Togo Experiences

Top 5 Togo Experiences



Top 5 Togo Experiences

1. Going Voodoo

Oh Togoville; the voodoo, that you do so well. This is one of voodoo’s cultural centres and a walk through the town’s streets will reveal shrines and fetishes used in everyday life.

2. Butterfly Safari

Hidden away in Togo’s highlands is Mont Klouto - home to dense forest, cascading streams, waterfalls and over five hundred different species of butterflies. Take a safari through the forest with a naturalist guide to see them in all their glory.

3. Paddling a Pirogue

When in Togo, travel like the Togolese. Join the fishermen on the lake and be paddled in a dugout canoe (pirogue) from Agbodrafo to Togoville.

4. Eating Yams

They’re West Africa’s favourite food and nowhere does them quite like the Togolese. Go yam crazy with the beautifully named fufu - yam mashed in a nut sauce.

5. Exploring Lake Togo

This is where the locals come to relax. There are plenty of water sports to try or hitch a ride with a fisherman to explore the lake’s villages.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Togo

Be considerate of Togo’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
