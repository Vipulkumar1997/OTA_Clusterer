Sweden



Sweden possesses a heady combination of chic cities, serene coastal towns, sparse arctic landscapes and vast tracts of deep green wilderness.


From the bars, galleries, boutiques and museums of Stockholm to the remnants of a Viking past scattered throughout the countryside, effortlessly stylish Sweden wears both its modern and ancient faces very well.

If you like adventure and small group travel I recommend Intrepid Travel. It can at times be very full on sometimes long days traveling.

Best time to visit Sweden

Best time to visit Sweden




Generally Sweden has a temperate climate thanks to the Gulf Stream, although above the Arctic Circle winter can get extremely cold. Sweden's northerly position has a definite summer advantage in that temperatures are rarely extreme and humidity levels are not high, with the average temperature during summer being 22 degrees Celcius. In the south, winter is generally mild with an average temperature above 0 degrees Celsius, but temperatures can vary greatly around the country. It tends to rain more in the months of March, April, October and November. July and August are generally the busiest months for tourism in Europe, outside of these times you will experience fewer crowds.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




The fifth largest country in
Europe
is a densely forested, green enclave bordered by
Norway
,
Finland
and the Baltic Sea. Home to pristine rivers, areas of thick woodlands, pure lakes and windswept islands, Sweden boasts an environment rich in incredible natural beauty. Most of the population lives in the south, with cities and towns concentrated away from the cold temperatures, snow and unforgiving terrain of the Arctic north. Sweden's urban centres and suburbs are largely built with respect to the natural world, with dedicated green spaces and waterways common features of many large cities and towns.








After Dark Adventures in Sweden

After Dark Adventures in Sweden




Top 5 After Dark Adventures in Sweden

1. Old Town

Stockholm's quaint Old Town (known as Gamla Stan to locals) gets a little magic sprinkled over it as dusk settles. Wander the charming, cobbled alleys, stop at pubs that date back to medieval times, browse at market stalls full of handmade crafts and slip into cool jazz clubs after the sun sets.

2. Aquatic Ales

Although Stockholm has no shortage of bars, clubs and restaurants, there's nothing quite like being on the water in such a beautiful city. Stockholm's waterfront is home to several floating bars - located on pontoons and even old ships - so after a day of sightseeing, why not wind down on the water.

3. When in Sweden

There is nothing quite like the northern European trend of Schlager music. Catchy and unashamedly commercial, singing along to Eurovision-esque tunes in a Schlager bar may not be the coolest thing to do, but it certainly provides insight into Swedish culture. Come on, you know you want to!

4. Northern Lights

Heading north to the Arctic region of Sweden offers the best chance to catch the mesmerising phenomenon known as the Aurora Borealis. Dancing, glittering, coloured lights skip through the sky creating a nightly visual feast of kaleidoscopic proportions.

5. Chill Out

With the bar, walls, chairs and glasses being carved from ice, Stockholm's Absolut Ice Bar is a bone-chillingly good gimmick. Put on the provided parka and gloves, sit in your ice chair and sip on cool cocktails made with Absolut. While not cheap, it's well worth checking out.

Top responsible travel tips for Sweden

1. Be considerate of Sweden’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

5. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

6. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
