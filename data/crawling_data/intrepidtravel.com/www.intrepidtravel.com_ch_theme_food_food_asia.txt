Asia food tours




Asian food in all its sweet and sour glory continues to influence world cuisine. Ginger, cinnamon, pepper and turmeric were the stuff of legend in the 1600s, and sticky stir-fries, fragrant curries and juicy dumplings have all made their mark on today’s global palate. But nothing beats the real thing, fresh from the wok. Come with us on a food tour through the night markets of
Thailand
, chaotic Vietnamese beer halls and the delicate teahouses of
Japan
. One tip? Pack stretchy pants.

Meet our local leaders














Chinese food is very different to Western food. There is a big variety depending on the province you visit. In the north-west, people eat a lot of kebabs, while in Beijing there’s a lot of savoury and less spicy food. In southern China, there is not much spice either but a lot of dim sums and snacks. Every region is quite different.

Real Food Adventure - Thailand,
October 2017

Linda Taylor

It could not have been easier to research, make decisions and carry out my trip with Intrepid’s assistance from beginning to end.  I can’t wait for my next trip!!

Real Food Adventure - Thailand,
November 2017

John & Angela Slater

The trip was a wonderful eating experience.  At the markets we saw and tasted many different foods and enjoyed cooking authentic Thai food. Also the trips to temples and Hellfire Pass were unforgettable.

Real Food Adventure - China,
October 2017

Kate Colman

Amazing trip - led by a fantastic guide through a fantastic itinerary . The lunches prepared by local families were some of the best food and experiences I had on the whole trip. It packs a lot in in a short space of time but doesn't feel too rushed. Highly recommended!
