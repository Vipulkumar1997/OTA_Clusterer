Brazil



Home to the mighty Amazon River, the irrepressible party city of Rio de Janeiro, the world’s greatest carnival and some of the most beautiful beaches on earth, Brazil could be accused of being greedy.


Luckily, nothing is wasted in brilliant Brazil where the spirited locals are known for embracing life to the fullest. Thankfully, they are happy to share their magnetic homeland with the rest of us!

Buenos Aires to Rio,

Mavis Burridge

Thoroughly enjoyed the holiday, will definitely do Dragoman tours again.

Review submitted 19 Oct 2016











Buenos Aires to Rio,
January 2016

Norma Schafer

Anyone who cannot tolerate cigarette smoke may want to limit the length of their trip.  Also plan on spending more money on meals when camping may be upgraded to hotels, costs for optional activities will probably be higher, and transportation may not be included for activities.

Transport in Brazil

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Brazil, you may find yourself travelling by:







Boat

Cruise Brazil’s famous blue coast and see why this place has enchanted seafarers and explorers for centuries.


Rio to Buenos Aires

Rio to Quito via Ushuaia

Rio to Iguazu










Cable Car

Ride a cable car to the top of one of Brazil’s imposing mountains for out-of-this-world views and impressive photographic opportunities.





Accommodation in Brazil

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Brazil you may find yourself staying in a:







Hammock

Listen to the sounds of the jungle while falling asleep in a hammock. Basic but comfortable, netting is provided to offer protection against hungry mozzies. Accommodation doesn’t get much more authentic than this.











Bush Camp

Get back to nature while camping out in remote Brazilian bushland, far away from the bright lights of the city.

Best time to visit Brazil

Best time to visit Brazil




In most parts of Brazil, temperatures range from 20 to 30 degrees Celsius, regardless of the season. The summer months between December and February can be hot and humid, bringing temperatures to the high 30s – perfect weather to enjoy Brazil’s famous beaches. It’s also festival season, so it’s well worth visiting during this time.

Rainfall varies greatly around Brazil so depending on where you’re travelling, you could experience some rain. Around the Pantanal, Manaus and the Amazon basin, expect patches of rain all year round. Rio and the areas around Foz de Iguacu don’t have distinct rainy seasons and are typically drier than some other areas of Brazil.

The south of Brazil experiences extreme seasonal changes, so pack accordingly.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Brazilians are universally known for their infectious enthusiasm and lust for life. The wild celebratory atmosphere of Carnaval isn’t a one-off —impromptu street parties, heaving nightclubs and busy dance halls all display the same vibrant energy and passion all year round. Travellers will find that music, dance and good times are all passionately pursued by most Brazilians, regardless of income, gender or age. But it doesn’t stop there. Fun is not limited to the dynamic bars and clubs of the big cities - the natural world is also enjoyed by most Brazilians. With so many spectacular beaches, national parks, mountains and forests, there are plenty of places for Brazilians to enjoy their favourite past times – football, surfing, swimming, hiking, volleyball and capoeira (a Brazilian blend of martial arts and dance). Brazilians are also known for being one of the most open, friendly and affectionate nationalities – personal space isn’t regarded as highly in Brazil as in most other countries, so expect to be hugged and kissed by new and old friends when travelling here.

In contrast to the exuberant, modern life that Brazil's city dwellers live, are the humble, traditional ways of the indigenous tribes that live in the Amazon and surrounds. Despite modern advances, many still live off the land – hunting for wild animals and gathering fruit and berries - although sadly this is rapidly changing due to deforestation and urbanisation. In the face of this, many tribes still cling to their ancient culture through traditional clothing, dance and song.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Brazil’s major cities feature a wide range of international cuisine, so it’s possible to eat a western-style breakfast, Mexican for lunch and Italian for dinner, with a few traditional Brazilian snacks in between. For an in-depth look at what you can eat in Brazil, visit our
South American food guide
.

Things to try in Brazil

1. Churrasco

This traditional Brazilian barbecue is a true pleasure for meat eaters. Beef, pork, chicken, duck, lamb and fish are all skewered and cooked to perfection over hot coals, creating a smoky flavour and tender texture.

2. Seafood

Brazil’s coastline is home to a bounty of marine life so when on the coast, be sure to eat seafood while it’s at its freshest. Fried baby octopus, king prawns and fragrant, seafood stew are great options.

3. Feijoada

This stew of beans and beef is Brazil’s national dish, and reflects its rich immigrant history. The flavours and style are a mix of African, Indian and Portuguese food traditions, making it a direct culinary link to Brazil’s past.

4. Caipirinha

This refreshing cocktail made from cachaca (a spirit derived from sugar cane), sugar, crushed ice and lime is the Brazilian national drink, and the perfect accompaniment to a beachside sunset.

5. Fruit

Brazil has plenty of tropical fruits and berries – so for a quick snack, head to the markets and buy fresh bananas, limes, oranges, guava, jackfruit and acai berries.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Being the fifth largest country in the world, Brazil shares land borders with many other countries including
Venezuela
, Guyana,
Colombia
,
Peru
,
Bolivia
, Paraguay,
Argentina
, Uruguay, Suriname and French Guiana. Home to many different landscapes and ecosystems, Brazil’s natural environment is one of the most famous in the world. From the steamy tropical rainforest that surrounds the Amazon River and the swirling torrents of white water at Iguazu Falls, to the stunning beaches, reefs and islands of the coast, Brazil is certainly blessed with the very best of Mother Nature. Home to many of the world's most rare and endangered species, travellers will be able to see the full spectrum of colourful bird life, curious mammals, gigantic snakes and unique marine life.

With such a large population, Brazil’s major cities are busy, crowded and chaotic. It can take some getting used to, but once you’re working with the flow of the Brazilian way of life, you’ll begin to enjoy the pace. With a widening gap between the rich and the poor, housing can vary from large mansions in upscale neighbourhoods and modern apartments right in the heart of the city, to humble tin sheds in the sprawling favelas. In some ways, Brazil’s major cities are full of contrasts but the universal appeal of partying, dancing and drinking seems to cross all cultural and social barriers.








History and government

History and government




Early History

Indigenous tribes inhabited Brazil for centuries before the arrival of the first European settlers from Portugal in the 1500s. Colonisation brought agriculture and crop growing to Brazil, resulting in extensive land clearing which dispossessed much of the indigenous population. The growing of sugar cane resulted in an influx of new residents, mainly slaves who brought rich African traditions with them. Remnants of this can still be seen in much of today’s music, dance and food. By the 19th century, coffee had taken the place of sugar as Brazil’s most valuable crop. The increase in coffee production brought a new wave of migrants to Brazil, mainly from Europe, and Brazil’s economy continued to flourish until the military coup of 1889.

Recent History

Brazil’s more recently history has also been characterised by wide spread immigration – especially during and after World War II - with large numbers of Jewish people choosing to flee persecution to live in Brazil, as well as significant numbers of people from the Middle East and other European countries.

In 1989, Brazil held its first democratic election in almost 30 years after decades of military rule. More recently, a stable government has resulted in increased economic prosperity, although many of Brazil’s residents are still impoverished, living well below the poverty line.








Top 10 Beach Spots of Brazil






×

Top 10 Beach Spots of Brazil




1. Praia do Rosa

The big surf and relaxed vibe of this hip holiday haven in Southern Brazil makes it a firm favourite with visitors and locals alike. Praia do Rosa manages to balance development with tradition - elegant small-scale hotels and eco-lodges provide the perfect place to rest after hiking, whale watching or surfing.

2. Ipanema

The cosmopolitan charms of this world-famous beach make it popular with people from all walks of life. Expect to see enthusiastic travellers, smug millionaires, bohemian artists and indifferent locals all enjoying Ipanema’s magnetic magic.

3. Jericoacoara

Far away from the showy extravagance of Rio lies this secluded spot only accessible by 4x4. Strictly protected from overdevelopment, the slow pace suits the windsurfers and kite surfers who prefer to get their thrills from the ocean's wild tides.

4. Lopes Mendes

This beach, located on the island of Ilha Grande, is considered one of Brazil’s best. The killer combination of fine white sand, great waves and clear, blue water guarantee perfect conditions for swimming, surfing and sun-worshipping.

5. Canoa Quebrada

This mellow hippie haven boasts stunning sand dunes and a deep blue-green sea. Horse riding on the dunes at sunset or cruising the coast on an old fishing boat are great ways to make the most of this picture perfect piece of Brazil.

6. Buzios

Put on the world map by Bridget Bardot back in the 1960s, Buzios is the epitome of Brazilian sophistication. The designer boutiques, glam hotels and cool bars attract the celebrity jet set – but it’s the beautiful bays and beaches that are the true superstars of Buzios.

7. Copacabana

One of the world’s most famous urban beaches, Copacabana, is a top spot to indulge in a bit of people watching. Watch an eclectic mix of people play football, work on their tans and strut their stuff on this busy meeting spot that attracts all walks of life.

8. Praia da Mole

Soft white sand for lazing in the sun and a year-round supply of waves for surfing make this beach in Florianopolis a top pick. Paragliding, wakeboarding and other water sports provide more thrills, while the nearby bars and clubs ensure good times when the sun goes down.

9. Maragogi

Found on the Coral Coast of Brazil, Maragogi’s calm waters offer some respite from the big breaks found on many other Brazilian beaches. Colourful offshore reefs make snorkelling or scuba diving a must for visitors looking for aquatic adventures.

10. Tambaba

One for the free spirits of the world, Brazil’s only official nudist beach is flanked by steep, dramatic cliffs and dotted with swaying coconut palms. Choose to get cheeky and take advantage of lying on Brazil’s only sanctioned nudist beach in all your glory, or keep your kit on and stick to the “non-naturist” side.








Shopping






×

Shopping




While not the cheapest South American country to travel or shop in, there are plenty of markets and weekend fairs full of interesting antiques, artisan wares and jewellery at low prices. You'll also find modern shopping malls and boutique shops in Brazil’s major cities.

It's also a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Brazil

1. Precious Stones

Rio is known as the gemstone capital of the world, so make the most of the wide variety of topaz, tourmaline, emerald and aquamarine on offer in markets and shops.

2. Hammocks

Take a piece of holiday relaxation home with you by buying a brightly-coloured hammock at one of Brazil’s open-air markets. Set it up at home to extend the holiday vibe!








Festivals and Events in Brazil






×

Festivals and Events in Brazil




Rio Carnaval

One of the biggest, boldest and brightest events in the world, Rio Carnaval is a time of dancing, drinking and delirium. While the main event is a flurry of music, make up, glitter and feathers, the month-long street parties and other gatherings may be smaller in scale, but are no less fun.

Boi Bumba

Giant puppets with serpentine heads, floats of women dressed in native-inspired costumes, rousing drum orchestras and troupes of frenzied dancers make Boi Bumba an unforgettable extravaganza. Held on the remote island of Parintins, this festival is less frequented by tourists due the isolated location, but is well worth the journey.

Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Brazil

Be considerate of Brazil’s customs, traditions, religions and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.





The Intrepid Foundation

The Intrepid Foundation provides travellers with an opportunity to give something back to the many wonderful communities we travel to. By donating to The Intrepid Foundation you can make a difference in local communities - in health care, education, human rights, child welfare and the protection of wildlife and the environment.

In Brazil, The Intrepid Foundation proudly supports:







Roupa Suja Project (UMPMRS)

Working to improve the lives of the families living in the favela in the Roupa Suja neighbourhood, through education. Run by local residents, UMPMRS is providing supplementary education for the disadvantaged local children, family support, a women's group and vocational training in a challenged area of Rio.
