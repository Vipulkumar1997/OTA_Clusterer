Djibouti



If you were asked to name all the countries of the world, we’d forgive you if you forgot about little Djibouti.


It’s a tiny speck on the Horn of
Africa
, right on the mouth of the Red Sea (you can almost wave to Yemen across the water). With the possible exception of
Iceland
, Djibouti has one of the weirdest collections of landscapes on the planet: volcanic salt lakes, sunken plains, rocky canyons, limestone pillars bathed in sulfuric steam. Classic Lion King this place is not. In fact, most tourists have never heard of Djibouti, which means you get its world-class hiking, diving and kite surfing all to yourself.

Book a trip before 18 December 2017 (departing between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018), get 20% OFF and we will donate another 20% to The Intrepid Foundation.

Expedition Djibouti - Footsteps of the Afar,
November 2017

Shane Edwards

The Djibouti trip was fantastic. Spectacular sights and friendly people. It's a laid back place and a few words of Afar always elicits a smile.

Djibouti travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Djibouti?









All nationalities require a visa to visit Djibouti.

All nationalities – except for India, Syria and Yemen – can obtain a visa on arrival at the airport. A tourist visa is valid for one month and costs around USD 55. A 3-day transit visa is also available at a cost of around USD 25. Proof of onward travel is also required.

If you arrive by land, visa arrangements should be made in advance from a Djibouti embassy in a neighbouring country. Where there are no Djiboutian consulates, visas can often be acquired from French embassies.







Is tipping customary in Djibouti?









Leaving a small tip in restaurants is welcomed.







What is the Internet access like in Djibouti?









WiFi is increasingly common in hotels and restaurants, and there are internet cafes across Djibouti City. USB internet dongles can be purchased and loaded with data from a local provider.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Djibouti?









Mobile coverage is generally good across the country. Your phone may work on roaming, depending on your home network. You can also purchase a local SIM card for around USD 11.







What are the toilets like in Djibouti?









Very basic squat/pit toilets are the standard in Djibouti, except for western-style flushable toilets that are sometimes available in large hotels and other modern buildings. Carry your own supply of soap and toilet paper, as this is rarely provided.







What will it cost for a...?









Cup of coffee = 750 DJF (approx. USD 4)

Soft drink = 130 DJF (approx. USD 1)

Bottle of beer = 700 DJF (approx. USD 4)

Simple lunch = 1000 DJF (approx. USD 5.5)

Nice dinner in a restaurant = 6000 DJF (approx. USD 33)








Can I drink the water in Djibouti?









Tap water isn't considered safe for travellers to drink. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Ask your leader and accommodation provider for local advice on where drinking water can be accessed. Also, avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Djibouti?









Credit cards are accepted at upmarket shops and hotels, though some will place a surcharge on the payment.







What is ATM access like in Djibouti?









There are ATMs in Djibouti City. They all except Visa. Outside of the capital there are no such facilities. Be sure to have both the local currency (Djibouti franc) and US dollars/euros in cash. The Djiboutian Franc is pegged to the US dollar, but beware of the conversion rate offered in some places.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Djibouti?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

For more information on insurance, please go to:

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Djibouti

1. Be considerate of Djibouti customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Djibouti has a large Muslim population, so dress modestly and conservatively, especially in the cities.

3. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

4. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

5. During Ramadan, make sure to show respect to those who are fasting.

6. Learn some French, Arabic or Somali phrases and don't be afraid to use them – simple greetings will help break the ice.

7. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

8. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

9. Taking photos of public buildings, bridges and military structures is forbidden. Ask your leader what you can and can’t shoot.

10. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
