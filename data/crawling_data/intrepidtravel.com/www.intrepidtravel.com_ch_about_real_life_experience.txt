About

Real life experiences




Real life experiences are those moments you know you’re really alive and experiencing something special. While it could be the instant you see one of the world’s great icons for the first time, it is more likely to be the moment you find yourself in the middle of a village square soccer game, being treated to a home-cooked meal by your new local friends or sharing a laugh with your fellow travellers as you try a new mode of transport … camel anyone? These unexpected moments are what travelling with us is all about, giving you a trip like no other.



What does that mean for you?

It means that our itineraries are specifically crafted to include as much time as possible doing local things with local people. They’re not simply about getting from point A to point B, or ‘seeing the sights’ – anyone with a guidebook can do that. What we offer is the local knowledge and experience to help you get behind the scenes of a culture and understand what makes that destination tick. These are unique and authentic insights into local life that have been facilitated specifically for Intrepid groups.
