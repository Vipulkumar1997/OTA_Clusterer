Festival holidays













Home

Themes

Festivals




For us, festivals are the smell of incense, the fizz of fireworks and the squelch of a fresh tomato. They arrive with the thunder of bespeckled dancers and ride on till the wee hours with plenty of dancing and music. They’re the lantern-lit, confetti-filled, mud-slinging reminder that life is there to be enjoyed to the max, and that there’s no such thing as too much fun in the name of pomp and ceremony.

From the holy waters of the Ganges and the graveyards of
Mexico
to the tulip fields and orange groves of
Europe
, festival season never truly dies – and we’ve got your private pass all ready to go. It’s time to strap on your sandals, pick up some maracas and dive right in.

Mexico City: Day of the Dead,
October 2017

Mardi Janetzki

Our leader on this trip Sofia was fantastic. It was so great to have her local knowledge, and this made my trip an authentic, enjoyable experience, a 'once in a lifetime' chance that was worth every cent.

Halloween in Transylvania,
October 2017

Jennifer Crossan

Romania is a fascinating country and the trip through Transylvania highlighted many aspects of this country and its interesting history. It was certainly one of the more relaxing trips I've done with Intrepid and it was great to have time to wander in the beautiful towns and explore the castles and churches. The homestay was a real highlight - amazing food and a really fun night around the fire! The accommodation was comfortable and very well located and it was great to have breakfast included everyday. Vlad, our leader really made the tour - he was organised, professional, knowledgeable and really friendly. I'd definitely recommend this tour - just make sure you take warm clothes!!

Mexico City: Day of the Dead,
October 2017

Morven McKinnon

It was a very good trip for a beginner who is travelling alone for the first time like I was, and I would definitely recommend going for longer than 5 days.

Mexico City: Day of the Dead,
October 2017

Rachel Breashears

The day of the dead ceremony where we built a group altar took place in a beautiful, remote mountain village.  The ceremony itself was incredibly moving and was led by local spiritual guides.

Mexico City: Day of the Dead,
October 2017

Alastair Russell

An excellent way to spend 4 days for those not sure how best to experience Mexico City and Day of the Dead. Make sure you allow a couple of days to include a few things in Mexico City not on the trip including the Anthropology Museum and Teotihuacán Pyramids.
