Germany tours & travel

Destinations

Europe

Germany



Germany is a fascinating fusion of old and new.


The bohemian streets of Berlin act as a fertile breeding ground for hip art, unique design and innovative ideas, while heritage-filled Munich boasts historic architecture in the form of impressive Baroque and Rococo buildings. In between, travellers will find stretches of idyllic countryside, impossibly gorgeous castles, charming university towns and boisterous Bavarian beer halls. Be introduced to the progressive cities and romantic splendour of Germany and never look back.

Berlin to Rome,
July 2017

John Wiedemann

Be sure to spend a day in Berlin before start and day in Venice at end.

Review submitted 23 Jul 2017











Berlin to Rome,
June 2017

Isabella Graham - Campbell

Amazing trip! Worth paying a bit extra for the chance to not worry about transport and accommodation, meaning you can really enjoy your time away. The tour leaders are lovely, professional and really helpful. The accommodation was generally better than expected and it was never stressful when travelling. The people I've met have become good friends and can't wait to look at some more trips with intrepid!

Best time to visit Germany

Best time to visit Germany




July and August are the busiest months for tourists in
Europe
, so outside of these times you will generally encounter fewer tourists. May, June and September are considered pleasant times to travel as there are less crowds and the climate is comfortable. During these months, beer gardens and cafes bustle at all hours, outdoor events and festivals enliven cities and villages and hiking, cycling and swimming are popular pursuits. Snow usually starts to fall in December, and winter travel to Germany is becoming increasingly popular, especially to the ski areas in the Bavarian Alps. Autumn is the optimal time to enjoy romantic Germany. The foliage is turning golden and the climate is still agreeably mild for getting out and about.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Located in Central Europe, Germany is bordered by
Denmark
,
Poland
,
Belgium
,
France
,
Austria
,
Switzerland
,
Luxembourg
,
Netherlands
and the
Czech Republic
. The terrain found in the north of Germany is relatively flat, with the topography growing increasingly hilly moving south. Southern Germany is characterised by mountain ranges and thick forest, with the Black Forest (on the French border) and the Bavarian Forest (on the Czech border) being the most well known forests in the south. Germany has small pockets of alpine terrain with the Alps being Germany's highest mountains.








Contemporary Art Spots of Berlin

Contemporary Art Spots of Berlin




Top 3 Contemporary Art Spots of Berlin

1. Mitte

Centrally located and well-serviced by several public transport hubs, historic Mitte is one of the easiest places to view Berlin's killer art scene. See run-down buildings that have been transformed into galleries and hotels, wander down gritty laneways full of vibrant graffiti and feel the urban buzz of Berlin.

2. Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg

Berlin's counter-culture is evident in the streets of this East Berlin borough, which is full of an eclectic range of hip galleries, innovative hotels, bohemian bars and vintage flea markets. This is the perfect place to gallery-hop, take snapshots and view the handiwork of some of the world's most iconic street artists.

3. Berlin Wall - East Side Gallery

After the triumphant fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 this section of the wall was adorned with colourful paintings and political murals, many reflecting the tone of this iconic time in Germany's history. A visit here reveals history in a way that no museum or book can.
