Middle East

Iran



Iran is a classic case of books and covers.


It’s hard to reconcile the country you’ve heard about on the news with a place where iPhone-toting locals carve up the Alborz piste, old women invite you in for a hot Chelow kebab and Tinder dominates the dating scene. Conservative and unconventional, deeply religious and deeply surprising, Iran tours don’t fit into any easy pigeonhole. Which is kind of why we love them. Our local guides will show you all the highlights – the Golestan Palace, the Zoroastrian Fire Temple, Esfahan’s bustling bazaars – but they’ll also show you what it means to be a modern-day Iranian. And that’s one thing you won’t get from your average news bulletin

Iran Adventure,
November 2017

Wayne Ryan

The Iran Adventure is a great way to get an overview of Iran, a nation full of positive surprises and friendly people.  If you are lucky you will get a wonderful modern young woman as your guide to provide insights into this fascinating country.

Transport in Iran

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Iran, you may find yourself travelling by:







Caravanserai

Step into the exotic shoes of a Silk Road merchant while staying in a caravanserai in the desert. Over the centuries, little has changed about this experience.











Metro

Carrying more than a million passengers a day, the trains of Tehran are fast, efficient and affordable. Have fun getting around the city like a local.





Accommodation in Iran

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Iran you may find yourself staying in a:







Nomad Tent

Spend an unforgettable night sleeping in a communal tent, just as local nomads have done for centuries.






Travelling to Iran podcast

Best time to visit Iran

Best time to visit Iran




The climate of Iran is mostly arid or semi-arid with a subtropical climate along the Caspian Coast. Generally, the hottest month is July, the coldest months are December and January, and the wettest month is January. Tourists visit Iran during the summer months (June - September) for the sunshine and regional festivals, and during the winter months (November - March) for skiing. So no matter what time you choose to go, Iran is a great place to travel all year round.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Being one of the oldest continuously inhabited civilisations in the world, modern-day Iranian culture is enriched by centuries of tradition. Years of trade, conquest and invasion have created a distinct culture with myriad influences from far and wide, resulting in an overriding national identity and culture rich in symbolism. Religion plays an important part in many aspects of Iranian society - the legal and educational systems, dress, marriage, architecture, the arts and the media are all affected. As Iran is an Islamic nation, visitors can expect to see the hallmarks of Islam throughout Iran; mosques, the call to prayer, strict dress codes and the observance of Ramadan are the most easily noticed, although there is a complex network of rules, customs and traditions at play every day.

Although Iran's population is largely youthful and urban-centric, rich Persian artistic traditions are alive in contemporary Iran, with much of the elaborate architecture, cuisine, handicrafts and popular poetry of Iran having their origins in ancient Persia. Iranian hospitality is world-famous; guests are often touched by the sincerity, politeness and generosity of spirit of their Iranian hosts. Accepting tea and food is considered polite if offered, as is acting graciously and modestly while visiting someone's home.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways of experiencing a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

With access to some of the world's best produce, prepared following age-old ancient culinary traditions, foodies will love travelling through Iran.

Things to try in Iran

1. Dried Fruit & Nuts

Dried apricots, prunes, dates, raisins and figs can be bought from shops, street stalls and bazaars and make wonderful, healthy snacks. Also, you'll be able to find a wide variety of nuts sold by the bag - pistachios, almonds and walnuts are usually the best picks.

2. Persian Ice Cream

Flavoured with orange blossom, rose water, honey, nuts or saffron, Persian ice cream is different to western-style desserts. Often made with chunks of cream and wedged between two waffles, don’t miss the chance to try this type of sweet treat.

3. Khoresht

This hearty Persian stew can be found everywhere in Iran and has many variations. Meat eaters will love the split-pea and lamb combination while the eggplant, mushroom and spinach options will delight vegetarians.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Sharing borders with Afghanistan,
Armenia
,
Azerbaijan
, Iraq, Pakistan,
Turkey
and
Turkmenistan
, Iran is located in the south-west corner of Asia. The Caspian Sea, Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman provide shoreline in the north and south, and while Iran lacks a major river system, there are several small rivers and streams throughout the country. Much of Iran’s terrain is mountainous, with most of the population living in the basins, plateaus and plains. The deserts of Iran are mainly uninhabited with the exception of a few oases, while the major cities are quite modern with well-developed infrastructure and housing.








History and government

History and government




Early History

The country now known as Iran was known as Persia for hundreds of years and has been occupied by people for many centuries. Archaeological evidence suggests that people populated the land here as long as 7,000 years ago, with civilisations and societies developing as the surrounding nations and areas evolved. Persia's fate was very much tied up with the destinies of neighbouring countries, so as empires rose and fell (and leaders came and went), Persia was affected by invasions and confrontations with the Greeks, Mongols, Romans, Arabs, Turks and others.

Under the reign of Darius the Great and Cyrus the Great (during the Achaemenid Empire), the Persian Empire expanded to be the largest empire of the time. During this period, coins were first introduced as a form of currency, building works on Persepolis began and a system of far-reaching highways and canals were built. Islam was brought to Persia around 637 AD; the population slowly adopted the religion and by the 11th century, the majority of the population was practising Islam. Despite adopting the religion of the conquerors, Persian culture, style and art was largely preserved, which led to the 'Islamic Golden Age' - a time where Persian literature, philosophy, science and art blossomed (750-1258).

This time of creativity and prosperity was brought to an end by the Mongols, who invaded in 1219. This invasion proved devastating, with a monumental loss of culture occurring due to the widespread demolition of infrastructure, libraries and mosques. Famine and violence accounted for a steep decline in population, which was worsened by the arrival of the Plague during the 14th century. Persia was in better shape by the 16th century, with the Safavid Dynasty (1502-1736) establishing the modern nation-state of Iran.

Recent History

The Great Persian Famine of 1870 and 1871 accounted for up to 2 million deaths in the region, but Iran's fortunes changed with the discovery of oil in 1908. This discovery also increased interest from other nations wishing to capitalise on this precious commodity. Iran endured many changes in leadership due to invasions and coups during the 1940s, 50s and 60s, leading to the Iranian Revolution. The Iranian Revolution (also known as the Islamic Revolution) took place between 1978 and 1979 and resulted in the birth of the Islamic Republic. Ayatollah Khomeini served as leader until his death in 1989, after enduring the Iran-Iraq war, which was waged between 1980 and 1988. The Iraqi use of chemical warfare during this time caused international fury and lead to the deaths of many of Iran's people. More recently, Iran has been lead by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad since 2005.








Beautiful Buildings of Iran

Beautiful Buildings of Iran




Top 10 Beautiful Buildings of Iran

1. Qavam House

This elegant, traditional house located in Shiraz was built by the Qavam family in the mid 19th century but is now open to the public as a museum. The fine paintings and mirrored porch are the highlights, but the peaceful gardens, pools and courtyards are also worthy of attention.

2. Abbasian House

This large historic house located in Kashan was built in the late 18th century. Featuring several serene courtyards, highly detailed wall carvings, peaceful pools and arched doorways, this fine example of Kashani residential architecture is now preserved as a museum.

3. Tomb of Hafez

While not the largest or most elaborate of places, Shiraz’s Tomb of Hafez possesses a simple, organic beauty. The pavilion, memorial hall and surrounding gardens are well-preserved examples of Iranian architecture - a fitting memorial to one of Persia’s most loved mystical poets.

4. Jameh Mosque of Yazd

This exceptional example of Azari-style Persian architecture has stood in Yazd for centuries. People come to admire the blue-green tiles, deep-blue interior and grand arches, but it's mainly known for its grand minarets, which are among the tallest in Iran.

5. Golestan Palace

Visiting this divine palace complex is a must-do for visitors to Tehran. Colourful mosaics, decorated doors, dazzling mirrors, intricate marble carvings, lattice windows, elaborate chandeliers, bespoke furniture and grand paintings combine in a sea of regal brilliance. Don’t miss it!

6. Khaneh Tabatabaei-ha

Also known as 'The Tabatabaeis’ House', this gorgeous building is another fine example of traditional Persian architecture. Detailed wall murals, ornate stained-glass windows, reflective pools and well-manicured gardens create an atmosphere of opulence and grandeur.

7. The Zoroastrian Complex of Amir Chakmak

This unique three-tiered wonder of Yazd possesses beautiful order and symmetry. When lit up at night, its many arched alcoves provide a stunning spectacle to view and capture on camera.

8. Persepolis

This is the ancient crown jewel of Iran. The buildings of Persepolis may no longer be in as good a condition as they were thousands of years ago, but they are still full of beauty and mystery.

9. Imam Mosque

Previously known as the Shah Mosque, this UNESCO World Heritage site is considered a masterpiece. Featuring a glittering, tiled dome, walls of skilful calligraphy, stunning minarets and spectacular mosaic work throughout, this is one of the world's most beautiful buildings.

10. Maqbaratoshoara

This stunning mausoleum is the final resting place of many of Iran's celebrated poets, scientists and mystics. Built in the 1970s, it's a great example of contemporary architecture that manages to remain true to its cultural roots.








Shopping

Shopping




With ancient bazaars, handicraft centres and modern boutiques, there are a huge variety of ways to shop in Iran - from bargaining with a bazaar vendor to buying fixed-price items from a museum gift shop.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.








Festivals and Events in Iran

Festivals and Events in Iran




Nowruz

Also known as Persian New Year, this is one of the most important traditional holidays on the Iranian calendar. Heralding the advent of spring, this celebration with Zoroastrianism roots is a time of feasting with family, celebrating in nature, springcleaning the home and purchasing flowers and new clothes for the New Year. Many different types of rituals are performed during this time and can vary from family to family, area to area.

Ramadan and Eid

The ninth and holiest of months in the Islamic calendar, Ramadan is observed by most in Iran and is thought to be a time of spiritual rejuvenation. For this month, Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset, refraining from eating and drinking during daylight hours. Eid marks the end of fasting with three days of feasting and celebration.

Iran travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Iran









Most foreign visitors require a visa to enter Iran. Please be aware that this can be a frustrating and stressful process, and can take from 6-8 weeks. You will need to allow sufficient time for this and plan any other travel around your Iran trip accordingly. The cost of a visa also varies dependent on your nationality, and also changes regularly, making it hard for us to advise of the actual cost. But you should plan for it to cost somewhere around 100-180EUR depending if you get a visa before departure or on arrival.

Iranian visas are issued in a two-step process and this will differ according to your nationality.

An authorisation code for your visa must be issued by the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

A visa for your passport must then be obtained at an Iranian Embassy once the authorisation code has been issued, or on arrival (depending on your nationality).

If you are travelling on UK, USA or CANADIAN passport please be aware that your visa process can take longer due to government regulations. Please check that you will have sufficient time to obtain a visa before departure.

Follow the link below and select your nationality in the drop down list to access detailed visa information relevant to you. When your trips has been confirmed you can then proceed to the online visa authorisation code application.

Iran Visa Authorisation Code Application









Is tipping customary in Iran?









It's customary to tip service workers in Iran, so set aside small amounts for porters, local guides, waiters, drivers and cleaners.







What is the internet access like in Iran?









You'll be able to access the internet in Iran's cities, with many major hotels and cafes having internet access. Expect little to no access in rural and remote areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Iran?









Mobile phones from other parts of the world may not work in Iran, although it's possible to buy a low-cost prepaid SIM card in most of Iran's large cities.







What are the toilets like in Iran?









Squat toilets are the most common variety in Iran, although flushable western-style toilets can be found in some tourist areas and hotels. Carry your own supply of toilet paper and soap, as these aren't always provided.







What will it cost for a...?









Squat toilets are the most common variety in Iran, although flushable western-style toilets can be found in some tourist areas and hotels. Carry your own supply of toilet paper and soap, as these aren't always provided.







Can I drink the water in Iran?









Tap water is considered safe to drink but due to the high mineral content, visitors should avoid drinking tap water which can cause stomach upsets. For environmental reasons, try to avoid drinking bottled water - ask your leader or hotel where access to filtered water can be found.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Iran?









Iran is very much a cash economy. This means travellers can rarely use debit or credit cards or travellers cheques while in Iran. A handful of tourist-orientated shops accept credit cards; otherwise, cash is the main method of trade in Iran. US dollars and euros are the only hard currencies accepted at Iranian banks and money-changers. Having those notes changed into Iranian rials is a fairly simple exercise.







What is ATM access like in Iran?









As with the question above, ATMs in Iran rarely accept foreign cards, so cash is the main form of currency. Bring US dollars and euros, which can be exchanged into local currency.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Iran?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.
