Oman



Less affluent than many of its oil-rich and decidedly showy neighbours, Oman’s modern development has been comparatively slow-paced with a laidback affability the country’s pay-off.


Crumbling Portuguese forts and tranquil fishing villages line the coast’s secluded shorelines, magnificent desert dunes and oases mottle the interior and traditionally garbed Bedouins can be spied drifting through the spice-filled souqs. Best of all, with their chunk of the Arabian Gulf having long served as a stopover point to centuries of merchant traders and explorers, the Omanis make for consummate hosts, ever keen to show off their country’s wares.

Discover Oman,
October 2017

Timothy Armstrong

Given my comments I don't think my comments would be appropiate.  Don't get me wrong the trip was good -  we loved Oman, the guides, the people, but I haev been critical of small parts of the overall trip.  I heard tha tthe product manager had recently been in Oman prior to our trip so perhaps many of my comments are being addressed already.

Discover Oman,

Oman is an amazing country and I cannot recommend this trip enough. The pace of the trip is good and the balance between towns and the outdoors is good. An excellent introduction to the country.

Best time to visit Oman

Best time to visit Oman



When it comes to the country’s weather, Oman is often divided into two regions – north and south – to account for two very different climates. Mid October to mid-March, when the weather is pleasantly warm, the mountain scenery clear and the rains light, is the best time to visit the more crowd-drawing north. Throughout the remainder of the year, the heat and humidity can be really quite oppressive – particularly along the coast. This being said, southern Oman receives some respite during the khareef (the monsoon that lasts from mid-May to mid-August) that transforms Dhofar (the local name for the south) into a stunning plot of greenery.








History and government

History and government




Early History

Oman’s colossal history (archaeological evidence suggests that parts of the country have been inhabited since the Stone Age) tracks from eras of remarkable prosperity and regional influence to self-imposed isolation, civil strife, foreign occupation and pretty much everything in between.

From as far back as 5000 BC, the land amassed great wealth due to its trade in frankincense, myrrh and, later on, copper. With this wealth, however, came foreign interest, and between the 6th century BC and the 7th century AD the country fell under the control of three Persian dynasties – the Achaemenids, Parthians and Sassanids – before becoming totally enamoured with Islam. Introduced by Amr ibn al-As, a disciple of the Prophet Mohammed, the faith flourished under the Bani Nabhan dynasty for 500 years.

Recent History

At the beginning of the 16th century, keen to exploit the disunity that had spread through the country and expand their own trade routes, the Portuguese arrived. Largely content with commanding coastal sentry points and building forts (many of which still stand), they made few ventures into the interior and, as a result, were eventually ousted by conspiring inland tribes. Oman then challenged the Portuguese in East Africa and West Asia and gained numerous coastal forts and a foothold in the lucrative slave and spice trades. This allowed Oman to rebuild its wealth to great success. The Al Said dynasty assumed power in 1749 and, despite centuries of interfamilial squabbling, still holds it today.

In July 1970, having ousted his father from power in a bloodless coup, Qaboos bin Said al Said dismissed the conservative isolationist policies that had characterised his father’s rule and set the country on course for modernisation and economic reform. Oman’s society has since found a balance of having a deep respect for tradition, a practical regard for technological progress and enviable health care and education systems.








Top 5 Omani Souvenirs

Top 5 Omani Souvenirs




1. Dallah

Like the rest of the Arabian Gulf, coffee drinking is an integral part of everyday life in Oman. Notably thicker and spicier than the typical western blend, this refreshment is always offered to guests upon arrival and customarily served in graceful, long-bodied pots called dallahs. Traditionally fashioned from silver in Nizwa, bronze models are more standard these days, though no less elegant. Some really old dallahs also contain small pebbles inside the lid, which both announce the boiling of water and alert company to anyone lifting the lid to add poison! Bring back one of these as the perfect kitchen addition for those who regularly suspect their friends of plotting to kill them.

2. Majmar

Ever had dinner guests who have stayed on long after you want to go to bed? If so, you may also like to acquire yourself an Omani incense burner – or majmar. Ornately carved silver orbs used primarily for burning frankincense, a majmar is produced when the final round of coffee has been served and – rather unsubtly – wafted around a guest’s body to signal that their departure is desired. Think of it as the equivalent of yawning loudly and saying: ‘so, should I call you a cab then?’

3. Khanjars

In times past, when it was forbidden for Omani men to wear jewellery, the shrewd among them got around this by taking to having their weaponry decorated. The result is khanjar, the curved silver daggers that now stand as the nation’s most iconic emblem. Featured on both the national flag and the one rial note, khanjars are these days mostly worn at symbolic occasions. Unsheathing it does still signify that you are seeking revenge or would like to assassinate somebody however - so don’t just whip it out to spread the garlic sauce more evenly across your kebab.

4. Henna tattoo

Henna tattooing is common among Omani women and can make for some very beautiful – and temporary – bodily decoration. The designs generally fade after five days or so, though make sure you go to a reputable artist who uses a traditional henna recipe. Some modern hennas have had chemicals and dyes added to hasten the drying process, which can result in stinging, scarring and even health risks. Be particularly wary of black henna.

5. Frankincense

If it was a good enough gift for baby Jesus, it should be good enough for Aunt Mildred.

Oman travel FAQs





Is tipping customary in Oman?









Many restaurants will add a service charge, though tipping beyond that is rarely expected. For exceptional service however, a 5% gratuity will be favourably received.







What is the internet access like in Oman?









Major Omani cities tend to have a handful of internet cafes, and Wi-Fi is becoming available in many cafes and public places.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Oman?









Mobile roaming connections are in place with many international phone companies, though coverage isn’t all that reliable in rural areas.







What are the toilets like in Oman?









Squat toilets are the norm throughout Oman, though Western-style toilets can often also be found in shopping centres, hotels and restaurants. Toilet paper is rarely provided, however, so keep your own supply handy. Hand sanitiser is also a good idea, as soap won’t always be at the sink.







What will it cost for a...?









Can of coke = USD 0.50
Cappuccino = USD 3.50
Meal at an inexpensive restaurant = USD 4
Meal for two at a mid-range restaurant = USD 23







Can I drink the water in Oman?









The tap water in Oman (desalinated) is considered safe to drink, though bottled water is safer. If you don’t like the idea of drinking the tap water, we’d advise bringing water purification tablets or asking your leader where filtered water can be found so as to cut down on unnecessary landfill.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Oman?









The major credit card brands are commonly accepted in substantial hotels and restaurants.







What is ATM access like in Oman?









ATMs are plentiful in Oman and most are connected to the big international brands.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in the Oman?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Oman

1. Be considerate of Omani customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered and shoes removed when entering places of worship.

3. Be conservative in engagements with members of the opposite sex. Even fleeting glances or interactions can be interpreted as bearing flirtatious overtones. Needless to say, public displays of affection are very much frowned upon.

4. Always use the right hand in passing, giving and receiving objects. The left hand is used for bathroom tasks.

5. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

6. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

7. When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

8. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

9. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive and supports the local community.

10. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

11. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

12. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
