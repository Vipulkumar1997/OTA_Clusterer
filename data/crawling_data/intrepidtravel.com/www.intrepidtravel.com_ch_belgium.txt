Best time to visit Belgium

Best time to visit Belgium




As a small country, Belgium's weather doesn't vary much around the country. Warmer weather prevails from May to September, with July and August being the most popular times to visit, so expect to share Belgium with more people when travelling during this period. It can get quite cold during December and January, with snow frequently falling around the country. Rainfall is quite high year-round in Belgium, although the rain is usually in the form of showers rather than torrential downpours.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Sharing borders with
France
,
Germany
, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands
, Belgium is strategically placed near many of Western Europe's capital cities. Featuring relatively flat terrain, Belgium has a mixture of fertile plains and valleys, and rugged forested areas. With a small strip of coastline along the North Sea, international travellers often forget that Belgium has sandy beaches, with the Flanders coast being well-frequented by local and European holidaymakers.








Top 5 Sweet Treats of Belgium

Top 5 Sweet Treats of Belgium




1. Chocolate

Belgian chocolate is arguably the world's best and with thousands of chocolate shops all over the country, visitors won't be able to resist trying a truffle or two! Visit chocolate museums, hand-pick favourites at luxury chocolateries or stock up at chain stores.

2. Waffles

Belgian Waffles (known locally as Gaufres) aren't exactly a diet food. Topped with cream, sugar, chocolate sauce, strawberries or all of the above, they are a delectably decadent treat easily picked up from markets, specialty stores and street carts all over Belgium.

3. Cuberdon

These classic Belgian sweets are a raging favourite with locals. Hard on the outside and syrupy in the middle, cone-shaped cuberdons are made with sugar and gelatine, and are available in flavours like raspberry, blackcurrant and apple.

4. Speculoos

These thin, spicy cookies are usually served at Christmas, but are baked all year round. With a unique flavour, they are very 'moreish' so it's hard to stop at one.

5. Pom Koek

This traditional, Belgian coffee cake made with honey and coffee and spiced with cinnamon and cloves is a delicious afternoon pick-me-up easily found in coffee houses and cafes throughout Belgium.

Top responsible travel tips for Belgium

1. Be considerate of Belgium’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

5. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it – simple greetings will help break the ice.

6. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

7. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

8. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
