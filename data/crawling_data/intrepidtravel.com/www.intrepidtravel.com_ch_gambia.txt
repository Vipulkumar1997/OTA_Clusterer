Gambia



The smallest nation on the African mainland, countries don’t come much more compact - and traversable - than Gambia.


Less than 50 km across at its widest point, this tiny sliver of land streaking Senegal’s midriff is oft bypassed, or swiftly passed through, in favour of exploring its more well-known neighbour. Yet a spell in The Gambia itself will be richly rewarded. Home to magnificent birdlife, pristine beach getaways, and lush tropical woodlands, iddy-biddy Gambia just goes to show that size ain’t everything.

Best time to visit Gambia






×

Best time to visit Gambia




The best time to visit The Gambia is from November to February when temperatures hover around a pleasant 24 degrees Celsius and there’s little humidity. Conveniently, this is also the best time for bird and wildlife spotting. From mid-February to April the average temperature rises to about 26 degrees Celsius, before gradually climbing into the 30s from late June to late September. Humidity during this time can be oppressive, and the rains can wash away some of the roads. The heat and rain slowly subside over October and November, making this another good time to visit as the country is green and lush.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Completely surrounded by
Senegal
save for its 80 km stretch of coastline, The Gambia is an exceptionally flat country with a highest point only 53 metres above sea level. The country’s namesake river, which threads through the country from the east, starts amongst tropical rainforest before gradually giving way to mangrove swamps and coastline. Further from the river, savannahs and plantation woodlands dot the landscape.








Top 5 Gambian Drinks

Top 5 Gambian Drinks




Top 5 Gambian Drinks

1. Bissap

Blood-red and almost impossibly sweet, bissap or manjo is an infused herbal tea made from the flowers of the hibiscus plant, and it’s the nation’s number one drink. Typically flavoured with ginger or mint, it makes for a refreshing midday beverage. And with preliminary studies recently suggesting that it may reduce blood pressure and hypertension, you may well return home in better shape than you left.

2. Ataaya

As much a social rite as a no-holds-barred caffeine injection, try the three-glass Ataaya ceremony when you’re looking to recharge the batteries or make some local friends. One part Chinese green tea leaves to two parts sugar, three parts water and a bunch of mint – think of it as the teetotaller’s mojito. Just don’t drink the foam at the bottom of the glass.

3. Kinkeliba

Brewed from the leaves of the local Kinkeliba plant, this strong and sweet herbal tea is mostly drunk as a breakfast tonic or at dusk during Ramadan when its reputed appetite-stimulant qualities assist gorging on the evening meal. And hunger inducing though it may be, one need not fret about possible weight gain because it also supposedly aids weight loss. Perfect!

4. Bouyi

A thick syrupy juice made from the fruit of the baobab, this ultra-sweet libation imparts an unmatched sugar high and is certainly more appetising than its ungainly tree would have you expecting.

5. Jul Brew

Described by some beer buffs as evoking aromas of hay, boiled vegetables, canned corn and cardboard, Gambia’s national beer is probably unlikely to scoop any international beer awards. But knocked back on a white sandy beach while being buffed by 28-degree sea breezes, you’re hardly likely to care.

Gambia travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Gambia?









THE GAMBIA:
Australia: No - Not required
Belgium: Yes - In advance
Canada: Yes - In advance
Germany: No - Not required
Ireland: No - Not required
Netherlands: Yes - In advance
New Zealand: No - Not required
South Africa: Yes - in advance
Switzerland: Yes - In advance
UK: No - Not required
USA: Yes - In advance

Some nationalities require a visa to visit The Gambia. If you require a visa it must be obtained in advance from an embassy overseas. Citizens of the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and some other countries do not need a visa for a stay of less than 90 days. Citizens of the USA, Canada, South Africa and some other countries do need a visa and should apply to their nearest Gambian embassy and ensure that the visa is obtained before arrival.







Is tipping customary in The Gambia?









In established restaurants, bars, hotels and taxis a 10% service charge is usually added to the bill - though feel free to tip more than this for exceptional service. At restaurants where a service charge isn’t included, 10% is the acceptable gratuity. Although tipping at other places isn't mandatory it will be much appreciated given the low wages that Gambian service workers are typically paid. Setting aside a small amount for porters, guides and drivers is also a good idea.







What is the internet access like in The Gambia?









Internet cafes with fairly slow connections can be easily found in Banjul and the resort towns on the Atlantic Coast. Towns further inland will usually have at least one internet cafe with unreliable connectivity.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in The Gambia?









Mobile phone coverage is good in The Gambia’s large cities and towns, but less so in rural areas. The major local telephone companies are Gamcell and Africell. Ensure you have global roaming activated before leaving home if you plan to use your mobile phone.







What are the toilets like in The Gambia?









Fairly clean western-style toilets can generally be found in Banjul and the towns on the Atlantic Coast. In towns and villages further inland, squat/pit toilets are the norm. Carry your own supply of soap and toilet paper as this is rarely provided.







What will it cost for a...?









Sandwich = 50 GMD
Litre of bottled water = 30 GMD
Bottle of Jul Brew = 20 GMD
Shwarma = 50 GMD







Can I drink the water in The Gambia?









Tap water isn't safe to drink in The Gambia. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, bring water purification tablets or ask your leader where filtered water can be found.







Are credit cards accepted widely in The Gambia?









Credit cards are generally only accepted at top-end hotels, if arranged at the beginning of your stay, and at some high-end restaurants. American Express and Visa are the most likely to be accepted, though use sparingly as there is a genuine risk of fraud.







What is ATM access like in The Gambia?









ATMs can be found at banks and urban centres in Banjul and around the Atlantic Coast, though they aren’t always reliable. Due to credit card and bank fraud, caution is advised when using these and some ATMs may only allow withdrawals of fairly small amounts. Be sure to have other payment methods on hand when venturing out of the big cities. Visa is the most accepted card.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Ghana?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Gambia

Be considerate of The Gambia’s customs, traditions, religions and culture.

Only use your right hand when dealing with locals. The left is used for ‘unhygienic tasks’.

It's considered very rude in Gambian culture to smell food in front of others before eating it.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered and shoes removed when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water or use water purification tablets.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive and supports the local community.

When bargaining, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
