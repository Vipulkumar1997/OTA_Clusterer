Vietnam



Move over, Thailand: Vietnam food is where it’s at.


When we think of moped shoals in Ho Chi Minh City or cloth merchants in Hoi An, it’s the flavours we remember best. A crusty Bánh mì or streetside pho, seafood cù lao hotpots and (scarily addictive) condensed milk coffee. Vietnam tours are fun, plain and simple. But unlike other operators, we won’t just drop you in Ha Long Bay and call it a day. Our local leaders will introduce you to rice farmers in Sapa and fishermen on the Mekong Delta. They’ll guide you through the Cu Chi Tunnels, point out Nha Trang’s best beaches and take you on a rooftop bar crawl through Ho Chi Minh City. Our stomach’s rumbling already...

Great tour..nice being limited to number of people. We had 9 of us plus tour leader. All very well organised.. even when we had to change plans at last minute due to weather. Had opportunity to do' own thing' if fancied time away from rest of group. Thank you Intrepid, and our brilliant tour leader ..Thanh.

Transport in Vietnam

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Vietnam, you may find yourself travelling by:







Overnight sleeper train

Travelling aboard the Reunification Express is a fun way to journey through Vietnam. Interact with other passengers or sit by a window and watch the world go by.


Explore Vietnam

Vietnam Express Northbound

Vietnam Express Southbound










Bicycle

Take time to wave to locals as you cycle at a leisurely pace past rice paddies and through simple villages in rural Vietnam


Cycle Vietnam

Cycle South East Asia




Accommodation in Vietnam

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Vietnam you may find yourself staying in a:







Overnight boat

History and government




Early History

The land now known as Vietnam has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Archaeological finds suggest that structured societies were in existence from as early as the 1st millennium BC. Early society was mostly feudal and agriculture-based, with various dynasties overseeing different parts of Vietnam until the Chinese invasion of 111 BC, which saw the societies of Vietnam and China become intertwined. Various Chinese dynasties dominated the area for hundreds of years, although revolts finally led to Vietnam gaining self-autonomy in 905. By 938, this period of Chinese imperial domination came to a close and Vietnam entered into an age of independence.

Recent History

During the 19th century, Vietnam came under the influence of French colonisers, who assumed control of Vietnam after the Sino-French War of 1884 and 1885. French Indochina was formed in 1887, and included parts of Vietnam, Cambodia and, later on, Laos. Although the French managed to suppress internal movements towards independence for many years, their control was finally relinquished in 1954 when Vietnamese forces overcame the French during the first Indochina War. Following this war, Vietnam was divided, with separate forces ruling the north (led by Ho Chi Minh) and the south (led by Ngo Dinh Diem, with support from the United States).

The second Indochina War created wide-scale devastation and turmoil for the people of Vietnam, leading to mass migration to other parts of the world as asylum seekers tried to escape the conflict that ravaged their homeland. By the 1980s Vietnam's economy had all but collapsed, leading to further waves of migration out of Vietnam. More recently, Vietnam has benefited from the free market economy that was set up in 1986. Vietnam's economy continues to expand, with agriculture and industry providing the backbone, and the tourism sector also contributing. Although many Vietnamese people live below the poverty line, there have been widespread improvements in literacy and health which hopefully will continue to improve in the years to come.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Occupying a long, thin part of the Indochinese peninsula, Vietnam shares borders with
China
,
Laos
and
Cambodia
. Much of Vietnam's terrain is mountainous, particularly the north and central highland regions. Although people still choose to live in the densely forested highland regions, most of Vietnam's population is concentrated in the cities of the low lying areas, where infrastructure is more easily built and the land is fertile. One of the 12 great rivers of the world, the Mekong, runs through Vietnam and has been responsible for wide-scale flooding. A system of canals and levees has been quite successful in redistributing the water during monsoons, and has helped to alleviate flooding in the Mekong Delta and surrounding areas.








Shopping

Shopping




Vietnam has a nice mix of interesting markets and small shops, with handicrafts, art and clothing among the best picks.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Vietnam

1. Tailored Clothing

Hoi An is one of the best places in the world to get tailor-made clothing at a great price. Find a tailor, choose your fabric, get measured and return later to collect your custom-made fashion.

2. Hilltribe Handicrafts

Some of Vietnam's hilltribe people make excellent woven bags, clothing and jewellery which make meaningful souvenirs for friends back home.

3. Coffee

As one of the world's largest coffee exporters, Vietnamese coffee is among the world's best. If you’re a coffee fan, why not take a little taste of Vietnam home with you.

4. Lacquerware

The time consuming, intensive process of creating Vietnamese lacquer art results in a beautiful, smooth and polished finish that adorns everything from bowls to paintings and jewellery boxes. While not the cheapest of souvenirs, authentic lacquer art is worth spending a bit more on.

Vietnam Top 10 Landscapes




Top 10 Iconic Landscapes of Vietnam


Halong Bay
- There's nothing quite like Halong Bay first thing in the morning. As the mists clear, hundreds of huge karst towers appear, looming high above the boat. In the soft morning light it's like waking up in a watercolour painting of a mythical land.



Hanoi
- Motorbikes piled high with people, produce and even animals zip through the streets. It's crazy, haphazard and somehow it works. The best way to take it all in is from a rooftop cafe. Order an extra strong coffee and watch the chaos unfold below.



Mekong Delta
- This massive area of floating markets, emerald rice paddies and lush islands is home to some of the friendliest people on earth. Take a boat trip to one of the sleepy islands to get a front row view of life on the Delta, and meet the people who call it home.



Sapa
- Head to the hills and see the colourful villages of Vietnam's minority groups - the Zay, and the Blue and Black H'mong. The area is remote so the best way to experience it is on an overnight trek, spending the night as a guest of a local family.



Qui Nho
- Quaint Qui Nhon is a sleepy beach town off the main tourist trail. It's worth coming here just for the drive. The road hugs granite cliffs that plunge into the South China Sea, and islands, lagoons and sand dunes slowly give way to sugar plantations and rice fields.



Hue
- Jam-packed with imperial sites, Hue is one for the history buffs. Explore the Citadel with its ruined Forbidden Purple City before embracing your inner emperor and taking a dragonboat cruise down the Perfume River.



Hoi An
- This shoppers' paradise is home to more boot makers, tailors and handicraft than you could visit in a lifetime. While you wait for your suit to be made, hire a bicycle and explore the Old Town - the streets are blissfully car free.



Ho Chi Minh City
- Still known as Saigon to most, HCMC is a city on the go. It's fast-paced, exciting and full of amazing sites. Temples and markets collide with churches and skyscrapers for a heady mix of traditional, colonial and modern.



Mai Chau
- Mai Chau feels a million miles away from the bustle of Hanoi. Misty mountains and emerald rice paddies contribute to the air of peacefulness. Be sure to look out for the traditional fabrics woven by the White Thais that call this area home.



Dalat
- It's spring all year round in Vietnam's 'honeymoon capital'. Soak up the French-inspired atmosphere, spot the quirky local artists and explore the surrounding lakes, waterfalls and forests. C'est fantastique!










Culture and customs

Culture and customs




Vietnam's ancient culture can be traced back centuries and over the years has been influenced in different ways by the Chinese, Khmer, French and American cultures. For most Vietnamese people, connection to family and community is paramount - whether they are from rural villages or living in the fast-paced cities. Most festivals and holidays are spent with the extended family - participating in rituals, feasting on special foods, giving symbolic gifts and paying respects to ancestors. Most Vietnamese people practice a form of religion that is an interesting mix of Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, although there are also a large number of practicing Catholics living in Vietnam. Having endured the hardship that the Vietnam War brought in the 1960s and 1970s, most Vietnamese people are keen to get on with life, living with a sense of optimism and humility.

Are credit cards accepted widely in Vietnam?









Major credit cards are widely accepted by large shops, hotels and restaurants in Vietnam. However, they may not be accepted by smaller vendors such as small family restaurants, market stalls or in remote towns and rural areas. Make sure you carry enough cash for purchases, since credit cards aren't always an option everywhere in Vietnam.







What is ATM access like in Vietnam?









ATMs are found widely throughout Vietnam, so withdrawing cash shouldn't be problematic in most areas. Some smaller villages and rural areas may not have ATM access, so prepare for this before venturing too far from a city or major town.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Vietnam?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Is Vietnam a gay-friendly destination?









The LGBQTI community is gradually gaining recognition in Vietnam, with gay pride parades becoming a regular occurrence and a lift on same-sex marriage bans in 2015.

Travellers will find Vietnam to be a gay-friendly country, with lively gay-friendly bars, restaurants, sauncas and hotels found in major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. It is generally recommended that both gay and straight couples resist showing public displays of affection.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Vietnam

Be considerate of Vietnam’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
