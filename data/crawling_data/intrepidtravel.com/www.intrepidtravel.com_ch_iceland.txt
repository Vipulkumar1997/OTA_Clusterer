Iceland tours & travel

Destinations

Europe

Iceland



Take one small island and maroon it miles from anywhere, cut off by freezing seas and Atlantic currents.


Populate it with Viking descendants, power it with volcanoes and add in more Nobel Prize-winners per capita than anywhere on the planet. That’s pretty much Iceland, a kooky outlier that’s rocked the global travel scene. Partly this is down to geography. Iceland bubbles like a volcanic laboratory, with geysers, mud pools, badlands, glaciers and black sand beaches turning the landscape into some Dr Seuss fantasy world. And partly it’s down to people: a friendly, eccentric bunch who love live music, green thinking and hotdogs with remoulade and raw onions (yep, really). Once seen, never forgotten – that’s an Iceland tour.

Northern Lights Escape,
November 2017

Amie Lin

Intrepid has always been my go-to travel group whenever I prefer not to travel solo. Being someone who has always lived in metropolitan areas and cannot drive a car, there are many places that are simply not accessible to me. The reason I prefer intrepid over other travel groups due to the fact that it is not a "tour" per se. The groups are always small, typically lead with local guides and often explore experiences off the beaten path. I never felt like I need to be herd around or force to go shopping. I see these trips more as convenient method of transportation and accomodation with opportunity to meet other interesting people. So far I have done around 6 trips with Intrepid and I am looking forward to many future trips.

Best time to visit Iceland

Best time to visit Iceland




Spring and summer are considered optimal times to visit Iceland. The early spring months bring warmer days, while summer offers long daylight hours with only brief nights. In the summer season, July and August are the warmest months and are the busiest tourist seasons. In September, tourism tends to slow down as the weather becomes unpredictable and the countryside is usually less accessible. However, there are plenty of attractions for the off-peak traveller, including the beauty of autumn colours and the awe-inspiring Northern Lights - a feature of our Iceland tours here at Intrepid. As to be expected, winters in Iceland can be challenging. During late December there's about four and a half hours of daylight and it's usually cloudy. In January, there are on average three sunny days in Reykjavík, with temperatures hovering around freezing point, often accompanied by chilling winds.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, Iceland possesses some of the world's most unique and incredible landscapes. Home to a huge amount of volcanic activity, Iceland is full of bubbling geysers, enormous glaciers, vast icefields, rugged mountains, dramatic waterfalls, glacial lakes and fjords - there is no other place quite like it. Being located so close the Arctic Circle, much of Iceland is uninhabitable, particularly the barren central regions. Most of the population live in coastal villages or cities and in the southern (more habitable) part of the country.








Natural Phenomena of Iceland

Natural Phenomena of Iceland




Top 5 Natural Phenomena of Iceland

1. Northern Lights

The Northern Hemisphere's Aurora Borealis has captivated and intrigued people for eons. Any winter tour of Iceland absolutely must include the Northern Lights. This stunning, natural light display that runs along magnetic fields brings hypnotic green, yellow and red shades to the night sky in Iceland from September to March. As one of nature's most magnificent triumphs, this is one unforgettable spectacle.

2. Golden Falls

Known locally as Gullfoss, this spectacular, three-tiered waterfall drops suddenly into a deep cavern, creating a dramatic landscape like no other. Surrounded by lush, green countryside, the mist and spray create rainbows in the air providing brilliant photo opportunities.

3. Blue Lagoon

The mineral-rich, azure waters of the Blue Lagoon are a magnificent sight to behold and are even better to soak in. Relaxing in the warm waters while admiring the sublime moonscape is a quintessential Iceland experience that just must be done.

4. Lake Myvatn

This awesome area in northern Iceland was birthed from volcanic eruptions millions of years ago and continues to be shaped by volcanic activity to this day. The combination of strange lava formations, thermal caves and a sprawling lake dotted with craters and rising rocks makes for an eerie yet beautiful landscape.

5. Glacier Lagoon

Also known as Jokulsarlon, this monumental glacier lake is the largest in Iceland. Featuring a parade of large and small blue icebergs floating on and under the pure, icy water, this lagoon is so exceptionally beautiful that it has been used as a backdrop for Hollywood films, a set for reality television shows and has even featured on a postage stamp. Make no mistake, by booking one of our Iceland tours, you'll ensure you don't miss this natural beauty.

Responsible Travel

Top responsible travel tips for Iceland

1. Be considerate of Iceland’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

5. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

6. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
