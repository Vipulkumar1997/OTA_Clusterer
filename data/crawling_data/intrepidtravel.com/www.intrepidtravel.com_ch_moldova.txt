Moldova tours & travel

Moldova



Many European countries advertise themselves as ‘off the beaten track’, but miniature Moldova, sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, doesn’t even know the track exists.


Only about 12,000 travellers a year visit Moldova, partly for its unspoiled natural good looks, but also for its wine. The country has some of the best up-and-coming vineyards on the continent, and they’re fuelling a bit of a cultural resurgence: you’ll find plenty of trendy bars, cafes and restaurants in the capital Chişinău. The only signs you’ve stepped into a Soviet time warp are the marble busts of Lenin lining the main boulevards, frowning over his goatee at a region outgrowing its communist roots.

Expedition - Moldova, Ukraine & Romania,
September 2017

Anne Robinson

Smaller group means more time in places and more tailored to you and your travel needs/wants. Expert trip leaders who assist in getting you to your destinations and activities and being so knowledgeable can help take the stress out of your trip. The local interactions are unlike any other company I have ever used and the care to give back to the local communities is something I feel is very important

Expedition - Moldova, Ukraine & Romania,
September 2017

Steven McLachlan

This trip went to parts of Europe that are not popular destinations but they were well worth visiting. I would't want to miss visiting any of the places we went to but for me the highlights were Odessa, Kiev and Chernobyl. I loved the architecture and the food was delicious and good value.

Best time to visit Moldova






×

Best time to visit Moldova



Moldova enjoys a typical continental climate with warm summers and cold winters, with temperature ranging from -5°C to 40°C. Spring and autumn are mild, and summers pleasant. The best time to visit areas like Chişinău, Tiraspol and Transnistria is from May to August. July and August are the high season. The first week of October is also a very good time, due to the annual Wine Festival in Chişinău.








Geography and Environment






×

Geography and Environment



Moldova is a small landlocked, mostly rural country of rolling steppes in the Balkans, surrounded by Ukraine to the north, east and south, and Romania to the west. This is one of Europe’s least known destinations, unspoilt even, where traditional village life can still be experienced, ancient ruins explored, forested hills hiked and growing city life uncovered.

Transnistria






×

Transnistria



Transnistria is a thin strip of land between the Dniester River and the border of Ukraine, officially known as the Prednistrovie Moldovan Republic (PMR). It declared independence after the Soviet Union broke up into pieces, but is only recognised as an independent entity by other unrecognised former Soviet breakaway republics. It is, however, 'de-facto independent' from Moldova – with its own parliament, police force, currency and coat of arms among other things – and still upholds Soviet values.

The security situation in Transnistria is unpredictable as the region is not under Moldovan control, and tensions may be heightened reflecting developments in eastern Ukraine. Many Western countries do not have an embassy or consulate in Moldova. Usually embassies in Russia or Romania provide consular assistance to travellers in Moldova, however they do not have any recourse inside the territory of Transnistria, and will only be of very limited or no assistance in the case of an emergency. Medical care is almost non-existent in Transnistria, especially for non-citizens. Even if you have travel health insurance, it will often not be valid in Transnistria (even though it may be valid in Moldova), and your insurance might not cover you for any expenses incurred for lost or stolen items. Please choose carefully when shopping for your travel insurance. Please also be aware that international credit/debit cards and traveller's cheques are not accepted anywhere in Transnistria.







Moldova travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Moldova?









Travellers from Europe, North America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand do not need a visa to visit Moldova. A 90-day stay within a 6-month period is permitted. Citizens of other countries must either obtain a visa in the nearest Moldovan embassy, at the airport, or at some land border crossings with Romania.

WiFi is fast and widespread in hotels and restaurants in the capital Chişinău and other big cities. 4G mobile internet is also available in most urban centres.

Museum entry = 20 MDL (approx. USD 1)

Stuffed pastries = 53 MDL (approx. USD 2.5)








Can I drink the water in Moldova?









Water is safe to drink in Chişinău, but in more rural areas consider sticking with filtered water. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water.

Credit cards are widely accepted in urban centres, less so in more rural parts. It is best to have a reserve of cash.







What is ATM access like in Moldova?









There are ATMs in Chişinău, but they are not always reliable.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Moldova?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Moldova

1. Be considerate of Moldova’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

3. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

4. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

5. Be ready to remove your shoes when you enter a local’s house. It’s the common custom.

6. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it – simple greetings will help break the ice.

7. In Moldova’s Orthodox Churches, women can keep their hats on, but men should take theirs off.

8. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

9. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

10. Don’t put your thumb between your first two fingers – this is considered a very rude gesture in Moldova.
