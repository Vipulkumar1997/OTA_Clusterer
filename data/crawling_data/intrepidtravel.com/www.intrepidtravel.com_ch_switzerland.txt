Switzerland



No other country does the great outdoors quite like Switzerland.


Whether you're walking through scenic alpine meadows, scaling tough mountain passes, taking on the ski slopes or kayaking on crystalline lakes, Switzerland offers stunning scenery, panoramic views and the chance to commune with nature in one of its purest forms. With rich chocolate and fine cheese waiting as reward, Switzerland is the place for the active and the indulgent.

Best time to visit Switzerland




May, June, September and October are wonderful months for seeing Switzerland, as the weather is typically mild, the mountain passes are still open and the country is less crowded than in the peak holiday months of July and August. It tends to rain more in the months of March, April, October and November, and with snow fall usually present from December, this is the perfect time for skiers and snowboarders.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Landlocked Switzerland shares borders with
Austria
, Lichtenstein,
Italy
,
France
, and
Germany
. A highly mountainous country, Switzerland's best known ranges are the Alps in the south, with the mighty Matterhorn and iconic Eiger being the most well-known peaks. Home to an abundance of rolling hills, lakes, glaciers, rivers, meadows and fields, Switzerland's landscapes are incredibly picturesque, particularly in spring and summer when the wildflowers are in bloom.

Top 5 Culinary Classics of Switzerland




Top 5 Culinary Classics of Switzerland

1. Fondue

While not enjoying the same worldwide popularity that it did in the 1960s and 70s, this Swiss classic is still alive and well in Switzerland. Although not to everyone's taste, travellers should experience sitting around a communal pot of rich, melted cheese at least once.

2. Rosti

Who knew that a plate of grated, fried potato could taste so good? Considered to be Switzerland's national dish, Rosti was once relegated to the breakfast plate but is now served as an accompaniment to dinners too.

3. Bircher Muesli

This Swiss-German classic has taken off worldwide as a breakfast food, although it was originally created for hospital patients by a Swiss physician. Commonly eaten in the evening in southern Switzerland, it's a nutritious mix of oats, fruits and seeds.

4. Zopf

This brioche-like, plaited bread is a traditional Sunday morning treat in Switzerland. Dating back to the 15th century, this delicious bread can be found in bakeries all over Switzerland, especially on Sundays.

5. Cheese

Making hundreds of varieties of cheese, Switzerland is one of the best places in the world to indulge in a dose of calcium. Whether it's a chunk of hard Gruyere, a slice of Emmental or a bit of fruity Appenzeller, Switzerland has enough cheese shops to satisfy everyone.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Switzerland

Be considerate of Switzerland’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
