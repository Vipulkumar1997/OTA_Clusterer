In order for us to be able to do this you must provide us with your passport details in advance.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.






Top responsible travel tips for Ivory Coast

Be considerate of Ivory Coast’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
