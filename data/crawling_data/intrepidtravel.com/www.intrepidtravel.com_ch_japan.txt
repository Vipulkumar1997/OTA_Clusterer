Asia

Japan



It’s hard to sum up Japan in a single sentence, but we’ll give it a try:


A lazer-guided, umami-flavoured, Hello Kitty fun machine where samurais battle Shiba dogs in naked thermal hot springs. If you’ve taken a holiday in Japan, you’ll know that that sentence makes a surprising amount of sense. This is a country that’s famously hard to read, so a local-led group tour is a pretty good idea. We’ll introduce you to Soba masters in Tokyo, lead you through tuna auctions and sumo stables, stay with Buddhist monks in Koya San and sing bad karaoke ‘til the wee hours in Osaka (all while sipping sake and gorging on market fresh sashimi). You ready? Kanpai!

Japan Express,
November 2017

Ewelina Dziedzic

Please clarify with the company, what's included in the trip price, and what is not. There always seems to be confusion and misunderstanding. Pack light.  You will be hauling your bags. Be open, and take part in group activities. You can make wonderful friendships. Don't be shy, afraid to ask questions.

Classic Japan,
November 2017

melissa szkil

This was our first time traveling with Intrepid, or any other tour group.  We loved the pace of the trip, which let us see so much more than we could have otherwise.  Our guide was very organised and looked after us. We loved the food! Transport was amazing, with precision timing! Travel light and expect a lot of walking - at least 5 miles/day, usually more.  Hiroshima, Koyasan, Kyoto, and Tokyo are must-see.  Tsumago and Matsumoto might be better in the spring.  Visiting Japan in the fall was fantastic though - highly recommended!

Transport in Japan

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Japan, you may find yourself travelling by:







Bullet train

Travelling at speeds of up to 300 km/ph, Japan's Shinkansen (bullet trains) are known for their punctuality, safety and comfort - an awesomely efficient way to get around Japan.


Japan: Land of the Rising Sun

Best time to visit Japan

Best time to visit Japan




March, April and May are excellent months to holiday in Japan and, consequently, are also the busiest. Since it's springtime, the weather is usually fine and beautiful cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

September, October and November are also great months to visit Japan on holidays, as the days are warm, but not too humid, and the autumn colours make the gardens and countryside look amazing.

Winter, while cold, offers great conditions for skiing, snowboarding, going to snow festivals and admiring the stunning mountain scenery. The summer months can be quite humid but tourist areas are generally quieter and there are many fun festivals and fireworks displays to enjoy.








History and government






×

History and government




Early history

Japanese civilisation can be traced back thousands of years to prehistoric times. Over the centuries, Japan alternated between feudal, empirical and government rule, with each period birthing different styles of art, architecture and ways of living. Agriculture, particularly rice-growing, was a very important part of life in early Japan, and craftsmanship like metal working was also highly developed and respected in Japan's early days.

Recent history

Over the decades, Tokyo has grown to become an economic powerhouse and one of the most cosmopolitan, modern cities in the world. Enduring an earthquake in 1923 that caused widespread damage and civilian fatalities, as well as several bombings during World War II, Tokyo remains a global city focused on trade, tourism and technological advances.

The Japanese Army were very aggressive during World War II, playing an important part in the war and therefore suffered many losses. Many troops were lost but the most notable losses were the civilians of Hiroshima and Nagasaki - two cities which were destroyed by atomic bombs dropped by the United States towards the end of the war. After World War II Japan slowly found its feet, creating a strong economy based on manufacturing and telecommunications. Enjoying decades of prosperity and abundance, Japanese arts, culture and cuisine flourished, allowing the rest of the world to see and enjoy Japan's unique heritage.

Emperor Hirohito passed away in 1989 after reigning for many decades. This signified the end of the Showa era and the beginning of the Heisei era. In 1998, Japan hosted the Winter Olympics and fast became known as one of the hottest new places to enjoy snow sports.

Currently, Japan is still in recovery from the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2011. But with large parts of the country unaffected, Japan is still a very special place to visit.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Located in the Pacific Ocean and a part of
Asia
, the island nation of Japan is an archipelago of more than 6,000 islands, with the main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku. Lying on the Pacific Ring of Fire, Japan is prone to destructive earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic activity.

Japan has much forested, mountainous terrain, unsuitable for agriculture and development, so much of the population live in the coastal cities, which creates overpopulation. Japan is one of the most densely populated countries in the world and as a result, most people are used to living in very small spaces and with a heavy reliance on public transport. Although life is fast-paced and crowded in cities like Tokyo and Osaka, rural areas typically feature low-density, traditional housing and a slower pace of life.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Shopping in Japan is fun, but expensive! In cities like Tokyo there are loads of quirky stores and funky galleries showcasing the works of independent fashion designers and gadget-creators. From the outlandish to the kitsch, you're guaranteed to find loads of colourful clothing and edgy art that you won't be able to find elsewhere.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Japan

1. Kimonos

This quintessential Japanese souvenir can be worn on special occasions back at home or hung on the wall as an interesting decorative piece

2. Paper Lanterns, Kites and Fans

Japanese paper goods make great, relatively inexpensive souvenirs. Choose from high quality, traditionally-made, colourful kites or delicate rice paper lanterns.

3. Electronics

Shops in Japan are bursting with the latest tech gadgets. Before buying, be sure to check that they are compatible for use at home.

4. Fashion

Have fun with the amazing diversity of popular street culture fashion available in Japan. Vibrant, brash and sometimes bizarre - find something that no one back at home will be wearing.

5. Anime Paraphernalia

Japanese anime is riding a wave of popularity in the West, so why not pick up a book, magazine, t-shirt or print for yourself?








Top 10 culinary experiences of Japan






×

Top 10 culinary experiences of Japan




1. Get in the spirit

Learn about Japan's favourite fermented spirit on a visit to a sake brewery in Takayama. See the production process then sip on the end results. Kanpai!

2. Tasty treasures of the sea

Be amazed by the variety of seafood on offer at Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market. This is the world's largest fish market - it would be hard to find fresher sushi and sashimi anywhere else.

3. Ceremonial tea

Be exposed to the careful ritual of a traditional tea ceremony in Kyoto. Green tea is delicately prepared by a kimono-clad host and served amid flower arrangements, tatami mats and calligraphy scrolls.

4. Snack attack

Japan has more vending machines per capita than anywhere else in the world. With ice cream, instant ramen, cold beer, sake and hot meals all available, just try leaving Tokyo without buying something from one.

5. Liquid gold

Pay a visit to the Sapporo Brewery for a tour of the brewery and museum exhibitions. That's enough to make anyone thirsty, so be sure to sip on a cool beer at the gigantic Beer Hall afterwards.

6. Osaka overindulgence

Head to Osaka's premier 'eat street', the famously flamboyant Dotonbori district. Restaurants specialising in crab, ramen, beef and takoyaki (fried octopus balls) line the streets - this is the perfect place to feast on food, and landmarks.

7. Meat-free morsels

Enjoy simple vegetarian fare prepared by young monks while staying at a monastery in Koya-san. This is a truly unique dining experience you won't forget anytime soon.

8. Pancake pig out

Don't leave Hiroshima without trying the local speciality of Okonomiyaki. This savoury pancake is layered with cabbage, meat, noodles, egg and sauce, and depending what restaurant you visit - sometimes you can cook it yourself.

9. Use your noodle

Head to a local restaurant and slurp a delicious bowl of steaming ramen. Choose from crab, pork, chicken or miso and top with ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, seaweed or corn.

10. Soba... so good

Find out how a staple of Japanese cuisine is created by learning to make soba noodles from scratch in Tokyo. A rewarding experience for your mind, and your stomach.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Japan is a country that lives life between two worlds. Older rituals and traditions like kendo, bonsai, geisha, tea ceremonies and sumo coexist with contemporary attitudes and technological advances. The modern generation - who are a decidedly online, high-tech, fashion-forward crew - have adapted to a fast-paced world and generally work long hours, keep up with fashion trends and display a more ostentatious image in public. With a culture based on modesty, respect and discipline, it's no wonder that older, more traditional Japanese people are often at odds with this more flamboyant, modern generation.

Despite the difference in attitude and appearance, many traditions and ways of living endure in modern Japan. No matter what age, etiquette is important to the Japanese and guides people when eating, travelling, working and interacting with others. Traditions and rituals like tea ceremonies, bowing, kendo, geisha and sumo endure, as do festivals that have been in existence for centuries. Japan holds many festivals all over the country, ranging from large national celebrations to small regional fairs. Cherry blossom festivals - Hanami - are celebrated all over Japan in spring and other traditional festivals and celebrations can be stumbled upon in small towns and cities alike.

Although modern cuisine and convenience foods have infiltrated Japanese society, authentic Japanese cuisines like bento boxes, sushi and ramen remain ever popular. The contradictions of Japan are endless - kimonos and karaoke, contemporary art and calligraphy, bonsai and bullet trains - the modern collides with the ancient everyday, and makes for a truly fascinating place to holiday.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Food lovers will surely be satisfied with a holiday in Japan. With a focus on fresh, seasonal produce, prepared meticulously and presented beautifully, dining in Japan is a memorable experience.

Things to try in Japan

1. Sake

Consumed for centuries, this fermented rice wine is usually served in small cups or saucers, and is drunk at restaurants and bars as well as during ceremonial rituals and special occasions. Sake has quite a high alcohol content - you've been warned.

2. Sushi & sashimi

Being an island nation, Japan has a bounty of seafood to sample. Try fresh sushi and sashimi made with tuna, salmon, squid, eel or octopus, served with soy, ginger and wasabi, prepared carefully by a sushi chef.

3. Beer

The Japanese love a lager, with beer being the most consumed alcoholic drink in Japan. Asahi, Sapporo and Kirin are the most popular Japanese brands - look out for special seasonal varieties.

4. Green tea

Cleansing, refreshing and packed with antioxidants, green tea is simply known as 'tea' or 'ocha' in Japan. A traditional Japanese tea ceremony is an experience not to be missed and a great way to try some of the many varieties of green tea available.

5. Ramen

This tasty, salty broth of noodles and meat comes in many different flavours and regional varieties. Sit and indulge at a Ramen restaurant or slurp down a bowl at a market or karaoke hall.








Festivals and events






×

Festivals and events




Sapporo Winter Festival

Held every February since 1950, this festival features hundreds of statues and ice sculptures, snow slides and mazes, regional food and artistic performances. Winter in Japan is truly amazing - and the Sapporo Winter Festival celebrates this magically.

Hadaka Matsuri

Head to Okayama to watch thousands of men, wearing nothing but a Japanese loin cloth, vie to touch the chosen 'naked man'. It may look like a bizarre male-bonding exercise but it's actually a historic cleansing ritual dating back thousands of years.

Fuji Rock Festival

Held annually in the stunning surrounds of the Naeba Ski resort, this outdoor rock festival with green-cred is huge. Drawing in big-name rock acts and local bands, thousands of music lovers flock to Naeba for three days of camping, music and partying.

Is tipping customary in Japan?









Tipping isn't customary in Japan and is not expected of you. Some inns or ryokans may leave a small envelope in your room where a small gratuity can be left for the maid staff.







What is the internet access like in Japan?









Internet access is excellent in Japan, with one of the most developed high-speed internet networks in the world. Internet cafes and Wi-Fi hot spots are easily found in most cities and major towns.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Japan?









Mobile phone coverage is excellent in Japan, but be aware that talking loudly on your phone in public places (like in train carriages) is frowned upon. If you want to use your mobile phone, ensure global roaming is activated before you arrive.







What are the toilets like in Japan?









In Japan, toilets range from high-tech bidets to standard western-style flushable toilets to squat toilets, which are still common in Japan. Sometimes you may need to pay for toilet paper, which can usually be purchased from a vending machine nearby.







What will is cost for a...?









Bento box = 1000 yen

Bowl of ramen = 700 yen

Beer = 700 yen

Snack from a convenience store = 300-400 yen








Can I drink the water in Japan?









Drinking water from taps in Japan is considered safe. For environmental reasons, try to use a refillable water bottle rather than buying bottled water.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Japan?









Major credit cards are accepted by some stores; however, Japan is still very much a cash culture and as such, some places may not accept credit cards. Ensure you carry enough cash to cover purchases.







What is ATM access like in Japan?









ATMs are common in Japan, so finding one won't be a problem in most towns and cities but unfortunately many of them don't accept foreign-issued cards. However, you can access cash from non-Japanese bank accounts via the Cirrus and Maestro systems at all post office ATMs around the country, as well as ATMs at 7-Eleven convenience store.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Japan?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.
