Latvia



Latvia is alive with vibrant cities, tantalising beaches, historic towns and a busy network of forests and rivers.


Latvians are proud of their past and much time and effort has been spent preserving their architectural history. Once you’ve had your fill of Baroque, Art Nouveau and Renaissance wonders, head to the nearest beer garden and make friends with some of the liveliest locals in Eastern Europe.

Best time to visit Latvia

Best time to visit Latvia




The best time to travel to Latvia is from June to mid September, when it’s warm and plenty of local food is available. Temperatures from June to August are normally around 20-22 degrees Celsius (68-72°F) and are very pleasant. July and August are the warmest months but they’re also the busiest months for tourists holidaying in Europe - outside of these times you’ll experience less tourists. October and November have autumn rains and daylight is short. From early November to April, temperatures rarely rise above zero degrees Celsius (32°F) during the day and drop well below zero at night. Slush under foot is something you have to cope with in autumn, when snow falls then melts, and in spring, when the winter snow thaws.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




You don’t have to travel far in Latvia to find dense forests and winding rivers. The rest of the country is fairly flat and along the coastline undulating sands back onto cliffs. Latvia borders
Estonia
in the north,
Lithuania
in the south,
Russia
in the east and Belarus in the southeast.








Top 5 Architectural Delights of Latvia

Top 5 Architectural Delights of Latvia




1. St Peter’s Church

The centrepiece of the Old Town dominates Riga’s skyline. Thought to be about 800 years old, the spire has been rebuilt countless times in the same form. Climb to the top for sprawling views.

2. House of Blackheads

Destroyed in 1941, the House of Blackheads was rebuilt for the city’s 800th anniversary. It’s Dutch Renaissance facade hides a stunning Gothic building that the Soviets felt was too ‘decadent’.

3. Swedish Gate

Follow Troksnu iela, the Old Town’s narrowest street, to the 17th-century Swedish Gate. This is one of the last remaining parts of the fortifications and celebrates the Scandinavians’ occupation of the city.

4. Riga Castle

Riga’s 14th-century castle has been destroyed time and time again, but keeps rising from the ashes. These days it’s home to the fascinating History Museum of Latvia.

5. The Cat House

Gaze up at the roof of the Cat House to see two feline sculptures perched on top. It’s said that 100 years ago, the Latvian owner turned the cats’ bums towards the Guild in protest of being blacklisted.

Be considerate of Latvia’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
