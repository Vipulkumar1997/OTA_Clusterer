Asia

Indonesia



If you thought Indonesia was all big resorts and Bintang, it might be time to check your atlas.


Because there isn’t really just one Indonesia, not when you’re an archipelago made up of 17,000 individual islands (only 8,000 of which have ever seen a human footprint). One minute you’re spotting orangutans in the jungles of Sumatra, the next you’re chowing down on an organic acai bowl in Ubud, hiking the slopes of Mt Batur or kicking back on the sugar-white beaches of Gili Air (preferably holding a some ridiculous, tropical-looking cocktail). Every day in Indonesia is different, so whether you’re after party, peace or paradise, the odds are good we’ve got an Indonesia tour that fits the bill.

Eliza Fletton

Beautiful Bali & Discover Longbok was two very beneficial trips to experience and learn about the Indonesian culture. You experience and learn much more than visiting the tourist destinations

Beautiful Bali,
November 2017

Robert Chretien

I love using Intrepid. The accommodations are beautiful and run by the local people. Much better than staying at a chain hotel. It is great having a local guide that deals with all the logistics, so you can just relax and have fun. It is also a pleasure interacting with people from across the globe.

Best time to visit Indonesia

Best time to visit Indonesia




Indonesia’s close proximity to the equator ensures consistently hot and humid weather in all seasons; however, its tropical climate means many areas are prone to periods of heavy rainfall. The wet season takes place from May to October and flooding can make road travel difficult at times. Popular holiday spots like Bali tend to receive large crowds during Christmas and school holidays but are significantly less crowded in shoulder seasons. Also worth keeping in mind are Indonesia’s various religious holidays. With a large population of practising Muslims, Ramadan results in the closure of many services, so expect a quieter experience when travelling during Ramadan.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




An archipelago of over 17,000 islands, Indonesia works its way across several oceans, beginning with the island of Sumatra in the West and stretching to Irian Jaya in the East. In between, Indonesia includes a sizeable part of Borneo, as well as larger islands such as Java, Bali and Sulawesi. With such a broad selection of islands, Indonesia encompasses a variety of landscapes such as: thick tropical jungle, fertile rice fields, grasslands and volcanic mountain ranges. Indonesia’s ecosystems are full of a rich variety of flora and fauna including the very rare Sumatran tiger and elephant, the Javan rhino and the fierce Komodo Dragon. Indonesia is also famous for its incredible beaches and marine life. With thousands of kilometres of reefs, beaches, bays and lagoons, Indonesia is a diver's paradise.








Top 10 Odd Creatures of Indonesia






×

Top 10 Odd Creatures of Indonesia




1. Sumatran Rhino

Appearing almost prehistoric, the Sumatran rhino is smaller in both size and number than its African cousins. Covered in a reddish brown fur, the Sumatran rhino is a solitary animal, and has been quietly grazing the grasslands for thousands of years.

2. Sulawesi Giant Squirrel

Living deep within Sulawesi’s rainforest canopies, this enigmatic and shy rodent can be tough to spot, so stay quiet and alert if you want catch a glimpse of one.

3. Sun Bear

A perennial favourite, the sun bear can be found on many of Indonesia’s islands. Perhaps suffering from ‘small bear syndrome’, these fiery characters are often quite aggressive, defying their nickname as the ‘Honey Bear’.

4. Sulawesi Macaque

Native to the island of Sulawesi, these crafty primates are known for being exceptionally social creatures. With family groups usually led by dominant females, Sulawesi macaques are a prime example of 'girl power' in action.

5. Sumatran Tiger

A noble predator with an almost mythical status, the Sumatran tiger stalks its prey deep within the jungles of Sumatra. With some estimates putting their numbers at just over 300, an international effort is underway to protect this incredible animal.

6. Javan Slow Loris

Slow in name, slow in nature. Don’t be fooled though, this super-cute creature packs a deadly punch – it is the world's only poisonous primate!

7. Long-Beaked Echidna

Inhabiting the island of New Guinea, this crazy critter snuffles about the forest floor using its large snout. Don’t expect to see many of these guys though; they are classified as ‘critically endangered’.

8. Komodo Dragon

The fearsome Komodo Dragon is the world’s largest lizard, often weighing up to 70 kilograms. Described as the ‘perfect predator’, this stealthy beast makes for an exhilarating sight.

9. Moluccan Flying Snake

Scared of snakes? Now you'll have to search the ground and the air as these aerodynamic reptiles have found a novel way to move between the treetops, by becoming airborne and gliding for up to 30 metres.

10. Babirusa

What do you get when you cross a pig and a deer? The odd looking Babirusa: a short and stocky animal with large, curled horns. Native to Indonesia, populations of these bizarre beasts are sadly in decline due to poaching and habitat loss.

Indonesia travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Indonesia?









Passport holders for most nationalities are now permitted to enter Visa Free for up to 30 days for tourism purposes. In March 2016 Australia and Ireland have been added to the list of countries now exempt from visas for visits for tourism purposes under 30 days. Please check with your relevant consulate or embassy.

Entry requirements: presentation of onward or return tickets, passport which is valid for at least 6 months. Visitors on Visa-Free Short Visits must enter AND exit from certain airports and seaports in Indonesia including: Jakarta (Soekarno-Hatta Airport), Bali (Ngurah Rai Airport), Yogyakarta (Adisucipto Airport) and Surabaya (Juanda Airport). This currently excludes entry and exist from Lombok (Bandar Udara International Airport). Visa-Free Short Visits cannot be extended and cannot be transferred to another type of visa.

Some nationalities are required to obtain a visa on arrival, or in advance. Citizens of countries who aren't on the visa on arrival or visa free lists are required to apply for a visa overseas before travelling to Indonesia.

Nationals of all countries planning to stay for more than 30 days in Indonesia have to apply for the appropriate visa at an overseas Indonesian consulate or embassy before their departure.

Local laws require that you must be able show your valid passport at any time when required to do so by an immigration office. We recommend taking a clear photocopy of your passport photo page, and visa (after arriving), to carry with you.







Is tipping customary in Indonesia?









Tipping isn't mandatory or customary in Indonesia, but a tip of spare change or another small amount would be appreciated by restaurants, drivers and other service workers, especially if the service has been particularly good.







What is the internet access like in Indonesia?









Internet access is widely available in tourist areas like Bali, which has many internet cafes. Internet access is less common in rural and remote areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Indonesia?









You'll be able to use your mobile phone in most urban areas of Indonesia, although some of the islands or more remote areas may not have network coverage. Ensure you have global roaming activated with your mobile carrier before you leave home if you wish to use your mobile while in Indonesia.







What are the toilets like in Indonesia?









You'll have to adjust to different standards of hygiene and sanitation while in Indonesia. The standard toilet is of the squat variety and this may take some getting used to. However, western-style toilets can be found in large hotels and some tourist areas.







What will it cost for a…?









Indonesia is one of the world's favourite budget travel destinations. Here's what you can roughly expect to pay for a:

Street food snack = 2,000 IDR
Fresh juice = 5,000 IDR
Bottle of beer in a bar = 20,000 IDR
Souvenir sarong = 25,000 IDR
Dinner in a restaurant = 40,000 IDR







Can I drink the water in Indonesia?









Drinking tap water isn't recommended in Indonesia. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water. Ask your leader where filtered water can be found, some hotels we stay in may have drinking water available. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Indonesia?









Major credit cards are widely accepted by large shops, hotels and restaurants in Indonesia. However, they may not be accepted by smaller vendors such as small family restaurants, market stalls or in remote towns and rural areas. Make sure you carry enough cash for purchases, since credit cards aren't always an option everywhere in Indonesia.







What is ATM access like in Indonesia?









ATMs are found widely throughout Indonesia, so withdrawing cash shouldn't be problematic in most areas. Some smaller villages and rural areas may not have ATM access, so be prepared for this before venturing too far from a city or major town.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Indonesia?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Indonesia

Be considerate of Indonesia's customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Choose to not support businesses that promote cruelty towards or exploitation of endangered species.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Ramadan is the fasting month for all Muslims. During this month no food, drink or smoking is permitted during daylight hours. While non-Muslims aren't expected to fast, it's recommended to try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public during daylight hours.

The precious reefs off the coast of Indonesia need to be preserved and protected. By all means, admire the coral, but never touch or remove coral from reefs. Also, avoid buying souvenirs that have been illegally removed from the reef.





The Intrepid Foundation

The Intrepid Foundation provides travellers with an opportunity to give something back to the many wonderful communities we travel to. By donating to The Intrepid Foundation you can make a difference in local communities - in health care, education, human rights, child welfare and the protection of wildlife and the environment.
