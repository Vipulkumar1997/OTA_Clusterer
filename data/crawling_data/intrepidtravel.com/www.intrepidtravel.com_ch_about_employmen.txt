We're incredibly proud of our small family of staff who each bring their unique skills and experience to our talent pool. In Intrepid offices around the world, you'll find dedicated, hard working people, who are passionate about what they do and thrive in a fun, positive team environment.

Here are just a few ways you might forge out a career with Intrepid:

Become a Travel Specialist

Our specialist travel advisors have an abundance of experience, a wealth of knowledge and a passion for amazing adventures. If you've racked up your fair share of passport stamps, come from a background in travel or simply have a thirst for adventure and sensational people skills - there might just be a job with your name on it in one of our offices around the world.

Become a Group Leader

Do you want to make a career out of showing your country to the world? Are experienced in group tours or travel? Then it's time to consider a career as an Intrepid Group Leader. Our leaders come from a diverse range of backgrounds and experience, and share our passion for responsible travel. Key attributes such as high-level organisation, problem solving and people skills are essential to ensure you've got what it takes to give Intrepid travellers the most incredible experience.

Join our industry sales team

Are you passionate about travel, skilled at making sales and have great attention to detail? If so, the Intrepid Industry Sales team might be just the place for you. This team are at the heart of our business - its trips, trips and more trips, 24-hours a day! In fact you are almost always on someone's holiday! Servicing the needs of direct sales, wholesale agents and web customers, you could be talking to an agent one minute and emailing a potential holiday-maker in Europe the next. Sound like the right mix of fun and variety for you?



Where we are in the world?

Melbourne, Victoria, Australia
It is Melbourne where the Intrepid story began although the team has increased dramatically from the days Darrell and Manch were a two man band working out of their kitchen! This is the biggest Intrepid office in the globe and based in the cosmopolitan CBD.

Brixton, London, UK
We're moved into the heart of uber cool Brixton! We have a fantastic new space in an old red brick Piano factory within 2 mins of Brixton Tube & Rail Station.

Petaluma, California, USA
Overlooking the Petaluma River and the hills of Sonoma County this has to be one of the most attractive work environments for Intrepid staff. It was ranked 33rd in the 100 best places to work by the American Outside Magazine.

Toronto, Canada
Tucked away in Toronto’s fashion district, our Queen St. W office space is truly a hub for adventure. This open space fosters an environment of open communication, collaboration and creativity. The office itself offers a relaxing lounge space, foosball table and two beer fridge’s, meaning there are no shortage of spots to celebrate a big win or a job well done!



Our Culture

Working for Intrepid can often be a fairly social affair, like team lunches in Hanoi, yoga sessions in the Beijing office or 'Frock up Fridays' in Melbourne - we always make time to supplement our busy working lives with some fun and frivolity.

The thing that sets Intrepid apart is that all staff are encouraged to be themselves, make suggestions and share their ideas - even the crazy ones. After all, Intrepid Travel was born from a crazy idea two backpackers had while on holiday in Africa!

The Intrepid Foundation

In 2002 we established The Intrepid Foundation, which supports non-government organisations around the world and empowers travellers to positively impact the communities that we visit.   As one of our team, you could make a difference with innovative approaches and ideas that challenge the status quo and contribute to the planet, people, peace, partnerships and prosperity.  Just some of our many projects include funding research on elephant welfare in Thailand, supporting a renewable energy enterprise in India or rebuilding damaged schools in Nepal.

Recruitment process

Office-based hiring process

The job application process with Intrepid is nice and straighthforward. Just a few simple steps and you’re on your way to beginning the adventure of a lifetime.

Application process

Once you’ve identified a vacancy that suits your talents and requirements, please ensure you have your CV ready in an electronic format. Answer some simple questions related to the job you’re applying for and attach both to an email directed to the relevant location

Telephone screening

If you are shortlisted the first stage of the process may involve a telephone call to discuss your CV and career aspirations in more detail. This is also a great opportunity for you to ask any questions you may have about life at Intrepid.

Interview process

Short-listed candidates will then be invited in to meet us in person. The initial interview will be a mix of behavioural and role specific questions and there is the potential for second round interviews to take place.

Selection

The final selected applicant will be given a verbal offer of the position, followed by confirmation in writing. The time frame for placement varies but generally may take between 2-4 weeks.

Benefits

Staff Travel Discounts - each permanent full time employee is entitled to a discount off Intrepid trips

Employee Assistance Program (EAP) - Intrepid offers an EAP program which provides employees and immediate family members with assistances in times of hardship. We want to ensure our employees are safe and happy inside and outside of work.



Training and development

To keep up with the growing needs of the business, we also regularly create new roles and reengineer existing positions - which means we can offer opportunities for multi-skilled members of staff to redefine and grow their roles within the business, or try their hand at something different entirely.

Performance reviews

Reviews are held every 6 months with each office staff member, where issues such as future development, training opportunities and performance are discussed and evaluated. This maintains healthy two-way communication between employees and managers.

Training and study support

At Intrepid, we not only recognise the importance of continued learning and development - we support it. All staff may be entitled to study leave and can apply for financial support for external training programs, short courses or tertiary study.

Internal training

Being an international company, we adopt a blended approach to learning that involves training in a face-to-face ‘classroom’ setting, online training via webinars and virtual ‘classrooms’ where employees from across the globe interact. Regular courses and workshops are also run by both internal staff and professional facilitators, on topics ranging from product specific training to conflict management and customer service.



Work Experience

Plenty of people grow up wanting to forge a career in travel - and why wouldn't you? Breathtaking sights, golden sunrises, eye-popping cities… we're inclined to agree that it's the best industry there is! In the interest of helping out the next-gen of travel gurus, Intrepid offers students the chance to do work experience in our Melbourne office.

As we receive a high volume of requests, all students must contact our HR Department, well in advance to be considered. Please email
