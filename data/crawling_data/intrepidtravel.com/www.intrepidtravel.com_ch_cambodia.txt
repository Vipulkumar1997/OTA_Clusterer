Destinations

Asia

Cambodia



Travelling in Cambodia is like winding back the South East Asian clock about 20 years.


Beneath the Cardamom Mountains or on the banks of the Mekong, Khmer village life goes on pretty much as it always has (give or take the odd iPhone). And when you’re watching a sunrise over Angkor Wat or clambering Tomb-Raider-style over the ruins of Tha Promh, the modern world feels a long way off. But don’t be fooled by the epic history – Cambodia is a country on the move. With riverside boulevards and art galleries popping up in Phnom Penh, and Siem Reap’s growing reputation for hip cafes and thumping nightlife, Cambodia tours aren’t all about the temple-gazing. (Although we have to admit, the gazing is pretty darn good.)

Cambodia Discovery,
November 2017

deborah bell

Am so lucky that I had seen both Laos and cambodia before the invasion of China and Chinese tourists who are not helping the locals in any way  and they need our help to survive eg tuk-tuk drivers, who struggle to make ends meet, let alone educate their children, which the government dosen't want as they will learn about democracy and freedom

Transport in Cambodia

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Cambodia, you may find yourself travelling by:







Remork

The Cambodian version of the tuk tuk is a fun way to get around and perfect for short trips.











Cyclo

Take the slow road and see Cambodia from the ground level while being pedalled through the streets by a friendly cyclo rider.

Bicycle

Get to know the countryside of Cambodia while riding a bicycle. Glide past fields of rice and wave hello to passing locals.

Best time to visit Cambodia




Any time of the year is a good time to travel in Cambodia, with each season having its advantages. The climate in Cambodia is generally hot and humid throughout the year. Temperatures stay in the 30s most of the year, dropping back to the 20s at night. There are officially two seasons in Cambodia – wet and dry. During November to May you can expect dry conditions, while June to October will have wetter weather.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




The Khmer culture has lasted for centuries, and is based on tradition, honouring ancestors, respecting elders and living a life of honesty, humility and kindness. Which is probably why Cambodians are known for being some of the most warm, hospitable and humble people in the world. Above all these qualities, Cambodians are known for their remarkable ability to get on with life after enduring the atrocities that ravaged the country in the 1970s.

As with other neighbouring nations like Thailand, the concept of “saving face” is important. Displaying control and keeping a peaceful nature in public is paramount, as is not losing your temper or ridiculing others.

Most Khmer people are Buddhist. Monks are highly regarded and respected in society, and religious festivals and ceremonies are important parts of daily life. When visiting Cambodia, expect to see orange-robed monks and many displays of faith - from people visiting large, elaborate temples to them praying over small, humble shrines.

Despite the infiltration of modern ideas and concepts, Khmer customs and traditions are kept alive with traditional dance, art, festivals and costume enduring alongside modern pop music and dance.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Like most other Asian countries, rice, noodle soups and stir fries are common in Cambodia. Drawing on Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese cuisines, Cambodian food is strong in flavour but usually not as spicy as food from neighbouring countries.

Things to try in Cambodia

1. Amok

This delicious dish consists of fish seasoned with coconut milk and chilli wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed. Found in up-market restaurants, cafes and markets – Amok is a national culinary treasure!

2. Baguettes

A remnant of Cambodia’s French-colonial past, fresh, crunchy baguettes are sold from street stalls and at markets - and make a great, low-cost breakfast or snack.

3. Tropical Fruit

Jackfruit, mangoes, bananas, pineapple, dragon fruit and watermelon are all plentiful in Cambodian. Get a street vendor to mix up a fresh juice or smoothie for a refreshing treat.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Bordered by
Vietnam
,
Thailand
and
Laos
, much of Cambodia is covered by forested area, although sadly, this is rapidly changing due to the growth of agriculture, logging and deforestation. Home to the largest lake in South-East Asia, Tonle Sap (Great Lake) connects to the Mekong River and swells to four times its normal size during the monsoon season.

Most of the country is low-lying, except for pockets of mountains. Large cities like Siem Reap and Phnom Penh are typically built-up, busy and filled with modern conveniences like nightclubs, bars, public transport, internet cafes and restaurants. Smaller towns and rural areas enjoy more peace and space, with low-density, simple housing and a reliance on agriculture for income.








History and government

History and government




Early History

Evidence of early life in Cambodia dates back to 1500BC, and further evidence suggests that by the 1st Century, rice cultivation, fishing and animal husbandry were the basis of organised society in Cambodia. Various empires arose in the early stages of Cambodian history, with the Funan and Chenla Kingdoms reigning before the rise of the Khmer civilisation. Regarded as one of the most powerful empires in the world, the Khmer Empire prospered from the 9th to the 13th centuries. This was a time of growth and expansion, and many of the artistic treasures and archaeological monuments that Cambodia is known for come from this era. The world-famous temples of Angkor were built during this period, and hold important clues to how life was lived back then. Temple inscriptions depicting daily life, religious ceremonies and military exploits give us important insights into this fascinating civilisation. There are many theories that speculate on the decline of the Khmer Empire. It’s more than likely that a combination of factors including drought, the arrival of the Plague and the rise of neighbouring Thai superpower Ayutthaya resulted in the loss of momentum for a once-powerful empire. A period of decline followed, with the 15th to the 19th centuries marking a time of Cambodia having a lower profile in international affairs, until coming under French Colonial rule in 1863.

Recent History

The events that have shaped Cambodia’s recent history began with the Communist Party of Kampuchea overpowering the Khmer Republic after more than 100 days of fierce fighting. What followed was a radical change in society, with Pol Pot leading the country now known as Kampuchea. This brutal regime soon set about restructuring society and was responsible for committing awful atrocities against the civilian population. Religion and education were repressed, currency and banking were abolished and people were sent to work in the fields. Business people, educators, scholars and other high-ranking members of society were hunted down and murdered by the Khmer Rouge. It's estimated that hundreds of thousands of people (possibly millions) were murdered between 1975 and 1979. In addition to this, many more died of starvation and disease due to lack of medical care and nourishment.

This nationalistic, murderous regime was finally overcome by the Vietnamese Army in 1979, signalling the beginning of the peace process and the establishment of the People’s Republic of Kampuchea. In 1993, millions of Cambodians voted to elect a new government, which then ratified a new constitution, and in 2004 a tribunal was established to serve justice to the people who committed atrocities during the Khmer Rouge era.

Today, Cambodia is rebuilding and moving on from it’s tragic past. Many NGOs have set up programs that empower and support Cambodians with education, health care, training and counselling. While wide-scale poverty and other social problems remain, Cambodia continues to gain strength from its burgeoning tourism industry, and has recently been successful in increasing access to education and health care as well as improving overall living standards.








Top 10 Must-Visit Places of Cambodia






×

Top 10 Must-Visit Places of Cambodia




1. Phnom Penh

Cambodia’s capital may be chaotic but there are moments of peace to be found. Relax in a riverfront bar, find serenity in a local temple or soak up the grand atmosphere of the Royal Palace.

2. Battambang

Beautiful Battambang is home to wonderful examples of French-Colonial architecture, ornate temples, peaceful pagodas and scenic villages. Choose to day trip here or stay longer to be immersed in this place of authenticity.

3. Sihanoukville

With brilliant beaches and a balmy, tropical climate, the port city of Sihanoukville offers a great beach break for weary travellers. Bask in golden sunshine, swim in azure waters, visit a nearby island or laze the day away swinging in a hammock.

4. Siem Reap

With vibrant markets, cool bars, excellent restaurants and superb street food - fun times, culinary adventures and a healthy dose of retail therapy are guaranteed in sensational Siem Reap.

5. Kompong Cham

Full of old-world charm and quiet beauty, Kompong Cham is a great place to switch gears and go slow. Wander the streets to admire decaying colonial buildings, visit a Wat for a quiet moment of reflection or sit on the riverbanks and watch fishermen glide by.

6. Angkor

The sprawling ruins of ever-impressive Angkor are not to be underestimated. From the smiling faces of the Bayon and the twisted trees of Ta Prohm, to the magnetic aura of mighty Angkor Wat, this archaeological site is both intriguing and inspiring.

7. Kampot

Riverside Kampot is a blissful place to unwind. Acting as gateway to nearby mountains, waterfalls, caves, ruins and national parks, this little haven of tranquillity has a great range of quaint guesthouses and cute cafes to keep travellers comfortable.

8. Kratie

Home to rare river-dwelling dolphins, amber sunsets and a gorgeous riverfront, Kratie may be small in size but is still a great spot to stop and get away from it all for a few days.

9. Mondulkiri

A world away from the rest of Cambodia, the mountainous Mondulkiri Province has its own unique culture. Minority groups live in traditional villages here, alongside lush landscapes and a temperate climate. It may be difficult to get to remote Mondulkiri but it’s well worth the journey.

10. Ream National Park

Home to a wide array of birds including eagles, kingfishers, storks and egrets, as well as many species of striking butterflies, a visit to Ream National Park is a great way to get in touch with Cambodia’s natural world.








Shopping

Shopping




Markets are plentiful in Cambodia - from the large markets like the Central and Russian Markets in Phnom Penh, to the smaller, local markets in regional areas. As with most markets in
Asia
, bargaining for a good price is commonplace.

It's also a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Cambodia:


Silver Jewellery



Stone and Wood Carvings



Traditional Cambodian Scarves (known as ‘Kramas’)

Festivals and Events in Cambodia




Khmer New Year (Chaul Chnam Thmey)

An important celebration in the Khmer calendar, the Cambodian New Year sees three days of people taking part in rituals, playing traditional games, performing gestures of goodwill towards others and enjoying feasts. Most Cambodians return to their homes to spend time with their families during this time but it’s still a fabulous time to see Cambodia shine.\

"Ancestors’ Day" involves Cambodians visiting pagodas bearing food, flowers, rice and gifts, which are given to monks to offer to the afterlife so the dead do not haunt the living. This is a particularly poignant celebration given Cambodia’s recent history.

Water Festival

Celebrating the end of monsoon and the natural flow reversal of Tonle Sap and the Mekong, this festival is a visual feast featuring illuminated ornamental boats, music performances, colourful racing boats, fire works, dance, food and drink. With millions teeming into Phnom Penh, this is a great time to see Cambodia in high spirits – although it can get very crowded.

Is tipping customary in Cambodia?









Tipping isn’t expected in Cambodia, but is appreciated. Feel free to tip drivers and restaurant staff if you feel the service has been good.







What is the internet access like in Cambodia?









Internet access is growing in Cambodia. Internet cafes are easily found in large cities, but the speed may be slower than what you’re used to.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Cambodia?









Mobile phone coverage is generally good in urban areas, but can be patchy and less reliable in rural areas. Ensure global roaming is activated on your phone before you arrive in Cambodia.







What are the toilets like in Cambodia?









Squat toilets are the most common in Cambodia, but western-style toilets can be found in large hotels and in tourist areas. Be prepared to pay a small fee when visiting public toilets, and always carry your own toilet paper and soap as they are usually not provided.







What will it cost for a...?









Large beer = US$1.50
Meal in a mid-range restaurant = US$4-6
Street snack = 2000-4000 Riel
Souvenir t-shirt = US$3-4







Can I drink the water in Cambodia?









It's not recommended to drink the tap water in Cambodia. Filtered water is a better option; try to use a refillable canteen or water bottle rather than buying bottled water. Remember to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Cambodia?









Credit cards are usually accepted by modern hotels, restaurants and medium-large shops in tourist areas. Smaller shops, cafes, market stalls and places in remote areas probably won’t have facilities that support credit cards, so ensure you have enough cash to cover expenses while in rural areas or when visiting smaller vendors.







What is ATM access like in Cambodia?









ATMs are becoming more common in Cambodia’s large cities, so finding one while when staying in places like Siem Reap, Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville shouldn’t be a problem. Smaller towns and isolated areas will have very few, or none at all, so have enough cash to cover purchases as ATM access may not be available.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Cambodia?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Cambodia

Be considerate of Cambodia's customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

Ask permission, remove your shoes and cover your shoulders with a jacket or wrap before entering a place of worship.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Refrain from touching or interfering with ancient monuments, relics or historic sites.

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
