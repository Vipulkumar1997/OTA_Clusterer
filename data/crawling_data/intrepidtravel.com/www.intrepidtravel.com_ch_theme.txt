Themes




If you’ve got an idea of which style of trip will suit you best, take a look at our different trip themes below, as there’s something to suit everyone. Whether you’re chasing a global gastronomic dream or wanting to ride your bike to Basecamp, Intrepid has a themed adventure that's perfect for you.










Cycling



Whether you’re a Tour de France fanatic or just enjoy the wind in your face on two wheels, a cycling adventure can take you up the cols of the Alps or across the roof of the world in Tibet. You don’t have to be a Bradley or a Cadel – whatever your level of fitness and experience, we’ve got le tour for you.

Family



There’s more to a family adventure than theme parks and resort kid’s clubs. Our carefully crafted itineraries allow you to create a memorable adventure together with your children. Experience authentic local culture with an English-speaking leader who will share their knowledge and passion for their country with you.

Find out more








Food



Food Adventures are about discovering new flavours while exploring the world. With a focus on street fare, local specialities, home cooking and urban food culture, these trips offer the authentic local experience that Intrepid is famous for, with an emphasis on cuisine.

Find out more








Adventure Cruising



Ditch the conga lines and cabaret of traditional big ship cruises for a more immersive cruising experience. Our range of small-ship adventure cruises are all about the destination – exploring local villages and markets, diving into the history of each destination, and stopping in at smaller ports that commercial liners just can’t reach.

Find out more








Sailing



There’s nothing more relaxing than exploring a destination via its waterways. No traffic jams, no delays – just endless horizons and golden sunsets. And with a range of sailing trips in Thailand, Burma, the Mediterranean, Caribbean, Galapagos islands as well as Polar cruises, there's bound to be a water-based adventure that suits you.

Find out more








Walking & Trekking



Explore on foot and make the most of the outdoors on one of our group tours or on a self-guided itinerary. All accommodation is pre-booked and your luggage will be transferred from point to point. They combine the best bits of hiking without any of the hassles.

Find out more








Wildlife



Witness some of the world’s most epic wildlife experiences: the migrations across the Serengeti, the gorillas of Rwanda and Uganda, or the penguins on Antarctica’s drifting floes. If you’ve got a bit of Attenborough going on, then why not travel with the industry leaders in global tourism sustainability.

Find out more








Polar



Cast adrift to the extremes of the earth and discover great white landscapes full of icy inlets and frozen coves. Experience the rush of setting foot on some of the world's most remote terrain, witness brilliant natural phenomena and come to terms with the sheer size and scale of our planet's polar regions.

Find out more








Expeditions



Our exclusive range of very special adventures: our expedition trips. They are limited departures that tackle the unexplored regions of the world untouched by tourism – everywhere from Burma’s Ice Mountains to the salt lakes of Djibouti.

Find out more








Explorer



Grassroots travel, authentic experiences and local adventures – Explorer trips are the essential Intrepid journeys. Taking you to the heart of a culture via myriad ancient sites, modern cities, national parks and local icons, these trips are big on real life experiences.

Find out more








Festivals



For us, festivals are the smell of incense, the fizz of fireworks and the squelch of a fresh tomato. They arrive with the thunder of bespeckled dancers and wind down like a Munich beer hall hangover. They’re the lantern-lit, confetti-filled, mud-slinging reminder that life is there to be enjoyed to the max, and that there’s no such thing as too much fun in the name of pomp and ceremony.

Find out more








Overland



Epic road trips, immense landscapes, big adventures. Explore the rugged terrain of some of the world’s most far-flung places in our purpose-built trucks and buses. When you think of ‘off the beaten track’, this is what your imagination is picturing.

Find out more








Short Breaks



Whether you’re short of time and looking for a mini-break with a difference, or want to unwind on a beach after a big backpacking adventure, these 2-5 day itineraries offer the same local, authentic experiences as our longer trips, but in a shorter amount of time.

Find out more








Urban Adventures



So you’ve just arrived in a new city. You step outside your hotel, take a deep breath and…then what? Wouldn’t it be great to have a friendly local to show you all their favourite spots – the little bars, hipster cafes and cool underground galleries that tourists never find? Enter Urban Adventures.
