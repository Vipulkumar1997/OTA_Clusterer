Best time to visit Austria

Best time to visit Austria




Sunshine generally prevails from June to September, making it the ideal time to visit for cycling and hiking in the Alps and sightseeing in the cities. During the summer months, visitors can expect warm days and cool nights with less rain than in the other months. Snow typically falls from December to March (especially in the alpine areas) so this is the best time for snow sports like skiing and snowboarding.

Sharing borders with

, and Liechtenstein, mountainous Austria may be small but carries large landscapes within. Austria's alpine regions feature everything from snowy, inhabitable peaks to green pastures, grasslands and meadows, depending on the season and area. The iconic Danube River runs through Austria, creating tributaries that flow to the north of the country, and with more than 300 lakes dotted around the country, there are plenty of scenic places for water sports and relaxation.

Top 5 Palaces of Austria

1. Schloss Schonbrunn

With a whopping 1440 rooms, this summer palace is the perfect example of European opulence. While the palace itself is impressive, the immaculately maintained gardens featuring statues, sculptures, fountains, flower beds and a hedge maze are a horticultural delight.

2. Hofburg Palace

The official resident of Austria's president, the Hofburg Palace (also known as the Imperial Palace) is a remarkable palatial complex. With grand rooms full of luxurious furnishings, sprawling gardens, interesting museums and art collections, this is a Viennese 'must-see'.

3. Schloss Belvedere

A triumph of Baroque architecture and design, this palatial complex built in the early 18th century features magnificent rooms and halls decorated with beautiful frescoes and paintings. Built during a time of economic prosperity, no expense was spared by the architect resulting in a palace of luxe splendour.

4. Schloss Eggenberg

This cultural treasure of Graz features lavish interiors decorated with priceless art, grand chandeliers, sumptuous furnishings and magnificent murals. Visitors are sure to be blown away by the Planetary Room, a visual feast of cosmic art depicting the planets and zodiac.

5. Schloss Hellbrunn

Built in the early 17th century, this popular Salzburg wonder is most famous for its elaborate water features. Visitors delight in the trick fountains and hidden water features which provide entertainment and refreshment on a hot summer's day.
