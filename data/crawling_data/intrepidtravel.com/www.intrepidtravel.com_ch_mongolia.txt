Asia

Mongolia



Landing in the post-Soviet concrete of Ulaanbaatar, you might wonder where Mongolia keeps its famous wide-open spaces.


But just wait until you catch your first glimpse of sunrise over the Asian Steppe. There’s no other view on Earth quite like it: mile after mile of rolling grassy tundra, dotted with white-domed Gers and broken up with golden dunes or the craggy peaks of Tavan Bogd. It’s probably no surprise that our Mongolia tours are all about the wilderness – soaking in the hot springs of Tsenkher or riding camels through the Khogno Khan Mountains – but you’ll find there’s more to this country than just good views. With its communist past and a (proudly) democratic future, Mongolia is ready to great the 21st Century with a smile.

Transport in Mongolia

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Mongolia, you may find yourself travelling by:







Camel

Enjoy a memorable ride through the Mongolian desert on the back of a camel.











Train

Watch the Mongolian steppe whiz past while rattling on a train through the countryside.





Accommodation in Mongolia

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Mongolia you may find yourself staying in a:







Ger Camp

Spend the night sleeping in a quintessential Mongolian icon, the ger. Built to withstand the harsh elements, these portable structures of circular beauty are surprisingly comfortable.











Homestay

Get in touch with Mongolian culture and cuisine while staying with a local family. Pick up some local language and learn about the Mongolian way of life while enjoying warm hospitality.

Best time to visit Mongolia






×

Best time to visit Mongolia




Mongolia has an extreme continental climate due to its inland location. The best time for travelling is from May to October when the weather is pleasant. Due to the popularity of the Naadam Festival, July is the busiest time to go; it can get crowded, but Ulaanbaatar buzzes with an incredible vibe during this time.

The wet season is from July to August and although it rains frequently during this time, the rain turns the countryside into a pleasant shade of green. It can get extremely cold from June to October, with snowstorms sometimes grounding flights and bringing transport systems to a halt.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Mongolia is known for its strong nomadic traditions, but life has recently become more urbanised for many citizens in this sparsely populated country. Almost 50% of the population live in or near an urban centre, while the other 50% live a semi-nomadic lifestyle in the countryside; although, settled agricultural communities can be found in rural areas and are growing each year. Despite this change in lifestyle, the rich nomadic heritage remains strong and traditional Mongol songs, dance, stories and clothing are still celebrated, especially during festivals and national holidays.

Many Mongolian people are Buddhist - this is evident in the monasteries and temples that populate the urban areas as well as the remote regions. Shamanism is also still in existence in some of the more isolated regions of Mongolia where the proud cultures have been somewhat protected from modern influences.

A common thread that links most Mongolians is respect for family and the importance of hospitality. Probably borne from the nomadic way of life, sharing with others and receiving guests with grace is a common theme that recurs in Mongolian society. Harsh conditions, a changeable climate and the uncertainty of nomadic life mean that most Mongolians go out of their way to provide a safe haven for family, friends and guests. It is for this reason that turning down food or not accepting a warm welcome is not advisable.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways of experiencing a country is by eating. Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Mongolian food will probably be very different to what you’re used to. Due to many Mongolians living a nomadic lifestyle, access to ingredients and different modes of cooking are limited. Fermented milk products and meats such as goat, mutton and horse are commonly eaten. Vegetarians might find eating difficult here, especially since refusing food is considered rude when visiting people’s homes. The cafes and eateries of Ulaanbaatar offer more variety and should be frequented.

Things to try in Mongolia

1. Buuz

These steamed meat dumplings are usually served during festive times, but can be found in restaurants and cafes all year round.

2. Khuushuur

Similar to buuz, these meat-filled dumplings are fried, not steamed. Served in the cafes of Ulaanbaatar, these pastry pockets are a cheap, flavoursome snack.

3. Vodka

Russia’s influence on Mongolia is evident in the popularity of vodka among locals who pass the bottle around generously.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Bordered by
China
and
Russia
, Mongolia is a land of mountains and plateaus, grasslands, marshes and deserts. Even though Mongolia is landlocked, Lake Khovsgol (one of Asia’s largest freshwater lakes) provides 70% of Mongolia’s fresh water. This ancient lake provides much of the drinking water for the animal and human population, with the surrounding areas providing lush habitats for wolves, ibex, deer and bears. Due to Mongolia’s significant seismic activity, there are also many hot springs and volcanoes throughout the country.

Mongolia is one of the least densely populated countries in the world, leaving much space for nomadic herders to roam. The fast-growing capital city of Ulaanbaatar is an exception, being home to high-density housing, universities and financial institutions. As an economic centre and transport hub, Ulaanbaatar has all the modern conveniences expected of an international city.








History and government

History and government




Early History

The area now known as Mongolia has been inhabited for more than 800,000 years. Archaeological evidence, such as rock paintings, points to groups of hunters and gatherers living throughout Mongolia in prehistoric times. Mongolia’s early history is coloured by battles and invasions, with various nomadic empires laying claim to the land. The most famous of these was the Mongol Empire, created by Genghis Khan in 1206. This empire was known as the largest land-based empire of its time and had great success invading and claiming foreign territory, before declining due to infighting, disunity and the rise of neighbouring territories.

Recent History

Modern Mongolia is an interesting mix of Mongol, Chinese and Russian influences. Rising up to gain independence from decades of communist rule, modern Mongolia is becoming more fast-paced and globalised as the years go by. Holding its first democratic election in 1990, Mongolia now enjoys a time of relative peace and stability, with tourism, agriculture and mineral resources providing more abundance and improvements in infrastructure and living conditions.








Natural Wonders of Mongolia

Natural Wonders of Mongolia




Top 10 Natural Wonders of Mongolia

1. Lake Khovsgol

This shimmering, azure jewel of Mongolia is simply stunning. Surrounded by majestic mountains and fresh, alpine meadows, Lake Khovsgol is a photographer’s dream and the perfect playground for nature lovers and adventurers.

2. Selenge River

This powerful river in Northern Mongolia is surrounded by lush landscapes and agriculture. Home to a wide variety of wildlife and birds, this fertile area shows Mongolia in all its natural glory.

3. Gobi Desert

Covering a large part of southern Mongolia, the atmospheric Gobi Desert is a vast, barren expanse of dunes, rocks and gravel. Surprisingly, there are traces of life here, from flocks of cashmere goats to rare Gobi bears. Think you’ve seen deserts before? The Gobi Desert is simply like no other in the world.

4. Bayan Olgii

Remote, rugged and rich in archaeological treasures, this isolated part of Mongolia rewards the patient traveller with impressive historic sites, panoramic vistas, unaffected people and a fascinating culture.

5. Altai Tavan Bogd National Park

Home to lakes, glaciers, alpine forests and dramatic valleys, the rugged landscapes of this national park will mesmerise visitors. Home to eagles, deer, moose and ibex, this stunning national park showcases Mongolia’s untamed beauty at its finest.

6. Uran Uul

This extinct volcano is no longer threatening - it hasn’t erupted for centuries and is now covered in verdant grass and lush greenery. Hike to the rim and enjoy the views of the surrounding valley.

7. Darkhad Depression

The 200-odd lakes of the Darkhad Depression possess a mystical, romantic beauty. The Mongolian steppe and surrounding Taiga forest provides the ideal environment for reindeer-breeding nomads who frequent this area throughout the year.

8. Terkhiin Tsagaan Lake

This lake in Central Mongolia is a place of peace, stillness and beauty. Its uncrowded shores are a great place to spot the wide range of aquatic birds that call this picturesque lake home.

9. Tsenkher Hot Springs

The hot springs of Tsenkher are the real deal. Natural, non-commercial and remote, the open-air springs offer hot and steamy rejuvenation amid unspoilt rugged mountain scenery.

10. Gurvan Saikhan National Park

The huge variety of flora and fauna within this national park make it a popular tourist spot. See finches, vultures, gazelles, wild camels and the elusive, endangered snow leopard.
