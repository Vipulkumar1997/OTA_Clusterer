based on 5 reviews in the last year.










Vic Falls to Zanzibar,
August 2017

Josie Misick

Stanley was an excellent guide on this exciting trip. I loved every minute of all the activities, especially the walking safari so close to the Rhinos. The riding safari in the Zambezi NP was an incredible experience, and the ancient stone city of Great Zimbabwe was fascinating.

Review submitted 11 Sep 2017











Vic Falls to Kenya,
June 2017

Karen Sizeland

This trip offers an excellent opportunity to travel through East Africa, with a very good balance of both cultural and wildlife experiences.  The game drives were breath taking, with a wealth of animals to see in their natural environments.  I would highly recommend the hot air balloon experience in the Serengeti which was pure magic!

Best time to visit Zimbabwe

Best time to visit Zimbabwe




Zimbabwe is located in a tropical zone but due to its high altitude, the climate remains temperate and comfortable all year, making it a suitable destination to visit all year round. May to October is the dry winter season and if wildlife watching, these months are perfect for easy viewing because animals flock to watering holes seemingly just for you. November to April is wetter and hotter but brings about a stunning, lush landscape that serves as a brilliant backdrop to photos.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Zimbabwe is home to a diverse range of cultures, with the predominant group being the Shona (of which most Zimbabweans belong). The ancient Shona tribal culture is rich in mythology and symbolism. Dance, song and crafts are prevalent in most African cultures but even more so in Zimbabwe where traditional soapstone carving, weaving, painting and beadwork are important features of Shona culture and folklore. The arrival of European settlers changed the face of Zimbabwe, with English cultural influences evident throughout contemporary Zimbabwe. Christianity is practiced by the majority of Zimbabweans, but ancestral worship and traditional beliefs endure, with many locals practicing animist rituals in tandem with church-attending.

Other British influences are evident, with sports like cricket and rugby having a following and the British custom of tea drinking common throughout the country. Even though most Zimbabweans live in poverty and have endured many struggles, generally they still have a huge amount of kindness to bestow upon visitors. Travellers can expect to receive warm hospitality from most locals, who have a humble and somewhat inspiring approach to life.








Eating and drinking

Eating and drinking



Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Travellers will be able to find a range of dining options in Zimbabwe, from international cuisine to local traditional fare.

Things to try in Zimbabwe

1. Nhedzi Soup

This wild mushroom soup is a national specialty and a good option for vegetarians in a country where game meat prevails in most restaurants and hotels.

2. Kapenta

This dried sardine-like fish is popular throughout Zimbabwe, where refrigeration isn’t available to all. Mainly sourced from Lake Kariba, visitors can order kapenta with a side of sadza (maize meal) in most restaurants.

3. Zambezi Beer

Zimbabwe’s national beer is locally brewed in Harare and widely available throughout most of the country. It's perfect for washing down lunch or dinner on a hot summer's day.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Zimbabwe is landlocked in southern Africa and bordered by
Zambia
,
Botswana
,
South Africa
,
Mozambique
and just meets the corner of
Namibia
. Although without access to the coast, Zimbabwe has access to water through the presence of the Zambezi and Limpopo river systems. The topography is a mixture of mountains and plateaus, which are home to wide range of flora and fauna. With grasslands and evergreen forests covering the land, Zimbabwe is home to a diverse variety of birds, mammals and plant species. With majestic mountains covered in emerald green forest, serene lakes and epic waterfalls, visitors will be treated to some of the most beautiful, unspoilt landscapes in the world while travelling through the countryside in Zimbabwe.








History and government

History and government




Early History

The land of Zimbabwe has been occupied since the 9th century, with tribes first emerging in the Limpopo Valley before starting to occupy the highlands. Zimbabwe's early society developed into a series of kingdoms which traded commodities such as gold and copper with other nations. The Great Zimbabwe ruins are a remnant of this illustrious time in Zimbabwean history and can be visited while travelling in the Masvingo area.

Portuguese settlers arrived in the 16th century, having a devastating effect on the empire. Trade was halted and a series of wars rendered the empire near collapse at the dawn of the 17th century. The British arrived in the late 19th century, by way of Cecil Rhodes' British South Africa Company, which lobbied to colonise the area and control the land (and precious minerals within). By 1898 the area of Zimbabwe was known as Southern Rhodesia (with modern day Zambia known as Northern Rhodesia). The Shona and Ndebele (along with other indigenous tribes) staged revolts against their colonisers, which were largely unsuccessful and lead to displacement, with land unfairly being allocated to European settlers, rather than local tribal people whose ancestors and families had lived there for centuries. In part, this issue of disproportionate allocation of land would return to haunt modern Zimbabwe many years later.

Recent History

Although controversial, colonial rule endured until Zimbabwe gained its independence in 1980, with Canaan Banana serving as the first President. In 1988, changes to the constitution enabled Robert Mugabe to become President. By the 1990s ethnic tensions, confrontation and political instability were changing the face of modern Zimbabwe. Zimbabweans had endured demonstrations, displacement, violence, drought, food shortages and forcible land removal. The unstable economy, wildly fluctuating currency value and drop in tourism revenue translated into widespread poverty for many Zimbabweans. With the highest inflation rate in the world, Zimbabwe still suffers economic difficulties mainly due to the collapse of the once-strong agriculture sector. Despite this, Zimbabwe's people are irrepressible, the landscapes are as beautiful as ever and tourists have begun to return to experience the natural wonders and exotic wildlife of this great land.








Top 10 Wild Animals of Zimbabwe

Top 10 Wild Animals of Zimbabwe




1. Sable Antelope

Zimbabwe’s national animal can be found grazing in herds in the woodlands and savanna of Zimbabwe. Lean, graceful and powerful, the sable antelope is considered one of the most magnificent antelope in the animal kingdom.

2. Lion

Prides of regal lions strut through Zimbabwe’s parks and reserves. Head on safari to find them stalking prey, at play or lazing in the sun – lion-spotting is one of world’s most sought after wildlife experiences for a reason, they are simply breathtaking to behold.

3. Hippopotamus

Hippos are a common sight while cruising on Lake Kariba. Watch them wallowing on the shores and lurking beneath the surface of the water. Although they look quite harmless, hippos are actually quite territorial and can get fierce, so don’t get too close.

4. African Wild Dog

Saved from the brink of extinction, the African wild dog is a recent conservation success story. While not completely out of the woods, population numbers have risen of late and if you’re lucky you’ll be able to encounter some of these highly intelligent canines while travelling in Zimbabwe.

5. Black Rhino

Sadly, black rhinos are on the critically endangered list due to poaching and loss of habitat. Zimbabwe still has pockets of these beautiful beasts and it’s possible to find them in reserves and protected areas.

6. White Rhino

Zimbabwe’s Matobo National Park is home to a significant population of rare white rhinos. Track them on foot with a local guide and be mesmerised at the sight of these enormous creatures quietly grazing in the protected valleys.

7. Crocodile

Keep your eyes peeled for these ancient reptiles that are expert at blending in with the scenery. Their menacing presence looms just under the water level – watch out for them while cruising Zimbabwe’s channels and rivers.

8. Kudu

This timid animal scares easily, so you’ll have to remain quiet if you hope to get close to one. With unique corkscrew-like horns, they are easy to spot but harder to capture on camera as they are great at making swift departures.

9. Elephant

Large groups of the mighty African elephant can be found wandering the terrain of Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park. Imposing and inspiring, elephants are one of the most beloved animals in the world – see why for yourself in Zimbabwe.

10. African Fish Eagle

The national bird of Zimbabwe is swift, nimble and majestic. Abundant near bodies of water, witnessing an African fish eagle swoop on the water and capture its prey is an unforgettable travel moment.








Shopping






×

Shopping



While Zimbabwe lacks glitzy malls and heaving retail precincts, there are plenty of markets, galleries and workshops full of handicrafts and handmade wonders. It's also a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Zimbabwe

1. Shona Stone Carvings

The Shona people have lived in Zimbabwe for thousands of years and have cultivated a rare talent in carving stone. Their craft is widely appreciated by the international art world, so support local artists by picking up a creative carving straight from the source.

2. Local Music

Zimbabwean music is lively, moving and steeped in history. Featuring drumming, marimba, mbira, singing and chanting – pick up a CD and bring the spirit of Zimbabwe home to share with friends.

3. Batik Fabric

Zimbabwe has an impressive array of batik, known as sadza cloth. Featuring wildlife and scenes of daily life, they make great bedspreads, wall hangings and tablecloths.

Please note: As of January 2016, the KAZA Visa for Zimbabwe and Zambia will be unavailable to purchase. Singular visas for Zimbabwe remain available on arrival at point of entries.







Is tipping customary in Zimbabwe?









Many Zimbabweans are struggling to make ends meet, so being generous by tipping service workers is a good idea. Generally, a minimum of US$1 should be put aside for porters, waiters, local guides and drivers. Rounding up the bill at restaurants and other establishments is common as small change is hard to come by.







What is the internet access like in Zimbabwe?









Internet cafes can be found in Zimbabwe's larger cities, however smaller towns and rural areas will have little to no access to the internet.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Zimbabwe?









Mobile phone coverage is generally good in Zimbabwe's cities and urban centres but less so in rural and remote areas. Ensure global roaming is activated before leaving home.







What are the toilets like in Zimbabwe?









Visitors can expect to encounter a wide range of toilets while in Zimbabwe. Western-style flushable toilets are available at many high-end hotels, bars, airports and tourist attractions while squat toilets are more common in rural areas and places frequented by locals. Be prepared by carrying your own toilet paper, soap or hand sanitiser, as these may not be provided.







What will it cost for a…?









Snack from street vendor = US$1
Espresso coffee in a cafe = US$1
Bottle of beer = US$3
Meal in a mid-range cafe or restaurant = US$10







Can I drink the water in Zimbabwe?









Tap water isn't safe for tourists to drink in Zimbabwe. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Ask your leader and accommodation provider for local advice on where drinking water can be accessed. Also, avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Zimbabwe?









Zimbabwe's currency and economy is classified as unstable. Credit cards are accepted by some tourist-driven establishments but are generally not a reliable option in Zimbabwe. Be prepared by carrying low denominations of US dollars and South African rand, as the Zimbabwean dollar is no longer an acceptable form of currency.







What is ATM access like in Zimbabwe?









ATMs can be found in Zimbabwe’s major cities but are less common in rural areas. Be prepared by carrying cash (US dollars and South African rand in small denominations).







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Zimbabwe?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment.

Be considerate of Zimbabwe’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.

Avoid purchasing ivory or other products harvested from endangered animals.
