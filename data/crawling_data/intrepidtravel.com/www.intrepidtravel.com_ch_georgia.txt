Georgia



Georgia’s mix of natural beauty, medieval history and Soviet influences has made it one of Eastern Europe’s most fascinating destinations.


Long hidden behind ‘the curtain’, it has emerged, butterfly-like on travellers’ maps. Boasting hilltop churches, meandering cobbled streets, mountainscapes and a wine region the French would envy, Georgia is sure to capture your imagination.

Best time to visit Georgia

Best time to visit Georgia




Spring and autumn are the best times to head to Georgia. Summers (especially July and August) can be very hot and humid with temperatures reaching up to 40 degrees Celsius. This is a great time to escape to the Black Sea or the mountains to cool off. Winters can be very cold, although the country rarely freezes over. Power supplies are frequently interrupted however so don’t rely on heating. This is a beautiful, fertile region so bring an umbrella and expect rain at anytime of year!








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Georgia’s spiky topography makes for stunning scenery. The Greater Caucasus Mountains crisscross the country, divvying it up into pockets of forests, valleys and glaciers. Its only coastline runs 330 km along the stunning Black Sea. Georgia’s neighbours include the Russian Federation,
Turkey
,
Armenia
and
Azerbaijan
.








Top 10 Georgian Gems

Top 10 Georgian Gems




1. Tbilisi

Set along a backdrop of hills and the Mtkvari River, Tbilisi is simply lovely. It’s been Georgia’s capital since the 5th century and the architecture tells the story of the city through the ages. There’s a fascinating mix of European, Byzantine, Middle Eastern and Soviet styles. Explore churches, winding alleys, parks and fortresses.

2. Kutaisi

One of the cradles of Georgian civilisation, Kutaisi is home to the immense Bagrati Cathedral. It may be in ruins but this 11th-century building still impresses from its hilltop.

3. Gori

Once an important strategic post in the Middle Ages, Gori is now better known as the birthplace of Stalin. Learn about his early years and how they shaped the man.

4. Uplistsikhe

Not far from Gori is one of the Caucasus’s oldest settlements. Dating back to the 5th century and the days of the Silk Road, Uplistsikhe has a 9th-century church, an ancient monastery and a 2nd-century Roman theatre to explore.

5. Chalato Glacier

Take the opportunity to hike to Chalato Glacier. Your efforts will be rewarded with stunning views of snow-covered peaks.

6. Homestay Hospitality

The Georgians are renowned for their hospitality. Be welcomed into a family home and get a taste of what it is to be Georgian. The houses may be simple but Georgian family life is rich.

7. Kazbegi

This nugget of a town may be distinctly Soviet in flavor but its setting is anything but dismal. Enjoy views out to Mt Kazbek and the hilltop Tsminda Sameba Church.

8. Telavi Wine Region

Whatever your favourite drop of wine, you’re sure to find a tipple to tickle your fancy here. Hundreds of varieties are grown and each village in the region has its own.

9. Shaumta Monasteries

One of the highlights of Telavi are the nearby monasteries. Dubbed the ‘old’ and ‘new’ monasteries, they’re nestled into woods among mountains. The old monastery dates back to the 5th century.

10. Batumi

Enjoy a beach break Georgian-style along the beautiful shores of the Black Sea. Take in views of rolling hills and holidaying locals as you sip on a Turkish coffee.

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
