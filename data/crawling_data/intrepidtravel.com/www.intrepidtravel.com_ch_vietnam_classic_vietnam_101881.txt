Is this trip right for you?

Classic Vietnam,
November 2017

Kathryn Mocatta

The Classic Vietnam  15 day tour was well organised, you get to experience the local way of life . Great activities like kayaking in Halong Bay ,bike riding through Hoi An and eating with a local family in their home. A highlight was the overnight cruize in Halong Bay pity it wasn't for two nights ! I would highly recommend this tour.
