Destinations

Africa

Namibia



Home to proud tribes steeped in tradition, herds of rare desert-dwelling elephants, wild horses and massive colonies of seals, Namibia showcases the very best of Africa's raw landscapes.


From quaint German-inspired towns to uninhabitable deserts, bushland filled with wildlife and a rocky coastline littered with shipwrecks, Namibia's untamed charm is compelling, captivating and camera-worthy.

Vic Falls to Cape Town,
November 2017

Karen Gregory

The trip was great but I did think that the office staff were not as efficient as they should have been. Be very careful to check all details of a booking and question any vague or ambiguous trip notes.

Review submitted 03 Dec 2017











Vic Falls to Cape Town,
November 2017

Sharon Lovison

AMAZING! That word was used after every activity, after every scenery change and literally after everything that we did.

When I met Victor and Dan for the fist time, all I noticed was their smile. Sometimes you don't need words when you meet people. Dan helped me with my luggage and found me a locker, after that I was now part of the family. 

From Day One, Victor, Dan and Henry were so kind, caring and made me and everyone feel at ease and so welcoming. It was refreshing to only meet someone for a few hours but then realise how comfortable they made you feel. 

We had such a wide range of ages on our trip, but that didn't stop anyone from not being friends. From the first night, everyone just clicked. 

Everyday was different and there was always something to see or do. Victor was very knowledgable and told us as much as he could at each place we went to. Especially on the safaris he was just as excited as we were when we saw a new animal. 

Henry's food on the trip was fantastic. I really didn't think we would get the type of food that we did. On the days that we were out and about and on our own, we often said "It's not as good as Henry's" I never went hungry and hats off to him to make all these different meals and satisfy 17 different people. 

This trip has been one of the best experiences of my life. So many memories. Victor, Dan and Henry made it the best trip possible for everyone and of course the other people on the trip too. I never imagined that I'd see all that I have. It exceeding my expectations way beyond belief.  I cannot recommend this trip to anyone enough, and if you're lucky to have these boys on your trip, then you are in for an amazing trip! There are too many words to describe this trip, just book it and see for yourself!

Transport in Namibia

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Namibia, you may find yourself travelling by:







Overland Vehicle

Travel through Namibia's vast deserts, rugged landscapes and rocky terrain on an overland truck custom-made for group travel.


Cape Town to Vic Falls

Canoe

Africa Experience

Accommodation in Namibia

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Namibia you may find yourself staying in a:







Guesthouse

Intrepid prefers smaller character-filled guesthouses to hotel chains. When staying in Namibia, enjoy staying in small guesthouses owned and run by friendly locals.

Best time to visit Namibia

Best time to visit Namibia




May to October is considered one of the best times to visit Namibia as the days are warm and sunny and the weather is generally dry. Namibian and South African school holidays are mid-December to mid-January, late April to early June and late August to mid-September, so expect Namibia to be busier during these times.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Red desert dunes, rugged bushveld, dense woodlands and plains of gravel make up Namibia's ancient terrain. Home to the monumental Fish River Canyon and sharing the iconic Kalahari Desert with
South Africa
and
Botswana
, Namibia has some of the most interesting landscapes in
Africa
, if not the world. With little arable land and a warm climate, Namibia is prone to prolonged periods of drought, making farming difficult. Bordered by Angola, Botswana, South Africa and
Zambia
, Namibia also has a stretch of coastline along the Atlantic Ocean where visitors can see where the desert meets the sea.








Top 5 Awe-Inspiring Views in Namibia






×

Top 5 Awe-Inspiring Views in Namibia




1. Colossal Canyon

There's more to the Fish River Canyon than its sheer size. With remote hiking trails, magnificent view points and raging river torrents during the rainy season, visitors will be breathless at the epic views and sense of isolation when visiting this canyon, believed to have been formed more than 500 million years ago.

2. Damaralandscape

The timeworn terrain of Damaraland makes for interesting, otherworldly landscapes to travel through. The combination of strange rock formations, parched valleys, ochre boulders and amber sunsets makes for magic memories.

3. Sossusvlei Sands

This huge clay pan wrapped in red sand dunes occupies a large part of southern Namibia. With some of the tallest dunes in the world, Sossusvlei's variety of colour, size and flora make it a glory to behold.

4. Cape Cross Critters

This protected area on the cape of the southern Atlantic is most famous for its resident seal colony, one of the largest in the world. Witnessing thousands of Cape Fur Seals basking in the sun is a life affirming sight not to be missed when in this part of the world.

5. Ship to Shore

Namibia's Skeleton Coast has been called 'The Land God Made in Anger' by the San Bushmen and 'The Gates of Hell' by the Portuguese, and it's not hard to see why. With gale force winds battering the shore, rolling surf and thick fog, the Skeleton Coast has ruined many a mariner over the years. Evidence of this is scattered along the coastal sands, with a collection of rusting ships resting on the beaches - an eerie yet enthralling sight.

Germany: No visa required
Ireland: No visa required
Netherlands: No visa required
New Zealand: No visa required
South Africa: No visa required

Please check with the relevant visa office before departure to make sure there has been no change.







Is tipping customary in Namibia?









While not mandatory, a tip of 10% is considered standard when dining in Namibia. With the typical Namibian earning a modest wage, a small tip to porters, housemaids and other service workers would be appreciated.







What is the internet access like in Namibia?









Travellers will be able to access the internet quite easily in the cyber cafes of Namibia’s large cities, but limited to no access should be expected in regional and rural areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Namibia?









Mobile phone coverage is good in Namibia's large cities and towns, but less so in rural and mountainous areas. Ensure you have global roaming activated before leaving home if you wish to use your mobile phone.







What are the toilets like in Namibia?









Depending on which areas of Namibia you are travelling in, expect to encounter a combination of squat toilets and flushable toilets. Carry your own supply of soap and toilet paper as these aren't always provided.







What will it cost for a…?









1 hour in a cyber cafe = 8-10 NAD
A bottle of local beer = 15 NAD
Budget lunch = 36 NAD
Sit-down dinner in a nice restaurant = 100 NAD







Can I drink the water in Namibia?









While tap water is considered safe in Namibia's cities, drinking tap water isn't generally recommended in Namibia. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead. Ask your leader where filtered water can be found; some hotels we stay in may have drinking water available. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Namibia?









Credit cards are usually accepted by large hotels and western-style restaurants but not by smaller vendors. Ensure you have adequate cash to cover purchases not able to be made on credit.







What is ATM access like in Namibia?









ATMs are easily found in large cities and urban centres, but are rarer in small towns, rural areas and villages. Be sure to have other payment methods available when venturing out of the big cities, as ATMs aren't always an option.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Namibia?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Namibia

1. Be considerate of Namibia’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

3. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

4. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

5. When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

6. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

7. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

8. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

9. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

10. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
