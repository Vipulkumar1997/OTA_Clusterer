Walking & Trekking holidays

Walking & trekking




Each journey may begin with a single step, but some require a few more steps than others. These are our walking and trekking trips. Here’s the idea: we provide you with expert trail guides, accommodation and porters (where necessary); you bring your legs and a sense of adventure. From the frosted peak of Kilimanjaro and Patagonia’s windswept trails to a more sedate stroll through the rice fields of Vietnam, there’s a calf-stretching trip to suit every level of fitness and expertise. All you have to do is put one foot in front of the other.


Walking vs trekking

Walking

If conquering mountain peaks and fighting the elements sounds a tad extreme for what is, essentially, a holiday – never fear. We’ve got a range of walking trips designed to stretch the legs without making them feel like they’re about to fall off. Hike the grasslands of northern Thailand, wander through rice paddies in Mai Chau or amble along Turkey’s famous Lycian Way. It’s a simple recipe: fresh air, the wild outdoors and not a basecamp in sight.

Trekking

When does a walk become a trek? Probably somewhere between your first yak sighting and that moment when you realise all this mist is made of clouds. Our trekking trips cover some of the most famous routes on the planet – Kilimanjaro, Annapurna, Basecamp, the Inca Trail – but that doesn’t put them out of reach for the eager novice. All you need is a sturdy pair of boots, a bit of pre-trip training and the best guides in the business. That’s where we come in.

Essential info





Hiking without the hassle









On all of our hikes, your accommodation is pre-booked and your luggage is transferred from one point to the next. All you have to carry is a daypack that contains water, any snacks or gadgets you may want and a few layers to keep you dry and warm. This means you get to enjoy the best of hiking without any of the hassles.







Guided vs Self-guided









We offer an extensive range of both small group and self-guided walking itineraries all over the world that cover everything from one-day hikes through to itineraries spanning 37 days. Armed with route notes and maps, self-guided walks allow you to explore at your own pace and are perfect for those wanting more independence. Or, if you want to concentrate more on the scenery, join a small group and explore with new friends. All your accommodation will be pre-booked, and your main luggage will be transferred between properties – so all you have to do is strap on your daypack and enjoy the walk!







Fitness









We have walks ranging from relatively easy to rather challenging. But no matter what degree of difficulty or distance you choose to walk, we recommend that you have a reasonable level of fitness to ensure that you get the most out of your walk or hike. Try to commit to some type of physical training program around six weeks before you depart. Here are some suggestions: Long walks: go on some long walks of 3-6 hours duration before you leave, wearing the boots you’re taking and carrying a small backpack to get comfortable with carrying your gear for long stretches. Aerobic exercise: running, distance cycling and the various aerobic classes offered at gyms (like pump, spin, zumba and circuit classes) all help to give you fitness and stamina. Strength training: doing body weight training like pushups, squats, dips, lunges, etc. helps to build up your muscle strength, which is needed for the steady climb up a mountain if you’re embarking on this type of hike (bootcamp sessions are perfect for this type of training).







Gear









You’ll need a comfortable daypack to walk with during the day and another piece of luggage (preferably not too large) for the rest of your gear to be transported or carried by porters or Sherpa (this depends on the walking trip you choose). Sturdy, good quality and well-fitted hiking shoes will make the difference between a great trip and terrible time – make sure you break them in before you go to minimise blisters. For some tips and ideas about what to take, check out Intrepid’s Ultimate Packing List – you won’t need half of what’s mentioned but things like wet-weather gear, a hat, layers of clothing, head torch, bandaids for blisters, water bottle and sunscreen are essential.







Altitude sickness









On some of our hikes you will encounter high altitudes. When climbing above 2,800 metres (9,200 feet), it is common for travellers to experience some adverse health effects due to the altitude, regardless of your age, gender and fitness. It even happened to Sir Edmund Hillary!

There’s no real way to tell how your body will react to the rigours of altitude trekking, so it is important that you monitor your condition and discuss any prevailing symptoms with your guide. If you have any pre-existing conditions that could be exacerbated by high altitudes, be sure to get them checked out by a doctor before you leave.

But above all, try not to worry, most of our travellers shake off the effects of altitude pretty quickly and enjoy a safe and rewarding trek.

I am happy that I chose to travel to Peru with Intrepid!  I felt very safe the entire time and enjoyed all of the activities.

We took the train option and we were very happy with the experience. Our experience with the local culture and customs was insightful and everything we hoped for.

Everest Base Camp,
November 2017

richard pfeffer

Everest Base Camp was a challenging and tough trek to unique part of the world....the experienced local guides made the journey in reach of everybody within the group. Aside from putting on our boots and "stuffing" our sleeping bags, there was not too much else to worry about.

Intrepid took care of us and were efficient, on time and always friendly. Our guides Norma, Christian and Katie were great company and had lots of knowledge for us to draw on.
