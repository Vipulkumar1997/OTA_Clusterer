Athens to Santorini,
September 2017

Karen & Nicole Crossley

On this trip you can do as little or as much as you want - a very relaxing trip with some added inclusions to inspire you.  Lots to see and plenty of time to explore on your own. Beautiful scenery with many hidden gems along the many stone paths.

Transport in Greece

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Greece, you may find yourself travelling by:







Bus

Live like a local resident by hopping on a local bus. Cheap, efficient and fast, it’s a great way to get around Greece’s busy cities.











Ferry

Take in awesome views of the blue-green Aegean as you hop between Greece’s famed islands aboard a ferry.

Best time to visit Greece






×

Best time to visit Greece




Greece generally has a mild, Mediterranean climate, with July and August being the busiest months for tourism. With warm weather and plentiful sunshine, this is a great time for visiting the islands, swimming in the sea and lazing on the beach. Summers are generally hot and dry, with daytime temperatures rising to 30°-38°C (85°-100°F). Days are usually cooled by prevailing north winds, especially on the islands.

By mid-September, temperatures begin to fall and crowds thin, but it can still be hot. The weather remains generally calm and balmy well into October. If you can't get to Greece in the spring, and beaches are not your primary goal, this is a fine time to visit. By late October, ferry service and flights are cutting back and most facilities on the islands begin to close for the winter. But the cooler atmosphere makes Athens and the mainland all the more pleasant.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




The origins of Greece’s current culture lie in its ancient heart. Greece is the celebrated birthplace of some of the world’s most famous art, architecture, language, dance, literature and culinary traditions. The hallmarks of Western medicine, philosophy, drama and government can all be attributed to the mighty ancient Greek civilisation.

With more than 90% of the population being Greek Orthodox, religion plays an important part in everyday life. Religious festivals and ceremonies are commonplace, both in the mainland cities and small rural villages. Christmas and Easter are particularly important dates on the calendar, although religious celebrations are not limited to these times as there are daily, weekly and annual rites and rituals performed all throughout Greece’s mainland and islands.

Family plays a strong part in Greek life, with extended families tending to remain close and gathering together for meals and celebrations. Special foods are created at different times of the year, some of which date back to centuries ago. Weddings are typically large affairs and usually celebrated with much merriment and fanfare. To be Greek is to be proud of your country, your heritage and your traditions.








Eating and drinking

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Visitors to Greece will be spoilt with the very best of fresh produce and ancient cooking traditions.

Things to try in Greece

1. Olives and Olive Oil

No trip to Greece is complete without savouring olives and their legendary oil. Greeks cook with copious amounts of olive oil and also serve it on the side with bread. Fresh green and black olives can be found everywhere – in markets, cafes, restaurants, supermarkets, and in people’s homes.

2. Yaurti (Yoghurt)

Thick, smooth and rich, the yoghurt in Greece is unlike other yoghurts around the world. Grab a bowl of it smothered in honey and nuts for breakfast, lunch or a snack.

3. Feta

The national cheese of Greece should definitely be sampled in its native environment. You’ll find this salty treat in fresh salads, baked into pies, stuffed into fish and fried and served with bread.

4. Ouzo

This strong, distilled spirit has a distinct aniseed flavour and is perfect for cleansing the palette before meals. Sip on some while visiting an ouzeri for an authentic Greek experience.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Sharing land borders with
Albania
,
Bulgaria
,
Turkey
and
Macedonia
, Greece is located in Southern Europe and is surrounded by the Ionian, Mediterranean and Aegean Sea. Consisting of the mainland peninsula and an archipelago of more than 3,000 islands, Greece is typically mountainous, containing peaks, karsts and canyons all over. Despite the mountainous topography, there is much arable land on Greece with small-scale farms successfully producing olives, peaches, melons, grapes, tomatoes and grain for export and local use.








History and government

History and government




Early History

The early history of Greece is among the world’s most fascinating, and like the other ancient civilisations of Egypt and Rome, Greece has many monuments still standing after centuries. The Greeks have been both the conquerors and the conquered, withstood the Plague and other natural disasters, and birthed some of the greatest literature, scientific developments, mathematical formulas and thought movements.

Recent History

In 1821, the Greeks fought against Ottoman rule during the Greek War of Independence, which resulted in Greece being recognised as an autonomous region in 1828. This was a time of great upheaval for the Greek people, with political assassinations, battles and plundering. After autonomy was granted, many years of change followed, with continued war and confrontation alongside intermittent periods of relative peace. The two World Wars had a profound effect on Greece, with many battles fought in Greece during the early 1940s (during the Axis occupation). Athens was liberated from this occupation in 1944 and the Greek government was restored. Greece joined the United Nations (as a founding member) in 1945 and NATO in 1952. During this time, many Greeks started moving to other parts of the world in a mass wave of widespread migration. The
USA
,
Australia
and
Europe
were popular destinations in this move, which saw hundreds of thousands of Greeks immigrate to other lands. In 2004, Athens successfully hosted the Summer Olympics once again. Yet more recently, Greece has come under the shadow of the European debt crisis which has crippled the economy. Despite this, the spirit of the Greek people endures as it has for eons.








Must-Eat Dishes of Greece

Must-Eat Dishes of Greece




Top 10 Must-Eat Dishes of Greece

1. Dolmades with Yoghurt

Probably one of Greece’s most famous culinary triumphs these vine leaves stuffed with rice, pine nuts and herbs are usually served with fresh, tangy yoghurt and due to their supreme ‘eatability’ don’t last long.

2. Grilled Octopus

The Greek Islands are arguably the best place in the world to savour char grilled octopus. Nothing beats freshly caught seafood, teemed with a cool beer and a golden sunset.

3. Horiatiki Salata

Known as Greek Salad in the English-speaking world, the combination of olives, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes, feta, olive oil and oregano shows that the simple flavours are often the best.

4. Mezedes

These small plates of vegetables, cheese, olives, dips and peppers are typically served before meals and are a perfect, light starter to a meal.

5. Fried Calamari

Known as Kalamarakia Tiganita to Greeks, this quick and simple deep fried delicacy is best served simple – with a slice of lemon and an amazing view!

6. Kleftiko

This slow-baked lamb dish features the mouth-watering flavours of garlic and lemon. The cooking method ensures that the meat falls off the bone to create a tender masterpiece.

7. Moussaka

This classic Greek dish of layered eggplant, spiced meat and creamy sauce is delicious, decadent and delectable.

8. Loukoumades

Sweet tooths shouldn’t miss these deep fried doughy treats! Soaked in a sugary syrup or honey and cinnamon, they are small but simply sensational.

9. Spanakopita

A favourite with vegetarians, this dish of layered filo pastry, feta cheese and spinach is filling and flavoursome.

10. Yiros

For a cheap and tasty meal, head to a yiros cart to choose from tender, grilled beef, chicken, lamb or pork yiros. This popular hangover cure consists of oily meat, wrapped in bread with salad and tzadziki and could possibly be one of the best examples of fast food in the world.








Shopping

Shopping




From public markets and designer boutiques to European chain stores, Greece has every aspect of retail cornered.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country.
Australia
and
New Zealand
generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Greece

1. Komboloi (Worry Beads)

These stress-relieving resin beads are meant to be turned through your fingers as you muse over life. With roots deep in ancient Greek cultural tradition, they make a great souvenir for friends wanting a slice of authentic Greece.

2. Botanical Skincare

Greece is home to many brands of premium, organic skincare. Stock up on luxurious olive oil soap or enriching yoghurt-based moisturisers before you head home.

3. Mati

Travel safely and ward off evil by attaching a Mati (an ‘Evil Eye’) to your backpack. They’re cheap, available almost everywhere in Greece and are a great reminder of your travels in the Aegean.

4. Jewellery

Whether you prefer gold, silver, amber resin or colourful beads, Greece has a huge variety of jewellery on offer. Prices are typically lower than in many other parts of the world, so it’s likely you’ll be able to snap up a few bargains.








Festivals and Events in Greece

Festivals and Events in Greece




Epiphany

If you find yourself in Greece during this time, you’ll feel ‘blessed’. Each year, Athens’ ancient port of Piraeus sees this religious day celebrated in an extraordinary way. A local priest flings a crucifix into the sea and young men dive into the cold water to retrieve it. This ritual is echoed throughout Greece in small villages and on islands. This special ceremony is performed for locals, by locals, but tourists are welcome to watch and learn.

Athens Festival

This annual feast of Aegean culture features visuals arts, music, dance and theatre performances take place in both the ancient and modern performance venues of Athens. Don’t miss getting along to one of the performances if you’re travelling in Greece during this time.

Epidaurus Festival

This festival offers the chance to experience the classics of Greek drama being performed in their original setting - an ancient theatre. With performances being held every Friday and Saturday night during the festival, there are plenty of opportunities to see Greek tragedies as originally intended.
