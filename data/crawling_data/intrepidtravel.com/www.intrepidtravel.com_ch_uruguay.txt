Uruguay tours & travel

Destinations

South America

Uruguay



Uruguay is like the cool, unaffected half-sister of Brazil and Argentina.


It may not be as shiny or make as much noise, but with over 300 km of superb coastline, a rich, fertile interior and some of the most welcoming faces in the region, this little stunner is fast becoming a superior destination in its own right. Strolling around Montevideo you could be forgiven for thinking you’d actually dropped into the heart of
Europe
. Uruguay’s mellow capital is regularly preceded by the adjectives ‘cosmopolitan’ and ‘lively’ - which it is - but what you'll also find is an eclectic and diverse city, teeming with infectious hospitality. Venture inland and you’ll discover working gaucho farms, charming agricultural centres and an intoxicating pace; or perhaps follow the crowds to some of the best beaches and surf towns in
South America
.

Best time to visit Uruguay

Best time to visit Uruguay




Given its humid sub-tropical climate, Uruguay is suitable to visit virtually all year round, although warm coats are needed in the winter months (June-August) when the temperature drops to an average of 10 degrees C. From there, the crowds rise in accordance with the mercury. And by the peak of summer (January), the coastline teems with tourists and holidaymakers, meaning a little more planning can be needed to ensure prime accommodation. Don’t be discouraged by peak season though - there are plenty of remote surf breaks and relaxed coastal towns in which to wile away the summer, and there’s always the option to head inland for a taste of fresh air and the country life!








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment



Flanked in equal measure by
Argentina
,
Brazil
and the Atlantic, Uruguay is the second smallest nation in South America, with a staggering 50% of the population living in the capital. The temperature is mild, with summer highs in January tipping 30 degrees C, while the July winter temperature dips as low as 6 degrees C. The landscape is predominantly rolling grasslands, small but fertile hills and an abundant coastline. Rainfall is modest and evenly spread through the year, however the absence of large wind-blocking mountains means Uruguay can be prone to high winds.








Top 5 Beaches in Uruguay

Top 5 Beaches in Uruguay



1. Punta del Este

As Uruguay's answer to the French Riviera's St Tropez, Punta del Este may be a little too glitzy or hectic for some - particularly in summer - but away from the hustle and bustle zone, there are miles of sublime beaches that stretch out either side of the city, plus several discount accommodation options tucked neatly away in other parts of town.

2. Punta del Diablo

Having drawn in droves of travellers for the past few years, Punta del Diablo can no longer claim to be a quieter option that its southern counterpart. But despite its growing popularly, this is easily one of the best beachside locales in Uruguay and well worth the trip north.

3. Cabo Polonio

Sitting on the east coast of Uruguay, this remote location can only be accessed on foot or by 4x4 across the sand dunes. With no electricity or running water, locals (to the tune of 75 people) use generators and collect rain water, making it the perfect place for a little escapism.

4. La Pedrera

A popular haunt for backpackers and Uruguayans, La Pedrera is characteristic of the small, idyllic beach towns north of Punta del Este. Here, it's still possible to find a sparsely populated stretch of white sand and top-notch surf breaks.

5. Piriapolis

With the enviable backdrop of one of Uruguay’s few mountains, Sugar Loaf, Piriapolis boasts a stack of great beaches plus a waterfront boardwalk and busy marina.

Is tipping customary in Uruguay?









It's customary to add 10% to restaurant bills (if this hasn’t already been included). Tipping elsewhere is optional, but leaving spare change at small cafes is a good idea as most Uruguayans typically earn little.







What is the internet access like in Uruguay?









Travellers should be able to access the internet at cyber cafes and Wi-Fi hot spots in Uruguay's major cities and towns. Remote and rural areas will have less internet availability, so be prepared for this when travelling out of the city.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Uruguay?









Using your mobile phone while in the cities of Uruguay shouldn’t be problematic. Coverage may be less reliable in remote areas. Ensure you have global roaming enabled before leaving your home country if you wish to use your mobile.







What are the toilets like in Uruguay?









Western-style, flushable toilets are the standard in Uruguay, although it’s a good idea to carry your own toilet paper and soap as these aren’t always provided.







What will it cost for a…?









Cup of coffee in a cafe = 40-60 UYU
Beer in a bar or restaurant = 40-60 UYU
Basic, takeaway lunch = 80-100 UYU
Dinner in an inexpensive restaurant = 180-220 UYU







Can I drink the water in Uruguay?









Tap water is considered safe to drink unless otherwise marked but outside of major cities and towns boiled water is recommended. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water; ask your leader where filtered water can be found. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Uruguay?









Major credit cards are accepted by most large shops and hotels. Smaller vendors may not accept credit cards, so carry enough cash to cover small purchases.







What is ATM access like in Uruguay?









ATMs are commonly found in Uruguay's cities and urban areas. Remote regions will have less ATM availability, so prepare accordingly before travelling away from cities.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Uruguay?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.
