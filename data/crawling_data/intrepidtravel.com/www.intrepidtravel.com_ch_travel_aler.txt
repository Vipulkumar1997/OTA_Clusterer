The safety of our passengers, leaders and operators is a major priority of Intrepid.

Read Intrepid’s Safety Policy

With this in mind, we monitor world events very closely. Intrepid makes operations decisions based on informed advice from a number of sources.

1. The Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade (DFAT)

For any Intrepid-operated trip, if DFAT’s advisory is at ‘Do Not Travel’ then Intrepid will either cancel the trip or reroute the itinerary to avoid the areas concerned.

Australia

2. Staff on the ground

With over 400 leaders on the ground in operational destinations and subsidiary companies in our main hub cities, Intrepid has access to an up-to-the-minute flow of information regarding the mood and feeling within the countries we work in. We are also in regular contact with the various operators we use. Their in-depth knowledge and understanding of their various areas is vital.

3. Other

advisories

Most countries’ governments provide their own travel advice. See below for links to some of the larger ones:

Election unrest, Honduras, 2017-12-04











Following elections in Honduras on 26 November 2017, violent demonstrations have occurred throughout the country resulting in casualties. On 1 December 2017, the Honduran Federal Government suspended constitutional rights, imposed a curfew from 6 pm to 6 am for the next ten calendar days, and closed many main roads.

In our range of tours, we only visit one city in Honduras called Copan, which is only 30 minutes’ drive from the border with Guatemala. This city remains unaffected by the political unrest. There has been no protests or violence in this area and being a largely touristic destination, it is functioning as normal.

We will continue to monitor the situation through our local partners in Honduras along with government foreign travel advisories. At this stage, all of our trips will continue to run as scheduled. Any minor changes to itineraries will be managed on the ground by our operations team as explained below. If you have any questions please contact you’re booking agent.







Mt Agung, Bali - Indonesia 2017- 11 - 30









Mount Agung, an active volcano in Karangasem Regency in East Bali, has emitted ash from eruptions since 21 November 2017. All groups currently in Bali & Lombok are safe and we are monitoring reports of falling ash in areas that we visit including Candidasa, Padang Bai Ferry Terminal, Sideman, Senaru and Gili Islands. We are in regular contact with local authorities, leaders and suppliers on the ground and have contingency plans in place should the ash fall worsen. Current itineraries operating through Bali and Lombok may be amended to avoid any ash fall. We do not travel inside of the current evacuation zone.

UPDATED 30th of November 2017

Flying conditions at Denpasar's Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS) are predicted to clear on Thursday 30 November for a period of time, so many airlines are planning to operate scheduled services from Bali, However many airlines have not resumed their flights into Denpasar airport at this stage. Volcanic activity and ash cloud are unpredictable and flights may be cancelled at short notice. We encourage anyone preparing to travel to Indonesia to check with their airlines regarding the status of their flights and their booking agent regarding the status of their upcoming trip. Any travellers currently in Indonesia and affected by cancelled flights should contact their travel insurance provider for assistance or advice.

CANCELLED TRIPS

A change in wind direction has now meant that much of Eastern Bali, including Candidasa, Mt Batur and Sideman is currently experiencing ash fall. Due to the current situation and the uncertainty surrounding continuing eruptions we have made the decision to cancel the below trips. We are in the process of contacting all passengers affected by these cancellations.

We are reviewing the situation on a regular basis and will post further updates as required.







Potential Political Violence, Harare, Zimbabwe, 2017-11-17









Due to recent political changes there is a heightened security presence in Harare, Zimbabwe, including armoured vehicles and increased military activity. We currently have no groups travelling through Harare and will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks prior to the next trip scheduled to travel through the area.

At this stage trips travelling through Victoria Falls, Hwange National Park and Bulawayo will continue to run as scheduled.

Please contact your booking agent if you have any specific questions about an upcoming trip.







Plague, Madagascar, 2017-10-27









Madagascar is experiencing a new plague outbreak which has been ongoing since August 2017.
Plague is endemic in Madagascar and cases have been reported nearly every year since 1980, between the months of September and April.

Two forms of plague are present in Madagascar: the bubonic plague and the pneumonic plague. The first one is transmitted from animals to human beings via flea bites. The second one is transmitted from person to person by inhaling infectious droplets. In both cases, the illness can be cured with standard antibiotics, available in the country.

WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar based on the available information.
It recommends travellers take some basic precautions which our outlined on their website: http://www.who.int/csr/don/02-october-2017-plague-madagascar/en/

The Australian Government’s level of travel advice for Madagascar has not changed. Similarly they recommend that travellers
practice good hygiene and speak to their health provider before travelling.

Based on this advice Intepid will not be cancelling any of our departures. We will however be suspending any city center market visits in Antananarivo, and Tamatave. In addition we recommend travellers have their meals in tourist hotels and restaurants where the sanitary conditions are strictly controlled.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely via our local operations team, and government advice. Should there be any changes we will update this page.







Rakhine State, Myanmar, 2017-09-11









Due to attacks in northern Rakhine State, and increased tensions in Rakhine State overall, many travel advisories warn against travel to this area specifically.

No Intrepid tours visit or travel near Rakhine State. We continue to monitor the situation through official travel advisories and our local operations team. If there should be any changes to the situation you will be advised immediately.  We recommend that you check your Government's advice for their latest travel information.







Northeast Asia (China, Japan, North & South Korea), 2017-9-5









There has been much media attention on the Korean peninsula following a series of North Korean missile tests in 2016 and 2017, including a recent nuclear test on 3rd September 2017. All Intrepid Travel trips in north east Asia, including Japan, South Korea and China are continuing to operate as normal and in accordance with our safety and risk procedures. We are working closely with local embassies and government authorities, including Australian Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade (DFAT) to monitor and react to any changes in their current travel advice for this region.
