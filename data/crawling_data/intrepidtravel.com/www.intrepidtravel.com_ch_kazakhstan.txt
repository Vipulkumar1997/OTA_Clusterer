Kazakhstan



Kazakhstan is the world’s ninth biggest country, and it’s got a lot more going for it than oil and Borat.


Thanks to natural resources (and sheer size) Kazakhstan is probably the best developed of the –stans. You’re more likely to get a good coffee on the leafy avenues of Almaty than anywhere else on the Asian steppe, and the country’s capital, Asatana, is a 21st-century showcase of modern architecture and futuristic design. Not what you’d expect from a country where the horse and cart is still a pretty big deal. Whatever your expectations are, leave them in the arrivals lounge. Kazakhstan defies them all.

Best time to visit Kazakhstan






×

Best time to visit Kazakhstan




Kazakhstan has a continental climate, which lends itself to extreme temperatures. In summer (June to August) it can climb above 36 degrees C (96°F) and in winter (December to February) you can expect temperatures to be as low as -26 degrees C (-10°F). Snow stays on the ground for almost half the year. The best time to travel is during spring (May to June) and autumn (September to November) when temperatures are mild. While it can rain at any time of year, the amount varies across the country. In the desert you’ll get very little, while in the mountains it’s best not to leave home without a rain jacket... and perhaps a small boat.








Top 5 Tastes of Kazakhstan

Top 5 Tastes of Kazakhstan




Top 5 Tastes of Kazakhstan

1. Beshbarmak

This is Kazakhstan’s national dish and a meat lover’s delight. Chunks of boiled mutton served on flat squares of pasta.

2. Kazy

Get ready for sausage, Kazakh-style. Made with horsemeat, the sausage is cooked for two hours before being served with generous servings of onion.

3. Qymyz

Wash down your main course with a glass of fermented mare’s milk. It’s mildly alcoholic and has a fizzy sensation. Shubat is another version made with camel’s milk.

4. Baursaki

Try these fried, doughy balls of goodness alongside soup.

5. Shay

Make new friends wherever you go by sitting down and sharing a cup of shay. This black or green tea is a Kazakh staple.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Kazakhstan

Be considerate of Kazakhstan’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully.

Smoking is banned in public places.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
