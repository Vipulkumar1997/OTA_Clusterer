Meet our expedition leaders










David Wood

Woody’s love of the ocean and the wild places at the extremes of the planet has resulted in a life at sea, in both the northern or southern hemispheres, for the past ten years. He is passionate about the landscapes, ice, wildlife and history of these special places and delights in sharing his interests with passengers.










David "Dutch" Wilmott

A veteran of both the Antarctic and Arctic, Dutch is an unashamed polar addict. Having studied geography and environmental science at university and sailed the North West and Drake passages innumerable times, his knowledge and extreme enthusiasm for the landscapes and wildlife of each pole is infectious.

Optional activities










Camping in Antarctica

Spend a night out on the Antarctic ice.  It may be cold, but we’ll provide all the gear you need to have an unforgettable experience.  On each trip, camping is limited to 30 passengers, so book early.










Mountaineering in Antarctica

If you’re up for a real challenge, spend a day with crampons and ice axes climbing ice, unnamed mountains in Antarctica.  Needless to say, passengers choosing this option must have exceptional fitness and the mental stamina to climb for long periods, as adventures can last up to 10 hours.












Sea kayaking in Antarctica and the Arctic

Up to 16 people on each voyage have the chance to paddle out on the icy waters in a sea kayak at each stop.  Kayaks, paddles, lifejackets and drysuits are provided, as well as the guidance of a qualified kayaking instructor.  For your safety, some kayaking experience is required.
















Snowshoeing in the Arctic

Strap on some lightweight snowshoes and explore remote alcoves and hidden valleys.  This clever mode of transport spreads your weight more evenly across a larger area, allowing you to navigate your way across the deep Arctic snow to places inaccessible in regular boots.

Antarctic Peninsula, Falkland Islands & South Georgia: From Buenos Aires (Ocean Endeavour) 2015 - 2017,
November 2016

Glynis Grey

This 3 week trip to the Falklands, South Georgia and Antarctica was fantastic, we saw so much wildlife and experienced so many places.  The expedition team are passionate about what they do and ensuring you have the trip of a life time. It has been a life changing experience.  The trip went far beyond my expectations.

Antarctic Peninsula, Falkland Islands & South Georgia: From Buenos Aires (Ocean Endeavour) 2015 - 2017,
November 2016

Glynis Kay Grey

I thoroughly enjoyed my trip and had a great experience discovering lots of new places and experiences that I do not think I would not have managed on my own in the same time scale and budget.

Crossing the Circle: From Buenos Aires (Ocean Endeavour) 2015 - 2017,
January 2016

Jo Kemper

Fantastic trip, well worth the hefty price. Quark does an excellent job. Guides and staff are stellar. They go above and beyond to make your Antarctic Peninsula wishlist sightings come true. I wish there was a bare bones option for a ship with basic lodging and food, but I have to admit that the cushy environment and fantastic meals were pretty welcome after a busy day of playing out in the wilds of Antarctica!
