Peru tours & travel













Home

Destinations

South America

Peru



Full of mystery and culture dating back millennia, Peru is an indomitable land of deserts etched with enigmatic lines, Amazonian rainforests teeming with wildlife, and soaring mountains harbouring secret cities.


While many travellers come to visit the country’s most famous site, the ruins of
Machu Picchu
, the real Peru lies within its warm, proud inhabitants – many of whom can trace their bloodlines back to the Incas. Whether you’re exploring the cobbled streets of Arequipa, bobbing on the floating islands of Lake Titicaca or uncovering mummies in Nazca, our Peru tours will have you feeling like a modern-day Indiana Jones. Just don’t forget to pack your fedora.

Transport in Peru

Bicycle

Cruise along the coast while pedalling a bike through the colourful neighbourhoods of Lima











Canoe

Spot exotic flowers, birds and mammals while enjoying a canoe ride down the mighty Amazon


Inca Trail & Amazon

Peru Encompassed

Sacred Land of the Incas










Train

Everyone gets a window seat while riding on the Vistadome train - the clear roof and windows allow maximum viewing for all.

Best time to visit Peru

Best time to visit Peru




Peru is a fascinating country with four distinct geographical regions. Not many countries can offer beaches, mountains, rainforests and deserts on one visit. These distinct regions offer something for everyone - that's why most Intrepid tours operate all year round. June, July and August are considered the driest months in the highlands and Amazon basin and are optimal for hiking and river journeys. However, even during the rainy season in the Amazon, the rains only fall for a few hours at a time. In the Andes, the rainy season can sometimes just mean a bit of overcast weather. The advantage to travelling in these areas at this time is that many other travellers make the mistake of postponing their plans until the dry season, leaving you with more of Peru to yourself. The best time to visit the infamous Nazca Lines or the coastal areas is from December to April, although the other months of the year are perfectly good times to visit also. Remember that the Inca Trail is closed for cleaning during February, although there are other treks to Machu Picchu which are available at this time.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Like many other South American nations, contemporary Peru is a rich mix of the modern and the ancient. The population is made up of Quechuans, Peruvians of Spanish descent and small groups of people from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean nations. With a long history of migration, many Peruvians may identify with several ethnic groups. While city dwellers tend to live modern lives, the Quechua communities of Peru have lived in the Andes for hundreds of years and live more of a traditional village-based lifestyle that revolves around markets and agriculture. While visiting Quechuan communities, travellers will be able to observe a markedly different way of life - with locals speaking a different language and wearing traditional clothing that isn't often seen in Peru's large cities. While the official religion is Christianity, some people still practice traditional rituals and customs alongside Christian beliefs. Indigenous celebrations and festivals offer fascinating insights into the ancient customs of Peru that have been carried into contemporary society from Inca times, with centuries-old food, clothing, song and dance playing an integral role in these celebrations.








Eating and drinking

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Food in Peru tends to be hot and spicy, and while meat features quite heavily on the menu, vegetarian options aren't too hard to come by considering potatoes and avocados are in abundance. If you want to know about South American food in general, we have all the info you need over

Things to try in Peru

1. Papas Rellenas

This popular street food consists of baked potato stuffed with beef, onion and spices. The perfect budget backpacker snack.

2. Choclo con Queso

How can something as simple as corn on the cob with cheese be so tasty? This street food triumph is a winner - it's perfect for fussy eaters, vegetarians and the budget conscious.

3. Pisco Sour

The national drink of Peru gets whipped up with lime juice, egg white and sugar to create this well known cocktail. Try it in Pisco… actually why not try it all over Peru?

4. Mate de Coca

Rumoured to help with altitude sickness, this tea made from coca leaves is drunk by locals all over the Andes region and is hailed for its 'medicinal' properties.

Geography and environment




Sharing borders with
Bolivia
,
Brazil
,
Chile
,
Colombia
and
Ecuador
, Peru also has a long stretch of coast along the Pacific Ocean. Home to a diverse range of landscapes, Peru can lay claim to parts of the Amazon Basin, Andean mountain range and Lake Titicaca as well as areas of tropical savanna, desert, cloud forest, mangroves and beaches. Peru's major cities are decidedly colonial, with historic buildings from the colonial era sitting alongside newer constructions. Out of the cities, rural life is largely agriculture-based, with locals working on potato, maize, coffee, rice and other farms.

Early History

Archaeological evidence indicates that early life in Peru started up to 11,000 years ago, with nomadic people living a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Organised civilisations based on land cultivation appear to have been established some time around 6000 BC. Over the centuries, Peru has seen many different civilisations rise and fall, grow and decline and evidence of these ancient civilisations can be found all around the country today, with the Nazca Lines being one of the most enigmatic examples.

However, the Incas can lay claim to being one of the most famous and revered empires of all. Spanning from 1438 to 1532, the audacious Inca Empire was responsible for one of the world's most impressive archaeological ruins - Machu Picchu. While certainly a scene-stealer, there are also many other reminders of the Inca throughout Peru, with the ruins at Sacsayhuaman also holding much significance. The decline of the Incas began some time around 1532, with the arrival of Spanish colonisers, civil war and the devastating smallpox virus contributing to the instability of the once-great empire. The indigenous population was decimated by infectious diseases brought from Europe, for which they had no immunity.

By 1542, the Spanish Crown had created the Viceroyalty of Peru yet over the years various indigenous uprisings and rebellions indicated the level of dissatisfaction the original population felt at having their traditional way of life, identity and land interfered with by foreigners. These disputes finally led to the War of Independence, which lasted from 1810 to 1824, when Spanish troops were defeated in the Battle of Ayacucho. Peru's independence was finally officially recognised in 1879.

Recent History

Peru's more recent history has been dominated by military coups and regional disputes with the years between 1960 and 1990 being a time of political instability and economic difficulty. With world commodity prices levelling out, Peru's agriculture-based economy suffered, as did its population who were largely reliant on farming. New leadership in the 1990s and beyond has led to economic reforms and trade promotion, which has driven economic growth for the country. With a focus on mining, construction, tourism and private investment, Peru withstood the Global Economic Crisis of 2008 considerably well and managed to avoid the high inflation and economic uncertainty that plagued many other nations. Celebrating the centenary of the re-discovery of Machu Picchu in 2011, Peru continues to enjoy widespread international attention for its cultural and historical riches.








Top 10 Must-Visit Places of Peru

Top 10 Must-Visit Places of Peru




1. Machu Picchu

No matter how many photos you've seen, nothing can prepare you for the reality. Time slips away as you try to uncover the ruins' secrets and marvel at how such grandeur is possible in a place so remote.

2. Cuzco

History comes to life in Cuzco. You can't turn a corner without coming across another reminder of its Inca past. Ruins are everywhere, and even the elegant colonial buildings have been built upon old Inca temples, houses, and markets.

3. Sacred Valley

This fertile valley is packed with Inca sites including the massive fortress of Ollantaytambo. Be sure to come on market day when the laidback villages come to life. The cobbled streets fill with every colour, produce and animal imaginable.

4. Amazon Jungle

Spend mornings watching colourful macaws and monkeys, the afternoon learning about traditional plant usage or spotting crocs in oxbow lakes. Then, at night, get your torch ready to seek out some of the jungle's larger creatures.

5. Lima

Peru's capital is home to unexpected treasures. Dig beneath the city's surface to uncover pre-Columbian temples, a touch of colonial elegance and a huge dose of modern distractions; like the cafe-rich district of Miraflores.

6. Arequipa

The White City, as it's affectionately known, is spectacular. Surrounded by canyons, volcanoes and deserts, the location is perfect for exploring Peru's wild side. But the true beauty of the city is in its elegant buildings, built from white volcanic rock.

7. Colca Canyon

While the canyon is a dramatic sight (it's twice as deep as the Grand Canyon), it's a glimpse of the elusive Andean condor that will really get your heart racing. With a wing span of 3.2m this bird doesn't just glide, it soars.

8. Lake Titicaca

Big enough to house countless island communities, coca smugglers and the entirety of Bolivia's navy, Lake Titicaca is massive. Remnants of ancient cultures are everywhere and many communities live on reed islands as they have done for hundreds of years.

9. Nazca Lines

The Nazca Lines are one of the world's great mysteries. Shapes of spiders, monkeys and birds are drawn into the desert landscape over 500 sq km. The most amazing part? They are only visible from the air.

10. Aguas Calientes

Whether you've just trekked the Inca Trail or travelled by train through the Sacred Valley, Aguas Calientes is the perfect place to stop, soak in a steaming thermal bath and reflect on the adventure so far.








Shopping

Shopping




With rich handicraft traditions on display in all the markets across the country, Peru is a great place to pick up handmade souvenirs at low prices.

It's also a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring some items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Peru

1. Alpaca Wool Clothing

As one of the largest alpaca wool producers in the world, travellers will be able to find alpaca wool clothing almost everywhere in Peru. Beautiful shawls, ponchos and jumpers are the perfect way to keep warm, as Peruvians have traditionally done for centuries.

2. Chullos

The classic hallmark of any backpacker who has travelled through South America - the chullo (knitted hat with ear flaps) might be a bit of a travel cliché but will be a well received as a gift back home.

3. Jewellery

Good quality gold and silver earrings, rings and bracelets are widely available throughout Peru, with classic Inca-style designs proving popular.








Festivals and Events in Peru

Festivals and Events in Peru




Inti Raymi

Hundreds of thousands of people gather at the ruins of Sacsayhuaman (just outside of Cusco) each year for this ancient celebration known as the 'Festival of the Sun'. Dating back to the Inca Empire, this ceremony once used to involve animal sacrifices (to appease the Sun God) but these days, historical re-enactments spare the animals.

El Senor de los Milagros

Even though this is one of the most important Catholic rituals in the world, you don't have to be a believer to be moved by the stirring sight of thousands of purple-clad people walking down the streets of Lima in honour of the Lord of Miracles.

La Diablada

Held on the shores of Lake Titicaca, this week-long festival commemorates the liberation of the city and pays respects to the gods of the lake. Expect to see locals dressed up in colourful devil-like costumes parading through the streets to the sounds of traditional music.

You should be able to use your mobile phone in Peru's cities, but prepare for less coverage in remote or mountainous areas. Ensure you have global roaming enabled before leaving your home country.







What are the toilets like in Peru?
