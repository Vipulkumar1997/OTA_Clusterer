The Canal du Midi  (Castelnaudary to Homps),
June 2017

Maryanne Wallace

Can't recommend Intrepid highly enough.  I usually travel solo (my preference!) and every trip sees the participants all getting along very well together.  I guess that is because Intrepid travelers are of like minds.  Leaders are always full of enthusiasm and their local knowledge is what appeals to me.  I travel to get involved in local cultures and customs and the Leaders' insights are perfect for this.

Transport in France

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in France, you may find yourself travelling by:







Bicycle

France is one of the greatest places in the world to cycle. Whether you’re taking on a steep hill in the Pyrenees or gliding past the lavender fields of Provence, cycling in France is a true pleasure.

Accommodation in France

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in France you may find yourself staying in a:







Hotel

Most hotels used on Intrepid tours through France are small, family-run guesthouses, so expect staircases instead of lifts and small rooms big on character.

Best time to visit France

Best time to visit France




Depending on what you want to get out of your trip, there is always a good time to visit France. Winter is a great time to enjoy snow sports in the Alps and Pyrenees, while the summer is great for soaking up the sun on the beaches of the Cote d’Azur. Generally, France enjoys a temperate climate with cool winters and warm summers, except for the Mediterranean areas that bask in warm temperatures most of the year. Popular tourist spots can get crowded during the peak holiday periods of Christmas, Easter and the school holiday months of July and August; if travelling during these times, be prepared to share France with many other travellers and holidaying locals.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Passionate about the arts, great food and even greater wine, French people are also fierce defenders of the 'French' way of life. The stereotype of the typical French person being a liberal, dog-loving, intellectual may not ring true but you will most likely see many dogs in cafes and an open attitude towards everything from sexuality to smoking.

France (Paris in particular) is a multicultural country with immigrants coming from
Africa
, the
Middle East
and other European countries. In fact, France has the largest Muslim and Jewish populations in
Europe
. In the recent past, this mix of cultures has created some tension among the population, with immigrant communities and students in particular protesting about employment rates and government restrictions.

With many different cultures co-existing in modern France, there are a wide variety of customs, cuisines and religions to be observed. Expect to see churches as well as mosques, Indian restaurants near French patisseries, and the sultry sounds of modern jazz right around the corner from a street beat-boxer.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

The gastronomic pleasures of France are world-renowned, so travellers won’t be disappointed with the food of France. There’s something to suit all budgets here, from Michelin star restaurants to humble cafes and market stalls.

Things to try in France

1. Simple, fresh baguettes

One of the best cheap eats in France has to be a fresh, crusty baguette. Buy a freshly prepared roll from a cafe or buy the ingredients separately from shops and markets, prepare yourself and eat by the banks of the Seine or in a park. C’est bon!

2. Pastries, cakes and tarts

Be overwhelmed by the array of cakes, flans, tarts, pastries, pies, biscuits and macaroons available in France. French pastry chefs set the benchmark for quality, so indulge away and work it off with a walk or cycle.

3. Champagne and wine

With famous wine regions like Bordeaux, Burgundy, Loire Valley, Alsace and Provence, France is the place to indulge in a tipple or two! Whether you’re sampling fine vintages straight from the cellar door or savouring a bottle in a Paris restaurant, don’t leave France without trying to the top quality wine and champagne.

4. Cheese

French people love their cheese, so when in France eat like the locals do! From soft cheeses like Brie and Camembert to strong, tangy Roquefort and hard, sharp Beaufort, try them all at the cheese shops and markets of France.

Geography and environment




Bordered by
Spain
,
Andorra
,
Luxembourg
, Monaco,
Switzerland
,
Italy
,
Germany
and
Belgium
, France has a variety of natural environments, from the rolling fields of Provence and the beaches of the Mediterranean to the urbanised cityscapes of Paris. Much of France is flat, except for the mountainous Pyrenees in the south and the Alps in the east, which are both popular places for outdoor sports like hiking, skiing, snowboarding and mountain biking.

The French capital is a fascinating mix of gritty charm and unusual beauty. Expect to see the full spectrum of life – from well-maintained boulevards lined with classy, up-market restaurants and boutiques, to neighbourhoods full of run-down housing and graffiti-clad industrial buildings. Paris is a city that has many different sides, where visitors can turn each corner and find something new.








History and government

History and government




Early History

France has a fascinating history marked by war, invasion, imperialistic expansion and revolution. Enduring the ravages of the Black Death, and the uncertainty of political upheaval and civil unrest, it's probably these events that give the modern French people their passionate, fighting spirit.

Recent History

France’s recent history is as interesting as its beginnings. Invaded by Germany during World War I and World War II, France suffered many losses during both of these wars. Civilian and military lives were lost, strict rationing created harsh living conditions, and regular airstrikes and shelling created a climate of fear. The French Resistance has been the subject of many books and movies, mainly because it’s such an interesting example of the French spirit. The French Resistance is the name given to pockets of men and women who rallied against the Nazi occupation of France during World War II. Using guerrilla tactics, as well as underground press and other means, these groups provided safe houses and escape networks for Allied soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. They also provided intelligence and other information to the Allies, as well as committed acts of sabotage against the German military. Visitors to France can choose to see many sites that reflect these times including the beaches of Normandy and the battlefields of Ypres and the Somme.

More recently, France has enjoyed the stability that comes with being a part of the European Union and NATO; even though unemployment remains high, France is currently enjoying more peaceful times than it has had in the past.








Top 10 Iconic Landmarks of France






×

Top 10 Iconic Landmarks of France




1. Notre Dame

This iconic Gothic-style cathedral is a true Parisian great. If you think the outside is impressive, wait until you get inside to see the spectacular organ and stunning stained-glass windows.

2. The Louvre

Housing some of the world’s most famous and valuable art, the Louvre Museum is a Parisian icon in its own right. Apart from the artistic masterpieces held within, the unique blend of old and new architecture - capped off by the much-photographed glass pyramid - makes the Louvre a landmark not to be missed.

3. Palace of Versailles

Elaborate galleries, opulent furnishings, gold-framed paintings and manicured gardens, the Palace of Versailles is the ultimate in old-world luxury. See where Marie Antoinette resided in decadence before her execution and understand why she was reticent to leave.

4. Chateau de Chambord

Located in the Loire Valley, this chateau fit for a fairytale is a classic example of French Renaissance architecture at its finest. Not to be outshone, the surrounding gardens, lawns and water features complement this grand, national treasure.

5. Le Pantheon

This historic domed icon is located in Paris’ Latin Quarter and is the final resting place of many famous French historical figures including Voltaire, Victor Hugo, Louis Braille, Marie Curie and Alexandre Dumas. Head here to admire neoclassical architecture and catch up on some French history.

6. Centre Georges Pompidou

The revolutionary, post-modern design of this building put it on the world map back in the 1970s and today it’s still as relevant as when it was first built. Home to an art museum, library and research centre, this place has attracted millions of visitors over the years – drawn in by the peculiar architecture and innovative works housed inside.

7. Arc De Triomphe

Commissioned by pint-sized Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806, the grand Arc de Triomphe monument signifies triumph and victory. Best seen at night, the luminous golden hues provide atmospheric photographic opportunities

8. Moulin Rouge

There’s no mistaking the famous red windmill of the Moulin Rouge. Take a snapshot outside or head inside to catch a cheeky show full of bedazzled, feathered dancers.

9. The Beaches of Normandy

The historic ‘D-Day’ landings of Normandy were one of the most crucial military manoeuvres of World War II. Visiting the beaches where the largest amphibious invasion in world history took place is a must-do for history-buffs and novices alike.

10. Eiffel Tower

Over the years, Paris’ much-loved landmark has been the backdrop to many romantic proposals and magic movie moments. Choose to climb the stairs to the top to take in views of the Parisian skyline or simply bask in the romantic afterglow on the lawn underneath.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Home to designer fashion houses, luxurious perfumeries, exclusive boutiques and antique merchants, France isn’t a great shopping destination for those on a budget. Regardless, there’s much fun to be had whether you’re window shopping or indulging in the real thing.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in France

1. Perfumeries

Beautifully packaged scents are best bought in the chic perfumeries of Paris – known as the fragrance capital of the world. Some have been trading for more than a century, others are brand new – either way a bottle of perfume makes a lovely gift for a friend… or yourself.

2. Bookshops

Stocking everything from modern literature and high-end fashion magazines to hard-to-find classics, the bookshops of France are filled with mystery, romance and adventure – the perfect place to retreat on a rainy day. When the sun is shining, head to the Seine where booksellers line the banks selling comics, postcards and antique books.

3. Flea Markets

The flea markets of Paris are great places to pick up vintage pieces. From art deco brooches to pretty 1940’s purses, you’re guaranteed to find something unique on the cheap! Try Porte de Vanves and Porte de Saint-Ouen in Paris.

4. Village Markets

French provincial markets just ooze with charm. Peruse fresh produce, home-made jams, pickled vegetables, rich cheeses and summer flowers - and dream of living such an idyllic life.








Festivals and events in France

Festivals and events in France




Bastille Day

France lights up with balls, parades, fireworks and street parties in this iconic holiday dedicated to the Fall of Bastille. Although this holiday is celebrated all over France, it is the celebratory vibe and decadent flourishes of Paris that best capture the triumphant spirit of this oh-so French holiday.

Avignon Festival

Performers and art lovers from around the world descend on Avignon for this three-week celebration of performance art. Dance, theatre, comedy and musical performances feature on the bill, with everything from open-air classical concerts and sweeping operatic epics to spoken word poetry.

Mondial du Snowboard

The alpine town of Les Deux Alpes hosts thousands of snowboarders for three days of top-flight snowboarding competition. See the latest and greatest tricks and boards before the season starts and party it up at night at the heaving music and bar scene. Non-boarders will appreciate the bike riding and skateboarding side shows.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for France

Be considerate of France’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
