claudia mcgrath

If you like some independence but don't want to travel alone; if you don't want to travel on big buses with 40 people; if you don't want to promote invasive tourism but prefer to blend in with locals then try Intrepid tours small groups max 12 where fellow travelers become friends

Best of Italy,
October 2017

William Haynes

Intrepid is a great way to travel because you get to see all the key highlights, you get to experience the local culture, you learn a lot and generally have a fun time with like minded travellers - without the hassles of organising everything; and it passes my cost/benefit analysis.

Transport in Italy

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Italy, you may find yourself travelling by:







Bicycle

Fields of grass scattered with wildflowers, quaint buildings and cobblestone lanes… cycling through the countryside of Italy is a great way to get around.

Best time to visit Italy

Best time to visit Italy




Italy enjoys a temperate climate most of the year, with June, July and August being the warmest months. Popular tourist spots can get very busy and crowded during the European summer, but the sun is shining and the weather is hot so it's still a great time to go.

April - May and September - October (while not as hot) still offer great conditions for travel, with milder temperatures and fewer crowds at the sights and beaches.

It can get quite cold in the winter months, especially in the north, with cities like Milan, Turin and Venice often seeing snow, fog and rain in December and January. Major coastal tourist spots like the Amalfi Coast and Cinque Terre all but close (except to locals) during winter and are truly best seen in the warmer months.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




With the Renaissance, Vespa, slow-food movement, opera, Valentino, espresso, the Colosseum and the Sistine Chapel, the culture of Italy is as rich as its food. And with iconic cities like Rome, Venice, Florence and Naples featuring reminders of the past around every corner, it's easy to see why Italians are so very proud of their heritage. Italy drips with sensational artwork, ancient icons, ornate architecture and historic sights. The streets are filled with people and places that exude character and charisma, and the famous Italian artists, inventors and public figures that have contributed so much to the world are openly adored and celebrated.

In general, Italians place great value on family, food and the enjoyment of life. Good quality food made with the best ingredients is preferred to processed, fast food. Eating is a pleasure to be enjoyed with friends and family, not a necessary inconvenience. Respect for the family unit is paramount, with many families choosing to live close to each other for life. Community is also an important element of Italian life and this can be seen with neighbours enjoying a passeggiata (an after dinner stroll and chat).

Italians certainly live their lives with passion and this is evident in their zealous approach to driving, passionate patronage of football (soccer) matches and exuberant social life. It's common to see Italians debate politics, fashion, sport and current affairs with ferocious verve, which can sometimes be quite confronting for people from meeker cultural backgrounds. But lying underneath the bold, animated exterior of most Italians is a deep, passionate love of life itself.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Italy is famous for its food and rightly so! Carb-addicts will enjoy the bounty of pasta and pizza on offer, foodies will love the parmesan and olives, and those with a sweet tooth won't be able to resist the desserts and sweets. From fine dining to street carts, aperitivo and family-run kitchens, Italy's got cuisine covered.

Things to try in Italy

1. Gelato

A true favourite, gelato shops and carts can be found nearly everywhere in Italy. Try traditional Italian flavours like bacio (choc-hazelnut), amarena (sour cherry) and limone (lemon) - the perfect accompaniment to sightseeing on a hot summer's day.

2. Pizza

Naples is the birthplace of pizza but you'll see it all over Italy. Gorge on a whole pizza in a restaurant or grab a slice from a street stall. Simple is usually the best - fresh basil and mozzarella are a top combo and a calzone is great to eat on the run.

3. Pasta

This is your chance to try all shapes - tortellini, spaghetti, farfalle, linguine, rigatoni, fettucine - and all sauces, from a fiery arrabiata to a hearty bolognese or a tangy puttanesca.

4. Fresh Produce

Fruit and vegetables are sold in street stalls and carts on the side of the road, even in big cities. For a healthy snack, pick up some fresh berries, cherries, grapes or figs. There's no self-service here so ask for what item you want - Italian fruit sellers don't appreciate fruit being handled before purchase.

5. Coffee

The quintessential Italian experience, sip an espresso while standing up at a cafe bar, just like the locals do. It's also cheaper.

6. Wine

Italy produces some of the world's best wine so savour a glass (or two!) of Sangiovese with dinner. Fans of white wine will love a crisp Pinot Grigio, a summer wine best served with seafood or chicken.

7. Limoncello

This lemon liqueur is super strong and usually served after dinner. Native to southern Italy, Limoncello can be found everywhere in Italy but especially on the Amalfi Coast.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Sharing borders with
Switzerland
,
France
,
Slovenia
and
Austria
, Italy also encompasses the independent territories of San Marino and Vatican City and includes the islands of Sicily and Sardinia.

Home to mountains, volcanoes, islands, beaches, spectacular cliffs and expansive stretches of coastline, the natural landscapes of Italy provide dramatic scenery as well as popular places to explore and relax for locals and visitors alike.

The major cities of Italy, although industrialised, still retain buildings, churches and relics from the past. It's quite common to see modern shops housed in historic cobblestone streets and new Vespas perched in ancient piazzas. In smaller cities and more isolated areas, rural life is a whole lot slower and simpler. Permaculture remains popular, with many Italians growing fruit and vegetables in their backyards. The traffic and frenetic pace of the cities give way to idyllic olive groves, vineyards and farmhouses.








History and government

History and government




Early History

The rise of the Roman Empire has been the subject of much fascination, intrigue and interest from scholars, artists, travellers and students around the world, and through the ages. Dominating the world for many centuries, the modern world can pay great respect to the fruits of this mighty civilisation, with many important scientific inventions, art movements, architectural triumphs and philosophical ideas being born during Roman civilisation - most notably during the Renaissance.

Founded sometime around 750 BC, Rome endures as one of the most important cities in the world. Home to such famous citizens as Julius Caesar, Emperor Augustus, Claudius, Nero, Mark Antony and Marcus Aurelius, Rome has enjoyed the great highs of dominating the Mediterranean region and the artistic triumphs of the Renaissance, but also the lows of the Great Fire of Rome, which ended up destroying a large part of the city. Rome has survived natural disasters, political turmoil, feuding families, the plague, war and more, to be the great city that is it today. Still a cultural and political powerhouse, any visit to Italy needs to include Rome's major sites in order to understand the birth of this nation. The Colosseum, The Pantheon, Circus Maximus and Palatine Hill are all great places to start.

Lasting centuries, the amazing history of Ancient Rome is full of dramatic twists and turns, and we suggest you read up on it before visiting.

Recent History

After the Renaissance, Italy was unified with Sardinia in 1861, becoming the Kingdom of Italy. After World War I, Italy came under the fascist rule of Benito Mussolini, who ruled until 1943. Siding with Nazi Germany in World War II, the Italian Army suffered many losses and ultimately surrendered in 1945. After a referendum in 1946, Italy became a Republic and flourished well during the 1950s and 1960s. The post-war period marks a time of economic progress for Italy, also largely reflected by the rest of the world's increased economic stability during this period of relative peace.

From the 1970s, Italians have lived with political upheaval and uncertainty. Corruption, organised crime, terrorism and government debt have created times of turmoil and concern. In 1994, media mogul Silvio Berlusconi was elected into office as Prime Minister but was forced to step down later in the year after losing support from his political partners. Undeterred, Berlusconi regained power in 2008 and has continued to rule Italy amid much controversy and scandal.








Iconic Italian Landscapes

Iconic Italian Landscapes




Top 10 Iconic Italian Landscapes

1. Captivating Capri

Be blown away by the shimmering beauty of this sun-bleached island that sits in the middle of a mass of blue-green water. Home to luminous sea caves, stunning cliff faces and whitewashed buildings, Capri is the perfect setting for a romantic escapade, relaxing boat ride or some serious sun worshipping.

2. Tuscan Hills

An enchanting mix of rolling green hills, vineyards, simple farmhouses and charming villages, Tuscan landscapes are effortlessly beautiful. Whether you're cycling around vineyards, hiking through the countryside or lying in a field of golden grass, Tuscany is made for life in the slow lane.

3. Luscious Lake

Picturesque Lake Como is considered one of the most beautiful lakes in Italy and any visitor will tell you why. A vast expanse of azure water set to a stunning mountainous backdrop, dotted with rustic villas and wildflowers, Lake Como is the sparkling jewel of Italy's north, naturally polished to perfection.

4. Mighty Mount Vesuvius

Sitting on the Bay of Naples, the austere beauty of brooding Mt Vesuvius offers a contrast to the luscious, green landscapes of the Mediterranean. A reminder of the raw power of nature, Mt Vesuvius is still active - yet a hike to the summit is possible and worthwhile for the sweeping views of the bay below.

5. Wonderful Waterways

No trip to Italy is complete without taking in the canals of Venice. A truly unique spectacle to behold, these classic waterways have served for centuries as a transport route for Venetians. Nowhere else in the world will you find a place such as this - hop onboard a gondola and ride the canals for an up close look at this fascinating city.

6. The Romantic Road

A journey along the winding roads of the Amalfi Coast offers panoramic sea views, alluring towns perched on cliffs and beaches bathed in sunlight. Admire the luscious landscapes dotted with fragrant lemon trees and olive groves, feel the soft touch of a gentle sea breeze and fall in love with this spectacular corner of the world.

7. Authentic Italian Island

Sitting under the watchful eye of moody Mt Etna, Sicily is a place where you can experience a taste of authentic Italy and see spectacular views at the same time. Surrounded by a sea of turquoise water speckled with volcanic islands, Sicily possesses diverse landscapes of rocky mountains, rural pastures, ancient ruins and villages steeped in history.

8. The Pleasures of Piedmont

While not as famous as other regions of Italy, the quiet, pastoral beauty of Piedmont is definitely pleasing to the eye. With classic vineyards, simple home-grown gardens, sleepy villages and divine cafes, Piedmont rewards visitors with attractive scenery and a serene vibe to match.

9. The Dolomites

Verdant green and carpeted in wildflowers during summer, and covered in a blanket of white snow during winter, the Dolomites are a breathtakingly beautiful sight to behold in any season. Whether you're scaling the epic slopes during summer hikes or skiing downhill during winter, making the most of these mountainous landscapes is too easy.

10. The Five Lands

A quintessentially beautiful Mediterranean landscape, the Cinque Terre is a destination to be cherished. Walk the rocky path over steep cliffs and pass character-filled villages perched over a brilliant blue sea. Wander past shady trees, gardens and groves as the sea reflects the radiance of the sun. This is panoramic perfection!








Shopping

Shopping




Italians are known for their style and this is reflected in the designer fashion and furniture of Italy. Be prepared to part with money - shopping in Italy can get quite expensive - but the quality of handmade and tailored items is generally exceptional.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Italy

1. Clothing

Milan, Rome and other big cities are packed with high-end designer fashion boutiques, chic chain stores and tailors. Either way, when in Italy you're guaranteed to get the latest fashions straight from the catwalks of Europe.

2. Colourful Ceramics

Vibrant, hand-painted ceramic bowls, jugs and glasses can be found in the shops and markets of the Amalfi Coast and Sicily. A perfect reminder of the Mediterranean.

3. Masks

Venice is filled with shops selling elaborate, handcrafted masquerade masks. These colourful creations look great hung on walls and are a true Venetian keepsake.

4. Leather Footwear, Bags and Accessories

Florence and Rome are hot spots for sourcing gorgeous handmade leather items. Splash out on an 'investment purchase' - a leather handbag that will last a lifetime.

Easter (Pasqua)

Beautifully decorated shop windows, colourfully painted eggs, church services, parades, feasts and fireworks make Easter a wonderful time to visit Italy and be immersed in Italian culture.

Held on the first Sunday of September and dating back to the 13th century, this historic event sees the canals of Venice turned into a competitive rowing race between colourful, carved boats.
