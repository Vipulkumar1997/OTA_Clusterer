Slovakia



Set against a backdrop of wooden churches, brooding forests and snow-capped peaks, Slovakia is a land where folktales come to life.


Boasting ancient castle ruins, cool street art and an array of cafés and bars, Slovakia offers an opportunity to discover a relatively tourist-free place before it changes forever. Still searching for its ‘famous for…’ line, Slovakia captivates its travellers with its mix of old and new, Bratislava’s quirky character and the tremendous peaks of the Tatra Mountains.

Best time to visit Slovakia

Best time to visit Slovakia




Slovakia enjoys four very distinct seasons. Summers are blissfully warm with July and August the most popular times to visit. To skip the crowds, travel in spring and autumn. Be sure to bring warmer clothes, as nights can get quite cold, especially in the mountains. Slovakia turns into a white wonderland over winter and temperatures drop below freezing. Excessive snow cuts off the Tatra Mountains from November to March.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Slovakia’s capital, Bratislava, stretches out into the lowlands, where the Danube rolls past farms and meadows. Further to the north and west, the country abounds with natural beauty including the Tatra Mountains, lakes, forests and caves. The
Czech Republic
,
Poland
,
Hungary
,
Ukraine
and
Austria
are all within easy reach of this tiny landlocked country and Vienna is easily reached as a day trip from Bratislava.








Top 5 Folksy Places in Slovakia

Top 5 Folksy Places in Slovakia




1. The Tatra Mountains

With soaring peaks, thick forests and simple villages, the Tatra Mountains are straight out of a storybook. Stretch the legs with a hilly hike or take a funicular to one of the heady peaks.

2. Hidden Treasures

Bratislava is filled with hidden treasures. Search out the curious Peeping Tom statues poking out from doorways and manholes. And be sure to look up when walking past older buildings, you might see a cannonball, courtesy of Napoleon, still embedded in the walls.

3. Bratislava Castle

Perched high above the city on a rocky outcrop is the grand Bratislava Castle. Walk around the grounds for sweeping views all the way to Hungary.

4. Devin Castle

The rocky ruins of this 13th-century castle conjure up images of dragons, witches and epic quests. Take a boat along the Danube for your own adventure and gaze up at the ruins on a river cruise.

5. Danube River

One of Europe’s mightiest rivers winds its way past forest, cliffs and castles. Take a walk along its banks or even hire a bike to cycle its banks.

Top responsible travel tips for Slovakia

1. Be considerate of Slovakia’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

3. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

4. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

5. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

6. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

7. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.
