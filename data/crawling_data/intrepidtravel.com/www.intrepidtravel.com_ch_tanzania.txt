Tanzania tour reviews


Our Tanzania trips score an average of

based on 625 reviews in the last year.










Gorillas, Game Parks & Beaches,
October 2017

Katherine Grigg

This trip was incredible, from the socially and environmentally sustainable practices of the whole trip (this was super important us and we were not disappointed once) to the things you experience and the places and animals you get to see. We were in great hands and felt safe, secure and immersed in the experience the whole time. Ken, the cook, was exceptional and very attentive to making sure any dietary requirements are well met and everyone stayed healthy. David, the guide, made the whole trip run super smooth. Kose and Chris driving skills were exemplary. It is honestly worth it and would recommend it to anyone!

Glenn Fraser

Africa was a destination on my bucket list for a very long time. My daughter and I choose Intrepid after reading all the reviews on their website. I am now one of those reviews. It was an adventure of a lifetime and exceeded my expectations every step of the way. Intrepid was amazing.

Transport in Tanzania

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in Tanzania, you may find yourself travelling by:







Overland vehicle

Get close to the action aboard a customised safari vehicle, designed to withstand the bush and allow greater visibility of the wildlife.


Serengeti Trail

Gorillas, Game Parks & Beaches

Cycle Tanzania










Ferry

Take in views of the stunning African coast while travelling from Dar el Salaam to Zanzibar aboard a ferry.

Accommodation in Tanzania

Travelling with Intrepid is a little bit different. We endeavour to provide travellers with an authentic experience to remember, so we try to keep accommodation as unique and traditional as possible.

When travelling with us in Tanzania you may find yourself staying in a:







Mountain Hut

Sleep in huts dotted along the trail while trekking to the summit of majestic Mount Kilimanjaro.

Best time to visit Tanzania






×

Best time to visit Tanzania




Tanzania’s climate changes with its diverse landscapes, so expect variances in weather in different parts of the country. Generally, January and February are the high season for travel in Tanzania as the hot, dry weather is generally considered to be the most pleasant. The best time to visit the Serengeti is late June to October when the animals are most abundant. Expect afternoon downpours during the wet season (from March to May); however, during this time you’ll find fewer tourists in Tanzania so you won’t have to compete with crowds.








Culture and customs






×

Culture and customs




Tanzania’s population is a vibrant mix of religions, races and cultures. Depending on what area you’re travelling in, be prepared to see a variety of cuisines, customs and dress, which directly reflect the diversity of the population. The island of Zanzibar is predominately Muslim; Maasai are largely found in the North along with other indigenous tribes whose beliefs are largely animist; and Christians, Hindus and other minority groups can be found throughout the country. Although most Tanzanians may not have many material possessions, travellers can expect a warm welcome and generosity from most locals. Greeting styles and language differ according to ethnic or tribal group but universally, visitors can expect to receive a warm welcome and a smile from most.








Eating and drinking






×

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Things to try in Tanzania

1. Seafood

Seafood-lovers will adore the range of fresh seafood on offer in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. From fragrant fish curries to barbecued shrimp and lobster, the waterfront markets and restaurants are full of wonders from the sea.

2. Indian Cuisine

With a significant Indian population, Tanzanian cities have a fair share of Indian restaurants. Whether you’re visiting a budget cafe or more extravagant restaurant, Indian cuisine is generally a good option for vegetarians as there will always be a few meat-free options to choose from.

3. Mandazi

These sweet, fried breads can be found at markets and street stalls throughout East Africa, and make a delicious, cheap snack. Although they can be flavoured differently, the ones made in Zanzibar usually feature fresh spices and coconut.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Bordered by Burundi,
Kenya
,
Malawi
,
Mozambique
,
Rwanda
,
Uganda
,
Zambia
and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania has one of the most diverse natural environments in the world. While travelling through Tanzania, you’ll be able to see enormous gorges, sprawling savanna, ancient islands, dense woodlands, snow-capped mountain ranges, vast lakes, colonial towns and modern cities. With the Indian Ocean occupying the eastern side of Tanzania, this country truly does have the best of both worlds. Home to Africa’s highest peak and some of the most famous nature reserves in the world, Tanzania also has eclectic cities and vibrant villages to boast of. Tanzania’s former capital, Dar es Salaam, is a modern metropolis with a colonial flavour while the regional centre of Arusha has retained a village feel. Zanzibar is in a category of its own with its ancient cobbled streets and unique, heritage-filled buildings.








History and government

History and government




Early History

Home to some of the earliest human remains in the world, the land now known as Tanzania could possibly be one of the first lands to have been inhabited by early humans. Human habitation can be traced back 10,000 years to a time when people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle before outside influences arrived bringing with them organised agriculture and cattle farming. Visitors to Tanzania should head to Olduvai Gorge (known as the 'Cradle of Mankind') if interested in the early history of Tanzania and, in fact, the world.


Recent History

Europeans only arrived in the 15th century, via the East Coast. Zanzibar was first controlled by the Portuguese, then by Arabian traders interested in easy access to the Indian Ocean that allowed trade with Asia and beyond. This was also a time when the human slave trade was a lucrative business. The island of Zanzibar became a pivotal place for this trade, with more than 100,000 slaves passing through during this period.

Mainland Tanzania came under the influence of German, Belgian and British colonisers in the 1800s, who explored and mapped the interior of the country. German colonisers brought infrastructure, agriculture and Christianity to Tanzania, but faced resistance from many tribes who fought against being forced into labour and desperately wanted to keep their land and preserve their traditional way of life. During World War I, Germany lost the colony to the British, heralding a new era of colonial rule for the region. More recently, Tanzania adopted its constitution in 1977, held its first multi-party election in 1995 and had its first female presidential candidate in 2005.








Top 10 Iconic Landscapes of Tanzania

Top 10 Iconic Landscapes of Tanzania




Top 10 Iconic Landscapes of Tanzania

1. Serengeti National Park

The grassy savannah and open plains of Serengeti epitomise Africa at its wildest. Head out on safari in the early morning to search out Africa's 'Big Five'; buffaloes, lions, rhinos, leopards and elephants all call this park home.

2. Mt Kilimanjaro

Trekking to Mt Kili's peak has to be a major highlight of any trip to Africa. Hike past ice fields, grasslands and the odd cacti to the roof of
Africa
for the most amazing views on the continent.

3. Zanzibar

Arabic, Persian, African and Indian cultures mingle with the scent of fresh spices on this exotic island. Relax on perfect beaches, sail turquoise waters aboard a dhow or head inland to explore tropical fruit orchards.

4. Ngorongoro Crater

This massive crater is 20km wide and home to enormous concentrations of African wildlife. Go out on safari in search of them and camp on the edge of the crater for incredible views of the animals roaming below.

5. Dar es Salaam

Balmy Dar es Salaam is a modern city with ancient origins. Colonial architecture sits beside a picturesque harbour, making it a great place to see Tanzania in a new light.

6. Tengeru

Make yourself at home in this typical farming village. The locals are welcoming and will teach you how to milk a cow, feed the chickens or make the perfect cup of lemongrass tea.

7. Olduvai Gorge

Located near Ngorongoro Crater, this gorge is said to be the cradle of mankind - the place we all began. Pay respects to our ancient ancestors in this fascinating archaeological site.

8. Lake Manyara

There's plenty of wildlife to search out in this national park including tree-climbing lions. Yes, they climb trees! Take a safari to search them out as well as the rest of Africa's 'Big Five'.

9. Karatu

Leave the animals behind for some village R and R in Karatu. Set in the highlands and surrounded by coffee plantations, this town is the ideal spot to mingle with locals and try a cup of African coffee.

10. Usambara Mountains

These lush green mountains date back 25 million years and offer endless walking trails. Grab a guide, get hiking and learn about the unique flora and fauna that live here.








Shopping






×

Shopping




Tanzania has a wealth of markets to explore, from the large markets of the big cities to the small, rural village markets throughout the countryside.

It's also a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in Tanzania

1. Spices

Tanzania has a huge number of spice plantations, particularly in Zanzibar. Perhaps bring home some fresh nutmeg, cinnamon and turmeric to embark on your own East African culinary adventure when you get home.

2. Handicrafts

Woven basketry, colourful batik cloth, intricate woodcarvings and tribal art can be found in Tanzania’s many markets and make good souvenirs or gifts for friends back home.

3. Jewellery

For silver and gold jewellery with Arabic flair, Zanzibar has plenty of unique pieces in the markets, galleries and antique shops of Stone Town.

Festivals and Events in Tanzania




Sauti Za Busara Festival

Zanzibar’s Stone Town and surrounding areas swell with Swahili music and dance in this vibrant celebration of East African culture. Stay until the last day where the festivities head to the beach and include craft, cuisine and entertainment.

Festival of the Dhow Countries

East Africa’s largest film, music and arts festival takes over Zanzibar each year in July. Film screenings, exhibitions and craft classes offer entertainment during the day, while beach parties are a fun way to interact with locals at night.

Tanzania travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Tanzania?









TANZANIA:
Australia: Yes - Visa required
Belgium: Yes - Visa required
Canada: Yes - Visa required
Germany: Ye - Visa required
Ireland: Yes - Visa required
Netherlands: Yes - Visa required
New Zealand: Yes - Visa required
South Africa: Yes - Visa required
Switzerland: Yes - Visa required
United Kingdom: Yes - Visa required
USA: Yes - Visa required
It is recommended you purchase your visa in advance at any Diplomatic or Consulate Mission of the United Republic of Tanzania abroad. The cost is approximately US$100 depending on nationality and should take 1 business day. At the present time you do not require a multi entry visa to Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda due to an agreement between the three countries (eg. if you exit Kenya to Tanzania you can re-enter Kenya on the same visa). However if your trip visits Tanzania twice after a visit to a country other than those listed above, you may need to purchase two visas.
For the purpose of the visa application you can use the following address:
Kibo Palace Hotel
PO Box 2523
Old Moshi Road
Arusha - Tanzania
Phone: +255 272544472
It is also possible to obtain a tourist's visa for a single entry at any one of the following main entry points to Tanzania, subject to the fulfilment of all immigration and health requirements:
-Dar es Salaam International Airport
-Zanzibar International Airport
-Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA)
-Namanga Entry Point (Tanzania-Kenya border point)
-Kasumulu Border crossing
-Isebania Border crossing







Is tipping customary in Tanzania?









Tipping isn’t mandatory in Tanzania but a little generosity will be received positively, especially when considering the low wages that Tanzanian service workers are typically paid. Setting aside a small amount for porters, guides and drivers is wise, as is leaving spare change or rounding up the bill at restaurants.







What is the internet access like in Tanzania?









Travellers will be able to access the internet quite easily in the internet cafes of Tanzania’s large cities, but limited to no access should be expected in regional and rural areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Tanzania?









Mobile phone coverage is good in Tanzania’s large cities and towns, but less so in rural and mountainous areas. Ensure you have global roaming activated before leaving home if you wish to use your mobile phone.







What are the toilets like in Tanzania?









Squat/pit toilets are the standard in Tanzania, except for western-style flushable toilets that are sometimes available in large hotels, tourist attractions and other modern buildings. Carry your own supply of soap and toilet paper, as they are rarely provided.







What will it cost for a…?









Street snack = 1,000 TZS
Bottle of beer = 2,000 TZS
Plate of food from a local eatery = 3,000 TZS
Dinner in an international restaurant = 10,000-20,000 TZS







Can I drink the water in Tanzania?









Drinking tap water isn't recommended in Tanzania. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water. Ask your leader where filtered water can be found; some hotels we stay in may have drinking water available. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Tanzania?









Credit cards are usually accepted by large hotels and western-style restaurants but not by smaller vendors. Ensure you have adequate cash to cover purchases not able to be made on credit.







What is ATM access like in Tanzania?









ATMs are easily found in large cities and urban centres but are rarer in small towns, rural areas and villages. Be sure to have other payment methods available when venturing out of the big cities as ATMs aren't always an option.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Tanzania?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Tanzania

Be considerate of Tanzania’s customs, traditions, religions and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

Help protect endangered species by choosing not to buy ivory, coral or animal products.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.

Be aware that many coastal communities in Tanzania are quite conservative. Beach attire is fine for when swimming but topless sunbathing is not. Don’t forget to cover up when leaving the beach and entering towns or urban areas.

Tanzania has a large Muslim population, particularly in Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam, so bear in mind that Ramadan is the fasting month for all Muslims. During this month, no food, drink or smoking is permitted during daylight hours. While non-Muslims aren't expected to fast, it's recommended to try to avoid eating, drinking or smoking in public during daylight hours.
