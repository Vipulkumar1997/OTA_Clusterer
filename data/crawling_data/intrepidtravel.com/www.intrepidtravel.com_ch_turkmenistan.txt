Asia

Best time to visit Turkmenistan

Best time to visit Turkmenistan




With a dry, subtropical desert climate, Turkmenistan earns the rank as Central Asia's hottest country. Spring (April-June) and autumn (September-November) are the ideal times to visit, as this is when weather conditions are the most comfortable. During summer - particularly July and August - the mercury can tip up to 50 degrees Celsius on a regular basis, while winters can get very cold, down to freezing in some parts of the north.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




Over 80% of Turkmenistan's land mass is covered by the Karakum Desert, which stretches from west to east for 880 km. Consequently, the landscape is dominated by undulating sandy desert dunes, with low mountains to the south and south-east, and the Caspian Sea running the length of the western fringe. Turkmenistan shares borders with Kazakhstan to the north,
Uzbekistan
to the east, Afghanistan to the southeast and
Iran
to the south.








Top 5 Things Banned by Niyazov

Top 5 Things Banned by Niyazov




1. Music

Listening to car radios, lip-synching and recorded music were all prohibited as he believed they stifled the natural creative talents of Turkmen.

2. TV Newswomen Wearing Make-up

Banned in 2004, because he believed Turkmen women were beautiful enough already without make-up. (Although, some reports claim this was actually because he was struggling to tell the difference between the male and female newsreaders!)

3. Gold Teeth

Banned in April 2004 - instead Niyazov decreed the youth of Turkmenistan should chew on bones to preserve their teeth, in the same way dogs do.

4. Opera, Ballet and the Circus

Banned in 2001 for being unnecessary and 'decidedly un-Turkmen-like'.

5. Dogs in Ashgabat

Banished from the streets of the capital as a result of their 'unappealing odour'.

Turkmenistan travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Turkmenistan?









TURKMENISTAN VISA

All travellers to Turkmenistan require a visa. A Letter of Invitation (LOI) is also required before you can apply for the visa. We recommend all travellers plan to receive a Visa on Arrival at either the airport or land border, depending on your itinerary. Please follow the instructions below to have your LOI for visa on arrival issued before you travel.

We have partnered with The Visa Machine to provide your LOI for Turkmenistan. This service is included in your trip cost. We advise that you apply for your LOI no later than 3 months before your trip to allow time for processing. Turkmenistan LOIs are processed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Turkmenistan and usually take around 4 weeks to be processed, with up to 6 weeks in peak travel season not uncommon.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. To obtain your Turkmenistan LOI use this link:
http://intrepid-visa-support.thevisamachine.com/

2. Use the Checklist to make sure you have everything you need before you start as you will not be able to save once your start filling in the application.

3. Once you are satisfied you have all information with you to apply for your Turkmenistan LOI click on the ‘Apply Now’ link and follow the instructions.

4. If you have any trouble with the online form or want to check the status of your Turkmenistan LOI application please contact The Visa Machine on visasupport@thevisamachine.com or during UK working hours on +44(0) 207 148 6402.

NOTES:

- Turkmenistan Tourist Visas are valid for up to 10 days. Independent travel in Turkmenistan is not permitted and your visa will only be valid for as long as tour services (including accommodation, guides, transport etc) are provided.

- Make sure you have a print out of your LOI before boarding your flight or leaving for your trip.

- You will need to complete a migration card and pay a US$12 migration fee ($10 fee plus $2 admin charge) on arrival in Turkmenistan.

CUSTOMS:

- A number of medications containing tramadol, morphine, opiates or any other similar constituent component are banned in Turkmenistan and are considered narcotic drugs. Do not bring any medications containing these drugs into the country.







Is tipping customary in Turkmenistan?









Although tipping isn't customary in Turkmenistan, establishments in tourist areas like Maputo are increasingly accepting (and expecting) tips. A tip of 10% in restaurants and cafes should suffice, although it's not entirely necessary. With many service workers receiving low wages, tipping waiters, porters and drivers is considered generous.







What is the internet access like in Turkmenistan?









The government strictly controls internet access and internet cafes have all been shut down.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Turkmenistan?









Roaming agreements are in place with some international phone companies, however mobile phone coverage is mostly limited to Ashgabat. Remember to activate global roaming with your service provider before leaving home.







What are the toilets like in Turkmenistan?









Turkmenistan has a mix of squat toilets and flushable toilets. As a developing nation, expect to adjust to different levels of sanitation. Always carry your own toilet paper and hand sanitiser as these are rarely provided.







What will it cost for a…?









Soft drink = 3-4 TMT
Bottle of imported beer = 5-6 TMT
Simple lunch = 15-20 TMT
Dinner in an inexpensive restaurant = 35-45 TMT







Can I drink the water in Turkmenistan?









Tap water isn't considered safe for tourists to drink and you should also be careful when eating salads and other uncooked foods that may have been washed in water, avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit before eating. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Ask your leader and accommodation provider for local advice on where drinking water can be accessed.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Turkmenistan?









Credit card usage - including cash advances - is only available in Ashgabat, and even then, mostly in hotels. Large hotels, restaurants and tourist service providers generally accept credit cards, but expect smaller operators and shops to accept cash only.







What is ATM access like in Turkmenistan?









ATMs are difficult to find, even in Ashgabat. If travelling through rural and remote areas, be aware that there will be no ATM access.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Turkmenistan?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Turkmenistan

Be considerate of Turkmenistan's customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
