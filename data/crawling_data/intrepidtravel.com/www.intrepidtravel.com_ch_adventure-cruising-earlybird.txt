Adventure Cruising Earlybird













Home

Adventure Cruising Earlybird




Think cruise and what comes to mind? Hawaiian shirts, games arcades and 5,000 people invading a once-picturesque town? Not with Intrepid.

We’re pioneering a new way to explore the seas; on small ships (with a maximum of 49 travellers), eating at traditional local restaurants or fresh, locally sourced food on board, and exploring the undiscovered little towns and bays that the bigger ships can’t reach.

If snorkelling in Portugal, kayaking in Croatia or whale-spotting in the Westfjords of Iceland sound like your kind of thing then you’ll love our earlybird discount; 15% OFF all 2018 departures. Panama hats and deck shoes optional.

Why choose adventure cruising?









Small ships, small ports

Steer clear of the regular nautical routes and sail into small ports that larger cruise ships can’t reach.










It’s all about the destination

Most of the cruising is done during the early morning, meaning you have more time to explore and immerse yourself at each stop.










Local flavours

Expand your palate with an on-board menu tailored to reflect each destination. All our trips come with either half or full-board, plus an unforgettable ‘Local Night’ where your chefs will whip up a feast of regional fare.










On board activities

You don’t need on-board casinos and bowling alleys when you can pop on a snorkel and dive into the glittering Adriatic Sea, or pick up a kayak and paddle out into the blue.










A lighter footprint.

We carbon offset each of our trips and strive to have a low impact on local communities.
