Bulgaria



Bulgaria is one of the Balkans' most exuberant nations in virtually every possible way.


From its mist-shrouded mountains and shimmering coastline, to its lively folk soundtrack and intriguing ancient mythology - there's an unexpected surprise at almost every turn. And, while it has experienced an at-times-too-quick growth spurt in the last decade, visitors will find Bulgaria to be a country of fascinating culture, impressive sights and extremely gracious hospitality.

Best time to visit Bulgaria

Best time to visit Bulgaria




Bulgaria follows the classic seasonal pattern that belongs to this corner of Europe. Expect chilly conditions in winter and a delightfully warm (and very busy) summer. As with many of its neighbours, spring is a fantastic time to really explore Bulgaria, as the going is relatively easy throughout the whole country.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Sitting almost at the crossroads between
Europe
and
Asia
, Bulgaria entertains visitors with a little bit of everything when it comes to landscape. Dramatic rivers and gorges, dense wooded areas, the lofty peaks of the Balkan Mountains and some of the most beautiful Black Sea coastline the region has to offer.








Top 5 Famous Bulgarians

Top 5 Famous Bulgarians



1. Vasil Levski

A revolutionary who would be remembered as the Apostle of Liberty, Levski became a national hero after leading the battle for liberation from Ottoman rule in the early 1870s.

2. Georgi Ivanov

The first Bulgarian cosmonaut in 1979, Ivanov was awarded the title 'Hero of the Soviet Union'. However, he had to change his original surname, Kakalov, because it occasionally had negative connotations in Russian.

3. FSB

A famous Bulgarian pop/funk band from the late 70s and early 80s. As with most acts who were prominent during this era, FSB appear to have always worn their pants far too tight, but their songs did become the iconic sounds of a generation.

4. Peyo Yavorov

This romantic poet and revolutionary was viewed by many as the finest poet in Bulgarian history. The majority of his works were about his two great loves: the first of whom died from tuberculosis, the second, took her own life, which ultimately drove Yavorov to do the same.

5. Stanislav Ianevski

Ianevski was catapulted into the international spotlight after playing Viktor Krum in the 2005 instalment of the Harry Potter series,The Goblet of Fire. While he does little talking in the film, Ianevski does some impressive broom-flying and walking around looking gruff.

Bulgaria travel FAQs





Is tipping customary in Bulgaria?









While most larger hotels will include a gratuity, restaurants rarely add a service charge and a 10% tip is the custom.







What is the internet access like in Bulgaria?









Travellers should be able to access the internet at cyber cafes and Wi-Fi hot spots in Bulgaria's major cities and towns. Remote and rural areas will have less internet availability, so be prepared for this when travelling out of the city.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Bulgaria?









Mobile phone coverage is generally good in Bulgaria, but patchy in some remote places. Travellers should activate global roaming before leaving home.







What are the toilets like in Bulgaria?









Western-style, flushable toilets are mostly the standard in Bulgaria, however squat toilets can be found in some public restrooms.







What will it cost for a…?









Cup of coffee in a cafe = 1-2 BGN

Basic, takeaway lunch = 6-8 BGN
Dinner in an inexpensive restaurant = 10-15 BGN







Can I drink the water in Bulgaria?









Tap water is chlorinated but generally considered safe to drink (unless otherwise marked), however some travellers may not enjoy the taste and should stick to using a water bottle.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Bulgaria?









Major credit cards are accepted in large cities, mostly in shops and hotels. Smaller vendors may not accept credit cards, so carry enough cash to cover small purchases.







What is ATM access like in Bulgaria?









ATMs are commonly found in Bulgaria's cities and urban areas, however not all bank machines accept overseas cards. Access may be difficult in some remote areas.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Bulgaria?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of your trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip.
