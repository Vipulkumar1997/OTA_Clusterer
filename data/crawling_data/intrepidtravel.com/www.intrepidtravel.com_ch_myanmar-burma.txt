Best time to visit Myanmar




Myanmar has three distinct seasons, with the hottest and driest running from February to May. During this time, temperatures can reach up to 40 degrees Celsius, although relief can be found in the highland areas which, on average, clock cooler temperatures. The monsoon season runs from May to October, while milder and drier weather usually prevails from October to February.








Geography and environment

Geography and environment




Sharing borders with
China
, Bangladesh,
India
,
Laos
and
Thailand
, Myanmar is characterised by a horseshoe of mountains and hills that surround the country from the north, east and west. Subtropical forest is the dominant natural environment throughout Myanmar, with the exception of low-lying tracts of land used for agriculture. From the coast of the Andaman Sea to the edge of the Himalayas, Myanmar's landscapes are incredibly beautiful and provide the perfect backdrop for hiking and other outdoors activities, nature photography and relaxation.

History and government




Early History

It has been estimated that the land now known as Myanmar has been inhabited since 11,000 BC. Archaeological evidence garnered from burial sites indicates early settlements were largely concentrated near the Ayeyarwaddy River, with agriculture and animal husbandry prevailing by 1500 BC. Later, larger settlements or city states were created by the peaceful Pyu people, who migrated from the north sometime around 1 BC, bringing Buddhism to Myanmar. With the Mon people entering from the south during the 6th century, and sustained attacks from the north occurring up to the 9th century, the Pyu people became absorbed into the general population to shape the face of future Burmese ethnicity. The Bagan Empire ruled Myanmar from 1044 to 1287 and with a burgeoning agriculture and trade economy, was able to build thousands of Buddhist temples, many of which are still present today. By the 13th century, the Bagan Empire had begun to decline due to economic mismanagement and foreign invasion from the Mongols and the Mon people. Myanmar's seesawing fortunes continued for centuries, with war, invasion and changes in rule commonplace over the years.

Recent History

By 1886, Britain claimed Myanmar (formerly Burma) as a province of India, with Rangoon (now Yangon) being named capital. This period of British rule impacted on Burmese society greatly, with the culture, religion, economy and society vastly changing at the hands of the British. The local population saw little of the economic benefits flowing from increased trade and agriculture cultivation, and with many villages being destroyed, this period of history marks a difficult time for the Burmese. World War II saw Burma's movements towards independence grow, and by 1948 Burma was granted independence. Decades of change and political instability followed, with an unstable parliament and several military coups creating uncertainty around the newly Socialist country. Burma seemingly lurched from crisis to crisis, plagued by corruption, inflation and volatility from the 1960s to 1990s. With increasing trade embargoes, protests, sanctions and international pressure, the military government was forced to cease the imprisonment of democratically elected Aung San Suu Kyi and instate democracy to the country once again. With elections held in 2010, Myanmar could finally be on the road to restoring democracy, peace and prosperity to the population.








Top 5 Temples of Myanmar

Top 5 Temples of Myanmar




1. Shwedagon Paya

As one of the most sacred sites in Myanmar, this glittering pagoda located in Yangon is a must-see for travellers wishing to learn about the Buddhist faith and culture in Myanmar. The bell-shaped golden stupa is stunning, while the surrounding statues and satellite shrines provide insight into Burmese culture and mysticism.

2. Dhammayangyi

The largest temple in the impressive Bagan complex, centuries-old Dhammayangyi, features elaborate brickwork, dark passages filled with shrines and serene figures of Buddha. With its construction shrouded in historical mystery, the identity of the architect/builder of this unfinished temple is still unknown.

3. Shwezigon

One of Bagan's most popular pilgrimage spots, Shwezigon is a significant place of worship for many Burmese people. With elaborate, gilded stupas, decorated staircases and golden, ornamental trees, this is one of Myanmar’s most beautiful temples.

4. Mahamuni

Grand columns, bright frescoes, peaceful pavilions, reflective pools and a massive golden Buddha statue combine to make this one of Myanmar’s most visually appealing and interesting spiritual sites. As an active monastery, school for monks and place of worship, expect Bagan's Mahamuni to be busy with daily rituals and yearly religious festivals.

5. Ananda

While not the largest or most elaborate temple, Bagan's symmetrical Ananda rises majestically into the sky with a certain sense of grace. Damaged by an earthquake in the 1970s, Ananda has been lovingly restored to former glory and continues to elicit admiration and wonder from both locals and visitors.

Myanmar (Burma) travel FAQs





Do I need a visa to travel to Myanmar (Burma)?









VISAS FOR TRIPS STARTING IN MYANMAR:

Most nationalities require a visa to visit Myanmar, and can obtain a tourist visa using a eVisa system. For information on obtaining an eVisa visit website:
http://evisa.moip.gov.mm/

Important to note when applying for an eVisa:
- Passport validity must have at least (6) months validity from date of return.
- You will need to present one colour photo (4cm X 6cm) taken within the last 3 months and a copy of your return ticket.
- Length of stay is 28 days from the date of arrival in Myanmar.
- The eVisa fee is US$50 per person, payable by credit card (note: visa fee is non-refundable should the eVisa be denied)
- The processing time is approximately 3 working days for granting an eVisa however we recommend allowing longer in the event of delays.
- The validity of eVisa approval letter is 90 days from the date of issue. If it has expired, entry will be denied.
- eVisas are applicable for single entry into Myanmar only and you will not be permitted to re-enter on an eVisa that you have previously entered on (multiple entries not possible).
- eVisas are only obtainable if you are arriving into Yangon International Airport, Nay Pyi Taw International Aiport and Mandalay International Airport, as well as land border crossings at Tachileik, Myawaddy and Kawthaung. If arriving into another Myanmar entry point you will need to apply for your visa in advance through a Myanmar Embassy.

Nationalities who are unable to obtain an eVisa should contact the Myanmar embassy in their country of residency. Note - you may be requested to provide a letter of invitation from a local Myanmar ground operator. In such cases please contact Intrepid to attain this letter and we will forward to you.

VISAS FOR SAILING TRIPS:

For this Myanmar sailing trip visas will be obtained by the group during the trip on arrival (at border crossing between Thailand/Myanmar).
Please bring:

2 photocopies of the front page of your passport.

2 passport photos.

Why should I travel to Myanmar with Intrepid?









Resuming trips in Myanmar isn't a decision Intrepid has made lightly. In 2003, we responded to the call for a boycott on travel to Burma by the then democratically elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy (NLD) party was denied the right to govern the country by the military dictatorship.

After recent positive events within the country including the elections in November 2010, the release of Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest and the subsequent call to end the travel boycott by the NLD, Intrepid has been prompted to consider returning to Myanmar (Burma).

By reintroducing our grassroots style of travel, we can contribute to improving the circumstances of the Burmese people by way of initiating a two-way exchange. Firstly, resuming trips will give them a chance to interact with visitors from other countries, thus giving a rare glimpse into life and governance in other parts of the world.

Secondly, taking passengers to Myanmar will help to build awareness of the complex issues this country continues to face, as well as positively contributing to the economy.







Is tipping customary in Myanmar?









While tipping isn’t customary in Myanmar, setting aside a small amount for restaurant staff, porters and other service workers is considered polite. With most Burmese people earning a low wage, a modest tip will be accepted graciously by most









What is the internet access like in Myanmar?









The availability of Internet is increasing in Myanmar, with wifi and access points in most hotels. However Internet speeds are often very slow and unreliable, particularly in rural areas.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in Myanmar?









International roaming with an increasing number of western mobile networks is now possible in Myanmar; the situation is rapidly changing, so it is best to check with your provider in advance. Tourist SIM cards can also be purchased at international airports and some post offices.







What are the toilets like in Myanmar?









You'll have to adjust to different standards of hygiene and sanitation whilst in Myanmar. The standard toilet is of the squat variety and this may take some getting used to, although western-style toilets can be found in large hotels and some tourist areas. Carry your own supply of toilet paper and hand sanitiser as these are rarely provided.







What will it cost for a…?









Street food snack = 500-1000 MMK
Bottle of beer in a bar or restaurant = 2000-2500 MMK
Banquet in a small, locally-run restaurant = 3000-5000 MMK
Dinner in a high-end hotel restaurant = 15,000+ MMK







Can I drink the water in Myanmar?









Drinking tap water isn't recommended in Myanmar. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead, fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water. Ask your leader where filtered water can be found; some hotels we stay in may have drinking water available. It's also advisable to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit and vegetables before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in Myanmar?









Credit cards can be used in some hotels, restaurants and shops however use will be very limited. Myanmar is still largely a cash economy, so it is best to still carry cash.







What is ATM access like in Myanmar?









ATMs are available in all cities and most major towns. At times these can prove unreliable due to frequent power cuts or running out of funds, so you may need to try several ATMs when withdrawing funds.

It's advisable to still bring cash to exchange. Foreign currency is no longer accepted for purchases in Myanmar.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in Myanmar?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment. It's important to remember that what may be acceptable behaviour, dress and language in your own country, may not be appropriate in another. Please keep this in mind while travelling.







Top responsible travel tips for Myanmar (Burma)

Be considerate of Myanmar’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, this is a requirement when entering places of worship.

Myanmar’s political situation is rapidly changing, but may still be sensitive at times. Respect the wishes of locals at all times and avoid starting conversations involving politics or the government. It is possible to discuss politics if welcomed to do so.

For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Instead fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water.

Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
