Kyrgyzstan



If mountains are your thing, then Kyrgyzstan is your place.


Tucked into the heart of Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan’s skyline is dominated by craggy peaks and alpine lakes. Pull on your boots and get trekking to really experience its spectacular beauty. You’re likely to come across spectacular glaciers, be invited into a yurt for some yoghurt or ushered to the sidelines of a ferocious game of goat polo.

Best time to visit Kyrgyzstan

Best time to visit Kyrgyzstan




Like most of Central Asia, the best time to visit Kyrgyzstan is spring and autumn. As well as being the best weather, in spring the desert flowers bloom and in autumn markets fill with fresh harvest produce. Summer can get very hot and winters are bitterly cold. Winter can also get quite wet and some roads may close due to snow.








Geography and environment






×

Geography and environment




With around 90% of Kyrgyzstan above 1500m, your adventure is sure to reach some heady heights. The Tian Shan (Heavenly Mountains) range takes up most of the country and around every corner appears another rolling hill or majestic peak. Kyrgyzstan is also home to some of Asia’s largest lakes, the most famous being Issyk-Kul in the northwest. Kyrgyzstan shares borders with
Kazakhstan
,
Tajikistan
,
Uzbekistan
and
China
.

Nature Places in Kyrgyzstan




Top 5 Back to Nature Places in Kyrgyzstan

1. Bush Camp

Bed down for the night in the Tian Shan ranges under a blanket of glittering stars. The only noises are from distant nomads herding their stock through the valleys.

2. Lake Song-Kol

This zoological reserve is surrounded by pastures that are favoured by nomadic herders. Don’t be surprised to see a fierce game of ulak-Tartys (goat polo). You may even get to ride out with the shepherds on their hardy ponies.

3. Djety Oguz Valley

Spend days hiking canyons and valleys surrounded by snow-capped peaks. Seven spectacular red sandstone cliffs stand guard over the entrance to the Djety Oguz Valley. Local tradition says that the cliffs were once wild bulls, immobilized by the gods to stop them terrorizing local yurt dwellers.

4. Karakol

Even in urban areas, Kyrgyzstan’s natural beauty abounds. Karakol is surrounded by orchards and mountains, with a lovely Russian church and colonial houses. Explore tree-lined streets that slope up towards glaciers and pine forests.

5. Lake Issyk-Kul

Take a beach break with a difference. This alpine lake has been a favourite holiday spot for locals for centuries. After relaxing on the beach, be sure to see the petroglyphs that date back to 500 BC.
