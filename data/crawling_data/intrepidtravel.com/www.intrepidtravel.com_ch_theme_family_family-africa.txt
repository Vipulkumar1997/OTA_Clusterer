Accommodation on Africa and Middle East trips


Whether you’re camping beneath the stars or high in the tree canopy overlooking the wilderness, accommodation in Africa and the Middle East is always surprising. Sleep on a Felucca whilst cruising the Nile, in a Bedouin camp beneath the sky of Wadi Rum or in a cave hotel in Tunisia (just like Luke Skywalker). On our Tanzania Family Safari, on the hunt for animals, you’ll spend a few nights in a two story Land Rover Suite. That’s a converted Land Rover parked right on the savannah.




A taste of what's in store..

Each of Intrepid's family trips has been built with a smooth blend of action-packed activities and flexible family time, just the way we like it. Want to know the sort of adventures you can expect with us? We’ve picked out a few of our favourites.











Visit a Zulu village in South Africa

Zulu villages are still traditional affairs. Tribespeople live in thatched huts and make a living off the land. Girls help the women weave and cook while boys and men tend goats and cattle. Meet the villagers, learn about local life and explore the surrounding Hluhluwe–iMfolozi National Park.

Experience on
South Africa Teenage safari











Embrace sand and safari in the Saadani National Park

The continent’s big parks are all well and good, but only one straddles the divide between sand and safari: Tanzania’s coastal Saadani National Park. Head out on a sunrise walking safari, swap a game drive for a swim in the Indian Ocean and go hippo-watching on a boat trip down the Wami River.

Tanzania Family safari











Camp among the dunes of the Sahara

Picture it: you and the kids wake up in a Bedouin tent among the dunes of the Sahara. No sound but the wind over the sands and the occasional braying of a camel. Welcome to our Moroccan desert safari at the foot of the mighty Atlas Mountains.

Experience on
Morocco Family holiday











4x4 through the canyons of Wadi Rum

Wadi Rum is Jordan’s vast, empty, beautiful desert. It’s known as the Valley of the Moon, a huge sandy valley punctuated by soaring granite cliffs and sheer rock formations. We’ll load the family into a 4x4 for an action-packed drive through the dunes to your very own desert camp.

Reviews











South Africa Teenage Safari ,
October 2017

Heidi Daniell

An excellent trip, well put together with lots of variety - we were very lucky and saw the big 5 plus more. 
Be prepared for basics - it is all part of the experience. Go with the flow and see what opportunities present themselves and work with the guides. Ours were excellent. They were passionate about their country, the animals and making our trip memorable.

South Africa Teenage Safari ,
August 2017

Heike Daams

Great trip with a lot of variety: culture, landscape, animals, ocean; basic camping to nice lodge; snorkeling, rafting, game drives and walks, a little bike tour. The concept of teenagers and parents traveling in the group and helping with cooking, dishes and tents is great for all parts, we had a really fun and relaxed time. Finally a very good, experienced and knowledgeable guide with a good humor made this trip a success. 
Nights are cold (bring a warm sleeping bag and clothes), but otherwise the weather is perfect in August, nice warm days, no mosquitos and little other bugs, snakes, and good game viewing.
The only minus for me was the long travel time in the bus and little physical movement.

Egypt Family Holiday ,
July 2017

Brian Guerrero

The Egypt Family Holiday was a fun and safe trip.  Our family enjoyed the diverse activities and sampling all the food.  The temples and tombs were amazing to see.  Going inside the Pyramid of Giza was a big hit with our son.  We would recommend investing in good hats and a CamelBak hydration backpack.
