India



There’s probably no other country on the planet that blazes its way into your memory like India.


Years later, you can still hear the morning calls of the chai wallahs and the silence of the desert, see smoke curling over the Ganges and a pale gold Varanasi sunrise. A lot of India tours rush from highlight to highlight, ticking them off in a blur of temples and tikka. But not us. Our India trips are more about spotting Bengal tigers in Bandhavgarh NP, hanging with nomads in Jaisalmer, meeting the holy men of Pushkar or camping under the stars in Bijaipur. This isn’t the India you see on postcards. This is India as it
is
. Raw, bizarre and totally addictive.

Classic South India,
November 2017

Helen Loudon

The most frustrating thing was getting an Indian Visa, they don't make it easy, but I'm not sure there is much you can do about it.

Review submitted 04 Dec 2017











Classic South India,
November 2017

Mary Landen

What was especially unique about my latest Intrepid trip (to South India), is that there were just six of us, and we were all solo travelers, representing five countries. That made the trip extra enjoyable!

Transport in India

Intrepid believes half the fun of experiencing a new country is getting there, and getting around once there! Where possible, Intrepid uses local transport options and traditional modes of transport - which usually carry less of an environmental impact, support small local operators and are heaps more fun.

Depending on which trip you're on while in India, you may find yourself travelling by:







Jeep

Safari through jungles and national parks aboard a jeep, which is ideal for conquering the difficult terrain and offers supreme wildlife viewing opportunities.


Kathmandu to Delhi

Classic Rajasthan










Camel

Swaying along the hot, desert sands while riding a camel is an unforgettable way to leave the city behind and embrace a slice of Indian isolation.


North India Adventure

Boat

Cruising the waterways of India is a revealing, inspiring experience. Whether it’s the iconic Ganges or peaceful Kerala backwaters, seeing India from the water is a must.

Train

Travelling by train is one of the great experiences of India. It's a system which looks like chaos, but it works - and well.

Accommodation in India

When travelling with us in India you may find yourself staying in a:







Homestay

Make new friends, feast on authentic home cooking and receive kind hospitality while staying with friendly families in India.

Best time to visit India




Due to India's size and topography, there's a huge amount of variation in its climate. One of the most beneficial times to visit is from September to March when temperatures are at their coolest. During winter (December-January), temperatures can get quite cold in Delhi and in the north, especially at night. Monsoon is from late-May to around October and offers hot and humid conditions, although this is considered one of the best times to visit Ladakh and the hills.








Culture and customs

Culture and customs




As one of the oldest living civilisations in the world, India's customs are based on an ancient cultural heritage. As contemporary India changes at a rapid pace, it stills clings to time worn traditions that have been in existence for centuries. Modern India is made up of a fascinating blend of ethnicities and religions, and as the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, any visit to India will undoubtedly be steeped in spirituality as it permeates most aspects of society. Although there are significant populations of Muslims and Christians, most Indians belong to one of the four main religions mentioned above.

Regardless of a person's religious beliefs, the family unit is given paramount importance in life and society, with generations of family members living together under one roof, often with the eldest male acting as head of the family. Indian weddings are usually elaborate affairs and arranged marriages are still common - being arranged according to caste, social standing and sometimes, favourable astrological alignments at birth. Giving the world everything from playing cards to prayer flags, yoga, cotton cultivation, ayurvedic medicine, Bollywood films, as well as many other important contributions in mathematics, science, literature and political theory, India's evolution has impacted on the entire world.

Indian cuisine, architecture, dance and fashion are also admired and reproduced worldwide, which is partly due to Indian populations who have immigrated to other parts of the world, taking their culture and beliefs with them.








Eating and drinking

Eating and drinking




Intrepid believes that one of the best ways to experience a country is by eating! Whether you're sampling street food, savouring a cheap eat or indulging in a banquet, there are endless options to choose from wherever you are in the world.

Indian food is one of the world's most favoured cuisines, and travellers will be in for a real treat when visiting India. Relying heavily on spices and vegetables, vegetarians will be delighted with the multitude of meat-free dishes available and visitors will be able to notice marked differences in the cuisines of each region.

Things to try in India

1. Goa

The tropical climate and coastal location ensures the seafood is fresh and tasty here. Pungent seafood curries bubbling in coconut milk, as well as fresh crab, lobster, squid and prawns are all great picks in this region. A Kingfisher beer also goes down well with a Goan sunset.

2. Rajasthan

With little access to water, Rajasthani cuisine relies on milk or ghee as a base, making it quite rich. Legumes, pulses and breads feature heavily as access to fresh vegetables is scarce.

3. Kerala

A great producer of many spices so expect hot and spicy dishes when eating here. Rice is abundant, as is coconut, so expect coconut-based curries laced with chilli, ginger, cardamom and pepper. Having access to many waterways, seafood also features on the menu here. Dosa (pancake-like crepes) are popular breakfast items in Kerala.

4. Assam

The cuisine of this north-eastern hills region is characterised by a reliance on rice and preserved produce. There is a distinct lack of spice used but despite this, the cuisine still possesses a strong flavour due to the dried herbs and flavoursome vegetables and fruits that most dishes are based on. Pickles, salads, garnishes and condiments like mustard oil, lemon and mangosteen add a distinct flavour to Assamese dishes.

5. Gujarat

Cuisine from western India is predominantly vegetarian. Daal, rice and roti (flat bread) are the main dishes, which are sometimes supplemented with stir fried vegetables.

History and government




Early History

India has been inhabited by humans for as long as 75,000 years, with early civilisations flourishing as early as 3300 BC. Subsequent civilisations showed advanced technology and infrastructure with drainages systems and houses made of brick appearing sometime between 2600 and 1900 BC. Over the centuries, India both influenced and was influenced by other nations and kingdoms, with far reaching trade, conquest and migration spreading the subcontinent's culture far and wide. Trading with the Romans, Persians and Greeks ensured that Indian culture had an impact on civilisations that seemed worlds away. Empires rose and fell over the centuries, with the wealthy Mughal Dynasty ruling most of India by 1600. At the same time, different European nations started showing an interest in India after being brought to the area for trade. The Portuguese, Dutch, British and French all had vested interests in India, with the British East India Company being given the rights to trade in India in 1617. The 1857 rebellion and War of Independence culminated in the decline of Mughal rule and were considered the first movements against the British Raj's heavy handed rule of the country. India's independence movement continued to grow and soon changed the face of India's future.

Recent History

By the 1920s, India's independence movement had grown considerable momentum with Mohandas Gandhi leading mass movements based on passive resistance and non-cooperation against the British Raj. Although it took decades, India finally gained independence in 1947. More recently, India has seen dramatic changes in society mainly due to modernisation and globalisation. A new wave of prosperity has seen the rise of the middle class, with men and women entering into new work roles in telecommunications, manufacturing and business. India's large cities are dealing with mass migration of rural citizens, who are moving to the city to seek better employment, education and opportunities for their children. Delhi successfully hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010, further putting India on the map as an increasingly cosmopolitan, modern country.








Sensory Experiences of India

Sensory Experiences of India




Top 10 Sensory Experiences of India

1. Potent Pleasures

Breathe in the intoxicating aroma of fresh spices while wandering through the bustling markets of India. Cardamom, coriander, cinnamon and nutmeg are classic spices of the subcontinent and aren't hard to find - the fresh scent envelopes markets across the country.

2. Fiery Flavours

Treat your tastebuds to the spicy flavours of India with a traditional aromatic curry. Indulge in the heady mix of coconut milk, chilli, ginger, ghee and spices, then cool down by sipping on a refreshing Lassi - the prefect antidote to the unrelenting heat of an Indian curry.

3. Colourful Chaos

Experience the urban cacophony of Delhi - a unique collision of cultures, cattle and people. Hear the rumble of cars, truck and buses, the frantic calls of street vendors and hawkers, the sizzle of food and the rustic ring of a cow bell in this unforgettable and irrepressible city.

4. In The Pink

Admire the dazzling pink hues of Jaipur. Watch the historic palaces, forts, temples and monuments of the 'Pink City' be bathed in a dusky pink glow as the golden sun sets over the dramatic Aravalli Range.

5. Rat Race

Walk barefoot through the Karni Mata Temple as thousands of rats scamper across the marble floor. Just felt a furry rodent scurry over your feet? Fear not - it's a sign of good luck in this unique rat-worshipping temple.

6. Instant Karma

Experience the multi-sensory wonder of an Aarti ceremony on the banks of the Ganges. Hear the clanging of bells, watch the luminous glow of fire, smell wafts of pungent incense and hear rousing devotional songs and mantras. Be immersed in the fire and prayer of this Hindu ritual and be changed forever.

7. Gorgeous Goa

Sit beachside in Goa and gaze into the sublime beauty of the ocean. Take a moment to kick back and soak up the clear skies and deep blue sea of this exotic island. Watch the sun's rays shimmer on the horizon and bask in the golden glow of this balmy retreat.

8. Silky Sophistication

For a slice of extravagance, feel the soft, luxurious touch of traditional Indian silk. Made in a variety of vibrant colours and perfect for making everything from saris to prayer mats and decorative hangings to upholstery, the inimitable feel of finely crafted silk is a simple pleasure in life.

9. Answered Prayers

Hear the flutter of prayer flags as they flap in the wind near the isolated monasteries of Dharamsala. In a stark environment of rugged, mountainous landscapes, quietness permeates the air, except for the unique sound of prayer flags collecting prayers and sending them to the heavens above.

10. Big Screen Brilliance

Be treated to a feast for the senses at a bombastic Bollywood movie screening. Covet the glamorous costumes, marvel at the energetic choreography and delight in the lively music. Revel in the razzle dazzle of the whole spectacle and be swept away by the irresistible charm of India's triumphant cinematic phenomenon.








Shopping

Shopping




India's fragrant bazaars, modern boutiques and village markets are brimming with wares harnessing centuries of artistic traditions. With talented artisans and top quality items at low prices, India is a shopper's paradise.

It's a good idea to check with your local customs officials to ensure that you are able to bring certain items back into your home country. Australia and New Zealand generally have strict quarantine laws.

Things to buy in India

1. Jewellery

From big, chunky ornate silver earrings to vibrant bangles and bold statement rings, India's silversmiths and jewellery makers ensure there are lots of pieces to choose from in the bazaars and shops.

2. Wraps, Scarves and Shawls

Whether you're looking for pricey pashmina, luxurious silk or colourful cotton, India has a huge variety of materials to wrap yourself in.

3. Tea

If you're lucky enough to be able to bring tea into your home country, then pick up some of the world's finest tea from the Darjeeling, Assam or Nilgiri regions.

4. Linen

Indian cotton sheets, embroidered bed spreads and colourful cushion covers can be picked up in bazaars at a fraction of the price paid elsewhere.








Festivals and Events in India

Festivals and Events in India




Holi

Travellers get a chance to revel in a tangible rainbow at this festival, which occurs throughout different regions of India. While northern India has the largest celebrations, Goa and some other areas also participate in this festival with Hindu origins. Colourful powders fly through the air onto crowds of people; water balloons explode in the street, food and drink flow and devotees slip into trances - all culminating into a wonderful festival of vibrancy.

Diwali

See firecrackers, lanterns, gift giving and gift receiving during this Hindu festival of lights. While many shops and businesses close during this period of spiritual significance, it's still a special time to visit, with moving pujas (offerings) and rituals to witness.

Pushkar Camel Fair

Thousands of camels (and their owners dressed in their finest garb) descend upon Rajasthan's Pushkar for the annual camel fair. Camels are traded and raced, acrobats and performers entertain crowds at a nearby fair, while finely dressed males and bejewelled females take the chance to let their hair down.

Your safari arrangements cannot be completed without this information.







Is tipping customary in India?









While not mandatory, tipping porters, drivers, restaurant staff and other service workers is considered polite. When taking into account the low wages earned by the average Indian person, a small tip of 5-10% of the service is a gracious way to show your appreciation.







What is the internet access like in India?









The internet has grown rapidly in India, so finding Wi-Fi access and cyber cafes in the large cities and regional centres won't be a problem. Smaller towns, isolated areas and rural villages may have limited to no access.







Can I use my mobile/cell phone while in India?









Mobile phone coverage is generally good in urban areas, but can be patchy and less reliable in rural and mountainous areas. Ensure global roaming is activated on your phone before you arrive.







What are the toilets like in India?









Squat toilets are the most common toilets in India. Always carry your own toilet paper and soap or hand sanitizer, as they are usually not provided. Western-style flushable toilets can be found in up-market restaurants, five-star hotels and in some tourist areas.







What will it cost for a…?









Cup of tea = 5 INR
Small bottle of beer = 40 INR
Basic street food plate = 40-60 INR
Buffet dinner in a nice restaurant = 800-1500 INR







Can I drink the water in India?









It's not recommended to drink the tap water in India. Filtered water is a better option; try to use a refillable canteen or water bottle rather than buying bottled water. Remember to avoid ice in drinks and peel fruit before eating.







Are credit cards accepted widely in India?









Credit cards are usually accepted by modern hotels, restaurants and medium-to-large shops in tourist areas. Smaller shops, cafes, market stalls and places in remote areas probably won’t have facilities that support credit cards, so ensure you have enough cash to cover expenses while in rural areas or when visiting smaller vendors and bazaars.







What is ATM access like in India?









ATMs can be found in India's large cities so finding one shouldn’t be a problem. Smaller towns and isolated areas will have very few or none at all, so have enough cash to cover purchases when out of major cities.







Do I need to purchase travel insurance before travelling in India?









Absolutely. All passengers travelling with Intrepid are required to purchase travel insurance before the start of their trip. Your travel insurance details will be recorded by your leader on the first day of the trip. Due to the varying nature, availability and cost of health care around the world, travel insurance is very much an essential and necessary part of every journey.

Responsible Travel

Intrepid is committed to travelling in a way that is respectful of local people, their culture, local economies and the environment.

Top responsible travel tips for India

1. Be considerate of India’s customs, traditions, religion and culture.

2. Dress modestly and respectfully. Shoulders to knees should be covered, especially when entering places of worship.

3. For environmental reasons, try to avoid buying bottled water. Fill a reusable water bottle or canteen with filtered water instead.

4. Always dispose of litter thoughtfully, including cigarette butts.

5. When bargaining at markets, stay calm, be reasonable and keep a smile on your face. It's meant to be fun!

6. Learn some local language and don't be afraid to use it - simple greetings will help break the ice.

7. Shop for locally made products. Supporting local artisans helps keep traditional crafts alive.

8. Refrain from supporting businesses that exploit or abuse endangered animals.

9. Please ask and receive permission before taking photos of people, including children.

10. When on community visits or homestays, refrain from giving gifts or money to locals.
