Fitness



Whether you’re a couch potato or a health nut looking to get moving, the goal of getting fitter most certainly seems a daunting one. Why not get the ball rolling with a week at a fitness retreat where you’ll be assessed and a carefully planned routine to kick off your new fitness lifestyle can be introduced. From getting you moving and showing you the best type of exercise for your body type to how to integrate the new routines into your busy lifestyle – the spa experts will guide you and ensure your fitness routine can become a lasting one.



Popular choices include boot camp spa escapes where you’ll be pushed to get that heart racing, bike programmes to speed up your blood flow and yoga retreats where meditation and breathing techniques ensure your body is properly invigorated. Enjoy hiking? Join a nature spa where treatments offer the option of challenging yourself to the surrounding hills and mountainsides. Yoga, Pilates, kick boxing or simply the resort gym – there are one on one trainers, or group sessions so you can decide your own pace.

Whether you’re looking to strengthen your upper body, improve your body shape or increase your cardiovascular fitness – there’s a fitness retreat program for you. The best advantage is you’ll get to enjoy the views, sights and spa facilities while training with experts so your break will leave you feeling strong, fit, and healthy with lasting holiday memories of your fantastic spa location.

Discover our selection of fitness retreats below or contact our wellness experts, who will give you unbiased advice on how to tailor the right programme for your individual needs. Call on 020 7843 3597 or submit
