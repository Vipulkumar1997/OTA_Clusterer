Gilly - 26 Nov 2017

Karen was so helpful and responsive to all my concerns and everything about my holiday was perfectly organised. Sha Wellness Clinic Retreat, 4 Day Discovery Programme: A very high level of professionalism was shown and the programme was designed to give you an insight into all the different therapies that they can provide. The macrobiotic cuisine was exceptional.

Luxurious yet medical and delivers excellent health results



CD - 5 Oct 2016

Hi, I returned from SHA on Monday feeling refreshed and fantastic and having lost some weight which was great. The place is amazing, I was so impressed with everything. A big thank you to you for helping arrange it all. Hopefully I will be in contact to book next year!



RK - 3 Feb 2016

After a little over-indulgence over the festive period I was in serious need of a detox and thanks to the incredible SHA Wellness Clinic I got just that. A week on the SHA Detox Programme was just what I needed to feel like my usual self again, thank you for the excellent recommendation. The personalised diet and exercise plan made me feel like I was getting exactly what I needed, and I definitely feel a lot healthier now. I have more energy, my skin looks brighter, and I even dropped a couple of pounds, all my friends have noticed the difference so I've made sure to recommend SHA and Healing Holidays to all of them, thank you once again!



CR - 14 Oct 2015

I went to SHA Wellness Clinic for a week on their weight-loss programme and it was a great experience. I had mixed feelings before I left, excited by the prospect of losing a few pounds but dreading the actual process it would take to do that, but I needn't have worried. No it's not a walk in the park, but if you are serious about losing weight that's not what you need. It's challenging but it's rewarding - and the diet was actually surprisingly enjoyable. The staff are attentive, the location is beautiful, and most importantly I lost weight. I am now planning to stick to the health plan they have given me so I continue on my path to reach my goal weight. Thank you for all your help organising the retreat.



MB - 3 Dec 2015

Wow - that's all I can say really. I have struggled to quit smoking for years and after a week at SHA Wellness Clinic on their anti-tobacco programme I have never had more confidence in my ability to quit, I am yet to have a cigarette since my return and what more can you really ask than that? The way they get to the root cause of your addiction in the psychotherapy sessions makes all the difference and all the other treatments you have certainly help ease the stress that can come with not being able to smoke.I believe this was a great investment in my healtth so thank you for your recommendation and organising everything for me, I will certainly be recommending Healing Holiday.



Anita - 12 Aug 2015

We really enjoyed our stay at SHA Wellness Clinic. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. The accommodation was excellent and our journey to and from was good! We were particularly lucky with the young lady who served all our meals, she was so helpful especially if my daughter was still hungry. The facilities are very good and whilst they said they were full there never seemed to be a scrum at any time. We would certainly go again!



R. Thomson - 4 March 2015

I spent a week at SHA Wellness Clinic and I was most impressed by the rooms, the facilities and most of all by the professionalism of the staff. The macrobiotic food was beautifully presented and I undoubtedly felt much better after a week on it. The treatment facilities were first class and the range available was amazing. I was slightly sceptical before I went, I just wanted to see an osteopath, but the results said it all and my husband thought I looked 10 years younger when I got home!









"I had a fantastic service from healing holidays. Tracey was so friendly and helpful."
