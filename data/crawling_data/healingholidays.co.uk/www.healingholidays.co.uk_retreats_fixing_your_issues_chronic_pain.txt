Chronic Pain

Fixing your issues



Any ongoing pain that persists longer than the reasonably expected healing time for the involved tissues, should be considered chronic pain. This is a widespread problem that affects millions of people of all ages around the world. Here are some programmes that will support you on the road to recovery, with a combination of treatments available during your retreat. These treatments will resolve the underlying problems that govern patterns of imbalance in the mind and body, applying a combination of alternative holistic therapies; as well as western medication and surgical procedures. Wellness practitioners also use a variety of treatments and techniques, to assist their patients to take responsibility for their own health, and for them to achieve overall wellness and patient education on lifestyle and self-care.

Invest in your health and be amazed by the better quality of life you could experience. Take a look at a few of our programme suggestions below, give us a call on 020 7843 3597 or contact us

for advice.
