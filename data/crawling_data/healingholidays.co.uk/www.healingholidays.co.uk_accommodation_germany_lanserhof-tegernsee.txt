Lanserhof Tegernsee


Germany
,
Europe


Healing Holidays Exclusive





Lanserhof Tegernsee is one of Europe's leading clinics, offering cutting-edge medical expertise within the settings of a top class luxury health resort. It offers the unique LANS Med Concept that combines the Mayr cure, traditional naturopathy and the most advanced medical techniques. The Mayr cure is based on the concept that intestinal cleansing, flushing toxins from the stomach is key for your wellbeing - everything comes back to the gut. The FX Mayr method is built on three pillars: rest (tea-and-water), detoxification (cutting out sugar, alcohol and raw food), and training (chewing thoroughly and without distraction to help your body process food better).

Unlike other medical spas, the programmes here are not just about the medical side of wellness, they also take a holistic approach to your wellness. You can choose from a range of programmes from weight loss, detox and holistic health, to a complete medical wellbeing overhaul such as mental training, movement therapy and programmes for beauty and aesthetics. Also available are modern preventative services like capsule endoscopy, where you swallow a pill camera that records your intestinal health, or head to the Cell Gym to optimise the energy your cells produce, or a comprehensive gene and DNA testing with a detailed analysis by expert doctors. Meal plans are recommended by your doctor and include organic sun-ripened produce; biophotonic meat; and humanely grown ingredients - all designed to optimize your digestive powers.Lanserhof programmes are tailored to your individual body requirements ensuring that your journey is suited to your exact needs and body type, not a one-size-fits-all solution.

Located above Lake Tegern, in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, the resort extends across 21,000 square metres, amongst rolling hills, beautiful meadows and fresh streams. Set in the midst of serene natural surroundings, Lanserhof offers a retreat to renew your life energy that everyday life drains from you. The resort has 70 rooms and suites, all designed for total privacy and tranquillity with calming neutral colours, warm natural materials, and vast balconies to take in the perfect view. Some rooms even have a sauna in the bathroom. Daily treatments are planned light, leaving you plenty of time to enjoy other activities like yoga, ta'i chi and kinesis workouts, there are also nightly classical concerts when life slows down in the evening.

A stay at Lanserhof Tegernsee will give you the tools and knowledge to self-heal and endure a healthy and happy life full of vitality.

Lanserhof Tegernsee Review



Healing Holidays founder, Frances Geoghegan, recently visited Lanserhof Tegernsee. Here is her revie...

Michelle - 3 Feb 2016



I have just got back from Lanserhof and want to thank you for the recommendation. I went mainly to detox after feeling slightly more sluggish than usual and hoping for something to perk me up a bit - I left feeling completely transformed, as if the clock had been turned back. I have new levels of energy I don’t think I have experienced in years, I’m determined to carry on with as much of the programme as possible to sustain these incredible results. I already hope to return and see what more I can achieve at this fantastic clinic.











Alice - 16 Feb 2016



I rang Healing Holidays, on a recommendation from a friend.  It was a very different experience from dealing with my regular travel agent. I had a very in-depth consultation with Frances, who asked lots of questions about my health, and ultimately what I wanted to achieve from my wellness break. She had been to Lanserhof, and felt that this was the place for me. She  told me which doctor would suit me, what treatments would help me, and her top tips for getting through a week at Lanserhof. I have to say she was spot on, and I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Most importantly, I addressed my h...











JW -19 Nov 2015



I went a little sceptical, but after completing the retreat at Lanserhof Tegernsee I can say I am a firm believer in the Lans med concept. I wasn't sure whether I would really see results after just a week but I did, and not just this but thanks to the advice of the doctors I know how to sustain them, you really get to learn so much about yourself here. Thank you for the recommendation, you certainly put this medi-spa newcomer at ease and I will definitely come back to Healing Holidays again for all my future spa needs.











MR - 2 Jan 2016



I had an amazing time at Lanserhof Tegernsee, thank you so much for recommending the retreat - I'm already thinking about when I can go back and do it again. Everything here was faultless, the location was beautiful, the doctors were friendly and really knew their stuff, and most importantly the treatments were effective. This is a true gem of a place that everyone must try.











SP - 12 Dec 2015



My stay at Lanserhof Tegernsee was a truly life-changing experience, I cannot thank you enough for organising my retreat. I went on the Lans Med Basic Programme for 7 nights and added extras when I got there and it was exactly what I needed! From the moment of arrival right the way through to my final consultation it was clear that I was in the hands of experts, they know exactly what you need and make sure that you get it, after my detox I can honestly say that I can see and feel the difference. I will be sure to recommend Lanserhof and Healing Holidays to all my friends, thank you again!










Insider's Tips



Reserve you place at Lanserhof early, don’t dither, this is the hottest place on the planet right now.

Do go to the evening talks and discussions, they are packed full of helpful information and tips. Also, make sure you do a cookery class, so you can replicate some of their delicious, yet super healthy dishes on your return.

Stock up on Lanserhof food stuff from the shop - spelt porridge, crackers and biscuits. Also, buy their great cookery book for inspiring recipes.

Take good walking boots with you, the surrounding area is stunning and there is nothing more healing than a brisk walk in the pure German air.

Ask our healing experts for the daily activity programmes in advance of your trip, so you don’t miss out on classes. You can then schedule your programme around them.

If you are travelling alone, join the single table for meal times, its fun, and you will meet new friends who are going through the detox with you. It's great for moral support.

If you are a golfer, then take your clubs, there is a challenging picturesque course on site.











Programmes



This exquisitely modern clinic has the solution for any problem, pioneering the LANS Med Concept – a pioneering holistic health concept based on the findings of F.X. Mayr. The staff takes pride in giving each guest their full attention by tailoring programmes to individuals, everything from diet to treatments is decided after the initial consultation with the doctors.
