Lefay Resort & Spa Lago Di Garda


Italy
,
Europe






Part of the Lefay Resorts Collection, Lefay Resort & Spa Lago Di Garda is located on Lake Garda in a stunning eleven-hectare national park surrounded by olive trees, rolling hills and breath-taking views. The concept of Lefay is to embrace overall wellness throughout your whole holiday – everything from the food to the natural surroundings and spa treatments contributes to your wellness. Light and modern rooms lend themselves to a peaceful night's sleep, while the impressive selection of facilities, activities, and dining options ensure every single one of your needs is easily met. Lefay Resort & Spa has won numerous awards, including the Tatler SPA Awards 2017: “Best for East-West Fusion”. The facilities are integrated into the surrounding countryside and were constructed to use renewable energy resources that have allowed the resort to reduce carbon emissions by more than 1,000 tonnes per year. You will find that Chinese Medicine plays a significant part in many of the retreats, yet it is the comprehensive approach that is taken towards your wellness here that makes Lefay so effective. A serene space, your stay at the resort is sure to be a restful and rejuvenating experience and one that you'll want to relive time and time again.

Please note
: The property will be closed between 7th January 2018 – 1st February 2018

Feefo Reviews












Jo - 19th March 2017



It’s rare to find such a place as Lefay, in such a beautiful location, the hotel exudes elegance, refinement and sophistication, everything you’d expect from a 5 star resort and more. One of Lefay’s best attributes is its homely and welcoming feel, from the staff, to the décor, the whole aura surrounding Lefay is one of comfort and peace.The spa was world class, the treatments unbeatable and the food is cooked to perfection. I cannot say enough about this place, I simply loved the week I spent there. Perfect.











Eileen - 2nd April 2017



I and my husband have had the most wonderful week, taking the time to lose some weight and reconnect with ourselves. The practice and theory of Chinese medicine is integral to the ethos of the Spa and programmes. The staff were just wonderful and ever so accommodating. Dr Barbieri and colleagues were both helpful and professional. Each member of staff within the resort made us feel very comfortable and made a real effort to engage with us. The gym was fantastic and well equipped whilst the pools both (the heated indoor/outdoor and the lap pool) were pristine.We had an amazing time during our s...











Paula - 17 June 2016



My stay at Lefay Resort was perfect and exactly what I needed. The staff were so helpful, my room lovely, and of course my fitness programme was exactly what I was hoping for, I really noticed results and most importantly I feel so much more motivated to work harder now that I'm back home.  Thank you for your recommendation and ensuring everything went so smoothly for me.










Insider's Tips



Families are welcome and the Paolino's Club offers a range of fun activities, games and entertainment for children aged 3 years and above. Open daily from 11am-7pm.

The hotel is on a hill in a national park making it difficult to walk to a town or the coast.  They have a free daytime shuttle to town, but opting for car hire is recommended.

The Lefay SPA Method uses the oldest form of phytotherapy within its programmes: the herbal tea. Be sure to imbibe.

There are no pre-arrival forms so please share any special requests with the Healing Holidays team at the time of booking.
