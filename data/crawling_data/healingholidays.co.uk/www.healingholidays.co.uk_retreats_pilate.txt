Pilates




Pilates Retreats
Pilates is a growing exercise trend that is becoming the exercise of choice to achieve a flat stomach and a long, lean and toned body. Originally used for rehabilitation purposes, Pilates is a body conditioning routine that seeks to build flexibility, strength, endurance and coordination without adding muscle bulk.

Pilates also has an innovative mind-body exercise using a floor mat and variety of equipment which evolved from the principles of Joseph Pilates. The exercises concentrate on building strength from your core and can dramatically transform the way your body looks, performs and feels.


Inspiring Pilates Holidays
With Healing Holidays you will find inspiring places around the world to go on a Pilates retreat. From beginners programmes to advanced level, choose your pilates retreat overlooking the most beautiful scenery in Europe to Pilates reformer boot camps in Thailand.

Whatever you choose, we’ll get you away from everything except your passion for pilates.

Speak to our wellness travel consultants to book your Pilates retreat on 020 7843 3597 or enquire
