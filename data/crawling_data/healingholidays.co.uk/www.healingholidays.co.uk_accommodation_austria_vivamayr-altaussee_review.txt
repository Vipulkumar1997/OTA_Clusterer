Rita - 24 April 2017

Amazing experience in a beautiful clinic set in a very charming little town. The medical team were very professional and helpful. We have enjoyed the 2 weeks so much we are thinking of going back for more.



CB - 20 JUN 2016

My stay at VivaMayr was a huge success. I really enjoyed the experience and would definitely go back. My big mistake was only to go for one week!! The building, staff and situation were all fabulous... Thank you for arranging my stay, it really was wonderful.



Bruno – 28 Aug 2015

After experiencing Irritable Bowel Syndrome, I decided to book a stay at VIVAMAYR Altaussee with Healing Holidays. I can’t believe how much I learned about diet and nutrition. I feel armed with the knowledge to keep my digestion regular, and having gone through the programme, I feel about a decade younger. My energy levels are higher than they have been for a long while, and I owe it all to you and the Mayr principles!



Annie – 14 Sep 2015

Until I stayed at VIVAMAYR Altaussee, I hadn’t realised quite how worn down I was becoming. Although it took a bit of practise, I really enjoyed the mindful eating, and have continued the habit so far. My diagnostics tests were much improved when I left the clinic…  I completely trusted the knowledgeable staff, and I am so glad I did. VIVAMAYR and its beautiful views were just what I needed.



Pam – 10 Dec 2015

I thoroughly enjoyed detoxing at VIVAMAYR Altaussee. I’ve returned feeling healthier, fitter and slimmer. I have to admit, I was worried about the food, but the meals were excellent, all while adhering to the Mayr principles!  Thank you for offering me this great value retreat to improve my health.









"Great holiday experience at Swa Swara, exceptional food and service at the resort, highly recommended! I wouldn't stay again at Holiday Inn in Mimbay though as a part of the trip,"
