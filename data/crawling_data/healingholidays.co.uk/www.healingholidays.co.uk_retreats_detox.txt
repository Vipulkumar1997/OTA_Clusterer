Detox



Feeling sluggish and slow, irritable and grumpy, and with one too many headaches thrown in? A detox retreat could be the fastest way to remedy many of your every day niggling health concerns.



A detox retreat can help give your body a fresh start, renews energy levels, aids weight loss, and ultimately helps prevent disease by giving your digestion system a break and enabling your body to concentrate its efforts on healing. Every day we are exposed to toxins – both external and internal –and many natural health professionals believe that if left unchecked these toxins undermine and weaken the organs of the body contributing to everything from arthritis to irritable bowel syndrome. So, although weight loss is often an inevitable sidekick of a detox, even the thinnest of bodies will really benefit from a thorough cleanse.

Think of it as a spring clean for your insides. A detox retreat vary in their severity – from cutting out meat, wheat, sugar and dairy to living only off pure, fresh made juices. Discuss your expectations and concerns with us to pick the right trip for you. If you are overweight one of the best presents you can give yourself is a two week detox holiday.

Discover our selection of detox retreats below or contact our wellness experts, who will give you unbiased advice on how to tailor the right programme for your individual needs. Call on 020 7843 3597 or submit
