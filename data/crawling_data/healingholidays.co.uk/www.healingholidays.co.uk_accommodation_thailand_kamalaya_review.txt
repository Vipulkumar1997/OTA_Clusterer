Silvia - 6 August 2017

Kamalaya was the most amazing place & the package I had was just what I was looking for. I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a relaxing & healing holiday.



Lisa - 24 April 2017

A truly wonderful experience - relaxing and healing in a great setting. The chef is incredible and the food, service and the treatments are all superb. The community table is a great way to meet fun people and have company in the evenings but you feel very comfortable spending time alone there too.



Joan - 24 April 2017

A totally relaxing break. Staff were friendly. Accommodation, food and facilities first class. Would definitely return.



Marianna Hewitt - 1 Nov 2015

Me and my friend went for a 7 night stay and loved every minute! Went for a detox and rejuvenation programme and felt great at the end of it and lost a decent amount of weight. The service, pools, gym and food was all outstanding! That you very much Healing Holidays for your recommendation and advice.



Claire Edwards - 15 Dec 2015

Kamalaya is a hidden gem! The second time I booked Kamalaya with Healing Holidays... without regret! I completed a 7 day relax and renew programme and this was a reboot and reset for me both physically and emotionally. The friendly staff, great food and villas make detoxing easy. This was one of the best thing I could have done for myself.





A.M.Corry - 1 May 2015

I just wanted to thank you so much for recommending I go to Kamalaya. It was the perfect place for me to go at this point in my life, and the Asian Bliss package is very aptly named. I feel so much better for my time there. I loved the room - it was the perfect sanctuary. I would definitely go back, and I would definitely recommend Healing Holidays to everyone I know!

Mariana - 28 July 2015

I had an absolutely fantastic time at Kamalaya. It is amazing what we can accomplish in just 8 days or so! The food was gorgeous and the treatments were very effective, in particular the counselling sessions with Sujay (I did not get Rajeesh for that but had him for Pranayama and Chakra meditation as you reccommended). I also loved my recipe for Bach Flower medicine (prescribed by lovely Amel) and came back with a few interesting tips on Nutrition from Lauren.









"They were very helpful and managed to accommodate my needs and holiday dates. The emails and documentation was very detailed and provided me with a hassle-free holiday. Just had to check in and fly. Everything else was sorted.
The only reason I have chosen 4 start is because the payment portal on the site is not SSL secured and this should be changed immediately to give customers 100% peace of mind that no details can be stolen in the process. I paid over the phone instead."
