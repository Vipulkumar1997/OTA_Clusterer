VIVAMAYR Altaussee


Austria
,
Europe


Healing Holidays Exclusive





Spectacular beauty abounds at VIVAMAYR Altaussee’s charming health resort located in an unspoilt traditional alpine mountain region. Altaussee’s uber-talented medical director Dr.Sepp Fegerl and his enthusiastic team dive into the spiritual side of original F.X. Mayr medicine. The Mayr Cure is based on the principle that giving an overworked digestive system a break allows other parts of the body to begin to repair themselves. Such are its remarkable effects that the method has reached legendary status, especially when it comes to tackling issues such as stress, chronic fatigue, allergies, arthritis, migraine and sleep problems.

Local thermal waters inspired the invigorating salt based treatments and uncontaminated alpine air is utilised for oxygen therapies. Personalised VIVAMAYR detoxification programmes are based on the world renowned Mayr Cure, developed by influential physician Dr. Franz Xavier Mayr.  VIVAMAYR's cutting edge diagnostic techniques include applied kinesiology, comprehensive blood tests, ECG’s, mineral nutrient analyses, hormone testing, fatty acid analyses, CSA Stress tests and mineral nutrient analyses (CCX).

Please note
: The property will be closed between 14th December 2017 – 03rd January 2018

Rita - 24 April 2017



Amazing experience in a beautiful clinic set in a very charming little town. The medical team were very professional and helpful. We have enjoyed the 2 weeks so much we are thinking of going back for more.











CB - 20 JUN 2016



My stay at VivaMayr was a huge success. I really enjoyed the experience and would definitely go back. My big mistake was only to go for one week!! The building, staff and situation were all fabulous... Thank you for arranging my stay, it really was wonderful.











Bruno – 28 Aug 2015



After experiencing Irritable Bowel Syndrome, I decided to book a stay at VIVAMAYR Altaussee with Healing Holidays. I can’t believe how much I learned about diet and nutrition. I feel armed with the knowledge to keep my digestion regular, and having gone through the programme, I feel about a decade younger. My energy levels are higher than they have been for a long while, and I owe it all to you and the Mayr principles!











Annie – 14 Sep 2015



Until I stayed at VIVAMAYR Altaussee, I hadn’t realised quite how worn down I was becoming. Although it took a bit of practise, I really enjoyed the mindful eating, and have continued the habit so far. My diagnostics tests were much improved when I left the clinic…  I completely trusted the knowledgeable staff, and I am so glad I did. VIVAMAYR and its beautiful views were just what I needed.











Pam – 10 Dec 2015



I thoroughly enjoyed detoxing at VIVAMAYR Altaussee. I’ve returned feeling healthier, fitter and slimmer. I have to admit, I was worried about the food, but the meals were excellent, all while adhering to the Mayr principles!  Thank you for offering me this great value retreat to improve my health.
