Cuisine


There are several dining options to choose from at Amanpuri, and guests on wellness immersion programmes will benefit from the nutritional support and education that are offered as part of every retreat. Meals will be designed that reflect your nutritional and physiological needs, as well as the goals of your immersion. The aim of your set diet will be to stabilise blood sugar levels, reduce inflammation and harmonise gut flora while supporting the health and rebalancing of the digestive system. A variety of diets are on offer including raw, liquid, and cooked, and your personal preferences as well as any allergies or tolerances will be taken into account to ensure you enjoy meals that never leave you feeling deprived.


Activities


With a focus on holistic healing that nurtures both body and mind, the activities offered by the retreat also reflect this. Yoga, Pilates, and meditation are all readily available for guests to participate in, with Amanpuri offering plenty of space perfect for practicing these activities. For those seeking something even more strenuous there are also tennis courts to play on and a gym where you can benefit from personal trainer sessions. Muay Thai, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong are among some of the other classes also on offer, we especially love the beach bootcamp for getting fit with a view.

In addition to activities that will help your wellness experience, there are those which are more just for the sheer enjoyment. Located along a stretch of beautiful white sand, you’ll find plenty of water sports and activities on offer too such as kayaking, sailing, and diving. When you prefer something more relaxed you could opt for one of the cruises offered by the resort, or simply hang out by the large infinity pool.

Amanpuri Wellness Immersion: A Review



Healing Holidays Founder, Frances Geoghegan, shares her lowdown on her stay at Amanpuri. We all know...

PW - 26 August 2016



AmanPuri is pure bliss, I don't think I have ever felt more rested and taken care of than my time spent here. I opted for the Awareness Immersion because I've been feeling more sluggish and not quite myself lately, after just a week here I feel thoroughly renewed and refreshed. I would definitely return here again, even just for a more general holiday with a little bit of pampering thrown in! Loved everything about it, thank you for the recommendation!


















Programmes



Known as immersions, all retreats offered by AmanPuri will be completely tailored to your inidividual needs and goals upon arrival. Offering retreats for fitness, weight-loss, detox, and holistic healing, let the gentle yet comprehensive approach adopted at AmanPuri help you achieve optimal wellness.
