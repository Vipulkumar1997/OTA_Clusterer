Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof


Austria
,
Europe


Healing Holidays Exclusive





Tucked away in the Tyrolean Mountains is the 30-room Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof, a perfect family-run hidden gem. We came across this jewel a few years back and were bowled over by their take on Ayurveda, which also offers exceptional value for money, and is only a couple of hours from London.

In Austria, Dr Alaettin Sinop leads the Ayurveda team of 13 specialists along with Dr Guarav Sharma, and they offer a huge range of programmes, from Shirodhara to the full-on traditional Panchakarma detox, as well as acupuncture, and the best oil massages you will ever experience. In terms of activities, you have daily yoga, breathing exercises and meditation by the lake. The daily programme is comprehensive and there is a lot to keep you fully occupied.

The food is delicious and healthy, colourful and enticing. Nutrition plays a prominent role in Ayurvedic medicine and is considered one of the three pillars of health.  Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof offers a balanced vegetarian cuisine that is based on the principles of Indian healing but adapted to suit western taste buds. The ingredients are first class and sourced from the local farms and markets. In Ayurveda, there are three constitutional types (Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and the suggested meals for each constitution differ. Their Ayurveda specialist Gaurav Sharma provides guests with an Ayurvedic treatment programme with detailed instructions regarding meals.

Sonnhof is a family-run affair and the owner, Johann, is always on hand to ensure that guests have all they need for the perfect stay. He is assisted by his two daughters – Lisa, who teaches many of the yoga and meditation classes, and Christina, with her Ayurvedic degree, who is involved in the daily running of the Ayurveda programme. Sonnhof is perfect for those who would like to sample the principles of Ayurveda, without having to schlep to the Indian sub-continent. It’s just as good for the purists, and for those who know and love Ayurveda, and as it offers good value for money, it’s perfect for all spa lovers.

For more information, read a review of this wonderful spa, as featured in the Conde Nast Traveller Spa Guide 2016.

Please note
: The property will be closed between 26th November – 8th December 2017.

Spa


The concept of the AyurvedaCentre is ‘Tyrol meets India’ and the various spaces have been designed in accordance with the Ayurvedic philosophy that our bodies are temples that house our spirit. In the spa, senses are soothed in a relaxed, positive atmosphere and gently stimulated with exhilarating fragrances and peaceful sounds. The spa contains three saunas, created in accordance with Ayurvedic principles, and the Swasthya peace room provides the ideal environment for rest and relaxation before and after treatments. Other areas of the spa include infrared cabins, a yoga & OM meditation room, a Shakti (power) fitness room and the new Shiva Shaki lounge. The signature feature of the spa is a glorious panoramic indoor pool boasting direct access to the gardens and energy fountain.


Activities


Exercise, yoga and meditation are integral components of European Ayurveda®, so activites such as meditation and deep relaxation with healing sounds are regularly offered. For those who wish to amble, energetic healing walks with energy coaching and informative 'walk, cook & eat' wild herb forays will treat you to fresh air and get your blood flowing. Guests may also enrol in Spirit Yoga© classes or sign up for a personal Qigong or Yoga class. Educational talks and presentations on various Ayurveda themes are also available.

Those who prefer other outdoor activities can hike, mountain bike, ski or hike in the surrounding region.

Garden of the 5 Elements

The Shiva Shakti energy garden is an oasis with Alpine views that spans 1000 square metres and was designed according to Vastu teachings. With a focus on the 5 elements, the garden offers various energy spots such as the Gateway to the Heart rose garden, statues of Ganesha and Buddha, the Shakti fireplace, special Chakra places and more. There are also places of bliss and a place of compassion to be found in addition to an herb garden, bird table, landscaped natural garden pond and yoga and rest areas.


Location


Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof boasts a stunning hillside location in the Tyrol Mountain range on the high plateau of the Thiersee Valley. At an altitude of 900 metres, it provides incredible views of the surrounding mountain scenery.

The nearest airport is Innsbruck, just 55 miles away. Because flights do not operate directly here from the UK year round, guests can also fly to Salzburg (73 miles away) or Munich (83 miles away).

Healing Holidays' Review of Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof



Forever an Ayurveda enthusiast, Healing Holidays were intrigued when it was announced the ancient In...

Daya - 2 August 2017



I enjoyed my time in Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof. The resort is a heaven. I was so relaxed when I returned home back and recharged my energy to focus on my work. I will definitely come back to destress.











A. Weiss -  25 June 2016



I am so thankful that [my friend] Kim told me about Healing Holidays. After years of yoga practise, I was interested in an Ayurveda retreat and the recommendation of Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof was spot-on. I loved spending time in the mountains with the fresh air; I felt so serene. I really can't think of anything that would have made my stay better - unless I had stayed longer! Next time I'll opt for the Royal Ayurveda programme instead of the Ayurveda Taster... Thanks again!











C. Kelly - 19 March 2015



I've been back just over a week, and I'm still walking on air! I cannot speak too highly of Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof, it more than met my expectations and I can't wait to return.The hotel was comfortable, spa facilities great and the Ayurvedic treatments of the highest quality. The real surprise was the food, which I thought was fantastic; so healthy and delicious. I enjoyed the yoga and meditation too, plus hiking on one of many local routes. Staff were wonderful without exception, so helpful. I've found my ideal venue for instant rejuvenation, so thank you!











Caro - 6 Aug 2015



Sonnhof really is the perfect place to unwind and I was very happy to be solitary – in fact, that very fact that there were (so few) English people there meant I didn’t feel bad about not really engaging with everyone and could zone out! And the food was really amazing – that was the best surprise of all – there are definitely some dietary elements and pointers from the Ayurveda specialist I saw which I’m going to be bringing home with me. The location is just heavenly too and it was so nice to be able to go for fantastic hikes or go riding (which unfortunately di...










Insider's Tips



Really work during your programme, and choose a sauna to suit your dosha (body) before and after your treatment.

Make sure to stretch your limbs with the morning yoga.

Don’t shower after your spicy oil treatment. Though you may be tempted because of the smell, your skin will become baby-soft if you can keep it on overnight.

Pack for comfort, there are no airs and graces here.

Remember to pack a head scarf or hat, particularly if you have opted for a Panchakarma treatment.
