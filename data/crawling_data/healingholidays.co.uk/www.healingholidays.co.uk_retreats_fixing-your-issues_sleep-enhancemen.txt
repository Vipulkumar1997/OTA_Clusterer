SLEEP ENHANCEMENT

Fixing your issues



The focus of the Sleep Enhancement Programme is to re-establish healthy and restful sleep while addressing sleep issues and imbalances. Sleep is a time when our mind is refreshed and our body is nourished. Hopefully, after a good nights sleep, a new day brings fresh perspective and less stress. However if the stress starts affecting your sleep, which it surely will, your ability to think straight, be rational and cope with the challenges of life will be vastly reduced. In the long term stress will start breaking you down, and the saying that ‘stress is a killer’, is absolutely true.

Re-establish a healthy and restful sleep, both on retreat and in the long term, we offer programmes that include a combination of treatments and therapies from naturopathy, traditional Chinese medicine, massage therapy and mind-body balance.

Take a look at a few of our programme suggestions below, give us a call on 020 7843 3597 or contact us

for advice.
