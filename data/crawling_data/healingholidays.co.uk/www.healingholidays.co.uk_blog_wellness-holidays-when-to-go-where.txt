Wellness Holidays: When to go Where







Limited by what month you can travel, or want to know when the best time of year is to enjoy that dream retreat you’ve been thinking of? We’ve created this guide with out favourite wellness holidays to help you figure out when is the best time to go where.



January: Fixing Your Issues

You’ve set the New Year’s resolutions, now it’s time to stick to them. January is the perfect month to go on a retreat to
fix your issues
and get your year off to a flying start. Whether you are looking to give up smoking, cure a sleep problem, or deal with just about any other issue you’ve been struggling with, committing to a wellness retreat will have you so much more invested in making the change and increase your chances of success. We love the
Personalised Programme at
Vana Malsi Estate
which can be tailored to help you with just about any problem you would like to resolve, while
Kamalaya
offers a wide variety of programmes to cure different issues, such as their
Sleep Enhancement
programme for sleep problems and the
De-Stress Asian Bliss
programme for those who struggle to manage stress.

February: Detox Holidays

We’re all guilty of a little over indulgence over the festive period and colder months, but the result of it can leave us looking and feeling a little unhealthier than we would care for. Fix it in February by heading off on a
detox retreat
to rid your body of toxins and feel completely rejuvenated. Whether picking a Mayr clinic such as
Lanserhof Tegernsee
which will use a modern take on the Mayr cure to rid your body of toxins, or a medical spa like
SHA Wellness Clinic
where a blend of Western medicine and Eastern practices are used on their
SHA Detox Programme
to revitalise, there are plenty of options that will have you looking and feeling more radiant than ever in no time at all.

March: Weight-loss Holidays

Winter has left its mark on your body in the form of a few extra pounds and summer and the beach loom ever closer. Get a head start on your beach body and head off on a
weight-loss retreat
in March to rid yourself of your winter weight. There are plenty of options available to you, whether you stick within Europe with a visit to
VivaMayr Altausee
where your weight-loss will be encouraged through the use of the Mayr cure and an intense detox, or alternatively go further away and try
Chiva-Som
in Thailand where a combination of healthy diet, exercise, and education is used to help you lose weight and keep it off on their
Weight-Management programme.

April: Emotional Healing

In April not only spring-clean your home but your mind too and rid yourself of negativity on one of our
emotional healing retreats
. People often forget that it is just as important to look after our minds as it is to look after our bodies, and our emotional healing retreats will help you to resolve any issues of the mind. There are different retreats suited to different issues – for instance those interested in mindfulness might opt for
Vana Malsi Estate's
Personalised Programme
while those struggling with accepting change will likely benefit from
Kamalaya’s Embracing Change programme
which will help you with the way you view life changes. Pick the retreat that feels most right for you and be amazed at the improvement you see in your life afterwards.

May: Fitness Holidays

With the summer holidays just around the corner now is the perfect time to tone up and get in shape with a
fitness retreat
so you can feel your most confident when it’s time to ditch the layers and hit the beach. Better still, you could even combine your retreat with a holiday by heading to a resort like
EPIC SANA Algarve
in Portugal which is located right along the beach – workouts are always much more enjoyable when you can enjoy a great sea view at the same time! There are plenty of other great options out there too, another beachside favourite of ours is the
Rocco Forte Fit retreat at
Verdura Resort
, whereas if you would rather go further afield the
Chiva-Som

Optimal Performance Retreat
and
Kamalaya

Optimal Fitness Programme
are both great options found in beautiful Thailand.

June: Pampering Holidays

Summer is finally here and so are trips to the beach and holidays. Now is the perfect time to head off on a
pampering retreat
, whether to prep yourself for an upcoming holiday with some beautifying treatments or even if the retreat is your summer holiday itself. For those looking to stay closer to home a visit to
Capri Palace
in Italy is sure to provide the indulgent break you seek, or if you seek even more luxury opt for the impressive
Amilla Fushi
in the Maldives for a truly blissful break.

July: Ayurveda Retreat

July brings the monsoon season to India and though it may surprise you this is actually deemed the best time of year to go on an
Ayurveda retreat
. India is the home of Ayurveda and this is where you will find the very best retreats in the world, whether you opt for the
Personalised Programme at
Vana Malsi Estate
and have it tailored to focus on Ayurveda, or opt for a standard Ayurveda retreat at somewhere such as
SwaSwara
, your Ayurveda retreat during the monsoon season is sure to be a special experience.

However, there are some great options to be found outside of India too if you would prefer to avoid the monsoon altogether, one being the
Ayurvedic programme offered at
COMO Shambhala Estate
in Bali. For those who want to stay closer to home with an Ayurveda retreat in Europe, the offering at
Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof
is also excellent.

August: Yoga & Pilates Retreats

End your summer with a regenerative
yoga retreat
or
Pilates programme
. The health benefits of Pilates and yoga are countless, with the practices good for both our bodies and minds. After a busy summer the perfect way to bring balance back to your life is to head on a yoga or Pilates retreat (or one that combines the two!). Going on such a retreat is sure to give you the boost you need as we enter the latter stages of the year. We love the
Yoga Programme at Absolute Sanctuary
for a varied and comprehensive approach to yoga, or for those who want to practice in beautiful natural surroundings try the
Ananda Yoga Programme at Ananda
in India. When it comes to Pilates we highly recommend
COMO Shambhala Estate
in Bali which like Ananda is located amongst stunning surroundings, or if you would prefer a Pilates retreat in Europe, you could visit
Shanti-Som Wellness Retreat
in Spain for their impressive
Shanti-Som Pilates Retreat.

September: Holistic Healing

The best destinations to enjoy a
holistic healing retreat
have to be in Asia, and in September the weather tends to be especially pleasant in this part of the world making the entire experience all the more enjoyable. There are plenty of fantastic options available, such as the
Comprehensive Balance & Revitalise programme
found at
Kamalaya
which helps to address any imbalances between mind, body, and soul which might be affecting our wellness. Another favourite of ours is the
Oriental Medicine Programme
at
COMO Shambhala Estate
which combines modern science and ancient healing to promote your wellness.

October: Medical Spas

With the cold setting in once more, many of us may begin to feel a little under the weather, and a sure fire way to identify and address any ailments you’re suffering from is with a trip to a
medical spa
. There are so many incredible medical spas out there, and luckily for those who don’t want to travel too far the best can be found in Europe. There are the Mayr clinics such as
Parkhotel Igls
,
Lanserhof Tegernsee
, and
VivaMayr Altausee
which can help identify and treat health problems through careful application of the Mayr cure, while more general medical clinics such as
Grand Resort Bad Ragaz
and
SHA Wellness Clinic
use the latest cutting-edge technology and know-how to handle all manner of problems.

November: Anti-Ageing Programmes

With the party season just around the corner it’s only natural that many of us want to ensure we are looking and feeling our best at this busy time of year, and the best way to make sure that happens is to go on an
anti-ageing retreat
. Designed to help you look and feel more youthful, these programmes are a great pick me-up which will ensure you see the year out on a high. We’re fans of the
Sayanna Anti-Ageing programme at
EPIC SANA Algarve
which is tailored to each individual’s needs to ensure you get the best results. The
Anti-Age programme at
Palace Merano Espace Henri Chenot
is another great choice for those looking for a non-invasive medical approach to anti-ageing, as is
SHA Wellness Clinic’s
Rejuvenation Programme
. For those wishing to enjoy the unique benefits of Thalassotherapy, the
Longevity Life Rejuvenation & Anti-Ageing retreat at
Vilalara Thalassa Resort
will offer exactly what you seek, while those who want to escape the cold and venture further afield should definitely take a look at the
Signature Rejuvenation Retreat at
Fivelements

in Bali.

December: Stress Management Retreats

While the festive period of December is generally a fun time, it can also get rather stressful too. Take some time out during this month to head off on a
stress management retreat
and you won’t regret it. Head for a stress retreat in Europe with the
Anti-Stress Programme at
SHA Wellness Clinic
and
Stress Management programme at
Marbella Club
being our top picks. Alternatively you could jet off for some winter sun by picking the
Tension Release retreat at
Chiva-Som
or the
Stress-Management programme
at
COMO Shambhala Estate
. If you want a retreat that really addresses your individual stresses and issues, the
personalised programme at
Vana Malsi Estate
is a great option, as is
A Week at Golden Door
in California – both these programmes can be completely tailored to your unique needs and goals for a bespoke experience.
