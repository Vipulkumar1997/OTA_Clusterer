Austria



Take a deep breath and inhale the fresh mountain air - Austria is the perfect destination for a wellbeing escape. Be swept away by the stunning scenery and panoramas of the Alps, with plenty of hiking, biking and skiing on offer. Austria is an excellent choice for a detox or weight loss retreat, with the spas here focusing on a light diet and gentle exercise to help you achieve a healthy lifestyle. It is believed that many chronic disorders are caused by bad nutrition and lack of exercise, and Austria is the place to find the healthier version of yourself.

You’ll find both ends of the spectrum here, both medical spa and holistic healing, ensuring that there really is something for everyone. If it’s a detox you’re after, head to one of the medical spas situated upon a picturesque lake such as
VIVAMAYR Altausee
where you’ll find the Mayr cure offers the perfect solution. Alternatively, should you seek a more holistic cure to whatever hails you, then Austria is even home to one of the finest Ayurveda retreats outside of India,
Ayurveda Resort Sonnhof
.

Stunning scenery and a first class wellness offering combine to make Austria the perfect destination for your retreat. Whatever it is you seek, by the end of your stay in Austria you will feel completely revived, the fresh air alone enough to provide you with a new lease of life. Discover it’s enchanting magic for yourself and find yourself forever wanting to return.
