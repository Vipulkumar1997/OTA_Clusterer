Park Igls


Austria
,
Europe


Healing Holidays Exclusive





Located a few kilometres from Innsbruck, and circled by the Tyrolean Alps, Park Igls is a detox, medical clinic that adheres to the Mayr principle, (clean guts are the route to good health). Drawing on this famous theory of holistic wellbeing, the clinic believes that 80% of chronic disease is caused by bad nutrition and lack of exercise. Diagnostics are enhanced by the latest cutting-edge medical testing, as well as by alternative medical procedures. The clinic works closely with internationally renowned experts from the University Hospital in Innsbruck, so you will have access to the latest testing and treatments.

A stay here offers a major reboot to your system, so expect a light diet, a gentle exercise plan and a tailor-made course of treatments. Food and nutrition are a big part of your stay, and a diet plan, using locally-grown organic ingredients will be tailored for you. The food is surprisingly delicious, and there is a big effort to make it both tasty and pleasing to the eye. There are regular classes with the chef, so you can replicate dishes that are both healthy and wholesome, ensuring you retain vital nutrients in the cooking process.

Rooms are bright, contemporary and all have balconies with views of the Alpine mountains, where a waft of fresh pure air will improve your wellbeing instantly. There are daily guided walks into the surrounding countryside, yoga, aqua-aerobics, personal training and the best massages you will ever have - massages that will really treat your issues, and invariably performed by qualified physiotherapists. There is a cute spa with saunas, a hydrotherapy pool and steam rooms, as well as a lovely pool, BUT these are just the luxury trappings, as this is a serious medical clinic where you go to fix your health issues.

Please note
: The property will be closed between 16th December – 26th December 2017

Spa


Park Igls is all about F. X. Mayr Medicine, it does not just treat symptoms; it addresses the causes and prevents the symptoms through detoxification. Choose from seven therapeutic modules, two diagnostic modules and a range of seasonal programmes that focus on everything from skin to the musculoskeletal system with treatments including massages, detox baths, acupuncture, psychotherapy, sleep diagnostic sessions, ultrasounds and vitamin injections – to name a few. There’s also a range of beauty treatments including removal of spider veins, manicures and pedicures, detoxifying body treatments and facials.


Cuisine


Detox is a lifestyle, and the menu at the resort adheres to the ideas of Modern Mayr Cuisine. Food is light, simple and delicious, prepared using organic and locally-grown produce with herbs and spices rather than salt. There are eight possible diets ranging from herbal tea fasting to healthy eating; however, you will discuss your diet with the staff to address your own specific needs.


Activities


Parkhotel Igls offers grounds for walking, jogging and hiking for outdoors enthusiasts, and golfers are also spoilt for choice with three golf courses in the immediate vicinity. Group classes available include yoga, Pilates, stretching and training for target areas (such as stomach and back training) among others. Individual activity programmes can be developed during a consultation with a personal trainer. Guests also have access to an indoor swimming pool and fitness room with state-of-the-art cardiovascular equipment. Cosmetic and therapeutic applications are also available by appointment.

Jane - 24 April 2017



It was Great! Perfect place to unwind and get healthy. Spotlessly clean; great room; wonderfully friendly and welcoming staff (without being intrusive); stylish spa facilities; tranquil hotel environment and surroundings beautiful; gentle exercise; great food (even if you're losing weight); fantastic doctors - sensible with no selling of any additional services. Will be back!











AW - 22 MAR 2016



We LOVED Parkhotel Igls and the whole Mayr detox, and we can't fault the hotel or the treatments we received... Everything was top notch. Fantastic location. It's so easy to ski from the [hotel] as the cable car is a 5 minute walk away in the village.. Endless trails make this place a walker's paradise, and I managed an average of 10 miles a day! I have returned feeling very fit and mentally alert. The medical facilities and diagnostics are amazing, and I particularly recommend having the full ultrasound diagnostic package - worth every penny!











Irene - 4 JUL 2012



Although initially a bit intimidated to attend a medical spa, this is exactly the trip that I needed. The lovely scenery put me at ease, and the staff took care of my every need... Because of their kindness, I felt that they were sincerely concerned about my well-being... I really had nothing to be nervous about! Now that I've had such a wonderful experience, I'm really looking forward to booking another retreat with [Healing Holidays]!











Verity F - 16 JUN 2015



Thank you for sending me to Parkhotel Igls. I was super impressed with the thorough medical check-up and felt I was well-cared for throughout my stay. I enjoyed the whole atmosphere of Parkhotel Igls, and I can't wait to head back. My whole stay was nurturing, but after the first three days, I really felt re-energised and re-vitalised. Thanks again!











K. Empson - 17 FEB 2015



I had a wonderful stay, so thank you. It is probably one of the friendliest places that I have stayed and they were very accommodating to my vegan request. The medical facilities there are excellent and exceptionally clean which is very comforting when you are having medical tests in a foreign country. The staff were all very informative with regards to exercise, healthy diet etc. I would definitely go back.










Insider's Tips



Be sure to arrive on a Sunday night, as the whole programme is explained thoroughly by the doctors.

Bag a suite, on the north side of the property, where views are the best.

Pre-book a DVD player, and take your favourite box set, as the evenings are long.

Pack for comfort, not style – walking boots, trainers, swimmers and comfortable leisure gear.
