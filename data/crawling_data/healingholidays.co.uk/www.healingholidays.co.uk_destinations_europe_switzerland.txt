Switzerland



Enjoy the fresh alpine air and dramatic mountain scenery on a Swiss spa retreat. Switzerland is a serious spa destination where you can have almost any ailment checked. Think medi-spa meets pampering with an army of experienced doctors on hand. Have a thorough medical check-up where everything from weight reduction, nutrition, cardio-vascular disease or diabetes can be treated.

Detox and weight-loss are offered with stunning results (don't worry you won't be starved). Fitness is important too and in the warmer weather outdoor exercise is the way forward to the healthier version of yourself, although even in the colder months you will find that this mountainous country lends itself perfectly to winter sports as an alternative way of keeping fit.

Switzerland is the place to come to seriously overhaul your lifestyle. You’ll find that the charming scenery combined with the highly effective retreats leaves you inspired not only to throw yourself into your wellness programme, but to keep up all that you have learnt even after it is time to leave. It is amazing just what taking yourself out of your normal environment and heading somewhere beautiful and new can help you to achieve, and you will find that a visit to picturesque Switzerland immediately helps to dissipate any feelings of stress and sets you on the path to a much improved sense of health and wellbeing.

What’s more, with this being a European destination, Switzerland lends itself perfectly to short breaks and weekends away, perfect for those who are tight of time but are still after that well-deserved wellness break.
