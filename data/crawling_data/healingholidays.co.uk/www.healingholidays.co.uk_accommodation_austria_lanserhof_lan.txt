Europe


Healing Holidays Exclusive





An architectural stunner situated in the picturesque Tyrol region of Austria, Lanserhof Lans was originally opened in 1984 and it has just recently re-opened after a massive €25 million transformation.
Surrounded by Alpine beauty - rolling meadows, deep forests and glistening streams, this medical marvel also comes with all the luxurious trappings. Expect the perfect bed from which to enjoy the view from your floor-to-ceiling windows, an indoor/outdoor salt-water pool, the steam and sauna complex and state-of-the-art fitness equipment - it’s all there. But that’s not the reason to come to Lanserhof Lans. This is the spot to take the modern Mayr cure, for a deep detoxification, cleansing and de-acidification. It’s also the place for your top-to-toe medical checks with state of the art medical screening and body analysis. You can have everything from full blood tests and a heart ultrasound to food intolerances testing and a full physiotherapeutic examination. You can even sort your sleep problems once and for all at the sleep lab; the list is endless.

There is also a new LANS Sport Active programme, designed for those who want to up their fitness game without doing the purging and food deprivation. The Spa is also cutting edge, offering whole-body cryotherapy for pain relief and reducing inflammation. There is a beauty centre too with a host of luxurious treatments to savour. The surrounding area is breath-taking, so enjoy some Nordic walking, hiking, mountain biking or swimming. You can even brush up on your golf at three challenging courses nearby.

Simon - 20th March 2017



Lanserhof is a beautifully scenic and relaxing place to stay if you are looking for a true detox and a chance to switch off all the noise of your busy world. One of the hardest parts of any detox is dealing with the new diet, however the meals were delicious and far more interesting that the usual Mayr menu.The rooms were spotless and modern; you immediately feel the luxury and quality when you walk in. The highlight for me was the treatments; the deep muscular massage in particular was my favourite. I’d recommend booking in extra treatments as the experts here truly know what they&rsquo...;











Natasha - 8th January 2017



This was the perfect way to kick-start my new year, being able to clear out and detox the previous year from my mind and body allowed me to start anew in 2017. Lansherhof was a no-nonsense medi-spa that knew just what I needed, the expertise of the medical professions blew my mind, the programme and diet plan that was prescribed truly did the trick. I feel revived, renewed and ready to take on this new year.











Trudy -  15th January 2017



Lanserhof Lans is a very serious clinic, it’s the perfect place if you’re looking to truly make a difference, in my experience some medical spas can be a bit too fluff and light, but with the strict diet and expertise I knew I was getting the best.A detox is never easy, but once I was past the first few days the exhaustion lifted and I started to truly appreciate how much better I was feeling already, both emotionally and physically.After my visit I felt lighter, calmer, I had lost five pounds and had a new understanding of the importance of taking time for myself to recharge.

"Karen who helped book the holiday was fantastic, very efficient and there were no issues making additions to the holiday a few days before the check in date.
The transfer we booked via Healing Holidays on the arrival pick up was great, again very pleasant and no problems however on the return we decided to cancel direct with the company as we no longer needed it. We didn't want a refund just called the gentleman to say we didn't want it, on the phone call he was rude, aggressive and refused to cancel still showing up at 2:55am in the hotel lobby in the morning making trouble with the reception staff. Terrible transfer company!!"
