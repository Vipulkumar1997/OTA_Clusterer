Chiva-Som


Thailand
,
Southeast Asia






Chiva-Som International Health Resort is the Grande Dame of destination spas, it has been purging and cleansing its guests for 20 years, and still remains triumphantly at the top of its game. Nestled amongst acres of lush tropical gardens in Hua Hin, a mere two hours by road from Bangkok, Chiva-Som is the perfect spa for everyone. It caters in equal measures for the solo traveller, couples, or a group of friends.

Asia is brimming with snazzy health spas, minimalist and cool, but Chiva-Som is a world away from this sort of offering, its aim is to deliver long-term health benefits by changing the way you live. During your stay at Chiva-Som, you will follow a fluid schedule advised by the experts who will ensure you enjoy a balance of treatments and relaxation. Think Tai Chi at sunrise, followed by a nice stretch, with kickboxing, Pilates, yoga and meditation all on the list. With all classes scrupulously chosen by their team - tried and tested, and you can be positive that you will be challenged to the limit by the very best instructors. Chiva-Som boasts an extensive range of spa and alternative treatments. As well as the range of massages and facials, there are colonic irrigation therapies and flotation, scrubs, body polishes, iridology and seaweed treatments, milk baths and acupuncture. Treatments cover everything from chakra balancing to physiotherapy. You can be sure you will also have the access to the world’s top visiting experts, as this is the place they all want to come to.

Food has always been delectable at Chiva-Som, saintly yet scrumptious. The menu features contemporary Thai cuisine with international influences’, food that is low in fat, salt and sugar, and big on flavour. You can still have chocolate brownies, although it will only have just over 200 calories. You can learn how to cook healthily, with daily classes to teach you the art of preparing and cooking the Chiva-Som way. It’s all about education, learning and understanding about food, and ultimately helping you to eat healthier.

With elegant rooms that have been recently renovated, there are countless reasons why people may choose to visit Chiva-Som, but it is undeniable that the main thing that keeps enthusiasts returning year after year are the results. After a week here you will feel brand new, and more importantly, you will take a wealth of knowledge with you on how to live your life better.

Insider's Tips



Room Types


All guest rooms at Chiva-Som are designed with luxury and comfort in mind, creating seamless harmony with your retreat programmes. All rooms have satellite colour TV and a Blu-ray player. Air conditioning is available, as are International Direct Dial phones, bathrobes, hair dryers, refrigerators and room safes. Chiva-Som can also be personalised, allowing for change. You can switch the scent in the oil burners, amenities in the bathroom, and linens and pillows in the bedroom.

Choose from a variety of Ocean Rooms, an Anchan Room, a Thai Pavilion or a Suite (Juniper, Patchouli, Jasmine, Champaka, Golden Bo or Leelawadee).









Thai Pavilion



Traditional Thai style buildings set in landscaped gardens overlooking the resort’s lake or gardens. Three Pavilions share a terrace and outdoor Sala sitting area. There are two Pavilions with an individual private terrace and Sala.












Leelawadee Suite



The Leelawadee Suite is the most exclusive suite, offering a private entrance, spacious living area, dining room and mini pantry, with a luxurious bedroom that features a walk-in dressing room.












Golden Bo Suite



Luxurious and indulgent, the Golden Bo Suite offers a large separate living room, dining area and day area which all lead to the swimming pool and a private terrace. Decorated with Thai silk and authentic funrinshings, this suite provides a true place of respite at Chiva-Som.












Ocean Room



The Ocean Rooms were renovated November 2015 to offer guests an elegant and sophisticated space to relax. They feature a range of facilities and amenities, a beautiful light colour scheme accented with gold, as well as stunning views of the Gulf of Thailand - making for a truly luxurious stay.

Mahasti - 27 April 2017



A peaceful resort with a team and staff that do everything to ensure a perfect stay.











William, Devon - 16 Feb 2016



From a male perspective- Chiva Som ticks all the boxes. You don’t feel like an odd ball hers, as there are many single men at Chiva Som for the same reason. The classes are varied enough to ensure I didn’t get bored. The trainers are really good, and they will challenge you, and your fitness levels to the limit.  I always dismissed Pilates as an activity that was boring, and frankly girly. I tried it at Chiva Som, on the advice of Frances at Healing Holidays. She said it would ultimately help me train better, as it would ensure I stretched properly, as well as strengthen my core, a...











LT - 27 Sep 2015



I've been attempting to lose weight for sometime now to little effect so I decided it was time I tried out a weight-loss retreat and headed to Chiva-Som for the Weight Management programme. I did find it challenging but the end results made it worthwhile. The personal trainers were very effective - they make sure to push you to get the most out of each session.  I was surprised to enjoy the meals given the fact they were so healthy and that doesn't usually equate to tasty, but I actually did. Most importantly I have seen a change in my weight which I hope I can keep up now back at home...











BH - 21 Nov 2015



I've not been feeling myself for quite some time, stress has taken its toll to the point where even my family had noticed the change in me, but after undergoing the Emotional Wellbeing retreat at Chiva-Som everything has changed. I am back to my old self again - if not an even better version of myself (which my family were very happy to see...) and I cannot thank you enough. The acupuncture was great for releasing tension and pranayama is certainly going to be something I continue now back at home. I was rather nervous about the thought of going to a spa on my own, but I was happy to see t...











FE - 23 Jan 2016



There is so much choice when it comes to spas in Thailand I had no idea where to begin, so thank you first of all for taking the time to talk through all the options and help me figure out what would be right for me and my needs. Chiva-Som was perfect, I went for the 10 night Art of Detox programme and I was not disappointed at all. I felt the benefits of every single treatment, and the diet was  just what I needed to feel healthy and nourished from the inside out - I loved that there was a cooking class so I can recreate some of the healthy meals now back at home. I have a renewed sense of en...











William, London - 9 Dec 2015



As someone that had no interest in Spas, and the thought of whale music and fluffy treatments is my worst nightmare, I was bowled over by how much I loved Chiva Som. There was a great mixture of male and female guests, and the range of classes each day was fantastic. I did kick boxing, and running on the beach-Pilates and training at altitude, I ate the most fantastic food-which didn’t add to my waistline. And the massages unravelled all the knots in my neck and back. I am now a covert.  Karen talked it all through with me, and was very patient and understood my brief completely. I cant ...










Insider's Tips



Book early, as Chiva-Som gets a huge amount of repeat guests.

Book a room with a view of the ocean, not only will it make your soul soar, but its near to the heart of the Spa action.

Do a cookery lesson with Kanyarat Thanomsaeng, so you can replicate some of their scrummy dishes.

Do their stretching class at sunrise, it will set you up for the day, and ensure that you are fit for the day ahead

Pack lightly as you will spend most of your time in the comfy pyjamas provided

Study the weekly schedule a week prior to travel and ask that treatments are planned not to clash.
