Kamalaya


Thailand
,
Southeast Asia






Tucked away in a lush valley, overlooking the coast of southern Koh Samui, lies the hypnotically-beautiful Kamalaya, a luxury wellness and holistic spa resort in, offering stress relief, detox, weight loss, fitness and yoga, for the ultimate healing experience. The award winning Kamalaya is located in Koh Samui, Thailand. This beautiful island is abundant in sandy beaches, coral reefs, and coconut trees. The spiritual energy is so pure and intense, it’s no wonder that Buddhist monks came here to contemplate, and it’s around their cave of worship that the resort has been built. Everything is geared for total and complete transformation. At Kamalaya, everything is directed towards a self-discovery.

It’s just recently been revamped, so the rooms are bright and airy, and the additions of a 25-metre pool and a three-storey fitness emporium means it is also now the most well equipped and beautfitul spa in Thailand, perhaps Asia. The joy of staying in this most stellar of spas is that you will be nurtured by some of Asia’s best healers. Karina Stewart, the owner, is a master of Traditional Chinese Medicine, so when it comes to authenticity and application, you will find no better. All of the treatments dig deep and are given by caring and loving therapists.

Many of the counsellors have been monks, (and you will also get the best overseas visiting experts), the near-vegan food is delectable, and your mouth will zing with the Asian fusion taste explosion. There is no calorie counting here, that’s not the Kamalaya way, you can have a little of what you fancy, and even have the odd glass of organic wine for dinner in the evening. There is a state-of-the-art diagnostic centre, a mass of interesting classes, with new Optimum Fitness programmes been introduced shortly. There are all sorts of yoga, and Pilates that will burn your core, and there are meditation experts who will teach you to clear your mind, and to let go. Kamalaya provides every type of healing imaginable from sleep enhancement programmes aided by acupuncture; and cognitive healing, releasing therapy to cope with loss and bereavement to Ayurvedic treatments used to de-stress and recover.

New to Kamalaya are
group Life Enhancement retreats
that allow for guests to reflect and heal collectively. Kamalaya is the ideal place to go to address and resolve your issues, it’s perfect for the worn down and stressed out, or for those who just want to slow down their pace.



To find out why Kamalaya was crowned the Best Destination Spa of 2016, read the article from the
Conde Nast Traveller Spa Guide

Silvia - 6 August 2017



Kamalaya was the most amazing place & the package I had was just what I was looking for. I would highly recommend it to anyone needing a relaxing & healing holiday.











Lisa - 24 April 2017



A truly wonderful experience - relaxing and healing in a great setting. The chef is incredible and the food, service and the treatments are all superb. The community table is a great way to meet fun people and have company in the evenings but you feel very comfortable spending time alone there too.











Joan - 24 April 2017



A totally relaxing break. Staff were friendly. Accommodation, food and facilities first class. Would definitely return.











Marianna Hewitt - 1 Nov 2015



Me and my friend went for a 7 night stay and loved every minute! Went for a detox and rejuvenation programme and felt great at the end of it and lost a decent amount of weight. The service, pools, gym and food was all outstanding! That you very much Healing Holidays for your recommendation and advice.











Claire Edwards - 15 Dec 2015



Kamalaya is a hidden gem! The second time I booked Kamalaya with Healing Holidays... without regret! I completed a 7 day relax and renew programme and this was a reboot and reset for me both physically and emotionally. The friendly staff, great food and villas make detoxing easy. This was one of the best thing I could have done for myself.











A.M.Corry - 1 May 2015



I just wanted to thank you so much for recommending I go to Kamalaya. It was the perfect place for me to go at this point in my life, and the Asian Bliss package is very aptly named. I feel so much better for my time there. I loved the room - it was the perfect sanctuary. I would definitely go back, and I would definitely recommend Healing Holidays to everyone I know!
