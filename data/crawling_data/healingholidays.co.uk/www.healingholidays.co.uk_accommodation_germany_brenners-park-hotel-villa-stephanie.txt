CB - 23 Feb 2016



I went to Brenners Park Hotel & Villa Stephanie for the Vitality Detox, and I can say as the name suggests I certainly feel revitalised now! I loved the way the detox diet and exercise sessions were complimented by more pampering treatments, making it a much more enjoyable detox experience than others I have had before. I particularly loved the digital detox option available, it felt so good to be able to switch off from everything and just enjoy the peace and quiet, and the beautiful surroundings of course!











CS - 9 Sep 2015



I wanted the results of the detox without necessarily having to go through the suffering you hear often comes with one, so Healing Holidays recommended I try the Medical Detox at Brenners Park Hotel & Villa Stephanie. I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised, despite being placed on a detox diet I didn't feel hungry and unsatisfied, and the different treatments you receive during your stay make it even more enjoyable. I feel so much better after my week spent at Brenners and feel encouraged to maybe even try a more intense form of detox in the future!











BM - 12 May 2015



I went to Brenners Park Hotel for a detox to perk myself up for the summer and have been amazed at the results. Everything about my experience was great, the location was simply beautiful, as were the rooms, and the staff were excellent, they really know their stuff and I felt the treatments were very effective. After the vitality detox I look so much more radiant, my skin is glowing and I'm sure I've dropped a few pounds too. I'm so pleased with the results I will be definitely be returning in the future.










Insider's Tips



Take control, and start your digital detox instantly by turning off the wifi signal at the touch of a button in your room
