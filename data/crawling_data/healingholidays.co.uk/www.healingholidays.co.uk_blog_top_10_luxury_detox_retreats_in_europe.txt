Top 10 Luxury Detox Retreats in Europe







Detox can be seen as a “no pain, no gain” process. Although you will emerge on the other side feeling refreshed and revitalised, actually undergoing a detox can be uncomfortable. However, staying at a luxurious destination spa or medical spa can ease the detoxification process. When you choose to stay at a top of the line spa or resort, you can expect a seamless experience, so you will not have to fret about a thing. At these European luxury detox retreats, you can simply focus on your own health.
