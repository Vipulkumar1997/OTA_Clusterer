Germany



Germany is a health-conscious travellers dream with more than 350 approved health resorts and spas to help prevent and treat illnesses or simply to rest and relax. The country knows a thing or two about retreats with a long history of spas and wellness. Romans appreciated the hot mineral springs at Baden-Baden, and beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries, Europe’s royalty and other aristocrats would meet at the great German spa resort towns. You can still have a taste of the life they enjoyed by staying at resorts like Brenners and Schloss Elmau.

The country’s knowledge on a healthy lifestyle is extensive, which makes it the perfect place for a detox and health-lift. With mountain ranges to observe and scale it’s ideal for families who want to bike, hike and climb. The landscape changes dramatically between Winter and Summer, making it a spot you can visit any time of the year. Be active outside during the summer break, or snuggle up inside for the cosy winter months.

If you decide you need a break from the spas; visit the many treasures of this great European destination. Cologne with its rich 2000-year old history, admire the Azure skies, medieval villages and Bavarian beer houses in the south or enjoy exploring the hustle & bustle of Berlin. Wherever you decide to go, a spa break in Germany offers a incredible mix of beautiful countryside & vibrant culture.
