Medical Spa



With the increase in lifestyle stress and other factors causing a general imbalance in your health, a ten-minute visit to your local GP just does not suffice. A regular visit to a medical spa is a fantastic way to keep your health in check. With a team of medical experts at your disposal, you can counteract the onset of chronic illness at an early stage, efficiently and effectively.

Most people do not associate wellness holidays with diagnostic and wellness checks in addition to time away from everyday stress. However, a medical spa offers you a more intensive health check-up and medical treatments far more extensive than anything available in a doctor’s surgery, within the settings of a luxury resort. Unlike the anxious and stressed atmosphere in your GP’s waiting room, the medical spa ambience will help you relax in a luxurious space before your treatment. The difference that the restful surroundings makes on your mind and thereby on your body is amazing. With fitness experts, plastic surgeons, dermatologists and even practitioners for a more serious health issue, medical spas ensure the peace of mind of knowing that you are in the hands of fully qualified experts.

Book yourself a full body ‘MOT’ with blood tests, fat to muscle measurements and a general health assessment or get your fitness assessed for that perfect golf swing. Other popular packages include appearance enhancing treatments to smooth out and rejuvenate the skin. Physiotherapy, massage and acupuncture are also often combined with body treatments to enhance movement and assist in repairing damaged muscles.

Medical health retreats, such as the elegant and sophisticated Villa Stephanie in Baden-Baden, Germany, offering a range of services like full blood tests, but also ultrasounds, cancer screening and even body scans. Dr Harry Konig, lead clinician at the centre, not only has a very impressive background in holistic and allopathic medicine, but he is also a strong proponent of taking time with each patient.

A visit to a medical spa ensures the very best medical experts combine their knowledge and skills with the services of a pampering spa facility. Enjoy the finest care alongside revitalising treatments that will leave you looking and feeling brand new!

Discover our selection of medical spas below or contact our wellness experts, who will give you unbiased advice on how to tailor the right programme for your individual needs. Call on 020 7843 3597 or submit
your enquiry here.
