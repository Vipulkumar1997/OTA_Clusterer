Meet Our Dedicated Team








Tracy Wilson

Health and Fitness Specialist


A true ambassador for healthy living, Tracy has been heading up the Healing Holidays team for ten years, and has been in the travel industry for the past 30 years. She is a dedicated yoga, fitness and pilates lover, and is committed to all aspects of wellness in both her personal and professional life.

Favourite Spa:
Sha Wellness Clinic
is one of my favourite retreats for detox and weight loss in Spain. This clinic also offers a wide variety of programmes to address specific issues and health concerns. Ideal for those you are looking for a stress management or quit smoking programme, who suffer from chronic pain or need to fix any sleep disorders.

Favourite wellness experience:
my favourite wellness experience would start

with sunrise yoga, before a healthy breakfast, which will set me up perfectly for a challenging workout (boot camp class or cardio). Then a quick sauna, steam or hammam before a light healthy lunch. The afternoon would be taken up by a cooking class or health talk, followed by Pilates or a Core Class. It’s then one final stop in the Spa for a facial and relaxing massage before a light dinner and an early night.











Karen Nyoni

Spiritual & Holistic Specialist


As a Reiki Master and qualified homeopath, Karen opts for the Holistic way of life. She has been working for Healing Holidays for eight years and she has been lucky enough to experience many different wellness retreats worldwide.

Favourite Spa: O
ne of my favourite retreats is
Dwarikas in Nepal
– “It combines my love of Spiritual Nepal and yoga”. This is the perfect place relax and unwind. If you have fallen into a rut and no longer feel like your true self, head to
Kamalaya in Thailand
, the amazing will guide you through experiential practices, therapies and dialogues that will help you to discover the cause of dissatisfaction and unhappiness in your life, as well as ways to guide you through a better self.

Favourite wellness experience:
my perfect wellness experience would start with morning yoga and stretching before breakfast, followed by an energy healing treatment or acupuncture before lunch, an early afternoon swim before a relaxing aromatherapy massage, ending with meditation before bed.









Klaudia Orr

Well-being & Wellness Advisor


Klaudia has a real passion for all things sports, spa, and wellness, having studied physical education at university herself. Klaudia has been providing Healing Holidays with her expertise for three years now, and when asked on her favourite spa says it has to be
Schloss Elmau
in Germany. The spectacular location with it stunning views of the Bavarian Alps makes this a firm favourite of hers, and with a young family of her own Klaudia loves that this is such a family-friendly spa. On her ideal spa day, Klaudia says it would begin with breakfast to fuel her for a trek through the mountains, after this she would love to sink into a mud pool and hot spring bath. For lunch, Klaudia would take a picnic by a lake, before enjoying an afternoon personal training session, followed by some swimming and then relaxation in the sauna. After enjoying a light dinner, Klaudia would then opt for a final spa treatment before heading off to bed.









Christina Mullet

Yoga Specialist


Since the travel bug first bit at 18 Christina has been lucky enough to travel to over 80 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa. She especially love unusual destinations, having visited Turkmenistan and the Silk Route countries, Guyana and Suriname in South America, Moldova and the Balkans in Eastern Europe and Senegal in West Africa.
Christina is a qualified as yoga teacher and she very much enjoys helping clients to find their perfect yoga retreat match.

Favourite Spa:
The spa at the Banyan Tree Seychelles is located on a hillside in thick jungle overlooking the most picture postcard perfect bay you could imagine. Being massaged by top class masseuse to the gentle sound of breaking waves is out of this world.

Favourite wellness experience:
When it comes to wellness, it would be my time spent practising yoga in the Himalayan foothills of India and Nepal. In the West, yoga has become synonymous with fitness and its traditional spiritual meaning can be lost, back at its roots in the East the focus is very much on the  all the aspects on your practise.


Where would you like to wellness next:
I would love to visit Absolute Sanctuary in Koh Samui, it is a world class yoga retreat; they even do yoga teacher training there. It has an astounding array of classes available every day, I would particularly love to try their Reformer Pilates.











Sophie Atkinson-Clark

Health & Fitness Advisor


Favourite Spa
: Rosa Alpina in Italy. I absolutely love the outdoors and Rosa Alpina is in such a wonderful place that not only do you have the amazing spa but you also have the glorious Dolomite mountains to explore on foot in the summer or on skis in the winter. There is nothing better than after a long day outside coming back to some relaxing time in the spa, a yoga class or a pampering massage.


Favourite wellness experience
: Being a lover of outdoors and nature and also someone that thinks fresh air and exercise is a big healer of the mind my favourite wellness experience has to be hiking in the Dolomite mountains in Italy or exploring the amazing countryside in New Zealand. I have also hugely enjoyed the Nordic walking experience at SHA Wellness Clinic in Spain.


Where would you like to wellness next
: I’m keen on exploring, learning and discovering new places and so India hugely appeals to me as somewhere completely different to anywhere I’ve been before. The offering of ayurvedic treatments and yoga are something I’d love to experience – in particular, Vana sounds like nowhere else on this earth.










Sonia Flahant

Fitness & Wellness Specialist


Favourite Spa
: I love COMO Shambhala in Indonesia. The location is perfect for escaping reality and as I’m passionate about holistic living, there truly is no better place than a destination spa in Asia. With a combination of healthy food, indoor as well as outdoor activities and pampering, this Spa really does provide a route to a healthy mind, body and soul.


Favourite wellness experience
: For me, Wellness is about feeding your soul with the things you enjoy. I love to take adventures, so hiking, cultural tours and stimulating boot camp classes all appeal to me.


Where would you like to wellness next
: I would love to Visit Shanti-Som in Spain. It’s amazing how they’ve brought the knowledge of an Asian Spa across to Europe, so close to home! Being a lover of all things fitness, Shanti-Som really does tick all my boxes, with the perfect mix of intense personal training sessions, mindful yoga and soothing pampering treatments.
