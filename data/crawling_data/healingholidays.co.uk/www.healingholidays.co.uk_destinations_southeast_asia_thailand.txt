Thailand



Thailand is a world renowned spa holiday destination and is guaranteed to delight. Often regarded as the finest country in Asia for spas, it combines some of the best 'destination spas' and 'resort spas' in the world. Offering everything from pampering to medical spas, health retreats and life changing philosophies, Thailand is where spa afficionados go year after year. For holistic health, gruelling detoxes, yoga retreats, weight loss, stress management, sleep enhancement and much more, Thailand is the place to go. The destination spas promise results, long term and short term but not all of them are hard-core with some offering gentler programmes than others. The focus is on health and enabling you to make life changes that can be taken away and followed.
