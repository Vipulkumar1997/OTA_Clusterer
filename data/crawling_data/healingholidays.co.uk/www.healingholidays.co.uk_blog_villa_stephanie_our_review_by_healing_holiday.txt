Villa Stephanie -  Our review by Healing Holidays







Frances Geoghegan, Healing Holidays founder on why Villa Stephanie makes for an excellent medical spa.

Having a medical marvel with such strong credentials a mere two-hour flight away is such great news for us here in the UK. Villa Stephanie is situated in the picturesque town of Baden-Baden and is attached to the long-established
Brenner’s Park Hotel and Spa
. It’s here that you can cocoon in total luxury whilst having all your medical testing done, using the newest state-of-the-art technology and under the stewardship of some of Europe’s top doctors and specialists.

Wellness programme at Villa Stephanie

There are two wellness programmes at Villa Stephanie that you can choose from -
Body Cleansing Detox
&
Weight Loss Programme
. As part of these programmes, you can have a full blood check as well as a body scan, and ultrasound to check and treat any underlying medical concerns. Fatigue, stress and digestive problems, that your GP back home has no time to treat, can be dealt here with ease, with full body MOTs. They also offer services like screening for cancer as part of your medical check. If you have back or neck problems the physiotherapists are on hand with the newest techniques and treatments to help you feel better. A full dental makeover can be done here too, once again, using the newest cutting edge technology. They are also rolling out stem cell rejuvenation therapies which will allow you to heal your own body (or take years off your face).




Food & Facilities at Villa Stephanie

Each guest has a menu tailored for them by the team of nutritionists. You could be set a very low-calorie menu, but it certainly won’t fail the taste test and will be beautifully presented to tempt even the most discerning palette. If you are fortunate enough, and do not to require reining in around meal times, there is a two-star Michelin restaurant at the hotel, just for you. The rooms are sumptuous and comforting, with huge beds dressed in Frette Linen and all the added comforts you would expect from a luxury hotel. There is even a digital detox button you can press to instantly disconnect the entire room from WiFi - Villa Stephanie has thought of it all.




Why do I think it's special?

It has not been billed Europe’s most impressive and innovative spa for nothing. For me, the best thing about Villa Stephanie is Dr Konig - it’s not just that he is very handsome, (that’s just a bonus), it’s his breadth of knowledge and his respect for alternative medicine, which he integrates so beautifully with conventional medicine. So you will find stellar homoeopathic remedies alongside vitamin and mineral infusions, all of which are made on site at Villa Stephanie. You have the latest and newest medical testing alongside the ancient holistic practices, all working in total harmony for the betterment of your body and mind. The surrounding area is also stunning; Baden-Baden has a great cultural scene with one of Europe’s finest opera houses hosting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, and it is home to the world-renowned contemporary Frieder Burda museum. It is also near to the Black Forest, for inspiring walks and hikes, and the town’s thermal waters are a few minutes drive away.

If you would like to experience all that Villa Stephanie has to offer then speak to one of our Wellness Consultants on 020 7843 3597 or email info@healingholidays.co.uk.
