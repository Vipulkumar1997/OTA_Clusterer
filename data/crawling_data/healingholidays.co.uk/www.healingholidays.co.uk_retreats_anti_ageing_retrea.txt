Anti-ageing Retreats



There are a wide variety of treatments to help you slow down the clock when it comes to ageing and a spa break offers the perfect opportunity to get in some relaxation alongside your rejuvenation treatments. With a growing trend to combine the holistic approach with the latest technology, you’ll find that even a week at a spa will leave you looking and feeling younger – inside and out.

Ever wondered how the stars retain their youthful appearance? Some swear by Thermage treatments, while others boost with collagen or smooth out with laser. There are many different skin treatments – each perfectly suited to a specific skin type and result. From within there are juices, diets and physical exercise like yoga and meditation to bring the inner revitalisation that will leave your skin glowing and your body feeling years younger.

Laser treatments are also popular offering wrinkle and cellulite smoothing, broken vein solutions or the ever popular hair removal treatments. There are acid peels, photo dynamic therapies, botox and fillers all offered alongside the usual therapies to ensure your spa experience leaves you feeling pampered.

Whether you’re in need of a confidence boosting rejuvenation or simply a treat – indulge in an anti-ageing spa experience because it’s never to late to wow yourself, and others with your transformation both within and without.

Discover our selection of anti-ageing programmes below or contact our wellness experts, who will give you unbiased advice on how to tailor the right programme for your individual needs. Call on 020 7843 3597 or submit
