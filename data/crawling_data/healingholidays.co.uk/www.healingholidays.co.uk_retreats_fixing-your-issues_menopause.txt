MENOPAUSE

Fixing your issues



While a natural stage in every woman’s life, for many menopause is one of the most dreaded parts of being a woman. Generally, the most unpleasant thing about menopause is the unwanted symptoms that come with it. Hot flushes, mood swings, weight-gain and more are all symptoms that women commonly suffer from when experiencing the change, but there are things you can do to ease these and make it a much more comfortable time.  One of the best things you can do when going through menopause is to simply take some time out just to focus on yourself, especially on a menopause retreat that will help you tackle the symptoms you are experiencing as well as provide you with a much needed break.

There are countless wellness retreats that can help with the menopause and it really comes down to personal preference which one is right for you.

We have put together a selection of our top menopause programmes, for more information contact our wellness experts by calling
