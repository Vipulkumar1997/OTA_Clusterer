Family-Wellness Holidays



Whether a personal choice or because circumstance dictates, sometimes our wellness holiday isn’t just a solo trip, but one that includes the whole family. You may think you’d be rather limited for choice when searching for a wellness holiday that the whole family can enjoy, but believe it or not there are plenty of family-friendly spas that everyone will love. Whether you head to a resort that has a spa that welcomes children and even offers children’s spa treatments, or you head to a hotel with excellent facilities in place to keep the kids occupied while you enjoy your retreat, there are plenty of options available to families. Enjoying a wellness break together in a beautiful destination is sure to be a fantastic bonding experience and ensures that the whole family get to reap the great benefits of a retreat.

"They were very helpful and managed to accommodate my needs and holiday dates. The emails and documentation was very detailed and provided me with a hassle-free holiday. Just had to check in and fly. Everything else was sorted.
The only reason I have chosen 4 start is because the payment portal on the site is not SSL secured and this should be changed immediately to give customers 100% peace of mind that no details can be stolen in the process. I paid over the phone instead."
