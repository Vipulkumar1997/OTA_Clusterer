Absolute Sanctuary


Thailand
,
Southeast Asia






Situated in a peaceful area on the island of Koh Samui lies Absolute Sanctuary, a simple, but utterly wonderful spa. If you have dreamt of a yoga or Pilates holiday in Thailand, and are determined to cleanse, get fitter and lose weight, without it costing the earth, then this is the spa for you. You might be surprised by the Moroccan style décor, and to find that you are not located on one of the islands many beaches, but you will instantly realise what a gem you have uncovered. This is a real rocket-charger. The yoga classes are amongst the best you will ever experience, so much so that Absolute Sanctuary's yoga gurus train yoga instructors from around the world.

The wealth of knowledge here means that you can choose from a whole host of yoga styles including: Ashtanga Vinyasa, yin, hatha, hot, pranayama and meditational.  In addition to this, their new Reformer Pilates programme will challenge even those with the strongest core - there are classes that focus on abs and arms, butt and thighs, or simply fit and tone. To start, you will have a full postural analysis session, which will assess your strengths and weaknesses.

If Pilates and yoga are not your thing, you can opt for intense fitness sessions with Marco, a former water-polo professional who will take you through your paces with Box Fit - high impact, heart-pumping, boxercise; as well as on early morning hikes to the beach. It really is all about the expertise of the instructors here. Programmes can be tailored to suit you, it’s not one-size-fixes-all at Absolute Sanctuary – and this goes for their menu and food selection too.

Another speciality is their fasting programmes – a chance for your digestive system to have a break. You will be on a liquid-only diet – warming broths, drinks of psyllium husk, and oodles of delicious coconut water. This, combined with colonic irrigation, will help to totally clean out your system, and all the while you will be looked after with gentle Thai kindness.

Lydia - 08 May 2017



The retreat and all of its treatments and sessions were exactly what I wanted. The staff were all professional, friendly and provided a top rate service. The retreat was simple, clean and calming. The food was delicious and healthy. The fitness sessions, including the personal training, Pilates reformer and yoga were challenging and fun and all of the treatments were out of this world. I couldn't have asked for a more perfect break.











Elaine - 24 April 2017



One of the best experiences I've had to date. Staff were lovely and friendly, the hotel was fabulous. great location, loved it.











Lynne - 15 Feb 2016



Absolute Sanctuary was a big highlight for me in 2015. I did a Pilates Bootcamp, which was both challenging and fun at the same time. I love so much about Absolute; its an amazing place to go for single travelers. There is great interaction between guests. The food was amazing, and there is a wonderful vibe there. I would definitely return, and will always use Healing Holidays. They know their stuff.
