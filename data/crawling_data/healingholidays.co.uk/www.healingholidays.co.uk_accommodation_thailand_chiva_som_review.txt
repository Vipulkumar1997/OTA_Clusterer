Mahasti - 27 April 2017

A peaceful resort with a team and staff that do everything to ensure a perfect stay.



William, Devon - 16 Feb 2016

From a male perspective- Chiva Som ticks all the boxes. You don’t feel like an odd ball hers, as there are many single men at Chiva Som for the same reason. The classes are varied enough to ensure I didn’t get bored. The trainers are really good, and they will challenge you, and your fitness levels to the limit.  I always dismissed Pilates as an activity that was boring, and frankly girly. I tried it at Chiva Som, on the advice of Frances at Healing Holidays. She said it would ultimately help me train better, as it would ensure I stretched properly, as well as strengthen my core, and help relieving back pain. It did all of this. The trainers were fantastic. I started with some private one-to-ones, and ended up doing daily classes with four other people. I now include Pilates as part of my fitness regime.  It was great experience booking with Healing holidays, you knew Chiva Som and the programmes, classes and trainers, and thus ensured I got the absolute most from my 10 day trip. I would never book with anyone else in the future.



LT - 27 Sep 2015

I've been attempting to lose weight for sometime now to little effect so I decided it was time I tried out a weight-loss retreat and headed to Chiva-Som for the Weight Management programme. I did find it challenging but the end results made it worthwhile. The personal trainers were very effective - they make sure to push you to get the most out of each session.  I was surprised to enjoy the meals given the fact they were so healthy and that doesn't usually equate to tasty, but I actually did. Most importantly I have seen a change in my weight which I hope I can keep up now back at home. Thank you for your help organising my stay, I will be using Healing Holidays again in future for all my spa needs.



BH - 21 Nov 2015

I've not been feeling myself for quite some time, stress has taken its toll to the point where even my family had noticed the change in me, but after undergoing the Emotional Wellbeing retreat at Chiva-Som everything has changed. I am back to my old self again - if not an even better version of myself (which my family were very happy to see...) and I cannot thank you enough. The acupuncture was great for releasing tension and pranayama is certainly going to be something I continue now back at home. I was rather nervous about the thought of going to a spa on my own, but I was happy to see that a lot of others had done the same - besides my days were so full with different treatments and classes that I didn't have time to feel lonely. Thank you once again, I hope not to need another emotional wellbeing break but if I do you will be my first point of contact!



FE - 23 Jan 2016

There is so much choice when it comes to spas in Thailand I had no idea where to begin, so thank you first of all for taking the time to talk through all the options and help me figure out what would be right for me and my needs. Chiva-Som was perfect, I went for the 10 night Art of Detox programme and I was not disappointed at all. I felt the benefits of every single treatment, and the diet was  just what I needed to feel healthy and nourished from the inside out - I loved that there was a cooking class so I can recreate some of the healthy meals now back at home. I have a renewed sense of energy and feel completely rejuvenated - this is honestly the perfect retreat for someone feeling drained and sluggish and needing a revival.



William, London - 9 Dec 2015

As someone that had no interest in Spas, and the thought of whale music and fluffy treatments is my worst nightmare, I was bowled over by how much I loved Chiva Som. There was a great mixture of male and female guests, and the range of classes each day was fantastic. I did kick boxing, and running on the beach-Pilates and training at altitude, I ate the most fantastic food-which didn’t add to my waistline. And the massages unravelled all the knots in my neck and back. I am now a covert.  Karen talked it all through with me, and was very patient and understood my brief completely. I cant thank her and Healing Holidays enough. A wellness break is on my list every year, and I know Healing Holidays will put me on the right road.











"Excellent accommodation, spa and service but the diet is very strict."
