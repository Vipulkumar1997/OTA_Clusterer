Lisa P. - 12 June 2016

I came to Marbella Club to escape from it all on their emotional balance retreat. I've been feeling not quite myself lately and thought I needed something to help me recharge and get back on track, and this programme proved the perfect way to do just that. As well as helping me cope with my stresses and problems while there, I love that this retreat has helped me learn how to cope with these kinds of situations in future. You really do feel completely looked after at Marbella Club and I would urge anyone to visit for themselves and be wowed by the amazing treatment they receive.

Marbella Club is simply perfect, I can't think of one thing I didn't absolutely love about my stay. I chose the Mediterranean Lifestyle retreat and I have never felt so relaxed yet healthy. This retreat really works to help you look and feel your abolsute best without depriving you of anything and that is why I loved it so much. The retreat aside, the hotel and location were simply perfect too. This is true luxury and in my opinion the dream escape, I cannot wait to return here and try out another one of the retreats.



Allison T - 08 FEB 2015

Thank you, [Healing Holidays], for sending me on a beach holiday to help me manage the accummulated stress in my life! I was reticent to go alone, but I was incredibly comfortable at the hotel. The friendly and attentive staff sure helped. I loved my accommodation, the grounds, the programme. Really, everything was fantastic! Although I had a nice solo retreat, next time I will bring my husband so he can enjoy it, too!

If you are looking for a programme that combines fitness and healthy food where you can keep up your daily routines then Marbella Club is the best option! The staff are wonderfully helpful, attentive and professional. Yoga classes and massage therapy are excellent. There is a initial Medical Consultation that help me to choose the best treatments.



Suzanne Whiston - 14 Sep 2015

I have been incredibly impressed with the wellness programme at the Marbella Club. Healing Holidays found me the perfect holiday to fit my needs! Great combination of holistic physical and emotional practices. The stress management programme helped me feelling stronger and ready for my daily routine.











"Great service! Always quick snd positive in their reply"
