Cuisine


Visitors can enjoy the resort’s Cuisine Équilibrée, a health-conscious menu devised by the executive chef and the resort’s dieticians and doctors. Alternatively, dine in one of the resort’s seven restaurants which include Asian, gastronomic and Mediterranean options.

Äbtestube

Gourmet chef Roland Schmid enchants your senses with elegant, authentic dishes that will live on forever in your taste memory. The Äbtestube (17 GaultMillau points) is the culinary flagship of the Grand Resort Bad Ragaz, with a top-class atmosphere to match. Harmoniously balanced and exclusive Domaine de la Romanée-Conti wines are skilfully combined with the selected dishes.

Bel Air

Sophisticated restaurant with 15 GaultMillau points in the Grand Hotel Quellenhof & Spa Suites. International spa cuisine and Cuisine Equilibrée from Executive Chef Renato Wüst, complemented by appealing Japanese offerings from Tadashi Aoki. Magnificent, covered sun terrace, home to the legendary summer barbecues.

Olives d’Or

Take a seat and enjoy the light, authentic Mediterranean cuisine! Whether ravioli or raviolini, spaghetti or spaghettini, penne, taglierini or panzarotti: they have redefined pasta cuisine! And if you were able to browse through the creative menu at this moment, your mouth would surely begin to water. Are you ready for a taste of the Mediterranean?

Namun

Asian cuisine enjoys the well-deserved reputation of being among the best in the world. Not only is it light and healthy, it also stands out for its use of fresh ingredients. A veritable cornucopia of fresh, spicy and lemony flavours is unlocked in the preparation of these dishes.

Zollstube

To match the informal chalet atmosphere in the traditional Zollstube, they spoil you here with popular Swiss specialities and regional delicacies.

Golf Restaurant

Club members, hotel guests and golfers are always welcome in the attractive restaurant (13 GaultMillau points) with its wonderful sun terrace. It offers a sophisticated seasonal cuisine that exclusively uses market-fresh, top-class ingredients. Indulge yourself with something from the selection of hot dishes.

Golf Bistro

The newly built Golf Bistro with its magnificent terrace offers a warm welcome to everyone. The Bistro is open daily from 8.30 to 21.00 between March and November.

La Merenda

La Merenda translates into something like "light meal". This and much more is available in the restaurant at the new Tamina Therme, accessible from both the dry and wet areas. A richly varied salad buffet, a wide selection of snacks and sandwiches, extra-healthy dishes, tarte flambée and a devilishly-tempting cake buffet make up the seasonally changing menu. You also have the option of designing your own pasta creation at the pasta station. Extensive use is made of high-quality organic and whole-grain products from the local region to ensure a balanced diet.

Tracy's Review of Grand Resort Bad Ragaz



Wellness consultant Tracy recently spent a long, leisurely weekend exploring the expansive facilitie...

CKD – 13 Feb 2014



[Healing Holidays] really came through for me! The hotel was beautiful and the spa was absolutely charming with 5-star service. The Italian cuisine was phenomenal, and other guests informed me that all of the restaurants are worth trying, really. This was the perfect place for some quality rest & relaxation time. Thank you for recommending this marvellous wellness property!











BT - 8 Jun 2015



My retreat at Grand Hotel Bad Ragaz was amazing. Honestly. The service was impeccable, and I felt so comfortable during my entire stay. My companion had a hard time dragging me out of the public baths. I really enjoyed the variety of pools available. I easily could have stayed another week! I am so looking forward to booking another trip.











Emily - 4 Apr 2015



I couldn’t have found a better place to recharge my batteries than the Grand Hotel Bad Ragaz. Thank you [Healing Holidays] for recommending it to me based on my individual needs. The saunas, steam rooms and thermal waters literally melted my stress away. The alpine air was incredibly refreshing and invigorating. I returned to daily life feeling brand new and better equipped to deal with stress.










Insider's Tips



Book early. Every programme is tailored individually, and this can take time to arrange

Take your swimming costume so you can languish for as much time as your schedule allows at their breath-taking thermal and iced pools - this is worth the visit alone

Remember your walking boots; this is Heidi country so you will need some sturdy shoes to see the pretty landscape

Rent one of their bikes, and cycle gently along the river Rhine, or try the more challenging mountainous terrain nearby. You can do both, on one of their electric bikes instead

Don’t forget to try the herbal steam bath made with sparkling Swarovski crystals

Take them up on their offer of complimentary limited use of their Porsche or Harley Davidson motorbike during the summer

Booking one of their set programmes can be easier to budget for, as selected treatments are already included











Programmes



Blurring the lines between medical marvel and posh hotel, Grand Resort Bad Ragaz is a mega spa – with the perfect collaboration of clinical direction and all-encompassing indulgence. From sleep diagnostics and state-of-the-art detox’s, to relaxing in their famous 36.5˚ Thermal spa. Bad Ragaz does not disappoint when it comes to looking after your health and wellbeing.
