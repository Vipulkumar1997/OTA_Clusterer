Anita - 1 October 2017

Yoga and Pilates classes very well taught, reiki session excellent, location of resort easily accessible but feeling quiet and secluded on arrival. Food generous and delicious, catering well for food allergies.



LE - 23 June 2015

I came to Shanti-Som for the yoga retreat after seeing all the different types of yoga on offer. As a relative novice I'm still discovering which type of yoga I like best, so this was a great way for me to trial a few different kinds, all while improving my practice. Yoga aside, the resort itself was simply amazing - you don't feel like you're in Spain but somewhere in Asia with a tranquil and Eastern feel about the whole place. It was simply amazing and has definitely made me want to try more yoga retreats in the future.



MS - 19 April 2015

I came to Shanti-Som to shape up ahead of the summer, and it certainly did the trick. The weight-loss retreat is amazing! It's pretty intense but they tailor it to your own needs and goals so I never felt that I was out my depth. The hikes had to be my favourite part of this retreat and were a great way of making exercise enjoyable as you got to see such beautiful sights along the way. The food was great and the diet never felt too restrictive, I hope to try and continue these new eating habits back home too. Overall, I achieved my aim of losing a few pounds and I couldn't be happier.



Christine M - 23 May 2016

I had a wonderful time at Shanti Som, and I returned home feeling better than I have in a long time. People there were super-friendly and looked after me really well, the atmosphere was relaxed and cosy, the yoga classes were brilliant, the spa treatments were very nice and the food was great, too. I will definitely consider going back another time... and I am going to start doing yoga here at home soon because I enjoy it so much and found both teachers I got to know in Spain not only very knowledgeable, but also very inspiring... All in all I had a great holiday, and I'd like to thank you once again for helping to make it possible.









"Excellent accommodation, spa and service but the diet is very strict."
