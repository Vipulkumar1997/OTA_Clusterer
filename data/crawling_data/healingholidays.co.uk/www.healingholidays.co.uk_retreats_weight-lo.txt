Weight-Loss




Weight Loss Retreats
Weight loss need not be a daunting nightmare! Joining a weight loss retreat ensures you receive expert advice on what your body needs and is a fantastic way to kick-start the process and help you achieve your goal. Whether you’re recovering from a little holiday weight or are starting on a long term lifestyle change – the Healing Holidays experts will guide you on the best way forward.

Your body weight has such a large impact on your overall wellbeing - from the physical burdens on your joints, organs and arteries to the psychological afflictions of low self-esteem, feeling self-conscious and even depression. While there are many ways to start losing weight, the problem may often not lie with what you’re eating – rather how you’re eating, and getting to the bottom of what’s causing your weight gain, is often the most important factor.


Weight Loss Holidays
The long term effects of overeating and living a sedentary lifestyle are increasingly becoming a problem and, added to high stress levels, can lead to serious health issues even over a short period of time.

The modern workplace has also contributed, making it easy to communicate and conduct business without physically moving. Combined with easy meals and processed foods that make it easy to pick the sugar and fat loaded options instead of more time consuming, healthy and balanced meals; these factors lead to long term health problems.

Discover our selection of retreats that will help you to lose weight or contact our wellness experts, who will give you unbiased advice on how to tailor the right programme for your individual needs. Call on 020 7843 3597 or submit your enquiry
