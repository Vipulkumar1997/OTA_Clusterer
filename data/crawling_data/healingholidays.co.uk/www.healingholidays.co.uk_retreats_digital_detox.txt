Digital Detox



Need a break from sensory overload? Want to detox your brain as well as your body? Break free of your devices and go on a
digital detox holiday
. Digital detox is the latest trend in Spa and Wellness travel. Nowadays we are more globally connected than ever before, but life in the digital age is far from ideal. Half of Brits admit to checking work e-mails while on holiday, while a third regret spending so much time on them. The negative psychological and social impact is apparent. We are connecting with technology and in turn disconnecting from human interaction. Our ability to stay balanced in this time of exponential technological growth and create healthy relationships with our digital devices will determine the future of humanity. By switching off your digital gadgets it allows you to switch off from life completely which is the best way to de-stress and reconnect with yourself and those around you without any interference. It also gives you a chance to fully relax and enjoy the sights and scenery and to savour your well earned break.



At Healing Holidays we offer a wide range of spas, clinics and retreats which adhere to digital detox. Book your retreat

today - Call us on 020 7843 3597 or enquire
