Jo - 19th March 2017

It’s rare to find such a place as Lefay, in such a beautiful location, the hotel exudes elegance, refinement and sophistication, everything you’d expect from a 5 star resort and more. One of Lefay’s best attributes is its homely and welcoming feel, from the staff, to the décor, the whole aura surrounding Lefay is one of comfort and peace.

The spa was world class, the treatments unbeatable and the food is cooked to perfection. I cannot say enough about this place, I simply loved the week I spent there. Perfect.



Eileen - 2nd April 2017

I and my husband have had the most wonderful week, taking the time to lose some weight and reconnect with ourselves. The practice and theory of Chinese medicine is integral to the ethos of the Spa and programmes. The staff were just wonderful and ever so accommodating. Dr Barbieri and colleagues were both helpful and professional. Each member of staff within the resort made us feel very comfortable and made a real effort to engage with us. The gym was fantastic and well equipped whilst the pools both (the heated indoor/outdoor and the lap pool) were pristine.

We had an amazing time during our stay and couldn’t recommend it enough.



Paula - 17 June 2016

My stay at Lefay Resort was perfect and exactly what I needed. The staff were so helpful, my room lovely, and of course my fitness programme was exactly what I was hoping for, I really noticed results and most importantly I feel so much more motivated to work harder now that I'm back home.  Thank you for your recommendation and ensuring everything went so smoothly for me.









"Great holiday experience at Swa Swara, exceptional food and service at the resort, highly recommended! I wouldn't stay again at Holiday Inn in Mimbay though as a part of the trip,"
