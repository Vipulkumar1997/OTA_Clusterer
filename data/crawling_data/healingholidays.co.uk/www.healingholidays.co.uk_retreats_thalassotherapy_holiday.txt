Thalassotherapy Holidays



Thalassotherapy Holidays

Restore your body with the power of the sea with a thalassotherapy holiday. Thalassotherapy is an ancient therapy dating back to Roman times; it uses natural elements and minerals to provide relaxation and healing. Derived from the Greek word ‘thalassa’, meaning ‘sea’, this cure uses seawater, marine mud and various other natural resources.

It is often used to help improve skin conditions as elements such as potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium are absorbed from the seawater to cleanse and nourish pores. Hydromassage, underwater showers and massage treatments all aid and improve circulation, and help relieve aches and pains in joints.

Luxury Thalassotherapy Retreats

A popular option at our wellbeing retreats, thalassotherapy also assists with weight loss and increases metabolism through massage and submerged jet therapy. This therapy has a strong focus on healing and improving the general wellbeing of the body and it can bring you a sensation of inner calm and relaxation. Our programmes feature the best of thalassotherapy treatments at some of the world’s premier centres with professional physiotherapists, hydro-therapists and thalassotherapy specialists.

Get in contact with one of our wellness experts to discuss your options by calling 020 7843 3597 or submit your enquiry
