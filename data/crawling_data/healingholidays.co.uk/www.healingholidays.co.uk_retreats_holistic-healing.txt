Holistic Healing



Holistic therapies have been very successful in treating those who wish to stop smoking, lose weight, get over insomnia, relieve stress and restore optimal health. Holistic healing is rapidly gaining popularity as people become familiar with the idea that maintaining health involves balance of the body, mind, spirit and emotions. Holistic healers look at the whole of a person when assessing their health needs and will look at diet, physical movement, mental and emotional strain to pinpoint an underlying cause for symptoms that have presented themselves. The aim is not only to heal the ailment the patient has presented, but also seek out the underlying cause and promote overall well being.

Most techniques are not newly developed having been used throughout ancient Asian and Indian history. The term holistic healing is used to describe a list of alternative medical therapies that include
Acupressure, Acupuncture, Aromatherapy, Ayurveda, colour therapy, cupping, Reiki, Osteopathy, colonics, chiropractic, Kinesiology, flower essences, gem therapy, reflexology, herbalism, Chinese medicine, Native American therapy
and many more. Holistic practitioners use a variety of treatments and techniques to assist their patients to take responsibility for their own health and for them to achieve overall wellness. These techniques may include patient education on lifestyle and self-care on topics such as exercise, relationships and counselling; complimentary alternative holistic therapies; and western medication and surgical procedures.

With the many different therapies and treatments to consider, we’ve added a collection of wellness retreats that will assist you in choosing the right holistic healing therapy for you. Whether you’re new to alternative therapies or an experienced holistic healing patient, there are many fantastic options for you to regain your optimal health and restore your well being.
