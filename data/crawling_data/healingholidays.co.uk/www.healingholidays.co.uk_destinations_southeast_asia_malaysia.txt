Malaysia



Malaysia is a pampering paradise with excellent resort spas in idyllic locations with extraordinary spa menus. After visiting the ‘spa villages’ you will be soothed and relaxed, who wouldn’t be after taking part in the Malay concept that emphasises purity of spirit, health and wellbeing? Be massaged until your heart’s content or until you reach your melting point - which ever comes first. Ensure you are early for your spa treatments to allow time for an indulging floral bath before your treatment. When not relaxing in the spa, be sure to explore the magnificent beaches or the snorkelling and diving on offer.
