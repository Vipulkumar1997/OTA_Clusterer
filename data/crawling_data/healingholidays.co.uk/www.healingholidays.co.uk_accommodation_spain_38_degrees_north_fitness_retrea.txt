38 Degrees North Fitness Retreats


Spain
,
Europe






38 Degrees North offers bespoke fitness holidays and experiences for body & mind that deliver results. From effective workouts and bootcamps to nutritional guidance and a wide range of activities that focus on muscle tone, fat reduction and posture improvement. 38 Degress fitness programmes are centred around health and wellness through physical exercise and fun challenges.

The programme is the brain child of James Davis and Kelly Morgan who, together with their A-Team of mind and body professionals, have created focused fitness and detox programmes. Spend your days with boot camp style workouts on the beach, hiking through pine clad hills, paddle boarding from island to island and practicing yoga and meditation in front of dazzling sunsets.

Bespoke itineraries can be created for individual goals on any day of the week, while small group programmes (maximum of 10-12 people) are run on selected dates. The group dates can sell out fast but by keeping the numbers low this means everybody will still get individual attention and focused advice from the professional fitness trainers and nutritionists, as well as making motivational friends for life!

Insider's Tips



Room Types


You can choose to stay in a single or shared accommodation during your programme with 38 Degrees North. It may also be possible for single travellers of the same sex can to volunteer to be matched up with a roommate to avoid a single supplement fee.


Spa


While you work to improve your fitness and overall health, taking a break in the spa will help to rejuvenate your body. At some properties, you will be able to take full advantage of spa facilities to relax in a sauna or steam room.


Activities


During your stay, you will have access to all activities and equipment hire - in addition to access to the spa, gym and classes at Aguas de Ibiza.

A numberous amount of activities are offered throughout the day from 8:30 or 9:00 to no later than 20:00. These activities TRX, kickboxing and boxing.

Other fitness-based activities include kettlebells, dance, power ballet, strength training and Swiss ball core. Outdoor enthusiasts can enjoy coastal runs, hiking, mountain biking or stand up paddle boarding (SUP), and those seekly clarity can join a meditation class.

Feefo Reviews












Solomon - May 2017



Originally it took a lot of persuasion from my wife to make the idea of a fitness holiday sound appealing to me, but I’m so glad she suggested it.It was outstandingly brilliant. I never knew 5 hours of exercise for three days would be so much fun and I'd leave with such a sense of achievement and planning how to eat, drink, exercise and generally live going forward.It’s changed my life for the better and I couldn’t be more grateful.











James - May 2017



Had the best weekend working out with 38 DN - and even managed to fit in a night's dancing too! Excellent training, superb hotel and a lovely group of guests. Highly recommend the weekend to 'reset one's co-ordinates'!











Victoria - March 2017



I attended the Easter bootcamp in Ibiza with a few friends and absolutely loved it. The workouts were challenging but enjoyable and there was no pressure to do more than you wanted to. We were all motivated and encouraged, but it still felt like a relaxing holiday. I had a great time meeting new people and making new friends. I’ll definitely return next year and cannot recommend it highly enough.











Faye T - 12 APR 2015



Thank you so much for suggesting I go to 38 Degrees North. I have always been interested in yoga, and I really got to immerse myself in the practise - while in a gorgeous location. I couldn't have asked for more! To top it off, use of the spa area was the perfect treat after a long day. I feel much more balanced now that I have returned.











Drew - 13 May 2015



After gaining weight at my previous job, I was self-conscious, and I'm glad that I chose this retreat to kick-start my fitness regime. I felt encouraged and I really pushed my physical limits. And now I will keep pushing the boundaries on my strength, speed, flexibility and stamina. Thanks for helping me to select this holiday.











Lena - 28 May 2014



I can't get over what a great time I had with my partner on the Group Optimal Fitness retreat at 38 Degrees North. We generally try to exercise and support each other at home, but the group environment really helped us to keep our energy level and spirits up. The enthusiastic instructors also helped. I tried TRX for the first time, and Dave tried yoga for the first time, so there was lots of learning all around. What a fantastic trip!










Insider's Tips



For programme follow-ups, make sure to book at 38 Degrees North at either Punto Romano in Marbella or ME Ibiza.

Bring along a journal to do extra reflecting after your goal-seting activities and motivational work.

The Body Re-set programme, for females only, is great for hen dos.
