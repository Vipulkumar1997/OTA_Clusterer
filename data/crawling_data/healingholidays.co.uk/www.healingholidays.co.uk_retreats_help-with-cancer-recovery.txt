Help with cancer recovery




Suffering from cancer will never be an easy time, and it is a sad truth that a large portion of the population will at some stage in their lives be affected by it, whether battling it themselves or having a loved one fall prey to the illness. While it may be a difficult time, there are things that can be done to make the situation more bearable. A visit to a spa where one can be nurtured and cared for can be an incredibly uplifting experience for those fighting or in recovery from cancer, with more and more luxury spas reaching out to ensure no one is excluded from their services, especially cancer patients. In fact many spas are now offering treatments and programmes specifically in place to help those who have cancer. Whether you are battling with cancer yourself or know somebody who is, a visit to a retreat or Spa can be extremely beneficial for your health and mental wellbeing.

Discover our selection of retreats below or contact our wellness experts, who will give you unbiased advice on how to tailor the right programme for your individual needs. Call on 020 7843 3597 or submit
