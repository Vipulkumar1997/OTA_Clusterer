Quit Smoking

Fixing your issues



The majority of smokers want to quit, but find it too difficult. At some point they have tried going cold turkey, hypnotherapy, reading a self-help book, or swapping cigarettes for nicotine-replacement patches, gum, or e-cigarettes. A few lucky people never start again, but most smokers spend years caught in the stop-start cycle, feeling out of control and unhappy.
The stop smoking programmes at our selected retreats offer modern techniques and therapies that are administered to get fast, long-lasting results, that can help you stop smoking and learn how to never start again.
Programmes include lectures, counselling, therapies and pampering spa treatments that will help you relax and relieve stress during the detox process, which can be stressful on your body and taxing on your nerves. You will learn relaxation techniques that you can practice once you return home as well.

Talk to one of our wellness consultants on 020 7843 3597 or submit an enquiry form
here
to tailor your perfect quit smoking retreat.
