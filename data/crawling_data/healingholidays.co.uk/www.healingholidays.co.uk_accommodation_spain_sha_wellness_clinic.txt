SHA Wellness Clinic


Spain
,
Europe






Hidden away in Spain’s Sierra Helada Mountains, this strikingly-cool minimalist jewel is considered one of the best medical spas in Europe. SHA was the brainchild of Alfredo Bataller Parietti; his vision was to open a clinic that could treat major illnesses with a perfect fusion of natural ancient Eastern philosophy and advanced cutting-edge Western techniques, alongside a pure macrobiotic nutrition diet.

There is a huge array of tailored programmes on offer as part of Sha’s Wellness Clinic, from Detox and Sleep Recovery to Fitness and Weight Loss. Each programme can help you to discover a healthy new lifestyle focused on improving your wellbeing through a series of natural therapies, healthy nutrition and a personalised fitness plan.

The clinic is home to various wellness units including the Sha Anti-Ageing medicine unit, designed to delay the ageing process and improve overall health. Other units include the Revitalising Medicine Cognitive Function Stimulation unit and the Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine unit.

For more information, read a review of this amazing clinic, as featured in the
2017 Conde Nast Traveller Spa Guide

Cuisine


This is the European home of Macrobiotics (a diet focused largely on organic whole grains and vegetables), so expect healthy-eating throughout your stay. However, that’s not to say you won’t enjoy it. Chef Pablo Montoro (who trained at legendary restaurant El Bulli) ensures that dishes such as tuna tataki on mushroom risotto and chocolate cake sweetened with rice syrup, are as delicious as they are nutritious. You can even take classes in macrobiotic cooking.

Shamadi

The Shamadi diet is based on the healing power of nature, accessed directly through food. Modern macrobiotic dishes feature Mediterranean and Japanese fusion cuisine, prepared using the finest organic ingredients. Wherever possible, organic and locally grown seasonal foods are used at SHA.


Activities


SHA Wellness Clinic offers an impressive range of activities both within the resort and in the surrounding area to help make your time spent here even more rewarding. Take in the scenic beauty of the area with a cruise along the Guadalest reservoir, a bicycle ride along El Albir and Altea, or even opt for a helicopter tour along the coast if you’re feeling extra extravagant.

For those looking for something a little more active, there are plenty of options available to please you also. Perhaps opt for some water sports and go diving in the bay of Altea or jet-skiing on Jávea beach, or keep your feet planted firmly on land with a round of golf at one of the many golf courses in the area.

While many of these activities will incur an additional charge, there is also a wide range of SHA Wellness Academy Activities including talks, yoga, tai chi, walks, healthy cookery classes that are usually included in your programme.

Karen was so helpful and responsive to all my concerns and everything about my holiday was perfectly organised. Sha Wellness Clinic Retreat, 4 Day Discovery Programme: A very high level of professionalism was shown and the programme was designed to give you an insight into all the different therapies that they can provide. The macrobiotic cuisine was exceptional.

Luxurious yet medical and delivers excellent health results











CD - 5 Oct 2016



Hi, I returned from SHA on Monday feeling refreshed and fantastic and having lost some weight which was great. The place is amazing, I was so impressed with everything. A big thank you to you for helping arrange it all. Hopefully I will be in contact to book next year!











RK - 3 Feb 2016



After a little over-indulgence over the festive period I was in serious need of a detox and thanks to the incredible SHA Wellness Clinic I got just that. A week on the SHA Detox Programme was just what I needed to feel like my usual self again, thank you for the excellent recommendation. The personalised diet and exercise plan made me feel like I was getting exactly what I needed, and I definitely feel a lot healthier now. I have more energy, my skin looks brighter, and I even dropped a couple of pounds, all my friends have noticed the difference so I've made sure to recommend SHA and Heal...











CR - 14 Oct 2015



I went to SHA Wellness Clinic for a week on their weight-loss programme and it was a great experience. I had mixed feelings before I left, excited by the prospect of losing a few pounds but dreading the actual process it would take to do that, but I needn't have worried. No it's not a walk in the park, but if you are serious about losing weight that's not what you need. It's challenging but it's rewarding - and the diet was actually surprisingly enjoyable. The staff are attentive, the location is beautiful, and most importantly I lost weight. I am now planning to stick to t...











MB - 3 Dec 2015



Wow - that's all I can say really. I have struggled to quit smoking for years and after a week at SHA Wellness Clinic on their anti-tobacco programme I have never had more confidence in my ability to quit, I am yet to have a cigarette since my return and what more can you really ask than that? The way they get to the root cause of your addiction in the psychotherapy sessions makes all the difference and all the other treatments you have certainly help ease the stress that can come with not being able to smoke.I believe this was a great investment in my healtth so thank you for your recomme...

Don’t miss out on the morning walk to the lighthouse
