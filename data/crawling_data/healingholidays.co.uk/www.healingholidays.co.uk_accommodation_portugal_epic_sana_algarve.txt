Isabelle - 30 Oct 2017



I have never been on such a holiday before and wasn't sure what to expect.  Well, it was incredibly well organised,  very soothing and completely stress free.  The hotel was wonderful.  From the minute the taxi approached the drive, I knew I was in for a treat.  The space, light and calm are such striking features that I immediately felt more relaxed.  The outdoor space is landscaped with style and in keeping with the location.  Areas around the pools are amazing.  Everything from the bedroom, bathroom, house keeping, activities, food, service oozed luxury, great attention to detail and ut...











Josephine - 9 Jul 2016



Fantastic trip! I lost 3kg, and my whole body is more toned. I'm stronger and motivated to keep going. The hotel, food and staff were fantastic as well!











Sue D. - 18 Feb 2016



This is an amazing place for a fitness retreat! Very welcoming environment and very supportive staff. I would recommend the Epic Sana bootcamp to anyone who is already active but wants to improve their shape. I had a specifically tailored diet plan and access to all the wellness treatments, which was a really good combination of fitness with well-being. At the end of the fitness programme I felt a million times stronger and now I'm on a total bootcamp kick! Thank you Healing Holidays for organising my trip to Portugal and for all the preparation prior to the fitness retreat.











Michelle G - 28 Nov 2015



I really enjoyed my stay at Epic Sana Algarve. The rooms were beautiful,  lovely staff and helpful, and the food was delicious. We enjoyed our 7 nights Bootcamp with great classes and sessions and had an excellent support from the personal trainer and the nutritionist.  Take advantage of the great spa on site and The Fitness Centre. We’ll definitely be returning next year.










Insider's Tips



The gym and indoor swimming pool are open 24 hours per day making it easy to train when the mood takes you;

If you like surfing take a trip to Salgados, which is only about 15 to 20 km from the Hotel;

Try the Zentai Crystal treatment to rebalance;

Avoid the school holidays where possible as Epic Sana is popular with families.
