Italy



Italy has long been a popular holiday destination, with its pleasant climate, beautiful scenery, and relaxed way of life drawing in visitors eager to experience all that it has to offer. However, more than being ideal for your typical holiday, Italy is also the perfect destination for a wellness break. Spa junkies will feel more than at home here, with every kind of wellness retreat imaginable on offer.

Whether you are seeking an intensive detox to refresh and rejuvenate, a weight-loss retreat that will see the pounds drop off, a high-tech medical programme, or even just a spot of pampering – you can find it all in Italy. The land lends itself to all different kinds of programmes, for outdoor fitness head to the Alps and breathe in the fresh mountain air, for the thermal spas we recommend Tuscany, and if what you’re after is some beach time and pampering, then the South is the destination for you.

Italy features the largest number of natural thermal spa centres in the world, after all this is the home of the ancient Roman baths, and you should certainly make a point of experiencing them during your stay. A dip in these hot springs is said to provide all manner of health benefits, and the best way to discover just what these are is so try them for yourselves. Italy touches the hearts of all who visits, and you’ll find that after your first time you’ll be desperate to return again and again.

"They were very helpful and managed to accommodate my needs and holiday dates. The emails and documentation was very detailed and provided me with a hassle-free holiday. Just had to check in and fly. Everything else was sorted.
The only reason I have chosen 4 start is because the payment portal on the site is not SSL secured and this should be changed immediately to give customers 100% peace of mind that no details can be stolen in the process. I paid over the phone instead."
