Ayurveda Retreats



Ayurveda is an ancient Hindu medical practice, originating in India, which works on the basis that the body, mind and spirit must all be treated together as a whole in order to achieve optimum health. It is a scientific medical system (involving years of training), which not only treats illnesses but offers a framework for a complete and holistic way of life.

This may sound like jargon, but many of its principles are very much common sense and some will prove to be more than that, and result in a total health revelation that leaves you feeling transformed. Any Ayurvedic holiday will start with an assessment of your personal health and lifestyle, usually in the form of an extensive questionnaire (including such queries as– are you calm tempered? Do you have good stamina? Do you gain weight easily?). On the basis of your answers the therapist/Ayurvedic doctor can establish your ‘dosha’, of which there are three main types –Kapha, Pitta and Vata.They will then prescribe a Ayurvedic programme aimed at balancing your individual constitution, incorporating everything from diet (including which foods to avoid, and which to eat more of) and lifestyle choices, to which treatments you should opt for.

Discover our selection of Ayurveda retreats below or contact our wellness experts, who will give you unbiased advice on how to tailor the right programme for your individual needs. Call on 020 7843 3597 or submit
