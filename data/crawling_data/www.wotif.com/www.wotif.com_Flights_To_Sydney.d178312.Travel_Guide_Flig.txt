Flights To Sydney
You’d think a city this good-looking might be lacking in substance, but boy, would you be wrong! Even when you look past the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge—two of the most recognisable structures in the world—you’ll see a rugged Pacific coastline, a surprisingly casual nightlife scene and curious wildlife that enjoys the city just as much as the human neighbours.
Explore the plentiful parks, go on a culinary adventure with the city’s daring chefs or explore sites of indigenous and convict history hidden in plain sight. Or, you know, you could just sunbathe in the seemingly endless days of summer. Either way, a pair of thongs and jeans are the perfect attire for our Sydney flights.
Getting Around Sydney
Sydney Kingsford Smith International Airport (SYD) is the oldest continuously operating airport in the world, but that doesn’t mean its transportation options are outdated. There are bus and rail systems, shuttles and taxis. You can also book one of Wotif’s car hire options.
When You Land…
Are you on one of the flights to Sydney that lands in the morning? Head to The Rocks and imagine what it was like to live in the first European settlement in Australia. And you thought
you
had a taste for adventure.
If you arrive in the afternoon, check out the animals at the Taronga Zoo. Landing at night? Grab a drink! From bumping clubs to small dive bars, Irish pubs and microbreweries, there are plenty of places to enjoy yourself. You might want to stop into one of our
Sydney hotels
first for a “
disco nap”
, because the party goes all night here in Sydney.
Live Like a Local
Instead of just snapping a few shots of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge, join the locals in watching the Flying Foxes (nevermind the name; they’re actually bats) fly over them at dusk. It’s a completely unique experience!
Looking for unique savings on your getaway? Wotif has the best deals on cheap flights to Sydney. Grab these babies before they fly away!
