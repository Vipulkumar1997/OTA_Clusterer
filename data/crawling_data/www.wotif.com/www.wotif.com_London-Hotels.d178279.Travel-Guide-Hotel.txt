Accommodation In London
Pack your walking shoes, togs and sleekest sunnies—this isn’t your grandma’s London. Well, actually, it is…this old gal has been around awhile. The capital of England is a city on a spectrum. From the White Tower, completed in 1101, to theatre world premieres in the West End, London seamlessly combines old and new. And that’s not all. Step back in time in vintage London hotels and see the world in several museums and art galleries that don’t charge admission fees—we like free stuff, don’t you?












When you want to swap your culture fix for an adrenaline rush, you can test your whitewater rafting skills on the site of the 2012 Summer Olympic Games or take a chilly autumnal pool dip in Hampstead Heath. See? Book
flights to London
and see just how eclectic this city can be!
Hotels in London are plentiful, from quiet Canonbury to bustling Brixton. For a home base in the hub of must-see sights, book
accommodation near the Tower of London
. Public transport can take you practically anywhere in this sprawling and diverse city, so no matter where you tuck in at night, you can stay, play, repeat.
Things to Do in London
You’ll need to mind the gap, but don’t pay any attention to the old nickname “The Big Smoke”. Make your first stop the London Eye—an observation wheel that gives you a bird’s eye view of London’s top historical sites. Check out Westminster Abbey, Big Ben and Buckingham Palace! A few metro stops to the east, you can take in a performance at Shakespeare’s Globe before walking across London Bridge to climb to the top of the Tower of London.
While you’re on the north side of the river, keep on trekking up to Camden Lock Market and scoop up some quirky souvenirs and sample exotic flavours or get a new tattoo—you know, to remember the holiday. Otherwise, photos ops in the colourful streets of Covent Garden will do just fine.
When evening falls, make sure you’re in Marylebone, home to Madame Tussauds London, great dining options and Sherlock Holmes—no big deal. Marylebone also happens to border the West End, so dinner and a show are already taken care of. When you’re ready for some peace and quiet, check in to accommodation in London’s riverside Greenwich.
Getting To & Around London
Most intercontinental flights touch down at London Heathrow Airport (LHR), about 31km west of the city centre and top London accommodation. With interwoven networks of buses, rail lines and an extensive subway system, London is one of the most pedestrian-friendly cities in the world. If public transit just isn’t your cuppa tea, don’t worry; taxis and car hire options are also plentiful.
Are flying broomsticks more your transport of choice? Then book a day at the
Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter
and pack your cape!
Upcoming Events
Each summer, Londoners shake off the spring showers and get ready for months of fun in the sun. Yes, England can be sunny and very warm, too! We know, it’s shocking.
Speaking of spring, nothing gets the season off to a smashing start quite like Wimbledon. Since 1877, athletes and enthusiasts swarm the tennis courts for lots of love and lobs. Don’t miss it! And for a party with a smidge less decorum and more colourful outfits, make sure you’re in town for Notting Hill Carnival—a late August street fair that celebrates London’s Afro-Caribbean heritage. Follow the drum parade through the streets; if you get distracted by rainbow feathers or mesmerised by plates of jerk chicken with rice and beans, join the dance or dig in on what locals say is some of the best food in London!
Get Outside!
Almost half of London is covered in green space, so come rain or shine, get outside! The city is sprinkled with grassy parks, and each one is unique. If you want to wander through the wilderness with Bambi’s cousins, then borrow a bicycle to cover the 1099 acres of Bushy Park north of Hampton Court Palace.
Closer to the city centre, Kensington Gardens are in fact one of the Queen’s stomping grounds, as well as home to the Peter Pan Fountain, the famous memorial to J.M. Barrie and lost boys everywhere. Kensington may be a smaller oasis, but the gardens are gorgeous and there’s a palace that dates back to the 17th century. The decision is up to you—wild deer or posh flower beds. Potato,
potahto
. Visit both!
Must-See Spots
If you’ve got just one day in London, it’s going to be a full one. When you have such a lush landscape all around you, it may be hard to believe that London keeps collections of its beauty indoors. Between walks in the park and catching up with local festivals, visit the city’s top museums—many of which are free to the public.
The façade of the Natural History Museum is as intricate as the prehistoric specimens you’ll discover when you step inside. The British Museum can’t be missed, either. It hosts one of the biggest art and culture collections in the world, and in this case, bigger is better. If you’ve ever wanted to read the Rosetta Stone—who hasn’t?—this is where you’ll find it, along with galleries of countless other treasures.
England’s capital city has all the history and sweetness of afternoon tea, with rainbow-splashed parades and wizardly attractions for spicing things up. While you plan an awesome trip, we’ll take care of the deals. Mix and match the best airfares and places to stay in London when you book
London holidays
with Wotif. Cheers!

Very well located to Paddington Station
No air conditioning which made the rooms very hot.   Also the cleaners were not cleaning the rooms until very late in the afternoon, so when we came back in around 3 pm rooms still uncleaned and then they wanted to clean - this needs to be improved.     Also check out staff were not very friendly, especially compared to those who checked us out
