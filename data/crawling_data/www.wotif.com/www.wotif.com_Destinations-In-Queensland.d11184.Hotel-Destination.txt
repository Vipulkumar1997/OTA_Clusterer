A great place to explore the Gold Coast
We have stayed there many times before prior to the recent name change of Star. The renovations that have taken place over recent months have placed the venue in the top class category. The accommodation rooms now are extremely comfortable with up to date technology.

Accommodation In Queensland
Queensland is famous for its great weather and friendly people, and the Sunshine State has so much to offer: From the natural beauty of the Great Barrier Reef and National Park rainforests, to the outback; from the state’s capital Brisbane, to secluded beaches and tropical islands; from Aboriginal cultural attractions, to historic sites of European settlement.  We have
Queensland accommodation
to suit every holiday, all at great rates.
Explore the state’s capital with our great rates on
Brisbane accommodation
.  Or soak up the beach culture and have fun at theme parks from our
Gold Coast accommodation
.  Or for a relaxing beach getaway just out of Brisbane, check out our great rates on
Sunshine Coast hotels
.
Queensland’s biggest tourist attraction is the World Heritage listed
Great Barrier Reef
, which is over two million years old and covers an area of 345,000 square km off the Queensland coast.  This amazing natural attraction is accessible from our accommodation in Bundaberg, Gladstone,
Cairns
, Capricorn, the Whitsundays, Mackay,
Townsville

and our Tropical North Queensland hotels. The area is also accessible from our
Port Douglas
,
Hamilton Island
,
Airlie Beach
,
Magnetic Island

and
Palm Cove accommodation
. If you are looking for an island paradise, stay in one of our
Whitsundays hotels

to explore the 74 beautiful islands of the Whitsundays, surrounded by deep blue waters perfect for sailing.
If you want to experience Queensland country hospitality, stay in our
Mackay accommodation

or our Rockhampton hotels in the Beef Capital of Australia.  Or stay in our Roma hotels to experience a Queensland country town with Australia’s largest cattle sales taking place every Tuesday and Thursday, and Queensland’s oldest winery, established in 1863.  Or if you are after an Outback experience, stay in our Mt Isa accommodation.
Stay in our
Hervey Bay
,
Fraser Coast

or
Fraser Island accommodation

to experience this beautiful area just four hours' drive north of Brisbane.  World Heritage listed Fraser Island is the world’s largest sand island, and the only place where rainforest grows on sand.  Harvey bay is one of the most popular whale watching destinations as around 2000 Humpbacks migrate past the area each year between August and November.
Our Maryborough accommodation allows you to experience one of Queensland's oldest provincial cities, where the heritage of the area can be seen in the many fine examples of Queensland architecture, and at a historic corner store, Brennan and Geraghty's Store, which is preserved by the National Trust.
Make the most of your holiday budget and get great rates on accommodation throughout Queensland with Wotif.com.
