Flights To Melbourne
Did you know it’s illegal to drive a goat or dog attached to a vehicle in a public place in Melbourne? Neither did we, but it’s true. Why you need to know that is beyond us, but we figured we’d pass the info on in case you had a few too many schooners and thought it’d be a good idea to hook up a golden retriever to a Toyota. With that in mind, check out Wotif’s great deals on cheap flights to Melbourne and leave home immediately.
Getting Around Melbourne
Hey mate, take a stab at where flights to Melbourne land. If you said Melbourne Airport (MEL), 23km from the city centre, you’d be right. After you’ve taken a taxi to your hotel, get out and explore the city. You can ride the free tram to just about anywhere in the central business district. Taxicabs are always an option, but if you want to drive yourself, get a vehicle from Wotif’s great car hire options.
When You Land…
Are you on one of the Melbourne flights that lands as the sun takes off? If so, spend the morning at the St. Kilda Esplanade Market. You can fill up on local delicacies and souvenir shop until you drop—all in the span of two hours. That’ll give you plenty of time to hit places like the Sea Life Aquarium.
If you’re landing during the evening hours, head straight for Chapel Street and make friends with the residents in one of the many watering holes.
Live Like a Local
Locals know the ins and outs of this town, so when they’re talking, you should listen. Like when they tell you to go to the Melbourne Cricket Ground and watch the local AFL club, the Demons, demolish whoever they’re playing. A few Victoria Bitters and you’ll be a Demons fan in no time.
Forget about all that “Throw another shrimp on the Barbie, mate” stuff. Just browse our fantastic offers on
accommodation in Melbourne
and enjoy your time down under.
