Holidays to the Gold Coast

Surfers flock to the Gold Coast like moths to a flame, but even if hanging 10 isn’t your thing, you can still have the time of your life in this Queensland destination.

High-rises, theme parks and relaxing spas are a big part of the landscape here, so there is always something to do. Outdoor enthusiasts and foodies alike will find a home away from home on the Gold Coast. Even better, thanks to killer Wotif deals on Gold Coast holidays, you can plan your dream holiday without spending an arm and a leg in the process.
Things to Do on the Gold Coast
The list of things to do along the Gold Coast is nearly as long as the beach, which is really saying something, since the sand stretches more than 50 km here. If you’re a water lover, you will find everything from surfing to jet skiing in abundant supply. On the other hand, the Gold Coast certainly doesn’t leave landlubbers in the cold. Climb to the Gold Coast SkyPoint Observation Deck for panoramic views of land and sea, then go to the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary to make some new furry (or feathered) friends.
Getting around on foot near the beach is a breeze, but a
car hire on the Gold Coast
really opens up your itinerary. With your own set of wheels, you can get from Coolangatta to the rainforest on your own schedule, no questions asked.
Shopping, Dining & Nightlife
What’s that? The big money you saved booking one of our top Gold Coast packages is asking to be spent? You’re in luck; the Gold Coast has everything from charming boutiques to expansive retail outlets. You’ll have no trouble finding a place to pick up designer duds, boardies or a new wetsuit to take home at the end of your holiday.
When you’re ready to take a shopping break and grab some grub, everything from upscale steakhouses to small cafes characterise the gastronomy on the Gold Coast. Whether you’re seeking something savoury or sweet, there is a coastal restaurant serving up food with a view.
At the end of the day, you don’t have to pack it in early at your hotel. Party people can head to the Surfer’s Paradise neighbourhood north of the city of Gold Coast to bust some moves on its packed dance floors. If you went too hard the previous night, keep it a bit more low key with a bar crawl or a waterfront cocktail. Even on a laid-back night, you’re sure to have a smashing time—and you’ll be well rested and ready to rip the next day.
What’s Next
Wotif always has spectacular Gold Coast package deals. When you combine our awesome airfares with great hotel rates, it translates to a guilt-free holiday. Whether you’re off on a luxury escape or looking to enjoy a budget holiday on the beach, Wotif
packages to Queensland
let you find a holiday that’s just your cup of tea. Why wait? Listen to your holiday self and book an oceanfront getaway today.




Guide to Exploring Gold Coast


Surfers Paradise Holiday Packages
For beach-lovers, getaways to the capital of the Gold Coast are worth their weight in, well, gold. As one of the best places to hang ten in Australia, Surfers Paradise really earns its name. This place is incredibly laid-back, so don’t let any of those high-rises sparkling in the sun fool you. With 52km of golden beaches and just 300 sunny days to enjoy them each year, there simply isn’t time to waste rushing around. So stroll through shops, restaurants, bars and clubs. Take a dip in the ocean. Get baked (by the sun, that is) on the sand. Whatever’s clever.

Cavill Avenue

Coolangatta Holiday Packages
Just because a town has the word “cool” in it doesn’t actually mean it really is
cool,
right? There’s no way it could be lined with picture-perfect beaches. There’s no way it could have happening bars full of lively locals who want to buy you a schooner or two. There’s no way a place like that exists. It’s all rubbish!
Oh, how wrong the above statement is, because Coolangatta on Australia’s Gold Coast is just that. The waves from Snapper Rocks to Kirra are world-class. The bars along The Patch seem to never stop raging. So yeah, we think it’s about time you book one of Wotif’s Coolangatta holiday packages and see it for yourself.

Australian Outback Spectacular
Experience a captivating performance showcasing Australian myths and legends while enjoying a typical Aussie dinner with ingredients sourced from the region.
See hotels near here
SkyPoint Observation Deck
Enjoy a drink and take in far-reaching views across the Surfers Paradise shoreline toward the Gold Coast Hinterland at this towering beachside observation deck.
See hotels near here
Mount Tamborine Holiday Packages
You might expect a spot called “Mount Tamborine” to attract a lot of folk singers. And maybe it does—if those folk singers also crave epic views of the Gold Coast and the Pacific Ocean from a height of 578 metres, that is. Even then they’d be in for a surprise, because despite its name and elevation, Mount Tamborine is actually a plateau in the lush Gold Coast hinterland.
If you’re visiting the Gold Coast or Brisbane, Tamborine Mountain makes a fabulous day trip. If you can’t wait to explore wild jungles that look like somewhere dinosaurs might still roam, then Mount Tamborine and the Gold Coast hinterland is a destination that stands on its own foothills. Either way, our Mount Tamborine holiday packages can help you get here in style. Pack your hiking boots and remember: Tyrannosaurus Rex can’t see you if you stand still!
See hotels near here
Tamborine National Park Palm Grove Section
Wander through groves of towering piccabeen palms, ancient strangler figs and ghost gums on the rainforest trails teeming with birdlife.
See hotels near here
Broadbeach Holiday Packages
What do celebrities, families and solo surfers seeking gnarly waves all have in common? Well, they all love Broadbeach, for starters. It’s the perfect spot for a Gold Coast getaway—just south of all the attractions of Surfers Paradise, and home to some of the best shopping and dining in the area. Just ask Kylie Minogue.
If you can’t get in touch with her, check out our guide below, then hurry up and book Broadbeach holiday packages!
