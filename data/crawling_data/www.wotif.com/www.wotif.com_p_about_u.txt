WELCOME TO WOTIF: THE HOME OF HOLIDAYS

Wotif® brings you access to millions of rooms and hundreds of airlines, flying to thousands of destinations around the world, giving you the flexibility to create a holiday or business trip that’s right for you.

Whether you choose to book accommodation, flights or access special savings by combining your flights and hotel in a Wotif package, Wotif offers great value travel choices locally and around the world.

Half of all Aussies, and one-in-four New Zealanders have booked a holiday with Wotif since we launched in the Year 2000. We’re one of the original online travel sites in Australia and New Zealand, and have been helping travellers create travel memories for more than 15 years.

The Wotif business started out in a humble garage office in Brisbane with an idea that would transform the travel industry: people love a great travel deal, simple as that. Today we’re a leading online travel site in Australia and New Zealand with a team of passionate travellers behind the brand.
