Accommodation In Northern Territory
Stay in our Northern Territory accommodation to experience Australia’s red heart. If you want to get to back to nature and enjoy bushwalking, canoeing and fishing, stay in our
Katherine accommodation

and explore Nitmiluk National Park where the Katherine River spectacularly winds its way through sandstone cliffs at Katherine Gorge.
Stay in our
Alice Springs hotels

and experience this historic town, which boasts many galleries with permanent displays of Central Australian indigenous art including the Albert Namatjira Gallery. See the breathtaking views across the dessert from Kings Canyon, in Watarrka National Park, by using our
Kings Canyon

accommodation as a base.
Our
Ayers Rock/Uluru accommodation

is a great base from which to explore Australia's most recognisable natural icon, Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock. Also in the area is Kata Tjuta, also known as the Olgas, which is a massive pile of rock domes, which are over 500 million years old. Both these sites have great cultural significance for the traditional land owners, the Anangu People, who run walking tours about the local flora and fauna, bushfoods and local Aboriginal Dreamtime stories. Stay in our
Darwin accommodation

to experience the relaxed lifestyle and rich culture and history of Australia's only tropical capital city. While staying in our Darwin accommodation get up close and personal with one of Australia's most infamous animals - the crocodile.  See the daily feeding of 15,000 saltwater crocodiles at Darwin Crocodile Farm. Or see daily feeding displays, crocodile museum and hawksbill turtles, green iguanas, monkeys, Persian leopards and Bengal tigers alongside Australian wildlife from brolgas to wallaroos, at Crocodylus Park - wildlife research and education centre.
Our Darwin accommodation is a great base to explore the World Heritage listed, Kakadu National Park, just 120km from Darwin.  Apart from the amazing flora and fauna of the rainforest and wetlands, major attractions of the park include the Aboriginal shelters, stone tools, grindstones and ochre, evidence of over 50,000 years of Aboriginal inhabitation. Or if you want to take your time to explore the area, we have great rates on
Kakadu National Park accommodation
.
