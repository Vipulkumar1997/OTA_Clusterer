Flights To London
London. The city of royalty. And a big clock. And a big Ferris wheel. And football fans who will do just about anything for their club. Check that—they
will
do anything for their club. Doesn’t that all sound delightful? It does to us. But we can’t go yet. You can, so why don’t you browse Wotif’s amazing deals on
accommodation in London
and tell us what you think?
Getting Around London
Flights to London will land at Heathrow Airport (LHR), a great airport in a city with one of the best public transportation systems on the planet. You can go anywhere in the city whenever you want. Just take the train, the Tube, a taxi or one of those double-decker buses Austin Powers used to cruise around in.
When You Land…
If you’re on one of the London flights that land in the AM, be happy. Use that amazing public transportation and find your way to the London Eye, the giant Ferris wheel. A few spins on it will help you get a good look at the cityscape.
Maybe you’re getting into town in the PM; if that’s the case, you should still be happy. Wander your way to the West End and see a show.
Live Like a Local
Even we can’t believe the savings you’ll get with Wotif’s cheap flights to London (well, yes we can). Use some of it to buy a ticket to a football game at Emirates Stadium, the home pitch of Arsenal Football Club. Learn the chants, wear the right colours and down English ales with the hooligans. Not a bad weekday afternoon, huh?
We know you’ve been dying to see an English football match in the flesh. Browse our fantastic offers on
London holiday packages
and get going on your next getaway immediately.
