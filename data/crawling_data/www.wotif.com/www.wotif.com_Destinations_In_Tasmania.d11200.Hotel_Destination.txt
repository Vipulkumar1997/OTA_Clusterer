Warm Comfort in the wilderness
It was a real relief to find such a warm and inviting place when we arrived after a cold and wet day hiking to Cradle Mountain.

Accommodation In Tasmania
For such a small state, Tasmania sure packs a lot of unique experiences. There’s remote wilderness, convict ruins, lovely ocean views and cities full of creativity. Whether your goal is to hang out in a sandstone pub in
Hobart

or to explore the Freycinet Peninsula, now is the perfect time for your first (or second or third) visit to Tasmania. Romantic getaways, family trips and solo treks – we have the right hotel for whatever kind of holiday you’re after, so book your Tasmania hotel with us.
Iconic landmarks and attractions
Tasmania has some of the most beautiful natural sights in Australia.
Freycinet National Park

is a rugged mountain peninsula surrounded by beaches and bays like Wineglass Bay. The Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage area is one of the largest wilderness areas let on Earth, covering almost twenty percent of Tasmania. Port Arthur is the most complete convict site in the country, and its historic ruins will have you feeling like you’ve travelled back in time to the 1800s.
Capital city Hobart offers hiking and biking on Mt. Wellington, fascinating art galleries like MONA and unique shopping at Salamanca Market. Second biggest city
Launceston

is the home of Cataract Gorge, a little patch of wilderness complete with cliffs, South Esk River and the longest single-span chairlift in the world.
Getting there
Once you’ve booked your Tassie accommodation with us, you can head to the Apple Isle with one of our
cheap flights to Hobart

or
cheap flights to Launceston
.
Getting around
There are no passenger trains in Tasmania. A hire car is the best way to see the island if you want the most freedom and are keen to see out-of-the-way areas, but buses are another option. Cities like Hobart, Launceston and
Burnie

have plenty of them, and you can also catch a bus to several regional and remote towns with a company like Tassielink. If you really want to kick back and not have to plan too much, take a tour. One way or another, the beauty of Tasmania is waiting for you when you book our Tasmania accommodation.
