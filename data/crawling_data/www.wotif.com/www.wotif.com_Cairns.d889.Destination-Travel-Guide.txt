Holidays To Cairns

A coastal Queensland city with a tropical climate, Cairns is a great place to get away from it all.

Outdoorsy types love this city, as it offers a multitude of exciting activities with beautiful scenery. From snorkelling to hiking and everything in between, you'll have no trouble stumbling upon a memorable adventure in Cairns. Experience it all with our Cairns holiday packages, which give you easy access to the city's many highlights.
Things to Do in Cairns
There is so much to do and see along the coast of Queensland. After you settle in at one of the many comfortable hotels in Cairns, reserve a
Cairns car hire
and take control of your holiday destiny. Don’t forget to stop by Barlow Park, which is the home of multiple rugby clubs, as well as the Far North Queensland Football Club, better known as the FNQ FC Heat. If you're taking in a big game, be sure to get there early—actual seating is limited and popular events require some spectators to watch from the hillside. No trip to Cairns is complete without a lazy afternoon at the beach. Check out the excellent beaches in and around Cairns, including Clifton Beach, Kewarra Beach, Yorkeys Knob, Ellis Beach and Palm Cove Beach. All are wonderful places to relax and catch a few rays. If you prefer to actively explore the waters surrounding Cairns, be sure to take part in a snorkelling or scuba diving expedition. Often included in our Cairns packages, these adventures let you witness the colourful world of the Great Barrier Reef.
Shopping, Dining & Nightlife
Cairns boasts a variety of excellent shopping opportunities, but the best is easily the Cairns Night Markets, featuring over 70 shops packed with unique crafts, clothing and souvenirs. Local artisans who live and work in Northern Queensland make many of these items.
Seafood is a big deal here, as Cairns is right on the coast. A few of the best seafood restaurants are waterfront establishments that allow diners to look out at the beautiful ocean view while they feast on fresh catches. Indian cuisine is also popular in Cairns, with some of the area's finest Indian restaurants conveniently located along Highway 1.
As amazing as the restaurants located along the Cairns pier are, the nightlife is even better. Cairns residents and tourists alike favour laid-back bars over heart-pumping nightclubs, although both options are available in this bustling city. Several of the pier's relaxed bars feature delightfully greasy appetisers and even better cocktails.
What's Next?
Whether you prefer to spend your Cairns holidays on your feet, in the water or lounging on the beach, we can help you plan your dream getaway. It doesn't matter if you're hoping to book a romantic weekend with your sweetheart or a huge expedition with your extended family; with our assistance, you'll score the perfect trip. Get started, and book your
Cairns CBD holidays
today.

A tidy little hotel right in the city close to everything. The room was not made up (all draws and cupboards were open) and was very small.
