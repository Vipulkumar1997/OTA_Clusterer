Flights To Bali
Bali! Bali! Bali! Bali! It’s fun to say that really fast. It’s also fun to go there. Dense tropical forests loaded with pesky macaques. Black sand beaches with perfect waves rolling in. Street chefs whipping up perfectly grilled skewers of beef and chicken. Check out Wotif’s splendid offers on
Bali accommodation
and we’ll see you there.
Getting Around Bali
This may be an island, but it’s a pretty
big
island, so walking won’t be your only option for getting around. When flights to Bali land at Ngurah Rai International Airport (DPS), there’s a public transport system featuring buses and taxis that can take you anywhere. If you want to strike out on your own, get a motorbike or vehicle from Wotif’s car hire options and brave the Bali traffic.
When You Land…
Take the savings you got from our cheap Bali flights, get a motorbike and make the 22km trek to Ubud Monkey Forest. Grab a handful of mangoes and host a lunch party with hundreds of crab-eating macaques. Keep an eye out for the ones lingering about—they’re known to have hands like pickpockets. After you’ve gotten your belongings back, ride 32km to Kuta Beach and go souvenir shopping in Kuta Square. You could always use a Buddha figurine.
Live Like a Local
Have you ever dreamed of catching the perfect wave? Hang in Kuta and take a surfing lesson in the warm waters off the black sand beach. After you’ve hung 10, make your way into town and enjoy a big plate of sate, a skewer dish of beef and chicken. Thanks to the money you save with lastminute.com.au’s cheap flights to Bali, you can buy all the sate skewers you want.
Doesn’t the “Island of Gods” sound unbelievable? We think so. Check out our fantastic offers on
Bali holiday packages
and book one as soon as you can. What are you waiting for?
