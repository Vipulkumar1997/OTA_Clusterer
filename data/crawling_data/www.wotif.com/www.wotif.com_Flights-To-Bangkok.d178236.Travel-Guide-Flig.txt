Flights To Bangkok
When you fly into the giant metropolis of Bangkok, it might be hard to imagine that it used to be nothing more than a small trading post before it became the capital of Siam. But if you have an in-flight cocktail and squint through the tiny window before you rub the sleep out of your eyes, you can just picture it. Ready to explore this vast city for yourself? So are we.
Getting Around Bangkok
Bangkok is broken up into 50 districts and even more sub-districts, but don’t worry. Once one of Wotif’s Bangkok flights lands, you can grab a tuk-tuk (or motorcycle cab) and head into Siam Square for glitzy malls; Rattanakosin to see Old Bangkok; or Sukhumvit for
Bangkok accommodation
, restaurants and entertainment. If you prefer public transportation, the Airport Rail Link will connect you to the Skytrain for a fast ride into downtown.
When You Land…
After AM flights to Bangkok, start your day with a morning workout—Thai style. Muay Thai is a traditional style of boxing that uses almost every part of the body. If you arrive at midday, great! You’re just in time for a lunch of pad thai, curry or papaya salad. If city lights are all that illuminate your first hours in Bankok, bowl a few frames in a nightclub. A
nightclub!
Live Like a Local
Most
Bangkok holidays
include a visit to at least one temple, and our pick is the monumental Grand Palace. You’ll want to spend several hours at this one. If you’re looking for something a little off the beaten path, try a cycling tour. The locals know which streets are outside the main bustle of the city and have the best sites, so find someone to show you around!
Book with Wotif
Can’t wait to get started? Neither can we! Wotif has tons of cheap flights to Bangkok all in one place, so you save time
and
money. Enjoy your flight!
