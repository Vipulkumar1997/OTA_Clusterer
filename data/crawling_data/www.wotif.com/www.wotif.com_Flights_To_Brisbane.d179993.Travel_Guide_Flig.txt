Flights To Brisbane
We’ll be blunt: If you’re searching for a quaint town in the countryside with only a handful of people and some kangaroos running about, Brisbane isn’t for you.
But luckily for us, the excitement of a big city like Brisbane is exactly what you’re after. You want to holiday in a place where life moves pretty fast. According to the great philosopher Ferris Bueller, this is the sort of place where if you don’t stop and look around for a while, you might miss it.
Getting Around Brisbane
Flights to Brisbane will land at Brisbane Airport (BNE), 17km from the central business district. From there you can hop on the Airtrain or ride the shuttle bus to downtown. But if you feel like driving yourself around, book car hire and be on your way.
When You Land…
If you’re on one of the Brisbane flights landing in the morning, make your way to one of the breakfast cafes along William Street. A flat white latte with a bowl of brown rice porridge with hazelnuts is a perfect way to start the day.
Do you know what the afternoons are good for? Checking out the animals at the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, that’s what. If you’ve ever dreamed of making friends with these cuddly marsupials, this is the place for you. Can you imagine how many Instagram followers you’ll get when you post a selfie with a koala?
If you’re getting into town after dark, drop your luggage at your
Brisbane accommodation
and then hightail it to the Fortitude Valley area. This is where many of the city’s hippest clubs and live music venues are located. Jazz, hip-hop, punk rock, whatever makes your toes tap, you’ll find it here.
Live Like a Local
One way to fit in with the local population is to shop with them at the South Bank Markets, held every Sunday. You can find everything here from high-end fashion products to cheeky souvenirs and fresh produce.
When you’re ready to get the heck out of Dodge for a while, browse Wotif’s insanely great offers on cheap flights to Brisbane, book one and be on your way.
