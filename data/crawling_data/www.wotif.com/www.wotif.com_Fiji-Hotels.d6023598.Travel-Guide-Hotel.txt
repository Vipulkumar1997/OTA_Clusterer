Accommodation In Fiji
BULA! Welcome to Fiji. Fiji is an archipelago of more than 300 islands, with the majority being formed through volcanic activity over 150 million years ago. Today, Fiji is known as one of the top holiday destinations, with year-round tropical weather, pristine beaches and rich culture. Experience it for yourself with our Fiji accommodation.












Our
Viti Levu hotels
will let you experience Fiji’s largest island. The Nadi International Airport on the western corner of the island is where most international travellers touchdown. There are attractions all over Viti Levu, such as the Fiji Museum, home to artefacts, shipwreck relics and the Garden of the Sleeping Giant. The garden, which once belonged to Canadian actor Raymond Burr, is full of colourful flowers native to Fiji. When you’re done with the museum and the garden,  visit the Municipal Handicraft Centre, where you can watch locals straw weaving and wood carving. Pick up a few souvenirs before heading off to the Suva Municipal Market for some fresh fruit and vegetables.
Viti Levu also holds the majority of the country’s major events. The Fijian International Jazz and Blues Festival, held in May, attracts local acts as well as performers from Australia, New Zealand, the USA and the UK. A more traditional event is the Bula Festival, a fundraising event that takes place in July. Here you can enjoy live entertainment, a Pacific dancing contest and even a beauty pageant. Seafood lovers will want to be in Fiji between October and November for the Rising of Balolo, an extraordinary event that sees Balolo sea worms rising to the surface of the water. Watch as the locals wander out to sea to scoop the worms up by the thousands, fresh and ready for eating. If you’re not on Viti Levu when this occurs, don’t worry – it takes place all around the islands.
If you’d rather go somewhere remote, our
Kadavu accommodation
will be perfect. With its lush jungles and mangrove forests, Kadavu is a wonderful place for wildlife-watching. While you’re here, look out for the rare Kadavu musk parrot.
Tavenui
is another place to see Fiji’s tropical flora and fauna. Take a hike or 4WD tour up Des Veaux Peak, Fiji’s 2nd highest mountain, and visit the home of Fiji’s national flower, the beautiful red and white tagimocia.
Vanua Levu
is another popular destination with activities such as hiking through the Waisali Rainforest Reserve, swimming with the dolphins.
No matter what your budget, we’ve got a wide range of Fiji accommodation and
flights
to suit you. Check out what Wotif.com has below!
