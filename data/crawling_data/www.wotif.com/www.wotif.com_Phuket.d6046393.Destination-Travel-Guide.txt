Phuket Holiday Packages

Pronounced “pu-ket” and not the way you’d probably like to say it, this island province sits off the west coast of Thailand in the Andaman Sea and is about as picturesque a place as you can think of. There’s kilometres upon kilometres of white sand beaches lined with lush tropical forests and beachfront towns where all-night parties continue well into the next day.
Sounds freaking awesome, doesn’t it? We think so, and can’t imagine why you wouldn’t either. Browse Wotif’s incredible list of Phuket holiday packages and book yours the second you’re done reading this.

Fun in Phuket
If we had unlimited time, then we might be able to let you know about every fun thing there is to do in this part of Thailand. But time is of the essence, so we’re just going to lay out a few of the things we think are must-dos that will make your Phuket holiday
that
much better. Snorkelling, surfing, fishing, jungle hikes and full moon parties. Anything else?
Phi Phi Islands
– If you thought the beach scenes from the DiCaprio movie
The Beach
were filmed on some Hollywood soundstage, you’re wrong. They were filmed on the sand of these almost too-good-to-be-true islands just off the Phuket coast. You want to go snorkelling? The crystal clear water here makes for perfect conditions. You want to paddle a longtail boat? Not a problem. What about doing nothing on a beach? Take your pick from any number of popular or secluded stretches of sand to bronze on.
AC’s Phuket Fishing Park
– Have you ever wanted to catch a fish that’s roughly the size of a motor bike? Just sign up for a day of freshwater fishing at AC’s and you’ll have the biggest arapaima you’ve ever seen on the end of your line in no time.
Siam Safari Nature Tours
– Riding atop a massive elephant is crazy. It’s not feasible. There’s no way you can do that! Just kidding—of course you can do that. Book one of our
Phuket car hire
deals and make your way to this remarkable experience deep in the jungle. You’ll come face-to-face with these magnificent beasts and will even be able to climb atop one for a trek through the jungle.
Patong
– The largest beach town on Phuket is also home to some of the wildest shows on earth. Catch a show at Simon Cabaret and then do your best to process what in the world you just witnessed.
Fasten your seatbelt, browse Wotif’s ridiculous offers on Phuket packages, and book one now. You should’ve booked one a long time ago, but that’s neither here nor there. Send us a postcard.




Guide to Exploring Phuket


Big Buddha
This huge statue appears to keep a watchful eye on Phuket from its vantage point at the top of the Nakkerd Hills.
See hotels near here
Kamala Beach
Slow down the pace at this hidden gem that’s perfect for families and as an antidote to its party-loving neighbours.
See hotels near here
Ao Phang Nga National Park
These islands are a sight to behold with their vertical cliffs that appear to emerge dramatically from the surrounding pristine waters.
See hotels near here
Promthep Cape
Phuket’s southernmost point attracts hundreds of visitors that flock here each evening to watch a spectacular sunset.
See hotels near here
Nai Harn Beach
This sleepy village still remains largely underdeveloped and retains its natural charm, making it a hit with expats and locals.
See hotels near here
Laem Singh Beach
This tiny, secluded bay is no longer a well-kept secret, but it’s still an idyllic spot away from the busier parts of town.
See hotels near here
Ko Phi Phi Holiday Packages
Look, up in the sky! It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Superman! Nope, it’s not Superman.
See hotels near here
Phuket Fantasea
Experience Thai theater, enjoy a buffet dinner and see a colorful show featuring a magical elephant at this cultural theme park.
See hotels near here
Patong Holiday Packages
Patong is the epicentre of fun on Phuket, an island off the coast of Thailand. Thanks to the town's wide open beaches, inviting resorts, tempting restaurants and exciting nightlife, you'll enter full holiday mode on your trip to Patong.
See hotels near here
Holidays To Ko Yao Noi
With party island Phuket to the west and the popular beaches of Krabi province to the east, you might be surprised to find the island of Ko Yao Noi hidden in plain sight in Thailand’s Phang Nga Bay.
See hotels near here
Holildays To Panwa Beach
When you want to get away—really get away—we have just the place for you.
See hotels near here
Holidays To Kalim
Surf’s up, mate! On the easy-going island of Phuket, the cosy neighbourhood around Kalim Beach is a haven for wave-charging champs.
See hotels near here
Cape Panwa Holiday Packages
Located in Wichit, Thailand, Cape Panwa is an ideal tropical holiday destination. The coastlines are packed with sandy beaches, separated only by rocky capes and luxurious hotels. Sound tantalising already? Just wait, there’s more. Cape Panwa has an abundance of beautiful, historic Buddhist temples, including the famous Wat Chalong. A holiday in Cape Panwa is a satisfying blend of outdoor relaxation and indoor pampering for any type of traveller, so stop fantasising and start packing!

Karon Beach Holiday Packages
If you're headed to Thailand, you’ve probably got its legendary beaches on your mind—and who wouldn’t? Phuket's warm and meandering Karon Beach offers friendly, affordable resorts, a relaxed vibe and plenty to do for all age groups, making it the perfect getaway. Whether you’re travelling with your entire pack or are a lone wolf looking for a hideout, check out Wotif’s Karon Beach holiday packages and kick off the holiday of a lifetime.
See hotels near here
Surin Holiday Packages
Surin Beach is best known as a secluded destination for world-weary celebrities, but you don't have to be famous to want to trade the daily grind for a stretch of white sand, turquoise water and small-village tranquillity. You don’t necessarily have to travel incognito to get here—though a pair of oversized sunglasses never hurt anybody—but you'll still feel like you're on a private retreat with a holiday to Surin Beach.

Holidays To Nai Yang Beach
You know you want to book a
package deal to Phuket
, but
where
? Take a hint from the locals and check out Nai Yang Beach holiday packages.
See hotels near here
Kata Beach Holiday Packages
Cut out from the crowd and head over to Kata Beach, a charming spread in the beautiful coastal city of Phuket. Kata Beach holiday packages are perfect for just about everyone. Seriously—romantic honeymoons, family retreats or solo travel adventures are all a little bit better in this balmy tropical wonderland. During the high season (mid-October through late February), Kata Beach is at its best: you can take a swim in the warm water, sink your toes into the sand or just crack open a beer and engage in some high-quality people-watching. But if you're into surfing, come during the low season, when the water is rough and Kata Beach plays host to multiple surfing competitions.
See hotels near here
Holidays To Mai Khao
You’ve probably heard stories about the easygoing island of Phuket, Thailand. Rest assured, rumours of crystal clear waters, friendly locals and unbeatable nightlife are all true.
See hotels near here
Holidays To Chalong
Beautiful sunsets, ancient temples and enough activities to keep you going from sunrise to…well, another sunrise are just a few of the draws of the Thai island of Phuket.
