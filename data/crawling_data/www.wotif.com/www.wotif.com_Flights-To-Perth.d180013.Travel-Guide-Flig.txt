Flights To Perth
The most isolated capital city in the world, Perth takes advantage of the flat coastal plain and the Swan River. Amid the dusty red outback of the rest of Western Australia, Perth is full of greenery and life. She’s like an independent oasis of awesome, just waiting to sweep travellers like you off their feet. Or, at least, sweep the dust off your feet.
Quiet and laid-back when compared to other big Australian cities, Perth is home to uncrowded beaches, beautiful weather and an informal atmosphere.
That’s not to say this city isn’t sophisticated. You can find plenty of museums, classy nightlife and international inhabitants—right beside gold rush roots and lots of park land. So bring a pair of jeans—and that fancy outfit—so you can enjoy everything this city has to offer.
Getting Around Perth
Perth flights landing at Perth Airport (PER) have access to plenty of taxis and shuttle buses from any terminal. There are also Transperth buses and a free CAT bus that will take you from the city centre to the suburbs. Then there’s the train. But our favourite is the Transperth ferry across Swan River. Not only is it beautiful (like a swan), but you’ll float gracefully on the river…also like a swan.
When You Land…
Are you on one of the flights to Perth that land in the morning? Have your morning cuppa in the famous cappuccino strip in Fremantle. Touching down in the afternoon? Check out the local independent stores in Northbridge and take some local treasures back with you.
Landing at night? Rock the evening away in Perth’s famous indie music scene. You’ll have music notes dancing in your head when you lay it down at one of our
Perth hotels
.
Live Like a Local
Mad for footy? You’ll fit right in with the local fans! A couple of local teams—the West Coast Eagles and the Fremantle Dockers—play at Subiaco Oval. If you’re lucky enough to score tickets to a game where the two teams face off, you’ll get to pick a side and cheer with the whole city.
Here’s something else to cheer about: You can get cheap flights to Perth right here on Wotif. With our easy booking system, you’ll have the tickets you need before you can say “Subiaco”.
