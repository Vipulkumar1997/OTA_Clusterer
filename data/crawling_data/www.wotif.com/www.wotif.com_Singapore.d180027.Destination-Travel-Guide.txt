Singapore Packages

A holiday to Singapore will immerse you in a multicultural melting pot of all things Eastern, where the scent of mouth-watering food wafts down almost every street, and the shopping is second to none. Discover an island where glistening modernity meets ancient cultures, and big-city excitement happily coexists with tranquil gardens and laid-back beach resorts.

Things to Do in Singapore

There's much to see and do in the vibrant metropolis when you reserve one of our exciting Singapore packages, so go armed with a carefully crafted itinerary. On arrival, it's hard to get past the beauty of the city's modern skyline, but start with the basics. Begin your trip with an easy walk across Marina Bay to Marina Bay Sands, then look back for the best CBD views and "guess where I am" photo moments. Are you a lover of nature? You’re in luck. Behind the dazzle of its legendary shopping and dining, Singapore houses some of the world's best-designed gardens. A legacy of the city's forward-thinking founder, Lee Kuan Yew, they are easy to reach and offer peaceful retreats from the city bustle. Two of the best are Singapore Botanic Gardens and Gardens by the Bay. If you wish to venture outside the city, the beach resort of Sentosa Island is an easy drive away. If you fancy exploring, equip yourself with an affordable
Singapore car rental
.

Shopping, Dining & Nightlife

Singaporeans love to shop, and you will quickly discover why. Massive shopping centres of gleaming glass and chrome demand exploration. You can discover some of the best around Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands and Jurong. Alternatively, delve into the boutiques and flea markets of Chinatown for hard-to-find labels and local hipster creations.

Feeling hungry after all that shopping? Singapore is perhaps the greatest food destination on the planet, rich with Chinese, Indian, Malaysian and Indonesian influences. What's more, its signature dishes are easy to find in affordable hawkers markets, coffee shops, food halls and street-side vendors. No holiday is complete without delighting your taste buds with Hainanese chicken rice, satay meat skewers with peanut sauce or chilli crab.

Singapore is a big, exciting city with a vibrant nightlife to rival any in the world, and many bars kick-start proceedings early with happy hour promotions. Unwind at sunset with a Singapore Sling in one of many rooftop bars, drinking in the views as the sky darkens and the city's lights flicker to life. The cocktails and service may tempt you to settle in for the night, but make the effort to venue-hop and your reward will be loud karaoke, great live music from local bands and thumping nightclubs that keep the party going all night.

What's Next?

If you're the designated travel arranger, Wotif makes it simple to find the best Singapore package deals. Whether it's a relaxing resort holiday on the beaches of Sentosa or a shopping splurge in Jurong, we can craft an affordable getaway that's just right for you. Browse

The Boss was a good Hotel but for the breakfast
The issue that I have it that the breakfast in the restaurant of the fourth floor was inedible. I ended up going to the hawker centers close by and got excellent food for a fraction of the cost. I feel that the hotel was trying to provide a western style breakfast but did not get it right. For the ...

Loved Singapore and will return. One Farrer Hotel & Spa (OFHS) was well located and fairly central to most things.
