Accommodation In Sydney
In Sydney, you’re never far from a gorgeous beach and relaxed surfer vibes. Then again, you’re also never far from adorable boutiques, delicious street food or five-star shopping and dining. You could say this town has something for everyone, but we’re sure that’s been said before. From the perfect surf breaks (and beach bods) in Manly Beach to the elegant theatre district, get ready to embrace the sweet Sydneysider way of life.












Hold on to your armrest—the view coming into Sydney over the harbour will blow you away. After drooling over your bird’s-eye view of the city skyline, you’ll be pretty psyched for what
Sydney holidays
have in store. We’re not kidding when we say this city is chockablock with iconic attractions.
Perhaps you’ve heard of the Sydney Opera House or Harbour Bridge? They’re only some of the most famous landmarks ever. Get your fill of the tanned and beautiful at the famous Manly Beach, and get your history and your shopping done in one place on historic George Street. History, you say? Indeed. This city is full of it. Yes, accommodation in Sydney is just the start of an epic getaway.
Wacky Wonders
Take a walk up George Street to see all that history in action—it’s the oldest street in all of Australia. Enjoy a cuppa tea like King George himself, or channel the rather more rough-and-tumble beginnings of the city with a pub tour. Just remember, those hooligans paved the way for modern amazing feats the likes of which the world would never have seen.
If you thought koalas were the only thing that’s cuddly here, think again. TV host Carrie Bickmore held the world record for “most hugs given in one minute” from 2014 to 2016.
Sydney is more than beaches, partying and food, too. Sydneysiders love fitness, as evidenced by their world record for “largest spin class”—270 people! Hey, that beach body isn’t going to sculpt itself.
Still doubting Sydney’s athleticism? Anthony Kelly caught a tennis ball flying at 192.9km/h in 2015.
If you’re more into brains than brawn, check out
Melbourne accommodation
and see the city that holds the record for fastest time to solve a Rubik’s Cube in competition.
We’re not saying you’ve gotta be a pro athlete to enjoy Sydney accommodation, though. There are plenty of records that have nothing to do with feats of strength and agility.
Enjoy the deepest natural harbour in the world from the ferry, which has some history, too. It traces its roots back to 1789!
Get your heart racing at BridgeClimb Sydney, where you’ll ascend 134m to the top of the world’s tallest steel arch bridge.
Too many highs and lows for you? Stay level at the Royal Botanic Gardens, the oldest in Australia. Check out the orchids in the glasshouse and the “living fossil” that is the Wollemi pine.
It’s time to create some records of your own. A personal best for most food eaten in one sitting, perhaps? Or most fun ever had on a holiday? Or maybe, just maybe, most awesome selfie on the planet. Actually, we’re willing to bet you can achieve all three.
Places to Stay in Sydney
If all that history sounds bloody great, consider a room at
InterContinental Sydney
, just steps from Circular Quay. Valet park that car, because you can walk to anything around here—and then sign up for a foot massage at the spa, too. Need space? The 245-sq. m. Australia Suite is one of the biggest you’ll find at hotels in Sydney.
Once you’re settled, visit the historic Customs House, stop by the Museum of Sydney or sign up for a ghost tour. But it isn’t only ghostly spirits you’ll find here—partake in a different sort of spirits at Sydney’s oldest pub, Fortune of War.
Drinking with a little bit of history involved makes you feel pretty smart, huh? Well, don’t stop there. The Lord Nelson lays claim to being Sydney’s oldest brewery, while the Hero of Waterloo isn’t the oldest anything but still has a “haunting” past. Listen for the ghost of Anne Kirkman’s piano playing skills or search for the secret tunnel that runs to the harbour—allegedly.
Amora Hotel Jamison Sydney
is in this neighbourhood too, but unfortunately there’s no tunnel back to your room. There is, however, free Wi-Fi, 24-hour room service and blackout drapes, all of which may come in handy once you get back.
Of course, visiting the “Harbour City” without actually experiencing the harbour is like going to Rome without seeing the Colosseum or visiting Coffs Harbour without taking a snap at the Big Banana. Sydney hotels near Circular Quay also make it easy to take a ferry ride to Manly Beach and check harbour views and one of Australia’s most famous beaches off your list.
Got more cultured pursuits in mind? You’ll find your match at
Pier One Sydney Harbour, Autograph Collection
. Choose city or water views at this five-star hotel and pick your perfect pillow from the pillow menu. If you want to lounge in your plush bed all morning or treat yourself to some “spa”-tacular massages, we don’t blame you. This is a neighbourhood that gets going later in the day, anyway.
Once you manage to get yourself out of that suuuuper comfy bed, enjoy a lunch with harbour views at The Gantry, the hotel’s on-site restaurant. Don’t worry, you’ll work it off with a climb to the top of Pylon Lookout and a relaxing stroll across the Sydney Harbour Bridge. On weekends, check out Kirribilli Market on the north side of the bridge, where much like the city itself, you’ll find pretty much anything if you look hard enough.
All right, it’s time for that culture we mentioned. Start your evening with cocktails and small plates at Theatre Bar at the End of the Wharf—book the balcony ahead of time if you really want to go all out. Suggested theatre topics of discussion: Did
Hamilton
really deserve all those Tonys? What’s previous Australian winner Barry Humphries doing these days? How do you pronounce “denouement” anyway?
You’re probably feeling pretty classy, but don’t forget to go to the actual show: Sydney Theatre Company puts on some bangers. Retire to your room with visions of curtain calls dancing in your head.
You’ll definitely feel fancy when you’ve got one of the best hotels around in the books. Wotif makes it easy to find awesome Sydney hotel deals, so you can start channelling that inner laid-back local. Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman did grow up here, so you really can’t go wrong. Relax—just pack your walking shoes, a pair of sunnies and be sure to leave room for adventure. Sydney will take care of the rest.
