Fiji Packages

With its fish-filled reefs, deserted beaches and cloudless skies, Fiji is the epitome of a tropical getaway. Look past the white sand and you will find lovely provincial towns, pristine rainforests and national parks all waiting to be explored. Luxury lovers will adore the sumptuous spa-resorts dotting the Viti Levu coastline. Cosier accommodation is also available for budget-conscious travellers looking for Fiji holiday deals.

Things to See and Do

There's no better way to discover the hundreds of islands on your Fiji holidays than by sailing past them on a traditional boat called a drua. Group island tours often include snorkelling trips and a fresh BBQ lunch, while a private boat hire will often come with a personal chef and more deck space. Ask the captain to make a stop at Monuriki Island, the location used for the film
Cast Away
, where you can make your own Wilson. When you get back on the dry land of Fiji's largest island, Veti Levu, take a trip to the artefact-filled Fiji Museum and learn about the country's rich history and evolution. Afterwards, head to the Thurston Gardens for a tranquil sunset walk through native flora and fauna. Air-conditioned public buses are available on the main islands of Viti Levi and Vanua Levu, but by far the best way to see the sites is with your own car, so remember to book one of the
car hire options on Fiji
with Wotif before you leave.

Shopping, Dining & Nightlife

Traditional handicrafts, such as carved buburau dishes, neon woven rugs and tapa prints are for sale at the Handicraft Market in Suva, Viti Levu. If you're seeking electronics and brand-name goods, then Fiji's largest mall, Port Denarau Shopping Center, near Nadi Airport, should deliver. From curbside stalls to Michelin-starred restaurants, Fiji's dining options will suit the palate of any traveller. Much like the country’s indigenous history, the cuisine here is varied, with Chinese, Indian, European and neighbouring South Pacific influences. Stuck for what to sample first? For starters try kokoda, which is a Fijian-style ceviche made from lime-marinated raw mahi-mahi, then follow it with a creamy taro curry and wash it all down with a frosty Fiji Gold beer.

The nightclub and bar-filled streets of Martintar on Vitu Levi are where most people head after dinner to party. Some of the larger clubs have beachfront dance floors, where fire dancers work their magic and DJs spin the decks underneath the island’s starry skies. Resorts on more remote islands will often host a range of evening entertainment, including live bands and traditional dance ceremonies known as meke, which may come included in your Fiji packages.

What's Next?

Set your watch to island time. At Wotif, we’ll bundle together flights and accommodation to score you the best Fiji deals around, plus we have special packages for Vitu Levu, as well as
Denarau Island holidays
. Whether you're flying solo, with the family or planning a romantic getaway for two, check out our affordable Fiji holiday packages today and you can book your South Pacific adventure in just a few clicks.
