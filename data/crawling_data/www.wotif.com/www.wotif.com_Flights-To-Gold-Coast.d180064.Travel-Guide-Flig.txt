Flights To Gold Coast
Where does a place like Gold Coast get its name? Is it from the bright yellow sands along its 110km of shoreline? Perhaps it’s because gold is one of Australia’s national colours, or because of the area’s wealthy, jewel-brandishing residents.
Or could it be all the treasure that’s been discovered from nearby shipwrecks?
We
think it’s because a trip where you can lounge on your choice of 30 beaches, surf the waves and have access to the Hinterlands is worth its weight in gold, but let’s see if we can help you spend less than that on flights to Gold Coast, huh?
Getting Around Gold Coast
From the Gold Coast Airport (OOL), jump on bus 760 or lucky number 777. There’s also the Gold Coast Light Rail, which is probably the easiest way to get around. If you rent one of Wotif’s car hire options, you won’t have to worry much about traffic like in Brisbane or other large cities.
When You Land…
Are you on Gold Coast flights that land in the morning? Check out the koalas, kangaroos and crocodiles at Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary. If you land in the afternoon, head to Cavill Mall for the best souvenir T-shirt shops to take home something both memorable and wearable.
Arriving in the evening? Grab some fresh fish and chips at the marina. If your
Gold Coast accommodation
is nearby, you can sleep with the fishes--but, you know, in a
good
way.
Live Like a Local
Want a little local flavour? Munch on some
muddies
, or mud crabs, with shells the size of your head! Then catch the Titans or the Suns in a rugby or football game.
Want to visit Gold Coast without having to
shell
out a bunch of cash? Then book Wotif’s cheap flights to Gold Coast. We’ve fished all the best deals out of the web and laid them out just for you. Now if we just had some chips to go with them, huh?
