Sydney Holiday Packages

Australia may be known the world over as The Land Down Under, but the island nation’s lively cities and stunning landscapes stay at the very top of our must-travel lists. Sydney getaways are always a smashing idea, with glittering harbours, famous cultural venues, and food and fun around every corner.
Whether you’re kicking off an urban walkabout to find yourself among the shops and cafes at The Rocks or bringing the family along for a brilliant beach holiday, book one of our
Sydney holiday packages
and get ready to soak up the sun and fill up on international eats.

Must-See Sydney
You could plan several Sydney holidays to hit all the fab attractions, activities and arts venues across The Harbour City. When you see the Sydney Opera House arching over the water like a sailing ship, you’ll know you’re in the right place—and yes, you’ll definitely impress your friends when you come home humming the music from a classic performance.
Prefer shopping to Chopin? You can leave your bushwalking shoes at home when you wander through The Rocks—located just west of Circular Quay—in search of artisan market souvenirs, gourmet meals and even the meaning of life. Just kidding.
When you’re ready to take this Sydney vacation out to the sand and sea, load up the boot with towels, boogie boards and sun cream, and drive a vehicle from one of our
Sydney car hire
options out to the beach. Which beach, you ask? Well, Bondi is a favourite among locals and travellers alike and Coogee Beach, to the south, is a bit more rustic. If you can’t decide, then amble along the gorgeous Bondi to Coogee Beach Walk for swimming and surfing on each end of sweet scenery!
Family Holidays to Sydney
If you’re bringing young swimmers along for the trip, then the gentle tides of Coogee Beach are a double win! Soak up the sun and splash around with the kids, then air dry while you look for Flipper’s mates at nearby Dolphins Point. When you and the crew can’t wait to be on a boat, take a ferry ride from Manly or Circular Quay—it’s the next best way to see the harbour, after sailing your own tallship.
Do you need to meet a koala? Who doesn’t? Take your darlings to Darling Harbour for a day at Wild Life Sydney Zoo. You’ll make friends with koalas, wallabies and plenty of other indigenous creatures all in one place, all while learning how to protect Australia’s natural habitats. We heart that!
Chow Down like a Sydneysider
Sydneysiders come from many backgrounds and cultures, and as a result the city is bursting with unique flavours and fusions, as well as heaps of culinary innovation. Saving up for an all-out foodie tour is just one more reason to score sweet—or savoury—Sydney travel deals. If you’re craving Vietnamese cuisine, you’re in luck! The city is full of fab pho and baller bahn mi, in addition to stellar seafood and new Australian recipes like the iconic Snow Egg, a delicate dessert masterminded by Peter Gilmore at Quay.
For waterfront cafes and quirky coffee and juice bars for your pre and post-surf snacks, Bondi Beach is the place to be. Surf’s up, bottoms up! If you think spice is nice, let your love of authentic eats lead you through Chinatown’s noodle stalls in Haymarket. If we had you at “fab pho”, get thee to the suburb of Cabramatta. Oh, and if you can’t decide whether you love beer or brunch more, spend your mornings and evenings in Surry Hills. Yeah, you’re welcome.
See You in Sydney
Whether your mouth is already watering or you’re too busy packing your bathers to notice, it’s time to escape on a great getaway. Save on your travel needs when you book Sydney flights and accommodation packages with Wotif. And if one coast is never enough, remember us when it’s time to steal away to Victoria with one of our awesome
Melbourne holiday packages
. Let’s take Australia by storm!
