Holidays To Australia

When it comes to kilometres of beaches, natural wonders, friendly locals and cute koalas, it's all good in Australia, mate.

Explore sunny beaches, sample fine regional wines and shop until you drop in some of the nation’s largest cities. Whether you're new to the country or a seasoned Aussie, Australia holidays hold adventure for everyone.
Things to do in Australia
First things first: Australia is big, so if you don't have a chunk of time to explore it properly, just pick one area. Booking one of Wotif’s
Australia car hire
deals is ideal if you fancy a road trip, or you can fly between most of the major cities in a couple of hours.
A classic Australia holiday begins with the beach; the pristine stretches of coastline in Queensland will fit the bill quite nicely. The Sunshine Coast, less than a two-hour drive from Brisbane, is home to about 100 kilometres of cream-coloured sand and blue waves. Farther north are the Whitsunday Islands, the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and excellent scuba diving.
If you're looking for more of a fast-paced vibe, head south to cosmopolitan Melbourne and soak up the country's most sophisticated and culturally diverse city. On the west coast, start in Perth and drive to the wineries, caves and beaches until you reach the scenic Margaret River region.
Shopping, Dining & Nightlife
Unless you're on a dusty road in the Outback, you won't have a shortage of shopping options across the country. Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and the Gold Coast are home to high-end couture stores, as well as smaller boutiques and independent art galleries. Large shopping centres are in virtually every city, and you'll also find a series of charming, unique stores in smaller touristy towns. Want to make sure you've got enough spending money? Our Australia holiday packages maximise savings by bundling flights and accommodation, so you've got plenty of cash left for some retail therapy.
You'll need to stop and refuel after all that shopping. Explore the burgeoning gastropub scene in Brisbane, or get lost in the trendy coffee shops in Melbourne's famous laneways. Even international chefs like Jamie Oliver have opened restaurants in Australia, proof that Aussies are a discerning bunch when it comes to grub. If you want something really simple, fish and chips on the beach is hard to beat—made even better because the seafood is likely to have been caught fresh locally!
Nightlife in Australia varies depending on where you are. In the major cities, anything goes: large dance clubs, boutique brew pubs, or seasonal pop-up events and markets. Even smaller cities and towns quite rightfully boast their own thriving (albeit smaller) nightlife scene.
What's Next?
Wotif will get your trip off to a good start—we’ve got heaps of Australia packages to choose from. Hotels, resorts and flights are available to suit all budgets, so you can find a holiday that suits you. Check out our Australia deals and get ready to kick off your next adventure. And hey, if you’ve got more annual leave to spare, look into our
Fiji holiday packages
. The beach bum life is calling you!




Guide to Exploring Australia


Sydney Holiday Packages
Australia may be known the world over as The Land Down Under, but the island nation’s lively cities and stunning landscapes stay at the very top of our must-travel lists. Sydney getaways are always a smashing idea, with glittering harbours, famous cultural venues, and food and fun around every corner.
Whether you’re kicking off an urban walkabout to find yourself among the shops and cafes at The Rocks or bringing the family along for a brilliant beach holiday, book one of our
Sydney holiday packages
and get ready to soak up the sun and fill up on international eats.

Melbourne Holiday Packages
You may think Bruce Wayne was the original Batman, but before he enlisted Lucius Fox to build him a bad-arse weapons cache, there was John Batman, founder of Melbourne (awesomely, the city was almost named “Batmania”). And yes, there are actual bats here as well, along with loads of other cool stuff.
With world-famous markets and underground scenes that will make you wish you lived here, holidays to Melbourne are always worth the trip—or several trips! Whether you’re here for a weekend or plan on sticking around for a while, you’ll never run out of things to see and do in this vibrant metropolis.

Holidays to the Gold Coast
Surfers flock to the Gold Coast like moths to a flame, but even if hanging 10 isn’t your thing, you can still have the time of your life in this Queensland destination.
See hotels near here
Brisbane Holiday Packages
Brisbane is a record-breaking kind of place, although you might never guess from its laid-back attitude. It’s the home of the first man to fly across the Pacific, Australia’s largest town hall, and its first dedicated entertainment district.
Yes, this city has pioneered many important things (hey, nightlife is just as important as the technology to fly across the sky at breakneck speeds). And when it comes to package holidays in Brisbane, well, they’ve aced that test, too. You’ll soon see for yourself, because irresistible Brisbane is in your future.
See hotels near here
Perth Holiday Packages
The rugged coast of Western Australia looks more like the landscape of the Martian surface with an ocean added to it than a holiday destination. But scattered across this rugged land are diamonds in the rough, and the city of Perth in particular shines brighter than most.
With its beautiful white sand beaches, happening downtown district, and proximity to the epic vineyards of the Swan Valley, this place is perfect for your next R&R destination. Browse Wotif’s fine deals on Perth holiday packages and book yours today.

Holidays To Adelaide
There’s a reason South Australia’s capital is known as “the 20-minute city”: just a short drive will take you from the centre of it to the beach or the hills (and their wine region).
See hotels near here
Holidays To Canberra
Looking for a capital holiday? Canberra is the home of Australia’s Parliament, and if you’re interested in politics, you can’t miss a visit to Parliament House.
See hotels near here
Holiday To Hobart
As the capital of Tasmania, the city of Hobart has become a low-key and luxurious destination. Not too long ago, though, this harbour city was a scrappy maritime haunt where early discovery expeditions first took shape.
See hotels near here
Holidays to the Sunshine Coast
With its golden sun-drenched beaches, breezy seaside towns, rugged mountain hikes and unique markets, the Sunshine Coast is hard to beat.
See hotels near here
Holidays To Port Douglas
You may know it as the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef and the Daintree Rainforest, but Port Douglas is worth a visit in its own right too!
See hotels near here
Holidays To Darwin
Australia's tropical capital is a bustling mix of frontier town and modern city.
See hotels near here
Holiday To Hunter Valley
Sometimes you just need to sip a glass of fine wine in a gorgeous rolling landscape and let your daily concerns slip away. And sometimes you need an entire holiday dedicated to doing just that.
See hotels near here
Holidays To Byron Bay
Travellers of all types flock to Byron Bay, a free-spirited beach town where surf and hippie culture meet.
See hotels near here
Holiday To Blue Mountains
When life gives you mountains, climb them! Leave the workaday life behind for fresh air, peaceful vistas and some good old-fashioned exercise on a beautiful Blue Mountains holiday.
See hotels near here
Holiday To Newcastle
Searching for a brilliant getaway? Pack your bathers and escape on a Newcastle holiday. Located on the coast of New South Wales, Newcastle is lined with sunny beaches.
See hotels near here
Holiday To Central Coast
You have pretty high standards for your getaway, and you should! If you want to be surrounded by gorgeous state forests and plenty of golden beaches, we have a place in mind.
See hotels near here
Broome Holiday Packages
Slip into laid-back 'Broome time' and discover one of Australia's most unique towns. A Broome holiday brings camels, surf, and Indian Ocean sunsets, among other natural wonders. The red pindan cliffs, ancient dinosaur prints and glamorous Cable Beach all serve as the gateway to the Kimberley outback. Broome holiday packages help you explore while saving time and money, so start planning your trip today!
See hotels near here
Holiday To Mornington Peninsula
Wake up on the right side of the bed every day when you take a Mornington Peninsula holiday. Of course you’ll be soothed to sleep by the waves in Port Phillip, but that’s not all.
See hotels near here
Surfers Paradise Holiday Packages
For beach-lovers, getaways to the capital of the Gold Coast are worth their weight in, well, gold. As one of the best places to hang ten in Australia, Surfers Paradise really earns its name. This place is incredibly laid-back, so don’t let any of those high-rises sparkling in the sun fool you. With 52km of golden beaches and just 300 sunny days to enjoy them each year, there simply isn’t time to waste rushing around. So stroll through shops, restaurants, bars and clubs. Take a dip in the ocean. Get baked (by the sun, that is) on the sand. Whatever’s clever.
See hotels near here
Holidays To Cairns
A coastal Queensland city with a tropical climate, Cairns is a great place to get away from it all.
See hotels near here
Broadbeach Holiday Packages
What do celebrities, families and solo surfers seeking gnarly waves all have in common? Well, they all love Broadbeach, for starters. It’s the perfect spot for a Gold Coast getaway—just south of all the attractions of Surfers Paradise, and home to some of the best shopping and dining in the area. Just ask Kylie Minogue.
If you can’t get in touch with her, check out our guide below, then hurry up and book Broadbeach holiday packages!
See hotels near here
Noosa Heads Holiday Packages
Are you looking to get out of town for…how should we say it…forever? Well, maybe not forever, but for at least a week or two on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast? You should, because Wotif’s deals on Noosa Heads holiday packages are hotter than ever.
Haven’t you ever wanted to hang ten down a wall of water so clear you can see every fish? And haven’t you ever wanted to enjoy a picnic in Noosa National Park while cute koalas lounge in the trees above? What about going for an exhilarating hike in the Glasshouse Mountains? Whatever it is you’ve dreamt of doing along this stretch of coast is in your hands. We don’t care what you decide to do—we just want you to get off your arse and enjoy holidays to Noosa Heads.
See hotels near here
Holiday To Great Ocean Road
You’re always on the move, looking for the best wave breaks, stellar scenery and new favourite foods. So it goes without saying that your dream trip will keep you rolling.
