Accommodation In Singapore
Take a pick from our extensive range of Singapore accommodation, or one of our ideally placed
Singapore Airport hotels
, when staying in Singapore. Whether the purpose of your trip is business or pleasure, we have hotels to suit every budget. Obviously Singapore is world renowned, as an international business and shopping hotspot, but it has so much more to offer.












Situated at the southern most tip of the Malay Peninsula, Singapore may be small, but with a population of 4.4 million people, it is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. It was initially set up as a British trading town in 1819, but gained its official sovereignty in 1965, forcing the fledgling nation to become self sufficient. There are now 4 official languages in Singapore consisting of Mandarin, Tamil, Malay and English. Thankfully for western tourists, most public signs, and official publications are displayed in English.
For first time travellers Singapore seems shockingly modern, for what was once thought of as a sleepy Malay fishing village. Today there is no doubt, that it is truly considered the ‘gateway between East and West’. The main Singapore airport is the heavily trafficked Changi International Airport, which offers a network of 81 airlines, connecting Singapore to 179 cities, in 57 countries. There is absolutely no doubt, that Singapore’s transport system is world class. Singapore’s train system the MRT (Mass Transit System), is 109 kilometres long, consists of 64 stations, and services roughly 1.3 million people daily. If train is not your transport of choice, all
Singapore hotels
are easily accessible by the wide range of bus and taxi services.
When travelling to Singapore, you should make an effort to co-ordinate your visit, with one of the various festivals and events. Thaipusam is a spectacular Hindu festival occurring in February around the full moon, where devotees can spear their cheeks with long, shiny steel rods, or even partake in a fire walk. July sees the annual Singapore Food Festival, which is heavily promoted to tourists, to celebrate Singapore's divine cuisine.
And then of course there is Singapore’s shopping, most famously located on Orchard Road and Chinatown, which are second to none all year round. The Great Singapore sale occurs each year from May to July, where you’ll find fantastic value on everything from fashion, watches, jewellery, electronics and more. Our
Orchard Road hotels
and
Chinatown hotels
make the perfect rest points for those tourists, who want to experience all the shopping that Singapore has to offer. Why not choose to stay in a
Singapore Boutique Hotel
and experience a more personal touch with your accommodation.

Hotel Boss
3.0
The Boss was a good Hotel but for the breakfast
The issue that I have it that the breakfast in the restaurant of the fourth floor was inedible.  I ended up going to the hawker centers close by and got excellent food for a fraction of the cost.    I feel that the hotel was trying to provide a western style breakfast but did not get it right.    For the price and location the Boss is great.

PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road

Nice hotel
Location in little india and very close to reasonably priced street food. Is very close to 2 shopping centers.     Reception area was very crowded. Hotel should tell guests not to use smartphones in swimming pool area.
