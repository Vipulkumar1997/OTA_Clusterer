Booking Terms and Conditions

The following terms and conditions apply to all our services directly or indirectly (through distributors) made available online, by email or by telephone. By accessing, browsing and using our website and/or by completing a reservation, you acknowledge and agree to have read, understood and agreed to the terms and conditions set out below (including the privacy statement).

Our Services

1. Our service is free of charge; we will not charge you for our service or add any additional (reservation) fees to the room rate. HOWEVER, the accommodation provider with which you have a reservation may have change or cancellation fees that we are required to pass on.

2. By making a reservation through BestHotelOnline, you enter into a direct (legally binding) contractual relationship with the hotel at which you book. From the point at which you make your reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the hotel, transmitting the details of your reservation to the relevant hotel and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of the hotel.

3. Hotels require credit card details in order to guarantee your reservation. As such, we will send your credit card information directly to the hotel at which your booking is made and we may verify (i.e. pre-authorize) your credit card as well. In order to safeguard and encrypt your credit card information when in transit to us, we use the "Secure Socket Layer (SSL)" technology for our services. For certain rates or special offers, please note that your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged (sometimes without any option for refund) upon reservation and confirmation of the booking. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. Although all transactions made on www.BestHotelOnline.com are handled by  BestHotelOnline.com's Hong Kong office, the payment are processed in Paris, France. Credit card companies are incurring no or additional expenses for processing transactions made in a foreign currency outside Paris, France. BestHotelOnline.com is not liable for any claims or compensation if any dispute or claim arising from or related to foreign transaction fees.

4. By completing a booking, you agree to receive an invitation email to complete our guest review form which we will promptly send to you after your stay at the hotel. The completed guest review may be uploaded onto the relevant hotel’s information page on our website for the sole purpose of informing (future) customers of your opinion of the service (level) and quality of the hotel. We reserve the right to adjust, refuse or remove reviews at our sole discretion.

5. Our services are made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, products or services available on our website for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.

6. BestHotelOnline makes every effort to ensure that any materials or rates displayed on this website are accurate as at the date of issue. Changes in market conditions or circumstances may occur after the issue date which may make information displayed on this website no longer accurate or no longer reflect the current position.

7. While BestHotelOnline makes every effort to work with hotels which provide an acceptable standard of service and accommodation for the price paid, we disclaim any representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to the quality or adequacy of any hotel listed on our website.

8. This website may contain hyperlinks to websites operated by parties other than BestHotelOnline. Such hyperlinks are provided for your reference only. BestHotelOnline does not control such websites and is not responsible for their contents or your use of them.
