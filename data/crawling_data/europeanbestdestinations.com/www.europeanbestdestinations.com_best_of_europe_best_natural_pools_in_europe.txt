was not ranked in first position because it is partly

. It is 200 meters deep. Icelanders undertook drilling of volcanic rocks to extract
    extremely hot water to produce electricity for their cities; Reykjavik is one of them. The water of this lagoon comes out of the power plant at a temperature of 40 degrees.
The water is
    blue algae rich which gives it its incredible colour
and obviously its name.

as well as your
best activities
and tours in Iceland such as a Northern Lights tour, a whale watching trip or a Blue Lagoon transfer and admission from Reykjavik.
