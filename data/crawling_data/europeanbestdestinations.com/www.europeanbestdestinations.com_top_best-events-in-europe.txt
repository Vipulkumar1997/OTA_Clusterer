2. Oktoberfest

_____________





The
Oktoberfest
has its origins in the year 1810. However, it looked a bit different then, as the first Oktoberfest was a horse-race, held as a part of the wedding festivities of
    Bavarian King Ludwig I. and his wife Theresie.



The people liked that horse-race so much, that it became an annual event, which then developed into what we know as Oktoberfest today, as the focus shifted more and more away from the horse-race
    and towards fun rides and drinking beer.
