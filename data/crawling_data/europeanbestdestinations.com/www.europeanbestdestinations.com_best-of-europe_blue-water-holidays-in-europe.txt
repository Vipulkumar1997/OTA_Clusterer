Dalmatia



Croatia



Rare are the regions that can be as proud of so many natural varieties as Split -
Dalmatia County
can.



The mountain chain, including one of
Croatia's highest mountain
, separate Zagora with its continental characteristics from the
Mediterranean beach
atmosphere.
    This region is among the most beautiful in the world. Here you can find both shallow waters and the open sea, wild rapids and peaceful river beds, the most beautiful Mediterranean islands
    alongside rough cliffs with endemic species in the middle of the open sea, deep lakes and the still unexplored richness of the underground caves.

Dariusz Majgier










Algarve



Portugal



There’s no shortage of
high quality beaches
either. Sandy stretches as far as the eye can see, framed by golden cliffs, virtually deserted islands marking the boundary between
    Ria Formosa and the sea, and small coves sheltered by the rocks. The ocean, in every
shade of blue
and mostly calm and
warm
, invites you for long swims and to
    indulge in water sports.

@G. Tournebize










Sainte-Maxime



France



A haven of tranquility between sea and land, emotions, sensations, flavors, fragrances, discoveries, your holiday destination cultivates the art of receiving. Welcome in
Sainte-Maxime
, Provençal city lively all year and family destination. Sainte-Maxime ideally located in the
heart
    of the Gulf of
Saint-Tropez
, is a favorite destination of the
French Riviera
.



Its 11 km from the Mediterranean shore, its sandy beaches, fields of Posidonia are a natural environment that everyone should strive to preserve.




The constant commitment to environmental protection and rational development is rewarded since 1987 with the presentation of the famous European label "
European Blue Flag
".
    This label recognizes and guarantees the quality of bathing water and environmental performance.

Costa Brava



Spain



The
Costa Brava
is about sun, beaches, coves surrounded by nature, refreshing dips in
crystal-clear water
, peace and calm, strolls along coastal footpaths,
    charming fishing villages... How does all of that sound? Well get your diary out, find the next gap and get ready to spend a great day (or all the days you can manage) on the beach.

Kochneva Tetyana










Antalya



Turkey




Antalya
which can be visited any season, is an indispensable touristic destination particularly during the summer. This "blue" city enchants its guests with its beautiful beaches
    and has the longest coastline in
Turkey
.



The most striking feature of Antalya are the terrific palm trees of the city which cool you with their shade and accompany you with their breeze on your way. Common in Antalya and adorning the
    city, palm trees are a sign of the
mild Mediterranean climate
of the city. Hot and dry during the summer and mild and rainy during the winter the city always gives the feeling of
    a warm home.

Samot










Zakynthos



Greece




Zákynthos
is a verdant island endowed with fertile valleys and a temperate climate. Its landscape diversity has resulted in different types of beaches: there are
sandy beaches
in secluded coves where the tranquil waters are
deep blue
on the island’s southeastern part; yet, if rugged cliffs and an interesting underwater
    world are to your liking, try the western part of the island.

Gozo Island



Malta




Gozo
is known to provide a
tranquil haven
for a tempo and scene change. The charm of
Malta's sister Island
is immediately apparent; it's
    greener, more rural and smaller, with life's rhythms dictated by the seasons, fishing and agriculture.





Steeped in myth, Gozo is thought to be the legendary Calypso's isle of
Homer's Odyssey
- a peaceful, mystical backwater. Baroque churches
    and old stone farmhouses dot the countryside. Gozo's rugged landscape and
spectacular coastline
await exploration with some of the
Mediterranean's best dive
    sites
.

Mallorca



Spain




Crystal clear waters
, open to the winds from east to southeast highlight a sandy bottom
    great for scuba diving and small boats to anchor at a depth which ranges from three to four meters. A two nautical miles of the port of Cala Figuera Santanyí.

Brac Island



Croatia




The
Zlatni Rat
, often referred to as the Golden Cape
    or
Golden Horn
, is a spit of land located about 2 kilometres (1 mile) west from the harbour town of
Bol
on
    the southern coast of the Croatian island of
Brač
, in the region of
Dalmatia
.

Marcin Krzyzak










Marettimo



Sicily



The
Marettimo
coast is rocky, characterized by hundreds of caves and coves that open up to a
crystalline blue sea
. At the Rock of the Camel, on the eastern side
    of the island, there is a small beach harmoniously wedged within a cave.  The scenario that presents itself is almost magical.

Porquerolles



France



As the first sea resort of the
French Riviera
, Hyères offers enchanted and preserved beaches, a clean water and a guarantee of bright sun. Whether you seek shade, privacy or
    family-friendly spots, with over 40 kilometres of coastline, you will have
plenty of creeks
to choose from to go for a swim, build a sand castle or take an afternoon
    map.




Bordered by a beautiful but fragile pine forest, just as beautiful as other beaches of Porquerolles, the beach
Notre Dame
is however much less crowded. The ongoing revegetation
    program requires that everyone take care of the environment.

Sardinia



Italy



A voyage over an
emerald sea
, past characteristic coves and
beaches
of snowwhite sand … this is
Sardinia
, an island that strikes its visitors
    with natural contrasts, the lights and colors of a region that boasts old traditions and a wild and pure nature.

Kephalonia



Greece




The magnificent sights, amazing beaches, rich cultural heritage, great monuments, mountains, castles, remote monasteries and cheerful, hospitable people are the treasures making
Kefalonia
one of the
most attractive destinations
.

Menorca



Spain




Menorca
, in the Balearic Islands, is a peaceful, unique
natural oasis
, packed with contrasts to discover. It is a real
paradise
, washed by the
    Mediterranean Sea, that will seduce you with its harmony and diversity.






The island has 216 kilometres of highly varied coastline, from the rugged shores and reddish beaches of the north, to the gentle relief of the south, with
golden sandy coves
. There are many different options to enjoy sun and sea, whether on broad sandy beaches or at small coves surrounded by pine groves. They all have one thing in
    common, however: clean,
crystal clear waters.

Gaspar Janos










Capri



Italy



Luxuriant, extraordinary, and such a mild climate.
Capri
is a Mediterranean island of calcareous origin that has been visited over the centuries by intellectuals, artists
    and writers, all enthralled by its
magical beauty
. A mix of history, nature, worldliness, culture and events that daily blend together and bring the Legend of Capri to life; a
    legend that sees no comparison anywhere in the world.

Aleksandar Todorovic










Nice



France



Life in southern Europe begins with the description of a sunrise on the
blue waters
of the Mediterranean, the well-being procured by the wonderful light that prevails only here,
a lovely breakfast
on a sun-drenched terrace, the tranquillity of a stroll in the narrow streets of the Old Town, lunch on a hotel terrace,
afternoon shopping
in
    the city’s prestigious boutiques,
diving into the sea
, sipping a drink on Cours Saleya, attending a classical music concert at the Opéra de Nice, a gala soirée at the Casino,
    candlelight dinner in a famous restaurant... It is all that and much more. Live a life of happiness and contentment.

Villefranche-sur-mer



France



From the moment of your arrival, be it by corniche road, by sea or by train, the renowned
Côte d'Azur
town of
Villefranche-sur-Mer
offers an awe-inspiring
    panorama. The charm of Villefranche is also due to the
mildness of its climate
, the environmental aspect that gives rise to the exuberance and spectacular display of its
    remarkable vegetation.
