NIN
–
the Most Romantic Destination in Europe


Exciting Past and Magical Present.



Nin is part of EDEN – European Destination of Excellence and European Walled Towns Association. Its
magical attractiveness
lies in charming location, gentle climate,
        exquisite cultural heritage, intact nature, peculiar festivals and preserved traditions.



Nin’s old town core, where life began
more than 3000 years
and that’s one of the oldest towns of the Mediterranean, is situated amid shallow lagoon on a heart shaped islet.
        Many civilizations left traces which are experienced strolling along the romantic streets of the islet – an open-air museum. In the prehistoric times Nin was important harbour on the Adriatic
        and afterwards a Roman municipium. It’s called the Croatian Bethlehem because it’s been in the Middle Ages the first capital of the Croats, the oldest Croatian royal town and a Marian
        sanctuary for 500 years.



All its stories, history, legends and monuments combined with its beauty and natural resources are here to be enjoyed and to find so much needed peace,
health and happiness
.




Nin is mysterious and magical
particularly attracting with the Church of St. Cross, known as the smallest cathedral in the world. The Church is compared with Stonehenge
        because it represents a sundial and calendar.



A unique cultural heritage strongly draws to Nin: Juda’s silver coin, the remains of the biggest Roman temple on the Adriatic, original old Croatian ship, crowning church of St. Nicholas,
        miraculous statue of the Virgin Mary and museums treasuring numerous secrets. If the big toe of the statue of Gregory of Nin, placed in the centre of the town, is touched it brings good luck
        and it’s listed among the 10 most attractive world symbols of happiness – you have to try it for yourself.



Nin’s Riviera is abundant in
long sandy beaches
with total length of 50 km. One of the most beautiful world beaches is the Queen’s beach in Nin, in the middle of the unique
        lagoon in Croatia, with impressive breath-taking view of the mountain of Velebit.



Lots of people come here for the open-air clinic for the medicinal mud treatments that successfully heal many ailments for 50 years. Nin has salt pans which directly in front of you produces
        salt based on a thousand year old tradition. Particularly valuable natural resources are 8 NATURA 2000 Habitats and natural botanic garden with rare and endemic plants. 200 different bird
        species picked Eco Park Nin’s Lagoon as their home. Especially interesting are black-winged stilt and Kentish plover.



Nin is on the east coast of Adriatic, only 30 minutes’ drive from the international airport of Zadar. It has thousands excitements and the most famous camp in Croatia within the modern Zaton
        Holiday Resort.



Nin and its surroundings are fantastic source of adventure and active holiday. Nature and people turned it into a town pleasant for living and interesting for vacation. Nin is a special
        place. Story that lasts. Life joy which doesn’t stop. Welcome!

Sandy Beaches and Medicinal Mud


Long sandy beaches are one of the trademarks of the ancient town of Nin and its Riviera. Shallow and warm sea especially, attracts families with small children and elderly people. Enjoying them
    enriches the memory so it is not surprising that they are listed among the most beautiful beaches in Croatia and abroad. On the famous beach, accompanied with a legend, called the Queen's beach,
    there is also a baby beach and thalassotherapy open-air clinic where treatments and rehabilitations with medical mud are successfully carried out for 50 years. All beaches are attractive but
    distinctiveness of the beach Ždrijac is that a wind and kite surfing school is there.

The Story of Salt, Salt Pans and Museum of Salt


Salt pans are on the east part of the Nin’s lagoon. Salt works in Nin testify about one of the oldest economies of Nin and production of salt is still produced in the old fashioned way. Salt is
    naturally produced only using the sun, sea and wind. In Nin generations traditionally hand harvested salt with lots of love. There is a variety of salt products but among the most famous ones are
    flower of salt and chocolate flavoured with flower of salt. In the surroundings of salt pans there are wetland habitats colonized by marsh birds making it one of the favourite spots for
    birdwatchers and ornithologists.
