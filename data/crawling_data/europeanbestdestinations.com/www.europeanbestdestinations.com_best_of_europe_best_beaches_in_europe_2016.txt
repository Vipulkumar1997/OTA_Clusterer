Stiniva Beach



Vis Island - Croatia



Swimming on
Vis
is an unforgettable experience firstly thanks to the
clearness of the open sea
that surrounds it. No matter whether you are looking for an escape
    from the heat by jumping into the sea into St. George's Bay itself, or that you have abandoned yourself to the unusually strong currents and gentle caress of undersea fresh water springs in Molo
    Trovna or even better: you are aimlessly floating on an
inflated crocodile
in the middle of the Zoglov sand bay, Vis' sea is what remains in your memories and cannot be
    expressed.



What can be disclosed are the
beaches
that are mainly approachable by road, suitable for family excursions and due to the amount of natural shade are ideal for the younger guests
    as well. Stiniva beach is protected upon the Nature Protection Law, as
geo-morphological monument of nature
.

Tossa de mar



Costa Brava - Spain










Cliffs, pinewoods, coves and beaches make up the coastal profile of the county of La Selva, the setting for
Tossa de Mar
. The most southerly sector of the
Costa
    Brava
offers tourists an incredible range of history, art and leisure on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This town in the province of
Girona
makes available to
    travellers a wide and varied range of accommodation made to measure for all tastes. The cuisine, another of the cultural riches of this area, will convince the most refined palates.

The Concha



San Sebastian - Spain










San Sebastián’s beaches
are one of the greatest summer attractions. Each one has its own personality: the
Concha
, the
best known
, and
    Ondarreta, a family favourite, make up the Concha Bay. The Zurriola, largely taken to by youngsters and surf-lovers, and the little stretch of sand on Santa Clara Island round off the beaches in
    the group organised under in a single Environmental Management System and offer swimmers a full range of services.

Berlenga Island



Peniche - Portugal



At a distance of around 10 km from
Peniche
, the Berlengas Archipelago is a
natural haven
maintained in a virtually unspoilt state. Constituted by three groups of
    small islands - Estelas, Farilhões and
Berlenga.




Berlenga, the largest island, is the only one with inhabitants throughout the year, limited to those persons required for indispensable services -- operation of the lighthouse and surveillance of
    the Nature Reserve, thus living in absolute isolation. Between May and October there is
daily maritime transport from Peniche
. If this timetable does not suit you, or you would
    like to visit the islands during a different period of the year, there are small boats that can take you there, subject to seafaring conditions.



Berlenga is the
ideal spot for those who are looking for tranquillity
, far from the normal hustle and bustle of daily life, given that the island can only be visited by a maximum
    of 350 persons at any one time. In order to get to know the island better, you may follow the pedestrian walks that will lead you to the grottoes, to the Fortress of São João Baptista or simply
    find excellent spots in order to marvel at the spectacular landscapes.

Cala Acciarino



Lavezzi Island - Corsica









The
Lavezzi Island.
The most amazing stories always begin with the line "Once upon a time ". You should be able to say that once upon a time you set foot on the Lavezzi
    Islands, to enjoy a day of "
pure nature
", on land and under the waves. Beaches of fine sand and small creeks, Lavezzi is an extraordinary island that is formed out of granite
    blocks that are often immense, deposited on a natural arid landscape that is blessed with
exceptionally rich marine life
. You will spend you day walking on land and diving in a
    relaxed atmosphere, as well as escaping on board a boat to explore some other islands of the archipelago, such as Cavallo, Ratino and Piana.



Bring a sun hat, drinks, sandwiches and a bag for your litter (please), as Lavezzi is a « strict » nature reserve with no facilities whatsoever. Also, please ensure that your mobile phone is set
    up with you usual provider, or else you will be roaming with an Italian network (Sardinia is only a short distance away).

Kavalikefta beach



Lefkada - Greece









The wonderful landscapes give way to equally
wonderful seascapes
, with
azure waters
bathing
white sands
in coves adorned with picturesque
    fishing villages. Sail around the island to explore all those unspoiled spots. As a matter of fact, sailing has developped in a rather impressive way here. The modern marina in the town of
    Lefkada can host up to 620 vessels, attracting Robinsons in quest of fun and adventure on the
island of Lefkada
and on the smaller ones opposite Nydri: Prigkiponissia, Meganissi
    with the countless coves, Kalamos and Kastos with the secluded beaches and sea caves. If
diving
is your cup of tea, the lefkadian sea bed will fascinate you with the
    unforgettable images you’ll see unfold before your eyes.

Armaçao de Pera Beach



Algarve - Portugal









It was here that, in the 15th century, the
Portuguese
set off on the epic journey that led them to discover other peoples and cultures… and it is in the
Algarve
that we cheerfully welcome many of our visitors. Even
the climate is mild and sunny all year round
!



There’s no shortage of
high quality beaches
either.
Sandy stretches as far as the eye can see
, framed by golden cliffs, virtually deserted islands marking the
    boundary between Ria Formosa and the sea, and small coves sheltered by the rocks. The ocean, in every
shade of blue
and mostly calm and warm, invites you for long swims and to
    indulge in water sports.

El Lobo










Apela Beach



Karpathos Island - Greece




Karpathos
is situated in the most south part of Dodecanese complex,
between Crete and Rhodes
, and is the second largest island of the complex. Basically, it is
    considered a mountainous island (Kali Limni is the highest peak-altitude 1.214m)
full of water springs
, pine-trees forests, vineyards, olives and fruit-bearing trees.



The rock-caves of the island are the home of the Mediterranean seal called Μonachus monachus, while, along with Kastelorizo, this is the only place where we can meet the amphibian species
    Mertensiella luscani. According to mythology, Iapetos, the son of Uranus and Gaea [Sky and Earth] was the first inhabitant of the island.




The conquerors who defined the island’s character were Francs, Turks and Italians.  The island extends over a
    surface of 301 km2,
its coastline is 106 km long
and it has 6,500 inhabitants.

Santa Maria Dell' Isola



Calabria - Italy









No doubt that the
crystalline waters
and
white sand
are Tropea’s calling card, catering to those in search of summertime relaxation, as well as to those wanting
    to explore its fascinating underwater world, replete with numerous fish species.



Aboveground, citrus and olive groves, and
vineyards
abound throughout the entire zone, serving as charming backdrop for excursions beyond the city walls.



But of course, the city center of Tropea eventually beckons its visitors to return for a stroll through its streets and past its characteristic churches and noble palaces, stopping every now and
    then for a unique view onto the natural elements that frame it.

Ksamil beach



Ksamil Islands - Albania










Ksamili Islands
. The four marvellous Ksamili islands only 8.9 ha when measured together feature some of the
most unspoiled beauty in all Albania
. They remain
    covered in lush, green vegetation throughout the year, and can only be accessed by small boats. The
clear water
surrounding these islands makes the pristine beaches in the area
    that much more special..

Kokkari Beach



Samos Island - Greece










Kokkari
is a fishing harbour of
Samos Island
, which has now developed into a tourist center. Still, it preserves its old
    traditional face, with small houses and lanes full of flowers. Kokkari is on a small peninsula full of houses which climbs up to the top of the hill with a small harbour on one side and a
superb pebble beach
on the other. Surrounded by green mountains and the view out to the sea, it's worth a journey.







Near Kokkari are several villages like Platanakia, Valeodates, Staurinides as well as many others, which are all connected with streets or small paths.
    Hiking paths lead all around the island. Find many hidden pebble beaches, like Tsamadou, Tsambou, Lemonakia close to Kokkari.

Zakynthos Island



Greece










Zákynthos is a verdant island endowed with fertile valleys and a
temperate climate
(area: 406 sq. km; coastline: 123 km). Its landscape diversity has resulted in different
    types of beaches: there are
sandy beaches
in secluded coves where the tranquil waters are deep blue on the island’s southeastern part; yet, if rugged cliffs and an interesting
    underwater world are to your liking, try the western part of the island.
