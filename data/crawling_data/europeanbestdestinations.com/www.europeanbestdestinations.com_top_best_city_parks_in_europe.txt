Parc des Buttes Chaumont



Paris - France



The
Parc des Buttes-Chaumont
is a public park situated in northeast of
Paris
, in the 19th
    arrondissement. Occupying 24.7 hectares (61 acres), it is the
fifth-largest park in Paris
, after the Bois de Vincennes, the Bois de Boulogne, the Parc de la Villette, and the
    Tuileries Garden. It was opened in 1867, late in the regime of Emperor Napoleon III, and was built by Jean-Charles Alphand, who created all the major parks of Napoleon III. The park has 5.5
    kilometres (3.4 miles) of roads and 2.2 kilometres (1.4 miles) of paths. The most famous feature of the park is the
Temple de la Sibylle
, inspired by the Temple of Vesta in
    Tivoli, Italy, perched at the top of a cliff fifty metres above the waters of the artificial lake.

El Retiro park



Madrid - Spain




El Retiro Park
is part of the city´s historical heritage and botanical patrimony inherited from past centuries. Once a recreation area for the
Royal Family
, it
    has become a very popular park and is central to the city´s image.



The second part of the route takes us on a tour of the
Buen Retiro Park
. The first mention ever of this park goes back to the era of the Catholic Kings (‘Reyes Católicos’, who
    were Spain’s first kings after the Reconquest’s unification of all Spanish Provinces). Founders of the Jerónimos Monastery (Monasterio de los Jerónimos), a part of them were used as royal
    lodgings, called ‘the Quarters’, which made this area into the temporary royal household. Under Felipe II it became a place for taking a break from the court life.

Opening hours:

Park Masksimir



Zagreb - Croatia




Park Maksimir
, which was originally formed on the outskirts of
Zagreb
at the end of 18 th and the first half
    of 19 th century, today is completely surrounded with town settlements. In this new surrounding Park Maksimir still represents a shelter for many plant and animal species, despite its small area
    of only 316 ha. Its value for the protection of endangered species connected to old hollows is significant because of
preserved hundred-year-old oak forests
. In Park Maksimir
more than one hundred bird species
are recorded.



Besides forests, in Park Maksimir we can find meadows, lakes and streams, which also represent important habitats for various plants and animal, and in that way contribute to its biological
    diversity.

Villa Borghese
is a large landscape garden in the naturalistic English manner in
Rome
, containing a number of
    buildings, museums and attractions. It is the
third largest public park in Rome
(80 hectares or 148 acres) after the ones of the Villa Doria Pamphili and Villa Ada. The gardens
    were developed for the Villa Borghese Pinciana ("Borghese villa on the Pincian Hill"), built by the architect Flaminio Ponzio, developing sketches by Scipione Borghese, who used it as a villa
    suburbana, a party villa, at the edge of Rome, and to house his art collection. The gardens as they are now were remade in the early nineteenth century.

Tiergarten Park



Berlin - Germany



What Central Park is to New Yorkers and Hyde Park to Londoners, the same holds true in regard to what
Tiergarten
- the green lung of the metropolis- represents to Berliners.
    Located in the
centre of
Berlin
, next to attractions such as the Brandenburg Gate, it is even larger than the 210 hectares of
    Hyde Park.



At the end of the 17th century, Elector Friedrich III created from a former hunting preserve a "pleasure park for the people." Over the course of time, the park was redesigned according to
    several models – including a plan created by the famous landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné who transformed Tierpark between 1833 and 1838 into an English style park.

Englischer Garten



Munich - Germany



"
The Englische Garten
" (“
English Garden
”) is
one of the largest urban parks in the world
. The layout has undergone constant change throughout
    the centuries as new buildings and green spaces were added time and again.



It all started in 1789 when Elector Carl Theodor ordered that a public park be established along the Isar River. He put the project in the hands of the Briton Benjamin Thompson, who worked at the
    time for the Bavarian Army. The park was given the name Englische Garten because it was laid out in the style of an English country park.
