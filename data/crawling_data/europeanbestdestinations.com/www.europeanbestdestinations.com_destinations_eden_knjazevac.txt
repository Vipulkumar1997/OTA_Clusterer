Old Bazaar
, the
        long promenade beside the river and as many as seven bridges. However, this is just the beginning and a small part of what the town and its surroundings have to offer interested visitors: a
        rich history, preserved and living folk traditions and a great variety of activities in unspoiled nature. Knjaževac is surrounded by the slopes of the
mountains
Tresibaba and
        Tupižnica.



The nature offers family enjoyment and a variety of
extreme sports
. Competitive paragliding, mountain biking, caving activities, hunting and fishing, quad racing and
        motorcycle shows are among the popular acitivities in the area. The Banjica sports and recreation complex in
Rgoška spa
comprises pools and an
aqua park
that
        is supplied by
thermal water
.



This place is a favourite daytrip destination for Knjaževac locals, but also a venue of choice for top water polo players and swimmers.
Stara Planina
Nature park is becoming
        an ever more popular ski resort, with ski lifts,
ski slopes
, an artificial snow system and new accommodation capacities. Knjazevac is the municipality of vineyards and
        quality wines, interesting tradition and friendly and hospitable people.



Cultural treasure is represented in Homeland
museum
. One of the attractions is collection of double knit socks, decorated with unusual ornaments, flowers and birds, with
        almost 700 pairs. The Prayer under Midžor is traditional ceremony organized in settlements Vrtovac and Balta Berilovac in May, on St. Geroge’s Day, at the foot of
Midžor
, the
        highest mountain peak in eastern Serbia.



The uniqueness of this ritual lies in the fact that it combines pagan and hristina elements and bears witness to ancient time. It celebrates the power of spring and nature, as well as the
        re-emergence of life from winter numbness.
