Tourism in Wroclaw

Poland












Hotels in Wroclaw
































Wrocław
, the historic capital of Silesia, is
one of the biggest and oldest Polish cities
. Vratislavia was first unambiguously mentioned as a mighty burg
        about the year 1000. It was then that a Polish ecclesiastical see was created there. In 1335 the city has fallen under the sway of the Czech king John of Luxembourg and broke its ties with
        Poland. Later Vratislav, together with the entire Poland, fell under the sway of the Hungarian monarchy, and it is from those times that the Hungarian name of the city, Boroszló, dates.
        Together with the Czech crown, Wrocław was incorporated in to the Habsburg monarchy and renamed to Breslau. In 1741 the entire Silesia was taken over by Prussia, and thus Wrocław was
        incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia, and later the German Reich, until 1945. After the Second World War Wrocław was returned to Poland.



Wrocław is
full of monuments
of its thousand years of history. It is best to begin visiting the town in its oldest part, or the former islands on the Odra River and its
        forked tributaries. The most famous of these are
Ostrów Tumski
and the Piasek island, a medieval residential quarter, today one of the Polish Monuments of History. Another
        site on this list of only 30 locations is the Centenary Hall, also honored on the
UNESCO list
.



On the “islands” it is hard to miss the
Church of the Holy Cross
and St. Bartholomew. The great medieval architect known as Magister Lapida Wilancius divided the interior of
        the building into two floors occupied by two separate churches.

The Cathedral Island


The history of Wrocław began here. The stronghold in Ostrów Tumski id dated back to the beginning of 10th century. In 1000 a bishopric was established here. When the princes moved to the

    geological section of a hard coal deposit, built over 140 years ago in the rockery. Imprints of pieces of extinct plants, of which the hard coal has developed during millions of years, are
    incorporated into the section.

The Centennial Hall


It is widely considered one of the most important works of the 20th-century architecture. Previous name – Peoples Hall, it is widely considered one of the most important works of the 20th-century
    architecture. It was designed by an outstanding architect, Max Berg. It was built in 1913, for the occasion of a hundredth anniversary of battle of Leipzig. This early-modernist, once the largest
    in the world, ferroconcrete structure has a vault 1.5 times larger than the dome of the Roman Pantheon, and the weight of the Hall is only 42% of the mass of the Pantheon.
