Secret Garden Party



UK




Secret Garden Party:
sickened by commercial gigolos and the false promise of fame and Fortune achievable only through wearing the right deodorant? Well then, join us in saying
    "Goodbye (to the) Yellow Brick Road" and its promise of (social/financial) redemption.



Within the shelter of the Garden, where the dogs of society's howl is inaudible, we are exploring the more positive visual imagery in our favourite songs - so dust off your old LPs say an oh my
    and a boo hoo to the 9 to 5… Dance with us beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free; because, in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.

NOS Primavera Sound



Porto - Portugal



NOS Primavera Sound is the Portuguese counterpart of the Primavera Sound Festival that has taken place in Barcelona for sixteen years. The City of
Porto
will host, for the sixth consecutive year, the Portuguese edition, happening between 8th and 10th of June at the Parque da Cidade.



NOS Primavera Sound's line-up counts with an ample selection of international artists, as well as a significant representation of the Portuguese musical landscape. The artistic line follows the
    same guidelines of the Barcelona music event that distinguishes itself by the variety of styles and the investment in new bands, highlighting both the local scene and international artists, with
    long and respected careers.



The fifth edition of NOS Primavera Sound has once again affirmed the festival as a unique and must-stop experience in Europe, with more than 80,000 people from 58 different nationalities.

Glastonbury Festival



UK




Glastonbury Festival
is the
largest greenfield music and performing arts festival in the world
and a template for all the festivals that have come after it. The
    difference is that Glastonbury has all the best aspects of being at a festival in one astonishing bundle.



It's like going to another country, a hip and thrilling Brigadoon that appears every year or so. Coming to Glastonbury involves a fair amount of travel, and probably a queue to get in but, when
    you get past these impediments, you enter a huge tented city, a mini-state under canvas. British law still applies, but the rules of society are a bit different, a little bit freer. Everyone is
    here to have a wild time in their own way.

Spread over two dozen unique outdoor and indoor stages,
Colours of Ostrava

    jazz, indie rock, and reggae. Festival-goers can look forward to over 350 events ranging from bands, DJs, films, open discussions, workshops, theatre, poetry, and art installations.



But the diverse programme is only one thing that makes Colours of Ostrava unique. The festival is held on the site of the city’s former mines and ironworks, a European Cultural Heritage Site and
    unlike any other concert venue. Despite its industrial feel, the festival site also boasts plenty of green space plus a range of quieter and shaded spaces which are ideal for lounging and
    recharging your batteries. In terms of accommodation, there are options ranging from camping in the picturesque surroundings of the Ostrava Silesian Castle to higher-end accommodation options at
    Ostrava city centre hotels. Whichever option suits you best, there’s no need to travel long distances to the festival, which is just three tram stops from the city centre.






Book your apartment, hotel, B&B at the best price guaranteed
in
    Ostrava or any other cities in Czech Republic as well as your
best activities
such as a legendary beer tour in Prague.

Iceland Airwaves



Iceland








Since the first edition was held in 1999 (in an airplane hangar),
Iceland Airwaves
has become one of the premier annual showcases for new music – Icelandic and otherwise – in the
    world. It’s made a heap of friends and won many fans along the way, and been lavished with praise pretty much everywhere they write about music. Example: Rolling Stone magazine called it
    “
The hippest long weekend on the annual music-festival calendar
.”

©Sound Wave Festival










Soundwave Festival



Tisno - Croatia



Organised by one of London’s top promoters, Rob Waller/Soundcrash, along with one of the managing directors and curators of Outlook & Dimensions Festivals, Noah Ball, the event is a
    wonderful opportunity to experience a
music festival on the beautiful Croatian coastline
– what could be better? This “
unique European boutique festival
” has a
    very loyal following, with many revellers returning year after year; a third of tickets are snapped up before any artists are even announced, and the festival is always fully sold out
    beforehand.




Soundwave
is a perfect choice if you’re just after a long weekend festival event in Europe, although there’s also a great opportunity for you to combine it with a holiday on
    Croatia’s coastline either before or after.

Womad Festival



UK



In the beginning... there were three men - Peter Gabriel, Thomas Brooman and Bob Hooton who put their innovative musical heads together and founded
The WOMAD Festival
. This was
    1980. It took two years to actually realise their dream and bring WOMAD Festival to Shepton Mallet. And this was July 1982. The crowds came in their droves and encountered a feat of extraordinary
    musicians and artists, workshops for all. Don Cherry, Simple Minds, Imrat Khan, The Drummers of Burundi, Echo and The Bunnymen and Peter Gabriel (to name but a few). WOMAD was perhaps the first
    truly international music festival to emerge at this time.

Every August for the last ten years, the
Festival du Bout du Monde
has succeeded in attracting a truly cosmopolitan crowd. The music is remarkable and the location is fantastic

    grasslands of Landrevarzec, this music festival is a must for lovers of world music. Now one of the most successful world music festivals in France, and renowned for its family atmosphere, during
    this festival, for a weekend at any rate, the world revolves around Brittany – which is no longer at the ends of the earth!

    claim to have
one of the most beautiful festival sites in the world
