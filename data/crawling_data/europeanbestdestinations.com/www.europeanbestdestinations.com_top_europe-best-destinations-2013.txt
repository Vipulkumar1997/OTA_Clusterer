Istanbul ? The best place to travel in Europe!



The only city in the world to straddle two continents, Turkey's fabled city of

#5
AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS














It's likely you've seen a picture of
Amsterdam
's winding waterways. Perhaps you've heard it's home to almost as many bikes as
            residents. Or maybe you're aware of its tolerant and laid-back atmosphere. But there's more to Amsterdam than meets the eye - here are five things you probably didn't know about the city.

#7
VALLETTA, MALTA














Europe's smallest capital it may be, but
Valletta
has the vibrancy and diversity - not to mention the rich cultural and historical
            offering-of a city many times its diminutive size.



Valletta's most compelling charms come to you slowly, in snippets: during a lazy walk through its tangled sun-bleached streets, where you'll catch a glimpse of the harbors through
            silhouettes of 16th-century homes.
