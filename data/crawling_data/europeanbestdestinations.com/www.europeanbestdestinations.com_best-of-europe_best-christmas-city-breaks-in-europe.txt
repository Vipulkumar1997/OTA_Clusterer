Dresden

From 29th November to 24th December 2017


If you like
Christmas
, you’ll love
Dresden
. A grand total of eleven completely different
    Christmas markets, from the by no means Dark Ages to the après ski charm of alpine huts, makes for wonderfully conflicting decisions.



Holiday sounds fill the air throughout the city. From the many oratorios, Advent, organ and gospel concerts, Dresden’s churches brim with festive insider tips.



Christmas tales also come to life in the city’s theatres whilst museums host special exhibitions and boats bejewelled with lights glide along the Elbe. If
    only
Christmas
could last more than just a few weeks…

Strasbourg

From 25th November to 31st December 2017


It was in
Strasbourg
in 1570 that the very first edition
    of the oldest Christmas market in Europe took place, then called the "
Christkindelsmärik
" (market of the Infant Jesus).



Since this time, Strasbourg has continued the tradition of a traditional, authentic, warm and generous Alsatian Christmas and these are all the reasons why "Strasbourg, the Capital of Christmas"
    continues to enjoy repeated success.

Colmar

From 24th November to 31st December 2017


The magic of
Christmas in Colmar
, first of all there’s the ambiance of the Old Town, illuminated and decorated like a fairy
    tale : a historic setting made magical by the Christmas illuminations which, in this festive period, blend harmoniously with the wonderful lighting designed to enhance the town’s heritage, and
    lay a soothing aura of light over the centre of Colmar.



Colmar town centre is essentially pedestrian, comprises numerous architectural treasures such as monuments, churches, museums and alleys, full of imposing buildings dating from the Middle Ages to
    the 19th century. Marvel at the Maison Pfister, the Koïfhus, Unterlinden museum, Little Venice, the maison des têtes and Saint Martin's Collegiate church. The whole town is decorated, as in a
    dream, turning the old centre into a veritable open-air theatre where the warm Christmas mood envelops the heart of the town.

©VisitBerlin





















































Berlin

From 25th November to 31st December 2017


The baroque Charlottenburg Palace is a sumptuous backdrop for this
Christmas market
in City West. An elaborate light installation bathes the market, the palace, the
    trees and decorative fence of the palace in a romantic glow. The pivotal point of the market is a pyramid in front of the palace's main entrance.



Wood huts and marquees, decorated entirely with natural materials, provide a festive atmosphere and offer not only a wide range of crafts but also an impressive selection of culinary choices. In
    addition to the traditional
Christmas market
stalls selling hot chestnuts, crepes or Hungarian langos, many hotels and restaurants from
Berlin
and Brandenburg offer fine dining in heated tents.



The Winterwald (winter forest) in front of the small orangery offers magical attractions for children, including a nostalgic carousel, an air swing and a small railway. In the Märchenzelt (fairy
    tale tent) organised by the Stiftung Stadtmuseum
Berlin
, the little ones can try their hand at arts and crafts.



A visit to the Christmas market in front of Charlottenburg Palace is wonderfully combined with a tour of the palace or a leisurely walk through its garden.

    experience, you'll definitely don't want to miss!





Another hot spot before
Christmas
is the cultural and
Christmas market
in
    front of Schönbrunn Palace. It offers sheer romance in front of an imperial backdrop, and is converted into a New Year's market after Christmas. The atmospheric market offers traditional
    handicrafts, hand-made
Christmas decorations
