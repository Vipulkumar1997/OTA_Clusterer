Lille - France



The history of

remains unclear, the first written record dates from 1127. The Lille flea market has evolved many times as much on principle (fair, selling
    fabrics, attic), the date on which it stood or its duration.



In the Middle Ages, in the twelfth century, the servants had got to sell an annual antiques and clothing of their masters. This custom was superimposed at the fair in Lille, where Lillois as
    foreigners could freely sell their goods.



Nowadays, the flea market extends hundreds of kilometers of sidewalks and can accommodate between two and three million people. In general, it is held the weekend of the first Sunday in September
    and officially began early Saturday afternoon to finish on Sunday at noon, without interruption.
