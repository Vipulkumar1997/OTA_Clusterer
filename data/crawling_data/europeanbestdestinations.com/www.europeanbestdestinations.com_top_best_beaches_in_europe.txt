Tenby Harbour



Wales - UK



Picturesque harbour built into corner on North Beach, between the old medieval walled town and castle hill.
There’s a
    small

sandy beach

tucked up under the
    harbour wall that’s perfect for very young children.


To the south of the harbour are the lifeboat stations, the old and the new. Hire easy to sail fun boats or take a boat trip to Caldey Island.

Praia da Cova Redonda



Algarve - Portugal



A real paradise, with calm clear waters ...

In order to reach the
beach
, you have to make your way down a long set of gently descending steps paved in the
Portuguese style
and bordered by lots of
    vegetation on either side: pine-trees, mastic-trees and Spanish broom. The bay in which the beach nestles is not a large one, but the space is full of sheltered nooks and crannies provided by the
    warm-coloured, sinuous and jagged rock formations. The shapes that have been formed in the cliffs by the erosion and wearing away of the rocks are quite extraordinary. In some places, amongst the
    furrows of the cliffs, are some greyish areas where the rock almost appears to have been “cemented”.

Anna Lurye




Isolla Bella



Sicily










Toarmina
is at 210 meters (689 feets) above the sea level. The coastline directly below Taormina, north and south, is immensely appealing.

Several pictoresque bays, with grottoes, rocky coves and good sandy or pebbled beaches, all easily reached by cable car or with the convenient shuttle-bus service from the hotels in town.

Virgin Island's Creek



Brittany - France









With its Mediterranean beach-like setting and maritime pines, the natural cove of Île Vierge (
Virgin Island
), also known as
Point of Saint Hernot
, is a
    surprising and unusual place in
Brittany
. Come and discover all of the aspects of this unique natural gem by boat, kayak, on foot via the GR34 trail or with
    flippers/mask/snorkel. Right from the start, it's completely worth it! Be careful, the entrance to the beach is a little steep.

beach

best activities

Nissi beach



Ayia Napa - Cyprus









The
sandy beach
stretches for 500m and the waters are clean enough for the beach to have been awarded blue flag designation. The beach which runs the length of its own cove,
    takes its name from the small islet (
Nissi
- Νησί in Greek) located close to the coast.



Book your hotel at the
best price guaranteed
for a perfect holiday in Cyprus. We recommend the "
Vassos Nissi Plage Hotel"
, located just a 2-minute walk from
    Nissi beach.
