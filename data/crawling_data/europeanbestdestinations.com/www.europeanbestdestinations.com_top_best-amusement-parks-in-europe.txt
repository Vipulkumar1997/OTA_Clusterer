Gröna Lund










Gröna Lund



Stockholm - Sweden




Gröna Lund
is an amusement park in
Stockholm
, Sweden. It is located on the seaward side of the
Djurgården island
and is relatively small compared to other amusement parks, mainly due to its
central location
, which limits expansion. The 15-acre amusement
    park has over 30 attractions, and is a popular venue for concerts during the summer. Gröna Lund was founded in 1883 by James Schultheiss. Gröna Lund's roots are in the 1880s, making it
Sweden's oldest amusement park
. In 1883, a German by the name of Jacob Schultheiss rented the area to erect "carousels and other amusements", and until 2001 descendants of
    Schultheiss ran Gröna Lund. Before the amusement park came into being, Gröna Lund was the name of a small park.




The park's location is quite unique in the sense that most of the buildings are old residential and commercial structures dating from the 19th
    century. The buildings are therefore not built for the park; instead, the park is built around the buildings.
