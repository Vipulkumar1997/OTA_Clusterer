The Palace of Pena



Sintra (Lisbon) - Portugal



Located in the
Sintra
hills, the Park and
Palace of Pena
are the fruit of King Ferdinand II’s creative
    genius and the greatest expression of 19th-century romanticism in Portugal, denoting clear influences from the Manueline and Moorish styles of architecture. The palace was built in such a way as
    to be visible from any point in the park, which consists of a forest and luxuriant gardens with over five hundred different species of trees originating from the four corners of the earth.

The Alcazar Castle



Segovia - Spain



The
Alcázar
of Segovia (literally,
Segovia Castle
) is a stone fortification, located in the old city of Segovia, Spain. Rising out on a rocky crag above the
    confluence of the rivers Eresma and Clamores near the Guadarrama mountains, it is
one of the most distinctive castle-palaces in Spain
by virtue of its shape – like the bow of a
    ship. The Alcázar was originally built as a fortress but has served as a royal palace, a state prison, a Royal Artillery College and a military academy since then.
The castle is one of
    the inspirations for Walt Disney's Cinderella Castle
.

The Castle in Love with the Wind



Ravadinovo- Bulgaria



In Love with the Wind – the castle with the magnificent structures made of marble and metamorphosed limestone from the
fairy tales
of a talented architect and dreamer,
Georgi Tumpalov
. The only newly built castle in Europe.



The Castle In Love with the Wind – a fairy tale
near the sea.
The place where the Castle is built is a unique natural phenomenon. Here, the wind loves the sun and always
    when the sun shines, there is a wind. On this bare field near the village, Georgi Tumpalov, an architect and developer, decided to make it child’s dream come true – to build a castle that exists
    only in fairy tales. But a dream never comes alone. Tumpalov attracted to the modest village of Ravadinovo, standing 6 km from
Sozopol
, enormous
crowds of visitors
from all over the world. The castle was awarded the prize for the most attractive tourist site of the year by
    the Bulgarian Hotel and Restaurant Association. In 2013,
Walt Disney
used its natural décor to make its movie the
Sleeping Beauty
. In 2016 the castle won the
    first prize of the international competition "A’ Design Awards 2016” in the category: "A Hospitality, Recreation, Travel and Tourism Design“.

The Neuschwanstein Castle



Bavaria - Germany



Seven weeks after the death of King Ludwig II in 1886,
Neuschwanstein
was opened to the public. The shy king had built the castle in order to withdraw from public life – now vast
    numbers of people came to view his private refuge.



Today Neuschwanstein is
one of the most popular of all the palaces and castles in Europe
. Every year 1.4 million people visit "the castle of the fairy-tale king". In the summer
    around 6,000 visitors a day stream through rooms that were intended for a single inhabitant.

The Hohenzollern Castle



Baden-Württemberg - Germany



The first personal related reference of the
Hohenzollern
House dates back to 1061 ("Wezil et Burchardus de Zolorin"). First direct mention of the Castle complex ("Castro Zolre")
    was in 1267. Appearance, size and furnishing of the original Castle are unknown, but presumably it was in the first decade of the 11th century. At that time it must have been a vast and
    artistically valuable furnished complex. Contemporary sources praised it as "Crown of all Castles in Swabia" and as "
the most fortified House in Germany
". However in 1423, the
    Castle was completely destroyed.

The Chateau de Chambord



Chambord - France



1519. A palace rises up out of the swampy lowlands of the Sologne region, on the edge of a forest filled with wild boar. François I, the young king who had garnered glory in the Battle of
    Marignan, ordered its construction.
The Château de Chambord
was not intended to be a permanent residence; François I would in fact spend only a few weeks here, leaving it empty
    of furniture and people after his visits. It was an architectural jewel that the king liked to show to visiting crowned heads and ambassadors as a symbol of his power. Although the château was
    not completed under François I, it is one of the few buildings of that age that has survived without major modifications to its original design.

Culzean Castle



Maybole - Scotland




Culzean Castle
is the jewel in the crown of the National Trust for Scotland. This grand cliff-top country house was remodelled in the late 18th century by the renowned architect
    Robert Adam in his trademark neo-classical Georgian style.

Eilean Donan Castle



Highlands - Scotland




Eilean Donan
is for many people,
the archetypal Scottish castle
and is certainly one of the most photographed. Ruined in the early 18th century, it was restored
    to all its glory some two centuries later and is now the headquarters of the Clan McRae.

Corvin Castle



Hunedoara - Romania




Corvin Castle
was laid out in 1446, when construction began at the orders of
John Hunyadi
(Hungarian: Hunyadi János, Romanian: Iancu or Ioan de Hunedoara) who
    wanted to transform the former keep built by Charles I of Hungary. The castle was originally given to John Hunyadi's father, Voyk (Vajk), by Sigismund,
king of Hungary
, as
    severance in 1409. It was also in 1446 when John Hunyadi was elected as the regent-governor of the Kingdom of Hungary by the Diet.

Chenonceau Castle



Chenonceaux - France



Property of the Crown, then royal residence,
Chenonceau Castle
is an exceptional site not only because of its original design, the richness of its collections, its furniture and
    its decorations, but also because of its destiny, since it was loved, administrated and protected by women, who were all extraordinary and who, for the most part have marked history.



Today, its guests, who come from all over the world, discover the quality of its reception, thanks to a free visit or audio guide with iPod video (in 11 languages).

Hohenwerfen Castle



Werfen - Austria



The mighty castle of
Hohenwerfen
has towered over the 155 metre high craggy rock pillar above the Salzachtal valley for more than 900 years. The powerful fortifications were
    built at the same time as Hohensalzburg Fortress and are some of the best preserved late medieval defences and rooms on the continent. Over the centuries they have seen countless attacks and
    sieges, and several great rulers and lords, such as Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, were held prisoner in the castle.
