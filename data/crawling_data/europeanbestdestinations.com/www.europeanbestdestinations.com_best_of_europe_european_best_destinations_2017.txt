1. Porto



Portugal










Never has the choice of the winning city been so unanimous among travellers from all other the world
. It is with the votes of worldwide
    travellers from 174 countries that Porto wins this European title again for the third time (2012, 2014, 2017). Travellers from the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Denmark,
    South-Africa, South Korea, Ireland and Canada, among others,... voted Porto in the first place in this competition.




Porto
is exceptional in more ways than one and the "Cidade Invicta"
    (unvanquished city) is history, is architecture, culture, gastronomy, trade, encounters and discoveries, will seduce you.







Porto has all the charm of towns which happily cohabit with their river. You can stroll along the River Douro (river of gold) in Cais da Ribeira,
fly over it by helicopter
or discover Porto's architecture, its amazing landscapes and
    magnificent bridges by
taking a cruise on this majestic
    river
. Porto is also a sea city and in the briefest of time a tram will bring you to Foz do Douro’s gentle beaches face to face with the Atlantic.







Enter the sumptuously cool Palacio da Bolsa, and walk through history with Portuguese adventurers, follow the country’s trade routes and be stunned by the treasures
    which they brought back. Remarkable buildings such as the Sé Catédral and its terraces offer superb viewpoints over a bustle of markets, grocery stores, bars, restaurants…






Porto Travel Guide
































2. Milan



Italy




Milan
has been interesting and vibrant at least since it was the capital of the western half of the Roman Empire. Have a
    look at the imposing marble
Duomo
, at our churches, palaces and museums. You will also be delighted by
contemporary art
and architecture.



The internationally renowned city has an extremely positive image in all corners of the world and attracts a large number of travellers, making it
a leading destination
. Milan is
    particularly appreciated by Swiss and American travellers.



While you visit, let the atmosphere of
Italy’s most modern and advanced city
seep in. You will be captured by the elegance and style; by the energy and the international flair.
An incredible shopping experience
for all tastes and pockets, in a place where design and fashion have made their home.



HOTELS in Milan























3. Gdansk



Poland







There is no other place like
Gdansk
. Other cities can just resemble Gdansk. Its unique location and over a thousand years’
    history shape Gdansk’s expressive and distinctive character and give it strong and implicit recognition among European cities. Nonetheless, the city holds an abundance of mysteries; it has got
    its own spirit which makes it impossible to mistake Gdansk for any other place.



This is Gdansk's first participation in this European competition  and it has reached the top 3 of your best European destinations.

4. Athens



Greece



Travellers have always ranked
Athens
at the top of this European competition.
     It is a favourite destination for travellers from all over the world who want to discover Europe. Ever since its participation in this competition, Athens has ranked among the 5 favourite
    destinations of travellers worldwide.



From the iconic Acropolis, rising above the city, to charming up and coming neighborhoods and contemporary art galleries, the city of Classic Marathon and Olympic Games is a majestically quirky
    clash of past and present.



One of the
world's oldest cities
with a recorded history of 3,500 years, the Greek capital is constantly undergoing urban renewals to keep up with the evolution
    of time.
Athens
lives up to all the hype!



HOTELS in Athens






















5. San Sebastian



Spain



With a very important cultural identity, breathtaking scenery, world-renowned gastronomy and an important business tourism, San Sebastian is one of the most trendy destinations of 2017.



Any excuse to visit
San Sebastian
is good. Besides the unequalled beauty of La Concha Bay, (a shell shaped bay) which
    the royal family fell in love with at the start of the last century and continues to captivate anyone who comes to see it, the city is the place to come to for innovative cuisine that has made it
    famous across the world, a wide range of festivals that have made it a genuine cultural phenomenon and an active and healthy lifestyle that is very much in touch with the natural resources on
    offer. All these reasons have made it a top tourist destination over the last two centuries.



Hotels in San Sebastian























6. Sozopol



Bulgaria



Bulgaria is an increasingly popular country for travellers all over the world. Between cities and nature, tradition and modernity, mountains and sea, it offers a great diversity of landscapes and
    tourist opportunities. The city of
Sozopol
has harvested on social networks the highest number of positive comments from
    foreign travellers, amazed by the beauty of this seaside resort.



Sozopol is also the oldest town in Bulgaria. It has been established in 610 BC as a Hellenic colony of Miletus Greeks named Apollonia Pontica.  The urban structure has been built during the
    centuries and reveals the stages of development of the human civilization, bears the marks of inherited cultural layers and continuity and turns Sozopol into a real museum town.



HOTELS IN SOZOPOL























7. Vienna



Austria






Vienna
is undoubtedly one of the favourite destinations of European travellers. Ever
    since the beginning of this competition, Vienna has beeen in the top ten.  The City enjoys a great reputation internationally;  it is the second most popular destination for travellers
    from Germany, the third best destination for voters from the US and the third most favoured European destination by voters from Japan.



Vienna's Ringstrasse is the
most beautiful boulevard in the world
. Nowhere else can you find such a dense concentration of so many
    representative buildings, palaces and parks.



All of these splendid buildings still have their full radiance today. An elegant promenade for the wealthy and beautiful has become a modern boulevard for everyone.  And the section of the
    Ring along the Danube Canal has become a hotspot: an
urban bar scene and modern architecture attract
a primarily young audience.



HOTELS in Vienna























8. Stari Grad



Croatia



This beautiful destination on the island of Hvar in Croatia seduces every year more and more travellers from all over the world. The Austrians place it in 4th position of their favourite
    destinations in Europe, just behind Athens and ahead of Porto.



This year,
Stari Grad
on the island of
Hvar
marks an
exceptional
    anniversary
– 2,400 years of the city foundation and of the equally long tradition of urban living on the
sunniest island
in the Adriatic.



The heritage preserved since the Age of Antiquity has been recognized by the
UNESCO
which in 2008 inscribed the
Stari Grad
Plain on the World
    Heritage List due to its preserved Greek land division and the continuity of life and agriculture in this place.



HOTELS in STARI GRAD

9. Basel



Switzerland




Basel
is situated in the heart of Europe, bordering Germany and France. A combination of authentic Swiss quality and a
    multicultural population make this city unmistakably cosmopolitan and innovative.



Due to its density of museums, Basel is further considered as the cultural capital of Switzerland. The city boasts 40 museums on a relatively small area. With various subjects and world-renowned
    special exhibitions, there is something for every taste. Furthermore, Basel is the home of Art Basel, the most important contemporary art fair in the world.



This was the city's first participation in this competition and the travellers' votes have placed it in the top 10.. Basel is even ranked in 7th position by German travellers and together with
    Rome, is placed in 4th position by Chinese travellers.



Hotels in Basel























10. Madrid



Spain




Madrid
is an open-minded city where culture and entertainment share a thriving space. The Spanish capital makes everyone feel
    right at home while providing them with some of the world’s most interesting tourist attractions.



The Spanish capital still has tremendous appeal for travellers from all over the world who still give it a good position in this European ranking. Madrid is also the 9th favourite destination for
    travellers from the USA.




Madrid
is one of the world’s liveliest, most entertaining and vibrant cities during the day, but even more so at night. The
Spanish capital
does not only offer
    art, shopping, nightlife and excellent
gastronomy
but it also presents both visitors and locals with all imaginable options for leisure.



HOTELS in madrid























11. Rotterdam



The Netherlands




Rotterdam
is a young, dynamic global city, continuously renewing itself at a rapid rate. Sparkling skyscrapers, an
    impressive port, trendy restaurants and food markets, renowned museums and awesome festivals are the direct result of the can-do mentality of the Rotterdammers.



Full of energy and innovation, Rotterdam reinvented itself after the bombing of the Second World War. It broke with the past and chose modern architecture. The motto: light, air and space, was
    ground breaking for that time.



For a first participation in this competition, this cosmopolitan and modern city has attracted a very large number of travellers who place it in their top 15 favourite destinations in Europe.



hotels in rotterdam































12. Rome



Italy




Rome
is consistently well positioned in this ranking of best European destinations by European travellers and travellers from
    all over the world; Brazilians rate the eternal city as the second most popular destination in Europe, just behind Porto, which ranks first.



The province of Rome is a matching frame for the
many treasures of the capital
, and the surrounding area has, more or less directly, experienced the influence of the history of
    the
Eternal City.




A region with a great deal to offer:
sea, nature, good food
and villages rich in history and art. The sea, the hills, lakes, rivers and vineyards: the surroundings of Rome offer
    a kaleidoscope of diversity and attractions for nature lovers.



HOTELS in ROME























13. Paris



France




Paris
is one of the world’s few really legendary capitals. Far from resting on its laurels, the French
    capital has taken a pro-active approach to enhancing its appeal by undertaking a quality-focused and sustainable development strategy based on constant innovation. This great city is a blend
    of past and future. Its pleasingly symmetrical layout, the result of the work of visionary rulers and architects, dates to the 19th century, while 21st-century Paris is a laboratory of the
    future.



Paris is a dream destination for French and international visitors alike.



Hotels in Paris

14. Bonifacio



France










Bonifacio
is a destination that appeals to travellers from all over the world. With its houses perched on cliffs and its
    well preserved natural habitat, it is one of the preferred destinations of European travellers and travellers from outside Europe.



Situated in the middle of the International Marine Park, the port of Bonifacio is set in the heart of a channel, a thousand nautical miles long.  It offers total protection in all weathers
    and winds.  But above all, a stop-over to satisfy sailors with top-level sea food gastronomy, numerable bars and terraces with the possibility of all types of provisioning only a few meters
    from the pontoons.



Bonifacio is rich with rare and protected species.  The Cory’s Shearwater seabird is part of family of the Albatross, the African Fish Eagle planes over Sperone and wild orchids, found
    nowhere else in France, cover the country-side.  And marine mammals of all kinds (the common dolphin and the White-Blue Dolphin) are omnipresent all year long.





Hotels in Bonifacio

15. Wild Taiga



Finland



For the first time, a sustainable tourism destination was selected in this competition.
Wild Taiga
, a destination of the
    European network "EDEN" proudly represents the colors of sustainable tourism ahead of major European capitals. It is extremely popular with Asian travellers, ranks 5th among the favourite
    destinations of Korean travellers and ranks number one destination with Chinese travellers.



Wild Taiga, located on Finland’s eastern border, is a perfect example of rich tradition and strong culture. Evergreen forests, aapa bogs, clean water and rich wildlife form the second
    important part of Kuhmo and Suomussalmi. On guided excursions you can watch and photograph the wild animals of the forest, in particular large beasts – bears, wolves and wolverines – that are
    either rare or extinct in other parts of Europe.
