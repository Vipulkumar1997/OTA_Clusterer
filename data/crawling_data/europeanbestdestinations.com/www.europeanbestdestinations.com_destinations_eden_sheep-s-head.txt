Tourism in Sheep's head Peninsula

West cork - Ireland












Search hotels



































The Sheep’s Head peninsula, jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean on Ireland's south-west coastline, is  home to one of Europe's best-loved walking trails.




WALK THE SHEEP'S HEAD WAY




It's home to the Sheep's Head Way - an award-winning 88km trail that stretches around the entire coastline of this slim peninsula. Begin in the historic West Cork harbour town of Bantry and
        walk out onto the Sheep's Head. As you look out over Bantry and Dunmanus Bays, take in the glorious unfolding views over the neighbouring Mizen and Beara peninsulas.

You'll discover many local heritage sites in this ancient landscape as you walk!

Cliff paths, ridge walks, and farmland paths can all be found on this varied and well-marked walking route. The views change here with every turn in the road and each shift in the light.
        You're sure to get a warm welcome from the locals you meet along the trail and in our cosy places to stay.



This is an unspoilt part of the world that deserves its reputation as a kind of Eden.




20 LOOP WALKS




There are 20 loop walks on the Sheep's Head Way, and there's a walk to suit everyone in this fantastic 200km trail network. Walk on Whiddy Island, trek to the lighthouse, hike along the
        Peakeen ridge, or enjoy valley views on the Coomkeen loop walk. Lovely inland trails introduce you to the hills and valleys around Drimoleague, Castledonovan, and Carriganass Castle.




THINGS TO DO




Cycle the Sheep's Head, with its hairpin bends and bayside villages. Pony trekking, sailing, kayaking, and shore fishing offer other wonderful ways to explore this hidden gem on Ireland's
        Wild Atlantic Way.




FOOD & CRAFTS




Put Cork on your fork when you sample delicious local produce like Durrus Cheese, Glenilen butter, and Bantry Bay mussels in our family-run restaurants and cafés.

Whether you're sampling fish fresh from the sea, connecting with Ireland's rich history, hiking our moorlands, or drinking Guinness with the locals, you're sure to love the time you spend
        'living the Sheep's Head Way!'



Monte Isola has always been a special place for the artisan production of boats and nets and has gained the title of “Presidio Slow Food” thanks to the millenary tradition linked with the
        conservation of the “lake sardine”. Other specialties are extra virgin olive oil and salami.

Visit Bantry House & Gardens


Take a tour of Bantry House, an exquisite Irish stately home and gardens, still owned by descendants of the original Earl of Bantry who built the house in the mid-1700s.



The house’s story is closely interwoven with Irish history, and it provides a gracious setting for the many stunning artefacts which the family has collected from across Europe over the
    centuries.



Take a tour or climb the garden's steps for breath-taking views over beautiful landscaped gardens, Bantry Bay and Whiddy Island!

Carve Letters in Stone


Take a piece of local Kilcrohane limestone in your hands and learn to carve it with help from Victor Daly, a stone carver with incredible knowledge of Ireland’s stone-carving traditions.



It's a unique opportunity to engage with the Atlantic landscape of the Sheep's Head peninsula.



You'll learn to use traditional tools and techniques as well as timeless skills passed down through the generations. Engage with West Cork's creative spirit and create something beautiful to take
    home!
