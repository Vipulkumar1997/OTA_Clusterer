The Gazompeter



Vienna - Austria



Since the end of the 1990s, four teams of star architects have been working on converting four 102-year-old
gasometers
into a new urban complex.



Apart from 615 modern flats and an events hall holding 4,200 people, the 22,000 m2 ground floor of the
gasometer complex
in the
Vienna
district of Simmering - once a heavily industrialised area - will also have a shopping mall with some 70 shops.



Just eight minutes' away from the city centre (Stephansplatz) on the U3 underground line (station: Gasometer), this new El Dorado offers
sheer shopping pleasure
in any weather.
    The gigantic size of this construction project is illustrated by the fact that
Vienna's Giant Ferris Wheel
would easily fit into each of the four 75-metre high gasometers.

Magna Plaza



Amsterdam - The Netherlands



The former main post office building in

Romantic elements of which, for instance, the Parliament buildings in London are also an example. In 1992 this beautiful building was added to the list of the ten most valuable monuments of the
    city of Amsterdam.
