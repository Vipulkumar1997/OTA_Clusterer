Tourism in Sinj

Dalmatia • Croatia












Search hotels




































The town of Sinj is situated in the heart of the
Dalmatian hinterland
, on the west side of the field that extends along the middle flow of the river Cetina. Surrounded by
        beautiful mountains of Kamešnica, Svilaja and Dinara.
Sinj
is about 13km far from the highway A1, at 30km distance from the Adriatic Sea. On elevation of 320 meters, the
        Town's temperature continental clime overlaps with sub -
Mediterranean climate
. Hot and dry summer days are relieved by cool nights, owing to the nearby mountain ranges.
        Winter months are abundant in perception, when temperatures can be very low.



The
archaeological
finds are evidence of the fact that the Cetina area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. The natives, members of the Illyrian tribe Delmates,
        appeared in the area during the Bronze Age and their development continued until the Romans had arrived. After the fall of the
Roman Empire
, barbarians repeatedly invaded the
        area. At the beginning of the 7th century, Croats came from White Croatia and settled in the region of
Dalmatia
. This was the time of the foundation of region of Dalmatia.
        This was the time of the foundation of the first Croatian principalities. In the later period, when a kingdom was founded, Sinj become the center of the Cetina County. The title of princes of
        Cetina was first acquired by the Šubić princes and from 1345 it belonged to the Nelepić princes.



In 1513 Sinj fell into Ottoman hands, up until 1686, when it came under Venetian rule. The Ottomans, however, were still attempting to win back Sinj. The most significant battle was fought in
        1715, when 700 defenders of Sinj repulsed an attack of 40.000 to 60.000 of Ottomans. The disordered Ottoman army left the Cetina Krajina Region. In commemoration of their victory the
        surviving defenders instituted the Alka tournament, a famous equestrian competition held every year since then on first Sunday in August for more than three hundred years.



The Tournament of Alka is under protection of
UNESCO
as world intangible heritage. It is a symbol of the struggle for freedom, peace and hearth, for faith and hope and unites
        the past and the future. The Croatian people have always worshipped the
Blessed Virgin Mary
and in tribulations they have prayed for her help. The Sinj is one of the greatest
        Croatian sanctuaries dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and a celebration of the Feast of Assumption on August 15th is given the special solemn significance.

The church of the
Miraculous Lady of Sinj
dominates the city's main square. Built from 1699 to 1712, it resisted wars and earthquakes and has preserved its original
        appearance. The central place both inside the church and in the hearts of Sinj is occupied by the image of the Miraculous Lady of Sinj. It was painted by an unknown autor in the fifteenth or
        sixteenth century. It was brought from Rama as the refugees treasure and hope. After the famous victory in 1715, which happened by the legend thanks to Madonna's spiel, as a sing of
        thanksgiving, the military officers of the Sinj army collected 80 shiners and had the gold crown with cross made to decorate the Miracle Painting.



The Painting was crowned with a golden crown on September 22nd 1716, which says IN PERPETUUM CORONATA TRIUMPHAT -ANNO MDCCHV ("May you triumph forever crowned -1715")

.

Sinj have two memorable fortress: The
Kamičak fort
is one of the moste picturesque and striking symbols of Sinj, located in the city center. There is a tower at the fort,
        which used to serve as watchtower with clock and bronze bell. And Old Town remnants of the old fortress who rises on rocky hill above the old Illyrian Osinium. There are 14 Station of the
        Cross along the road leading from the foot of the hill to the church in the fortress.

Race "Sinjski hipodrom"


Horse breeding and training has always been a distinctive characteristic of Sinj and the Cetinska Krajina Region. For almost three centuries now Sinj has been the town of the Alka Tournament.
    Besides that, Sinj has traditionally hosted a number of local and international hurdle and gallop tournaments. The development of Sinj equestrian sport was encouraged by the holding of the 1979
    Mediterranean Games in Split. On that occasion Sinj racecourse, Hipodrom, was completed and put into use. Equestrian sport contests were held there. Sinj Hipodrom is the second largest in
    Croatia, following the Zagreb one. The equestrian club Alkar has spawned a number of top horse riders and internationals since its foundation in 1968. Greater Sinj also comprises many smaller
    private-owned stud farms of high reputation and nowadays there are five equestrian clubs there. Besides the riding school for beginners and advanced learners, several clubs have on offer the
    therapy riding, which has produced exceptional results in the therapy of disabled persons. New tracks have been built which should attract a greater number of enthusiasts of nature, horses and
    adventure tourism.
