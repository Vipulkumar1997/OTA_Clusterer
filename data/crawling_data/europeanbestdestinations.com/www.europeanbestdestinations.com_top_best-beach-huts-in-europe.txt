Mersea Island



Essex - UK




Mersea Island
is the most easterly inhabited island in the UK, located marginally off the coast of the county and 9 miles (14 km) to the southeast of Colchester.



The main industries on Mersea are farming, fishing including oyster cultivation, tourism and servicing the leisure boating industry. There are two main settlements on the island, the small town
    of West Mersea and the village of East Mersea, plus a small hamlet at Barrow Hill to the north of West Mersea. Most of the population of Mersea live in West Mersea, this is where nearly all of
    the
shops, guesthouses and restaurants
can be found.

Whitby



Yorkshire - UK




Fish and chips and ice cream
; history and culture; vampires and Goths: it’s all on offer at
Whitby
, one of the North East coast’s best-loved seaside towns.




With
Blue Flag beaches and many attractions
, including the world-famous steam North Yorkshire Moors Railway, Whitby is the perfect base for a family holiday. But it doesn’t end
    there. Whitby wallows in history, including fishing, the jet industry (did you know that it’s still the best place in the world to find the gleaming black gemstone so beloved by the Victorians?),
Captain Cook
(who was born nearby, and whose famous ship the Endeavour was Whitby-built) and whaling

Noirmoutier



Vendée - France



The
island of Noirmoutier
is off the Atlantic coast of France in the Vendée department. Parts of the island have been reclaimed from the sea. The island is most notable for the
    Passage du Gois, a paved-over sandbank with a length of 4.5 kilometers, one of the routes that connects the island to the mainland. It is flooded twice a day by the high tide. Every year, a foot
    race – the Foulées du Gois – is held across it, starting at the onset of the high tide.

Blyth



Northumberland - UK




Blyth
is a bustling port town with a rich history and a keen sense of its own identity. There has been a settlement in this part of South East Northumberland since the 12th
    century, but modern Blyth grew rapidly in the first part of the 18th century and reaped the rewards of the rise of coal mining, ship building, modern fishing and the railway and accommodation.
    There is also the
popular South Beach
, a beautiful stretch of
golden sand
, home to the only beach huts in Northumberland, all of which are available for rent.

Nieuwpoort



Flanders - Belgium



The old city centre of
Nieuwpoort
is located about three kilometers from the current coastline. Close to the sea, a new tourist centre has developed. Both parts form one
    contiguous built up area, connected by buildings along the Albert I Laan street and the fishing port. Besides Nieuwpoort proper, two small villages in the
Flemish polders
are
    part of the municipality, Sint-Joris and Ramskapelle.

Wells next the sea



Norfolk - UK




Wells-next-the-Sea
is a port on the North Norfolk coast of England. The town stretches nearly a mile inland. The majority of
shops
and other such businesses are
    now found on
Staithe Street
but up to the 1960s commercial premises were also to be found along High Street which continues south towards St Nicholas's Church. The distinctive
    landmark of the seafront is the
granary
with its overhanging gantry on the quay, started in 1902 and finished in 1904.

Deauville



Normandy - France




Deauville Beach is 2 km of fine sand
, cleaned every morning during the summer. You can choose to isolate yourself, far from the Boardwalk and near the water, on your towel in
    peace and quiet, or opt for a spot under one of its legendary beach umbrellas; or, again,
you can hire a beach cabin
at the Sea-Bathing Establishment. To children, tall masts,
    surmounted with a boat, a house, or a beach ball, help them to find their bearings.
