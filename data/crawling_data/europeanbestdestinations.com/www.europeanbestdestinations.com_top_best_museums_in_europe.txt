    connected them to this object.



This museum makes you think of the value we can give to common objects, how their presence can link you to a romanticized past. This museum is the perfect place to turn the page on a difficult
    breakup, but also to remember that love as strong as it is, is very fragile.

Art Brut Museum



Lausanne



In his search for art freed of cultural and social conditioning,
Jean Dubuffet
enthusiastically turned to creations outside the mainstream, in which he perceived a “completely
    pure artistic operation, raw, brute, and entirely reinvented in all of its phases solely by means of the artist’s own impulses”.



Inaugurated in
Lausanne
in 1976, the
Collection de l’Art Brut
came into being thanks to this French artist’s generous donation of works to the city.
