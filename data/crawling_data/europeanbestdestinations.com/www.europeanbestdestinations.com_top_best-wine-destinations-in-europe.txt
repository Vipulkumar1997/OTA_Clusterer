Alentejo



Portugal



In the Alentejo, there is no haggling over the honour to be paid to Bacchus. The
wines are emblematic of the Region
. There are
more than 250 producers
, with an
    area under cultivation in the order of 22,000 hectares.



Go to
Borba
, if possible in November, when the
Festa da Vinha e do Vinho
(festival of the vine and of wine) takes place. In the Historical Centre there are
    various "tasquinhas” (small taverns/restaurants), some with enormous clay wine-pots, where the wine used to be made, that offer local products. During the festival, they are places on a special
    route visited by the Confraria dos Enófilos do Alentejo (confraternity of wine-lovers). The other is that, in December, you should visit
Cabeção
and Vila de Frades, when the
    tasting of the new wine from the producers is the occasion for a festival. In Vila de Frades, within the framework of the Vitifrades event, there is a competition for local
"pot-made”
    wine
(2nd weekend in December). In this town as much as in two others nearby, Vila Alva and Vila Ruiva,
wine
of this kind
is still produced using methods very
    close to those used by the Romans
.



Finally, you should not fail to visit the Enoteca and the Museu do Vinho in Redondo. Begin with the museum, which has the advantage of being located in the Tourist Office, make an excursion into
    the Serra d’Ossa, enjoy a succulent lunch and spend the afternoon in the town.

Bordeaux



France



You can go on a guided tour of the city on foot, by boat, or by bike,
visit the wine country
, or see the region on a river cruise… Your children will love the boat option, and
    you and your friends will undoubtedly appreciate a
wine tasting
or discovering Bordeaux by night.
Visiting
    Bordeaux
is a real treat, and one that always includes a few surprises.



People usually go to
Saint-Emilion
for its superb wine, but they also discover an extraordinary,
well-preserved historic village




Located one hour by car from Bordeaux, Saint-Emilion is an
adorable medieval town
surrounded by
5,500 hectares of vines
, and was listed as a World Heritage Site
    by UNESCO in 1999!

The Douro Valley



Portugal



The
Douro Valley
could as easily be called the enchanted valley, such is the beauty and magic that its landscapes offer.



Departing from
Porto
, where the river flows into the sea and where the
Douro wines
(table wines and Port
    wine), produced on its hillsides, also end up, there are various ways to get to know this cultural landscape, listed as a
World Heritage Site
: by road, by train, on a cruise boat
    and even by helicopter. None will leave you indifferent.



Following a route between the viewpoints that offer the best vistas, you need to cross the river from north to south and back again. But along the way you can admire breathtaking landscapes over
    the river and
visit vineyards
, towns and villages until you reach Miranda do Douro, the point at which the river
    enters Portugal.



Start at
Vila Nova de Gaia
with a visit to the lodges where Port wine is aged. Here you will get to know this wine a little better, taking the opportunity – how could you do
    otherwise? - to taste the precious nectar. And you can still see the old
rabelo boats
on the river, the vessels that carried the wine from the quintas where it is produced to the
    mouth of river, before the various dams that made the river navigable were built .

Tuscany



Italy




Tuscany
is located in central
Italy
and stretches from the Apennines to the Tyrrhenian Sea. Its landscape, artistic heritage and stand-out cities - first
    among them Florence - make Tuscany an unquestioned protagonist of international tourism. In this region, nature has many different facets, starting from the coast that alternates long and
sandy beaches
, like the Versilia beach, with rocky cliffs and steep headlands. The islands of the Tuscan Archipelago, surrounded by Mediterranean vegetation, a
crystal-clear sea
and rich seabeds, are peerless.



You can admire sceneries of
uncontaminated nature
in the Apuan Alps and in several protected areas, such as the Orbetello Lagoon, home to many species of migrant birds, including
    pink egrets.



However, the most typical sceneries of the region are those that merge the beauty of nature with the millenary work of man. The amazing
Gulf of Baratti
and the sites of
Vetulonia
, Vulci and Pitigliano guard necropoli and vestiges of the Etruscan civilization, while Roselle and Cosa evoke memories from the Roman Age.

Champagne



France



The
Champagne-Ardenne
region is known worldwide for the quality of its
vineyards and cellars
. They cover more than 30,000 hectares and mobilize the talents of
    thousands of farmers. The Champagne-Ardenne region also has a
cultural heritage
waiting to be discovered without moderation.



Champagne Cellars & Vineyards are indeed an original way to discover the richness of the Champagne-Ardenne. Located in villages or in cities, these are highlights of the
wine
    tradition
of the region.  It is possible to visit museums devoted to champagne to flow in farms, enjoy the many guided tours, etc ... With most of the time, a
tasting
at the key!
(tourisme-champagne-ardenne).

Catalonia



Spain



The Catalan Mediterranean climate is especially favourable to growing vines. Catalonia has many hours of sun, even in winter, and enjoys summers with moderate temperatures.  Rainfall is
    concentrated mainly in spring and autumn.

Its great geographical diversity has led Catalonia to have 11 designations of origin (DO) for wine.



In addition there is a Cava Designation of Origin, located mainly in the Penedès region. Thus, Catalonia has many attractions for tourism in its wine regions, such as visits to wineries,
    walks through vineyards, festivals, wine tasting, and food and wine matching classes. Meanwhile, there are increasing numbers of wellness centres focusing on wine therapy treatments, which apply
    the properties of grapes and wine to health and well-being. (Catalunya.com)

Piedmont



Italy




Piedmont
is in Italy's northwest and borders Switzerland and France.

True to the meaning of its name (
foot of the mountain
), Piedmont is a land of mountains. It is surrounded on three sides by the Alps, with the highest peaks and largest glaciers
    in Italy.



The Alps form the background for sweeping, picturesque valleys, e.g. the Val di Susa, Valsesia and Val d'Ossola.

The landscapes of the Langhe and Monferrato are hilly, rather, but just as beautiful, a
succession of cultivated hills and vineyards
that are dotted with small towns and
    castles.



Expanses of water and rice paddies, long rows of poplars and old farmhouses make up the typical scenery of the plains around Novara and Vercelli.



Lake Maggiore is the most sought-after tourist resort, including Stresa and the Borromean Islands, charming as they are with their
ancient villas
surrounded by
beautiful
    lawns and gardens
.

Rhone Valley



France



Between vineyards and mountains,
Beaujolais
unfolds various landscapes. Lovers of old stones should visit the gold stones and
hilltop villages
without forgetting
    Beaujeu and Villefranche, by turns historical capitals.



For gourmets, introduce yourself to the tasting of
ten vintages
, between hillsides and
Saône valley
to the north. Further west, Beaujolais green nature and
    sports, land of pines and mountains is the perfect destination for hiking, swimming & much more
(Copyright Rhonetourisme).

Istria



Croatia



It seems that already the Fenicians and Greeks brought
grapevines
to
Istria
. The native settlers of that time,
    the Histri, successfully cultivated this noble plant and mastered wine production. A proof of this is the legend, according to which the Argonauts, famous Greek seafarers in search of the Golden
    Fleece exclaimed kalavojna, which in a loose translation from Greek means good wine. Where? On the
eastern coast of Istria
, at the place along the Bay of Raša which even today
    bears that name




What has made Istria a synonym for good wine?
Man’s hard work, naturally, but first of all natural features that guarantee high-quality grapes. Those are position, soil, climate
    and relief, since each contributes to a certain extent to the charm of good wine.



There are two dominant types of soil suitable for wine-growing on the Istrian peninsula: red soil (terra rossa) and marly soil or flysh, popularly known as white soil. Experts say that the red
    soil is
ideal for plantations of high-quality red varieties
(yielding strongly structured, full-bodied wines) whereas the flysh is ideal for white varieties, mellow wines that
    retain their freshness along with the fine aroma. Hilly land with gentle slopes, which Istria abounds in, is ideal for wine-growing, especially slopes exposed to the sun, whereas the greater
    oscillation between day and night temperature contributes to the pronounced intensity of the future wine.
