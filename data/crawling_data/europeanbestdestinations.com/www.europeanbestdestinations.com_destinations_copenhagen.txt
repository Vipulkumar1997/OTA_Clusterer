Tourism in Copenhagen

Denmark












Hotels in Copenhagen





































Copenhagen
is a popular city when it comes to hosting
congresses
and conventions; consistently ranking among the world's top ten. Within 20 minutes of the
        city centre, and close to the Øresund Bridge to Sweden, lies Scandinavia's largest showcase. The
Bella Convention
& Exhibition Centre covers 122,000 square metres and has
        a capacity of 20,000 concurrent congress participants. In terms of smaller scale gatherings, most hotels in Copenhagen and Malmo offer ample facilities to cater to larger meetings, events and
        conferences. The family owned hotel chain Arp-Hansen has a Copenhagen Downtown Congress Centre that opened in the fall of 2010. Copenhagen is known for its low crime rate, its general
        efficiency and the high standard of its cultural and entertainment attractions.



Copenhagen is one of
Europe's finest shopping destinations
and has become a first class gourmet experience, with
Michelin star restaurants
, and Noma that was
        voted the worlds' best restaurant in 2010. The city's main shopping area is centred on the longest pedestrian street in Europe, Strøget, and the charming 17th century streets surrounding it.
        Apart from Magasin du Nord, the
biggest department store in Scandinavia
, Copenhagen boasts hundreds of boutiques, restaurants, and cafés. Danish design items such as
Bang and Olufsen
stereos, Royal Copenhagen porcelain and Georg Jensen silverware, are world famous. All have flagship stores in Copenhagen.



Denmark is renowned for the
high standard of living
they offer their inhabitants. In their latest survey into the standard of living in the world's cities, the renowned
        consultancy firm William M. Mercer positioned Copenhagen as
number five in its 'Best Cities' list
. Monocle Magazine placed Copenhagen as nr.1 and as nr.2 on its top twenty
        list of most liveable cities, citing its excellent transport, quality housing, superb shopping, and abundant culture among the reasons they'd like to live here. They could also have mentioned
        that the inflation rate in Denmark has been one of the lowest in Europe for many years and that the economy remains strong. Tourism is an important source of foreign currency and employment.

Top things to do

in Copenhagen









The Little Mermaid


At Langelinje Pier you will find one of Copenhagen's most famous tourist attractions: The sculpture of The Little Mermaid. 23 August 2013 she turned 100 years old. Unveiled on 23 August 1913, The
    Little Mermaid was a gift from Danish brewer Carl Jacobsen to the City of Copenhagen.

The sculpture is made of bronze and granite and was inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale about a mermaid who gives up everything to be united with a young, handsome prince on land.

Nyhavn


Especially during summer Nyhavn is the perfect place to end a long day. Have dinner at one of the cosy restaurants or do like the locals and buy a beer from a nearby store and rest your feet at
    the quayside.

Nyhavn was originally a busy commercial port where ships from all over the world would dock. The area was packed with sailors, ladies of pleasure, pubs and alehouses.

Strøget


Copenhagen's largest shopping area is centered around Strøget in the heart of the city. Strøget is one of Europe's longest pedestrian streets with a wealth of shops, from budget-friendly chains
    to some of the world's most expensive brands. The stretch is 1.1 kilometers long and runs from City Hall Square (Rådhuspladsen) to Kongens Nytorv.

Christiana


Christiania, the famous freetown of Copenhagen, is without a doubt one of Denmark’s most popular tourist attractions.

This controversial area is loved by many, but has been a turning point for strong debate, especially because of the locals relaxed view on hash and some unfortunate violent incidents.

Tivoli Gardens


Tivoli is a must for all children and those who like to play. Tivoli is located just a few minutes walk from City Hall, and with the Copenhagen Central Station as its nearest neighbour it is very
    easy to get to.

In 2013 Tivoli Gardens presented a new 600 m2 Tycho Brahe area with three new rides, one of them being the 4G ride Aquila, live music is on the programme every day, fireworks every Saturday and
    international artists like Sting and Suede plays live on the open air stage.
