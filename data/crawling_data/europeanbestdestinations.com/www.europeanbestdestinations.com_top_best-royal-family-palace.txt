Buckingham Palace



UK




Buckingham Palace
has 775 rooms. These include 19 State rooms, 52 Royal and guest bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices and 78 bathrooms. In measurements, the building is 108
    metres long across the front, 120 metres deep (including the central quadrangle) and 24 metres high.



The Palace is very much a working building and the centrepiece of
Britain's constitutional monarchy
. It houses the offices of those who support the day-to-day activities and
    duties of The
Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh
and their immediate family.



The Palace is also the venue for
great Royal ceremonies
, State Visits and Investitures, all of which are organised by the Royal Household.

The Palacio Real



Spain



The
Palacio Real de
Madrid
(literally: Royal Palace of Madrid) is the official residence of the
Spanish Royal
    Family
at the city of Madrid, but is only used for state ceremonies.
King Juan Carlos
and the Royal Family do not reside in the palace, choosing instead the more modest
Palacio de la Zarzuela
on the outskirts of Madrid.



The palace is owned by the Spanish State and administered by the Patrimonio Nacional, a public agency of the Ministry of the Presidency. The palace is located on Calle de Bailén (Bailén Street),
    in the Western part of downtown Madrid, East of the Manzanares River, and is accessible from the
Ópera metro station
. Several rooms in the palace are regularly open to the public
    except during state functions. An admission fee of €11 is required except for residents of the Iberian Peninsula.

Prince's Palace of Monaco



Monaco



The
Grimaldi's
occupation of their
palace
is unusual because, unlike other European ruling families, the absence of alternative palaces and land shortages have
    resulted in their use of the same residence for more than seven centuries. Thus, their fortunes and politics are directly reflected in the evolution of the palace. Whereas the Romanovs, Bourbons,
    and Habsburgs could, and frequently did, build completely new palaces, the most the Grimaldi could achieve when enjoying good fortune, or desirous of change, was to build a new tower or wing, or,
    as they did more frequently, rebuild an existing part of the palace. Thus, the Prince's Palace reflects the history not only of
Monaco
, but of the family which in 1997 celebrated
    700 years of rule from the same palace.

The Royal Palace of Brussels



Belgium



The
Royal Palace of Belgium
is one of the most beautiful official buildings in the capital,
Brussels
.



Standing opposite the Parliament building on the other side of the Royal Park, the Royal Palace symbolises our system of government, that is to say, a
constitutional monarchy
.



The Palace is the place where His Majesty the King exercises his prerogatives as Head of State. It is at the Palace that the King grants audiences and deals with affairs of state.

The Royal Palace of Stockholm



Sweden



The
Royal Palace of
Stockholm
is His Majesty The King's official residence and is also the setting for most of the
    monarchy's official receptions. The palace is a daily place of work for The King and Queen as well as for the various departments that make up the Royal Court.



This combination of royal residence, workplace and culture-historical monument open year round to visitors makes the Royal Palace of Stockholm
unique amongst Europe's royal
    residences
.



The palace is built in baroque style by the architect Nicodemus Tessin and is formed as a Roman palace. The palace has more than 600 rooms divided between seven floors with a state apartment
    facing the city and smaller living rooms facing the inner courtyard.

Norwegian monarch

Vaduz Castle



Liechstenstein




Vaduz Castle
is the palace and official residence of the
Prince of Liechtenstein
. The castle gave its name to the town of Vaduz, the capital of Liechtenstein,
    which it overlooks from an adjacent hilltop.



The castle underwent a major restoration between 1905 and 1920, then again in the early 1920s during the reign of Prince Johann II, and was expanded during the early 1930s by Prince Franz Joseph
    II. Since 1938, the castle has been the primary residence of Liechtenstein's Princely Family. The castle is not open to the public as the princely family still lives in the castle.

Grand Ducal Palace of Luxembourg
