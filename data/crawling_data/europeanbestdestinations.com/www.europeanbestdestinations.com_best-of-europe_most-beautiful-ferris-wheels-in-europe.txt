No big wheel in the world looks like the Ferris wheel at "The Prater" amusement park located in the heart of the city of
Vienna

(65 meters high) and one of the symbols of the city of Vienna. It was built in 1887,
    eight years later than the Eiffel Tower.




Book your hotel, hostel, apartment in Vienna at the best

    high and one of the symbols of the event. Despite a sulphurous reputation sometimes, it is above all a
traditional Bavarian festival
.



It takes place in
mid September
and ends on the first Sunday of October. It has celebrated the wedding of King Louis I of Bavaria for more than two hundred years now.

    appreciated by artists including the singer Mika, but also by many companies, start-ups and investors.  Marseille is located in Provence. It is
the oldest city in France
since it was founded before Paris, in the 6th century BC by Greek sailors.



Located on  the old port, the
Grande-Roue de Marseille
was previously temporary but was so successfull  that the city authorities decided it would be permanent



Come and discover Marseille and
book your hotel, apartment, guesthouse at the best
    price
and your
activities
. Do not forget to board the Ferris wheel located Quai des belges in Marseille.

Paris


France



There are many big wheels in
Paris
. The first one was built to celebrate the 1900 universal exhibition and dismantled in 1921.



A more recent large wheel has been installed at « les Tuileries fun fair » since 1993 but only in July and August. You can enjoy another big wheel at Christmas time on the « Place de la Concorde
    ». Another big one was inaugurated for the UEFA EURO 2016 but is no longer there.



In short,
there is often a big wheel to see in Paris
especially in July, August or December and certainly near the Place de la Concorde or the Jardin des Tuileries. No doubt that
    with or without a big wheel, Paris will always be Paris.




Book your hotel or apartment in Paris at the best price
and your
activities
such as a cruise on the Seine or a priority accesss to the Eiffel Tower.

Toulouse



France



Most European cities enjoy their Ferris wheels all year round such as London, Vienna, Marseille... but some big wheels are just for specific events such as the Great Wheel of the Oktoberfest but
    also the
Toulouse
Ferris wheel, in summer during the "Toulouse-beach" event.



For the anecdote,
that great-wheel was previously used for the Oktoberfeest in Munich
then bought by Toulouse. But there is more than a Grande Roue to discover in Toulouse, the
    fourth largest commune in France. Come and discover Toulouse, the “Pink city” named for the colour of its buildings.
Book your hotel, apartment, guesthouse in Toulouse at the best
    price
