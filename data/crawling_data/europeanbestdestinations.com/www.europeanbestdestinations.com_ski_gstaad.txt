Gstaad Ski Resort

Switzerland












Hotels in Gstaad



































The combination of the special experiences for which
Gstaad
is so famous is unrivalled. It cannot be found anywhere else and makes Gstaad the
‘last paradise in a
        crazy world’
(quote by actress Julie Andrews, a regular visitor to Gstaad). The prestige value of the brand Gstaad comes top of the list. The
internationally renowned
        brand
which is associated with
luxury and high society
creates a value that resonates far beyond the actual main target group.



Despite a history of tourism dating back more than 100 years in the region, a genuine
Alpine lifestyle
still prevails in the destination of
Gstaad
. For
        instance, it is home to approx. 200 agricultural businesses, 80 alps still in operation and over 7,000 cows.
Local products
, such as cheese and meat as well as craft
        traditions, are very popular. Houses with a chalet architectural style dominate the villages in the region, of which
Gstaad
represents the tourist centre. Some of the cosy
        buildings date from the 15th century.



The destination is divided into
five attractive side valleys
. This fact is what the legend of God’s hand is based on, which is said to have had a rest there during creation.
        The altitude of between 1,000 and 3,000 metres above sea level has a positive effect on personal well-being. Forests, green areas, streams, lakes and the mountain panorama create an
        impressive backdrop.




Gstaad
has an exceptionally
diverse range of winter offers
: these include 220 kilometres of slopes and the only glacier ski area in the Bernese Oberland,
        sunny terraces of cosy
mountain restaurants
and
ski slope
bars attract guest. Specialists enjoy themselves in different snow parks or in the extensive
        freeride and ski touring area. Gstaad is also one of the top cross-country ski areas in the Alps and is considered a tobogganist’s paradise.



Approximately
the half of all visitors travel to Gstaad in the warmer months
. With 300 kilometres of walking tracks – accessible by up to nine mountain railways –, countless
        bike touring and climbing opportunities as well as an idyllic 18-hole golf course, visitors to Gstaad can enjoy
plenty of leisure activities
.



No other holiday region spoils its guests' palates like Gstaad does.
More than 100 restaurants
ranging from a cosy raclette restaurant to a gourmet restaurant are available
        to choose from. Renowned restaurant guides value excellent kitchen arts with outstanding appraisals. The Alpine businesses also offer various accommodation options.



With 12,000 inhabitants, the holiday destination of Gstaad has an offering of
cultural and sporting events
which would be extraordinary even for urban regions. Every year,
        guests can choose from more than 1,000 different events. Some of these events have a top international format, such as the Menuhin Festival, the ATP Suisse Open tennis tournament, the Swatch
        Beach Volleyball Major Series – Gstaad Major, or the Hublot Polo Gold Cup – to name but a few.
