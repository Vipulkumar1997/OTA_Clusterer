Tourism in Pirot

City of
Pirot




The position of this region is conditioned both by a variety of
tourist attraction
and the tourist route of  movement. This region is related to the East-Mediterranean
        direction, which is the route that connects Western and Central Europe with the Middle Estern Mediterranean. The region of Pirot municipality itself is surrounded by the
Balkan
        Mountains
from the north and north-estern side with the highest peak Midzor (2,169 meters).The southern and southwestern edge of the basin is the spurs of Vlach Mountain (1,442
        meters) and Suva Mountain (1,809 meters) while the northwest of Pirot basin is surrounded by the spurs of SvrljigMauntain (1,334 meters).



An
ancient road
, known as Via Militaris (military road) or Caričin drum later,passed trought this area.This city, going troughtdifferent  time periods, was named
        differently. Durin the Roman Empirein the III and IV century, it was named TURRES (tower); among other names are: Pyrgos, Thurib, Momcilov grad and Kale.The name of the fortress in Pirot
        today is Kale.





PIROT’S BRANDS




Pirot’s kilim


In the course of the centuries the most significant branch of manufactoring industry was kilim production as an economic activity. It was the original carpet- weaving production linked to the
        urban locality which was done by the poor women-weavers. The population was oriented towards cattle-raising as its main occupation. Because of that, large quantities of excellent wool made
        Pirot a trade hearth of the region. That is how all the conditions for the production of the Pirots’kilim were met: the sheep from Staraplanina ranges yiealded large quantities of excellent
        wool which was processed and dyed here, the weaving- technique was well-advanced, and the trading activity was highly developed.




Pirot's pottery


Pirot was the centre of the pottery craftswork of Serbia. In the middle of the 19th century there were even 40 pottery workshops in Pirot. Yet at the end of the 20th century the significance
        of this craft was declining which led to the reduction of the number of potters’ shops to only 32. Since the towns in the north and west of Serbia kept growing rapidly after the liberation
        from the Turks a number of potters from this area left Pirot having gone northward and westward in search of employment and better earnings.




Peglana - Flattened Saussage




This specific brand of saussage is produced using only the finest meat mixed with spices. Its origins are assumed to date back to the age of the Ottoman Empire. The recipe involves carefully
        picked slices of chevon, lamb and veal; types generally considered to contain less fat. Most consider donkey meat to be the finest choice. Pork meat is strictly avoided because of two
        reasons: the first one is that it spoils easily, and the second is linked to its historical background dating to the Ottoman Empire era.



All tendons, fat and other unwanted components are sepparated from the meat, which is then minced and mixed with various spices. Flattened saussage has to contain chilli pepper, at least in
        subtle traces, because its magic lies in that particular taste. After being stuffed, the saussage's ends are tied, resembling a horseshoe and it is left outside to dry out on the draft.



The preffered temperature for drying the product is between -5 and 5 °C (23 – 41F), with no humidity or frostbite. That is why the ideal time of the year for making the flattened sausage is
        somewhere between the end of November and the end of December. During the time required for it to dry, the sausages are flattened every two or three days (usually with a glass bottle), which
        is where they originally got their name from. After this process the sausages assume the form and shape of a horseshoe. This process is also the key to extracting the water from the product,
        ensuring its longevity.



Without preservatives, additives and artificial colors, without any thermic processing or exposure to smoke, “Peglanakobasica” is an eco-friendly, organic product.




Kackaval – famous cheese in Pirot




Prestigious price EDEN (European Destinations of  Exellence) given to Pirot in 2015 was very encouraging for every businessman or business woman who tries to emprove the image of serbian
        tourism, especially the tourism in Pirot. Pirot was the winner on the national contest, which had a purpose to reward less developed destinations with specific gastoronomy. There were
        presented local products and brands, such as mentioned flattened saussage, traditional dishes from Stara planina, exellent Pirot’s barbecue...Emphasis was on Pirots’ hard cheese Kackaval, as
        a worldly famous brand.



Apart from the Kilim (a unique, hand-made rug), the symbol and the hallmark of this town on the coast of the river Nišava is “Kačkavalj,” a dairy product passed onto the villagers of the
        Visok area by the Sarakatsani (or Karakatsani), a group of transhumant shepherds that inhabited the mountain of “Staraplanina” from the 17th untill the 19th century. These shepherds are
        assumed to have originated from Greece or the Aromanian (or Cincar) people.
