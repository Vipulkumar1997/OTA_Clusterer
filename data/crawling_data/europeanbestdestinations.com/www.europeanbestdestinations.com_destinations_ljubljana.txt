Tourism in Ljubljana

Slovenia












Hotels in Ljubljana





































What is it that sets
Ljubljana
apart from other cities and capitals that makes it a great place to visit and discover? A vibrant city of delights characterized by its unique
historical heritage, cultural creativity, friendliness and relaxed atmosphere
.



Due to its compact size, Ljubljana is a walking and environmentally friendly city, dotted with many green spaces. Nestled on a hill above the Old Town, the medieval Ljubljana Castle looks
        like a mighty guardian protecting the city at its foot.



Ljubljana has one of the best-preserved
Baroque quarters
in Central Europe that blends harmoniously with the younger
Art Nouveau
buildings. And, in the first
        half of the 20th century, it was blessed with the talent of world known architect Jože Plečnik, who created the cosmopolitan image of his native city with his eclectic architecture.



The young and vibrant spirit of the
Slovenian capital
often stuns first-time visitors. Lean back & relax is also a motto of our city – having a refreshment in one of the
        numerous cafes along the riverbanks or in the Old Town is a good way to observe and feel the pulse of our everyday life. As a contrast to our Germanic attitude in the business sphere, this is
        where a
Mediterranean-style dolce vita
is most reflected. The picturesque open market, a must-see spot, provides many fresh ingredients which are the basis for culinary
        delights served in the plentiful downtown restaurants and inns, and to appreciate even more the local gastronomy, indulge in the discovery of
excellent Slovenian wines or
        beers
.



Just to round up the picture, Ljubljana displays a remarkable agenda of cultural events, more than 10.000 annually - including 14 international festivals and many other traditional happenings
        all year round. Especially in the warmer months, a host of free-of-charge events liven up the public spaces in the downtown area. All this helps in creating a special atmosphere in the
        Slovenian capital. Even at first glance, Ljubljana seems pleasant and familiar to visitors, but at the same time interesting and different.

Ljubljana Castle


Ljubljana Castle is the city's most prominent sight, offering some of the most beautiful views of Ljubljana. The castle premises house several museum exhibitions and presentations, such as
    Slovenian History, The Prison and Virtual Castle, among others. The castle, accessible by funicular railway, also houses two restaurants, Gostilna na Gradu and Strelec.

Dragon Bridge


The Dragon Bridge (Zmajski most) stands by the market place, and was built in 1901 on the site of the former wooden “Butcher’s Bridge” to mark the fortieth anniversary of the accession to the
    throne of Emperor Franz Josef. The bridge is a concrete and iron structure and was among the first of this type in Europe. Otto Wagner’s pupil, Jurij Zaninovich, decorated it - among other - with
    four dragons’ statues, hence its name.

Central Market


Apart from fruits, vegetables, spices and herbs, Ljubljana's picturesque central open-air market, designed by the famous architect Jože Plečnik, offers almost all kinds of food, including a
    variety of Slovenian specialities such as prosciutto and the potica cake.

City Museum of Ljubljana - MGML


Visitors to the City Museum of Ljubljana can admire the Renaissance architectural features of the palatial museum building, take a walk along a 1st century Roman road or meet the Underwater Troll
    in the "Search.for.Yourself" exhibition room. The Museum keeps the world's oldest wooden wheel with an axel, dated 3500 BC.









©Visit Ljubljana









The Tivoli Park


The Tivoli Park is Ljubljana's largest and most beautiful park, stretching right into the city centre. It was designed in 1813 by the French engineer Jean Blanchard and created by joining
    together the parks which had surrounded Podturn and Cekin Mansions. The park, covering an area of approximately five square kilometres, is crossed by three grand horse chestnut tree-lined walks
    and landscaped with ornamental flower beds, interesting trees and numerous statues and fountains.
