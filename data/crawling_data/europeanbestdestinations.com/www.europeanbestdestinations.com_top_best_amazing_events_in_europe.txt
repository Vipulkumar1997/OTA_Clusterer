world-famous event
", and indeed, in
    2013, a 27 year old American and a 39 year old Japanese each won one of the four races. The event takes its name from the hill on which it occurs.




The event is traditional. In recent years, it has been managed in a quasi-official manner, but since 2010 the event has taken place spontaneously without any management.

_____________






Krampus
is celebrated on
Krampusnacht
, which takes place on the eve of St. Nicholas’ Day. In
Austria

Haro wine festival

_____________





In the sixth century the rocks around the mountain where the fight is held was home to a hermit monk, who later became the patron saint of the town of
Haro
.




These mountains became a pilgrimage spot, especially on this special religious day, and after mass the pilgrims would gather for a feast, which would invariably get a little rowdy – to the point
    that a
wine fight
would break out.

Every year on the 29th of June, thousands of locals and a handful of lucky tourists climb a mountain in La Rioja, Spain, and throw wine on each other.

Hogmanay

_____________






Hogmanay
is what the Scots call
New Year's Eve
- 31 December - and the arrival of the new year is always celebrated in style across the country.



In the big cities, you'll find large-scale open air concerts, street parties and spectacular fireworks welcoming 'the bells' (when the clocks chime midnight). Elsewhere, the celebrations are all
    about community and local events such as dinner dances, ceildhs or just parties held in neighbours' houses which get visited in turn as 'first footers' go from house to house to be the first to
    wish everyone a good new year.

The
World Santa Claus Congress
has taken place in the
Dyrehavsbakken amusement park
(usually shortened to Bakken) north of
Copenhagen
in
Denmark
since 1957. Every summer, Bakken is invaded by Santas from around the world who gather to spread good Christmas cheer, have fun and socialise with their peers.
