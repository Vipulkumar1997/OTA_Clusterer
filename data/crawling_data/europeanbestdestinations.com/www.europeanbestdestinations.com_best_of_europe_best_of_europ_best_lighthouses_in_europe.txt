The Maiden's Tower



Istanbul - Turkey



The
Maiden's Tower
(Turkish:
Kız Kulesi
), also known as
Leander's Tower
(Tower of Leandros) since the medieval Byzantine period, is a tower
    lying on a small islet located at the southern entrance of the Bosphorus strait 200 m (220 yd) from the coast of Üsküdar in
Istanbul
, Turkey.



There are many legends about the construction of the tower and its location. According to the most popular
Turkish legend
, an emperor had a much beloved daughter and one day, an
    oracle prophesied that she would be killed by a venomous snake on her 18th birthday. The emperor, in an effort to thwart his daughter's early demise by placing her away from land so as to keep
    her away from any snakes, had the tower built in the middle of the Bosphorus to protect his daughter until her 18th birthday. The princess was placed in the tower, where she was frequently
    visited only by her father.



On the 18th birthday of the princess, the emperor brought her a basket of exotic sumptuous fruits as a birthday gift, delighted that he was able to prevent the prophecy. Upon reaching into the
    basket, however, an asp that had been hiding among the fruit bit the young princess and she died in her father's arms, just as the oracle had predicted. Hence the name Maiden's Tower.

Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse



Hjorring - Denmark




Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse
is located on the coast of the North Sea in Rubjerg, in the Jutland municipality of Hjørring in northern
Denmark
. It was first lit on
    December 27, 1900.



Both shifting sands and coastal erosion are a serious problem in the area. The coast is eroded on average 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) a year, which can be seen most clearly at the nearby Mårup Church.



The lighthouse ceased operating on August 1, 1968. For a number of years, the buildings were used as a museum and coffee shop, but continually shifting sands caused them to be abandoned in 2002.
    By 2009, the small buildings were severely damaged by the pressure of the sand and were later removed. It is expected that
the tower will fall into the sea by 2023
.

The Tower of Hercules



A Coruña - Spain



The
Tower of Hercules
is the only
Roman lighthouse
still functioning today that continues to exhibit the same functions as when it was founded, on the one hand
    as maritime sign and on the other hand assisting navigation for the ships that were and are crossing the Atlantic corridor.



In all likelihood it was constructed in the second half of the 1st century or the beginning of the 2nd century A.D. by the Roman Empire, in the finis terrae of the, until then, known world, to
    accompany the ships that were bordering at the end of the Empire furthest to the West.



It is located in the NW of the Iberian Peninsula, in the region of Galicia, in the province of
A Coruña
and in the city of A Coruña.

and the Sea, are among this tour as well.

Fastnet Rock



Ireland




Fastnet Rock
is a small clay-slate islet with quartz veins. It rises to about 30 metres (98 ft) above low water mark and is separated from the much smaller southern Little
    Fastnet by a 10 metres (33 ft) wide channel.



Fastnet Rock is used as the midpoint of one of the world's classic offshore yachting races, the Fastnet Race, a 1,126 kilometres (700 mi) round trip from Cowes on the Isle of Wight, round the
    rock and back to Plymouth. It is also sometimes used as a mark for yacht races from local sailing centres such as Schull and Baltimore.

Phare Saint-Mathieu



Plougonvelin - France



The
Saint-Mathieu lighthouse
is a lighthouse located on Pointe Saint-Mathieu in
Plougonvelin
, around
Brest
in Finistère. The lighthouse is open
    to the public.



The promontory of Saint-Mathieu hosts the ruins of an
abbey
, a
sémpahore
, and a
lighthouse
. This bizarre juxtaposition (some suggestions were
    made to restore the abbey, while deconstructing the lighthouse and rebuilding it elsewhere) is explained by the connections these structures shared throughout
Saint-Mathieu
’s
    history.

Low lighthouse
is one of three lighthouses in

Brittany
, opposite the
    village of Lilia. It is in the commune of

, in the département of Finistère. It is the location of the

The Genoa Lighthouse



Genoa - Italy



The
Lighthouse of Genoa
, is the main lighthouse for the city's port. Besides being an important aid to night navigation in the vicinity, the tower serves as a symbol for the
City of Genoa
, and is one of the oldest standing structures of its kind in the world. It is built on the hill of San Benigno at some little distance from the Sampierdarena
    neighborhood. At 249 feet (76 m) it is the
world's second tallest "traditional lighthouse"
built of masonry. It is constructed in two square portions, each one capped by a
    terrace; the whole structure is crowned by a lantern from which the light is shone.

The Gorliz Lighthouse



Bilbao - Spain



The
Gorliz Lighthouse
is located in
Cape Billano
, facing the island. It was built in 1990 on the cliffs offering an excellent view of the coast. Over there we
    can see the remains of a cannon that was served to defend the bay.

Phare du Petit Minou



Brest - France



The
Phare du Petit Minou
is a lighthouse in the roadstead of
Brest
, standing in front of the Fort du Petit Minou, in the commune of Plouzané. By aligning it with
    the phare du Portzic, it shows the safe route to follow for ships to enter the roadstead. It also has a red signal that indicates a dangerous sector around the plateau of les Fillettes (literally
    the girls), one of the submerged rocks in the goulet of Brest — sailors remember this by using the mnemonic "the Minou blushes when he covers les Fillettes".
