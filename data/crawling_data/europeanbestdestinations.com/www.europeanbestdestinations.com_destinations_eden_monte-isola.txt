Monte Isola: a special place where rediscover the pleasures of life.




Monte Isola
is a
green mountain emerging at the centre of Iseo Lake
. In every season special, wonderful and suggestive landscape makes this island of almost
        5 km2 (450 hectares) a real Italian pearl. In the island there are eleven villages; the connections with the Brescian shore of the lake take place between Sulzano - Peschiera and Sale M. -
        Carzano.




Cars are banned
and only the 1,800 inhabitants are allowed to drive motorcycles. Visitors can use the small bus or rent bikes, so as to start the discovery by cycling along
        the 9.4 km of the perimeter. It is possible to explore by foot the bridleways and the footpaths leading to the top of the island where the sanctuary stands. This is an extremely interesting
        point of view thanks to the
extraordinary panorama
and the artistic beauty inside its little church dedicated to Mary.



The older and higher hemlets in the island are characterized by an age-old peasant culture. The Town Hall is in Siviano, the most populated village and the island’s capital. It’s reachable by
        boat, descending in Porto of Siviano where the Museum of the Net is. Peschiera is an interesting fishing village deeply connected with water and where there are the tourist office and the
        Fishing Museum. Furthermore, visitors can see the islets of San Paolo and Loreto, Menzino with its fortress, Carzano  where takes  place every five years the feast of the Holy
        Cross, renowned for  the
thousands of hand-made paper flowers
that fill its alleys.



Monte Isola has always been a special place for the artisan production of boats and nets and has gained the title of “
Presidio Slow Food
” thanks to the millenary tradition
        linked with the conservation of the “lake sardine”. Other specialties are extra virgin olive oil and salami.
