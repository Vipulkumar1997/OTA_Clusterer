Ski, Snowboard, Parks and Nature


Located near Sierre in the heart of the swiss Alps, Crans-Montana ski area offers exceptional views over the Alps and the Rhone Valley. The ski resort welcomes you to enjoy over 140km of pistes
    and many sunny days. For over 15 years, the Crans-Montana Snowpark has welcomed the best Swiss and international riders on its 100,000 m2 snowpark which, spread over 2 sites, also offers modules
    for beginners.



It has been judged the best of its kind in western Switzerland as well as the finest in the Alps. The main snowpark is aimed at confirmed and expert freestylers and consists of rails and boxes,
    jumps, an airbag and, above all, the single olympic half-pipe in French Switzerland with 7m-high walls. The only one of its kind in Valais, the half-pipe is frequented by countless serious riders
    as they prepare for various competitions. The second zone, the Easy Snowpark, situated close to Chetzeron, is dedicated to novice freestyle skiers and snowboarders.

Winter & Summer Golf


Four courses, one prestigious club, an indoor centre open year round and host to the OMEGA European Masters, this is what’s on offer to golfers from all over the world on the Crans-Montana
    plateau overlooking the Rhône Valley. Over a century of tradition has established the worldwide reputation of the destination, with its famous courses:  the Severiano Ballesteros (18 hole)
    and the Jack Nicklaus (9 holes).



In winter, the golf course is covered by a beautiful white coat of snow and offers lots of activities for all tastes. Snow Island, Bibi’s home quarters, invites families to take part in different
    activities, games and entertainment. This is also where beginners can try skiing thanks to the very gentle slope and magic carpet which will take them back to the top of the run, or you can
    hurtle down the snowtubing piste at top speed.

Crans-Montana has always had close links with cycling over the years. In 1984, it welcomed a stage of the Tour de France and since then, the Tour de Suisse and the Tour de Romandie have come here
    regularly. With several Swiss Bike Hotels and key events such as UNICEF’s Cycling for Children, the region could not be better suited to cycling enthusiasts. Steve Morabito himself, the
    professional cyclist is responsible for the design of several routes around Crans-Montana. Furthermore, the awesome Bikepark opened in 2001 and has quality descents for all levels.
