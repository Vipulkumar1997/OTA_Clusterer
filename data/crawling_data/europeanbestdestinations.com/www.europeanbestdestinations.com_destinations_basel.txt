Tourism in Basel

Switzerland












Hotels in Basel




































Basel is situated in the heart of Europe, bordering Germany and France. A combination of authentic Swiss quality and a multicultural population make this city unmistakably cosmopolitan and
        innovative.



These characteristics are also borne out in Basel’s many spectacular buildings designed by renowned architects. They present a fascinating contrast to the historic and picturesque Old Town
        and round out the image of this modern city. As you explore, you can view architectural masterpieces by luminaries such as Herzog & de Meuron, Mario Botta and Frank O. Gehry.



Due to its density of museums, Basel is further considered as the cultural capital of Switzerland. The city boasts 40 museums on a relatively small area. With various subjects and
        world-renowned special exhibitions, there is something for every taste. Furthermore, Basel is the home of Art Basel, the most important contemporary art fair in the world.



This year, Basel Tourism came up with something special to make a younger audience aware of Basel and its sights. Since the “Pokémon Go” mobile game was launched, thousands of people in Basel
        have used the app to hunt the little fantasy creatures. In collaboration with the agency Fadeout, Basel Tourism has now turned the tables and sent four Pikachus out to hunt people in Basel's
        city centre with “Pokémon Go – The Revenge”. This is a low-budget production, and no money was required for its dissemination. The viral transmission via social media is thus all the more
        gratifying: the video has been viewed around 150 million times in all. At the same time, a landing page was created on the Basel Tourism website that presents the most attractive tourist
        locations for Pokémon players as well as tips for a stay in Basel.



The city looks forward to welcoming many additional visitors!

Top things to do

in Basel





Art & Culture


Basel is widely acknowledged as Switzerland's city of culture and for good reason, with visitors confronted by art at every turn - whether wandering through the streets of the Old Town or
    visiting one of the city's nearly forty museums. With their themed collections, they have something for every taste and many have reputations that stretch far beyond the Swiss border. And then
    there are the countless galleries scattered liberally throughout the city.



There are also many high-class cultural events and of course we should not forget that the city also has a lively theatre and music scene.

Tradition and the Modern


Take a trip through the ages! In scarcely any other cityscape in the world are historic buildings from the 15th century so harmoniously blended with modern buildings designed by
    internationally-renowned contemporary architects.



Basel's Old Town is one of the prettiest and most intact in the whole of Europe. However, the city is also open to the new. In the last decades the city has grown into a veritable Mecca for
    lovers of architecture. Today the Basel region contains buildings designed by no fewer than twelve Pritzker Prize-winning architect.

The Rhine is Life


The Rhine is the true lifeblood of Basel and the city's enduring landmark. As one of the most important trading routes, it has had a huge influence on the development of the city.



Today it contributes greatly to the quality of life the city offers its inhabitants and visitors alike. In the summer months Basel's inhabitants, students and businessmen flock to the river's
    banks to sunbathe, promenade and generally let their cares melt away in the sunshine. It is often said that the Mediterranean seems very close to the city, and If you mix with Basel's inhabitants
    you will soon discover why.

Dining & Shopping


The city's unique location on the border of three neighbouring countries has had a profound influence on its cuisine. But it is not only in the area of food where the inhabitants of Basel can
    enjoy the finer things in life - the city also has a wealth of shopping opportunities on offer!



For lovers of fine wining and dining the city has long since lost its status as a hidden gem. The city has more than 20 restaurants with entries in either the Gault Milau or Michelin guides. The
    variety is also evident when it comes to shopping, with luxurious labels and shops selling specialities.

Activities & Excursions


Basel is lucky to have nice neighbours - not only because of the feeling of affinity that crosses international borders, but also because of the beautiful countryside and delicious culinary
    culture surrounding the city. But you do not have to leave Basel to discover exciting excursion destinations.



The views from the top of the Jura mountains, the Black Forest or the Vosges mountains - just a taste of what the Basel region has to offer. A short trip into the countryside will reveal a
    picturesque landscape rich in diversity.
