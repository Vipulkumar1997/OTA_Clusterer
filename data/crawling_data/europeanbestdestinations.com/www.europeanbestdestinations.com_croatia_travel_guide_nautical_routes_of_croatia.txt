Croatia gives you

the best nautical routes in the Adriatic Sea














Croatia
gives you
Crystal clear water
, sandy and pebbly beaches, enchanting
small coastal towns
and historical sights – the Croatian coast is
    known for its
natural beauty
, excellent nautical infrastructure and safe harbours and ports. Sea lovers can enjoy Croatia’s mild and pleasant
Mediterranean
    climate
, its culinary specialties and its rich culture. Croatia is the perfect destination for a
boating summer vacation
.


So much to see but so little time - a nautical trip along the
Croatian coast
, its islands and islets gives you chance to be spontaneous and flexible. A
boating
    trip
allows you to see many beautiful places in just one visit and is ideal for family holidays, a
romantic voyage
with your partner, adventurous getaways or for those
    wanting to just let loose.



For the last three decades, Croatia has been known as a destination that offers boaters with outstanding infrastructure. On the coast, there are
over sixty marinas
, as well as
    the so-called seasonal marinas of the remote islands and docks in coves, which all include facilities for sailors. You can find shelter in a safe harbour almost anywhere along the coast and
    easily hire a fitting vessel if you do not have your own – with a crew also included.

Land ahoy in Istria



Istria
is known for its picturesque towns and the numerous
wine and olive oil roads
. The region has many
    landing stages, such as Kanegra in the north, Cape Kamenjak located south of the west coast, or the beautiful cove of Tunarica and cliffs of Brseč in the east.




Rovinj
is the perfect place to start your nautical trip. The Rovinj ACI marina is located in the south eastern part of the harbour, which is fully protected from the wind by the
    little island of Sveta Katarina. From this charming town and its mediaeval architecture, you can visit
Brijuni archipelago
, which is the only national park in Istria and is just
    twelve nautical miles away from Rovinj. You can easily access Veli Brijun with its large berths for yachts. Don’t worry if you don’t have your own boat as you can simply travel on a tourist boat
    which starts from Fažana near Pula. From Mali Brijun why not go for a walk around the splendid bays, hire a bicycle and visit some of the many local archaeological sites, the safari park or even
    try a game of golf.



A hidden attraction of the Istrian archipelago are the two large underwater caves, not far from Cape Kamenjak. Due to the strong winds in the region anchoring is not recommended, so it is best to
    go to the cove of Debeljak, and head to the cave by foot.























Visit the historical sites of Pula


While you are there,
Pula
it is definitely worth a visit. The region has excellently preserved ancient Roman buildings, including
one of the
    most famous first century amphitheatre
, Arena, which is the
sixth largest in the world
. It is one of the best-preserved amphitheatres from Antiquity and today it is used
    during the summer for film festivals and various cultural events.



There are
several marinas
to tie up your boat in Pula, even in the old town harbour right next to the city centre.

Ready about in Kvarner


From Istria you can easily reach the region of
Kvarner
. From Opatija in the north to Karlobag in the south there are excellent marinas on the coast and surrounding islands. One
    of the most beautiful islands there is
Krk
, especially the south, which is
full of life and vegetation
.















©iascic









Cres & Rab Islands


A powerful northerly wind leaves the north of
Krk

and some other islands in this
    region almost deserted, although its ideal for windsurfers who greatly enjoy it. From the south coast of Krk boat lovers can easily sail to Rab, visiting its mediaeval town, or along to
Cres
, which offers a peaceful and quiet area to spend time in nature.

Next stop : Losinj


The next stop is
Lošinj
with its harbour
Mali Lošinj
. The region has beautiful coves to swim in and visitors can even get a glimpse at the
dolphins
which swim nearby. All islands of this region cater to their own unique lifestyle and provide sailors with many coves where anchoring is safe.



Looking for an adventure? An unusual nautical route is the one to two islands,
Grgur
and
Goli Otok
, which for a long time served as prisons. Grgur is located
    between Rab, Krk, Prvić and Goli Otok, and can be reached by boat from the south-west side of Krk and mooring in the cove of Sveti Grgur, on the north-west side of the island. A few hours’
    sailing away from Grgur is Goli Otok, which holds the remains of the
once most famous prison in Europe
. During the summer months you can anchor in the cove of Vela Draga and also
    tour the island with the ‘Goli Express’, a small tourist train which takes you to the prison buildings and facilities scattered across the island.

Eno-gastronomic offering


The Kvarner region is famous for its specific eno-gastronomic offering. While visiting this part of Croatia you shouldn’t miss the taste of the famous Žlahtina wine from Vrbnik and the well-known
    Kvarner scampi.













©xbrchx









Full speed ahead to Dalmatia (Split)


A highlight of the
Croatian Adriatic
is the region around
Split
. You can sail between the islands of
    Drvenik Veli and Mali, Šolta, Brač, Hvar, Šćedro, Vis and Biševo. Every island has its own characteristics, like their innate, linguistic, oenological and cultural aspects. This
Central
    Dalmatian archipelago
is the centre of entertainment and quality cuisine providing boaters with beautiful docks.

















©Xenia Chowaniec









The sunny island of Hvar


A “must visit” is the sunny
island of Hvar
. The beautiful harbour is the centre of its nautical events, however, there are also other mooring sites in front of
Hvar
and an ACI marina on the island of Sv. Klement. The nightlife there is for everyone.













©xbrchx









Island of Vis


On the
Island of Vis
you’ll find caves such as Modra Špilja (Blue Grotto) on the island of Biševo, Medviđa Špilja, Stiniva Cove and Zelena Špilja (Green Grotto) on Ravnik island,
    which have turquoise water and a rich history to offer.



The city
Split
has a rich choice of
cultural activities and busy nightlife
whilst also providing visitors
    with a historic centre with the palace of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, which was declared a world heritage by UNESCO, as it is a significant monument of Late Antiquity architecture.
