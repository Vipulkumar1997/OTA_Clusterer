and we have selected for you
the most beautiful ones in Europe
.

The 25th of April Bridge



Lisbon - Portugal




The 25 de Abril Bridge
(Ponte 25 de Abril "
25th of April Bridge
") is a suspension bridge connecting the city of
Lisbon
, capital of
Portugal
, to the municipality of Almada on the left (south) bank of the Tejo river. It was inaugurated on August
    6, 1966 and a train platform was added in 1999.



Because it is a suspension bridge and has similar coloring, it is often compared to the
Golden Gate Bridge
in
San Francisco
, USA. In fact, it was built by
    the same company (American Bridge Company) that constructed the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and not the Golden Gate, also explaining its similarity in design. With a total length of 2,277 m,
    it is the
23rd largest suspension bridge in the world
.  Until 1974, the bridge was named Salazar Bridge (Ponte Salazar). The name "25 de Abril" commemorates the
Carnation Revolution.

The Ponte Vecchio



Florence - Italy



The
Ponte Vecchio
("
Old Bridge
") is a Medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno River, in
Florence
, Italy, noted for still having shops built along it, as was once common. Butchers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewelers, art
    dealers and souvenir sellers. The Ponte Vecchio's two neighbouring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Ponte alle Grazie.

The Bastei Bridge



Lohmen - Germany



The
Bastei
is a rock formation towering 194 metres above the Elbe River in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains of
Germany
. Reaching a height of 305 metres above sea
    level, the jagged rocks of the Bastei were formed by water erosion over one million years ago. They are situated near Rathen, not far from Pirna southeast of the city of Dresden and are the major
    landmark of the
Saxon Switzerland National Park
.



The Bastei has been a tourist attraction for over 200 years. In 1824, a wooden bridge was constructed to link several rocks for the visitors. This bridge was replaced in 1851 by the present
Bastei Bridge
made of sandstone.

The Luis 1 Bridge



Porto - Portugal



This truly is
Porto
’s emblem. We recommend that you take a boat trip under this amazing bridge or take a walk to appreciate
    this grand feat of engineering. Take the lower deck to reach Vila Nova de Gaia and its cellars and the upper deck for a perfect view of the town.



Designed by the engineer
Teófilo Seyrig
, yes you guessed it, a disciple of Eiffel of the
Eiffel tower
, was inaugurated in 1886 and comprises 2 overlapping iron
    decks. It is 395 meters long and 8 meters wide, and its arch is still considered to be the
world's biggest one in forged iron
. Nowadays the upper deck is used by the Metro of
    Porto, connecting the area of Porto's Cathedral to the Garden of Morro and to the Avenida da República in Vila Nova de Gaia.

The
Millau Viaduct
is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the valley of the River Tarn near Millau in southern France.



Designed by the French structural engineer Michel Virlogeux and British architect Norman Foster,
it is the tallest bridge in the world
with one mast's summit at 343.0 metres
    (1,125 ft) above the base of the structure. It is
the 12th highest bridge deck in the world
, being 270 metres (890 ft) between the road deck and the ground below. Millau Viaduct
    is part of the A75-A71 autoroute axis from Paris to Montpellier. Construction cost was approximately €400 million. It was formally inaugurated on 14 December 2004, and opened to traffic on 16
    December. The bridge has been consistently ranked as
one of the great engineering achievements of all time
.

The Puente Nuevo Bridge



Ronda - Spain



The
New Bridge
is, together with the bullring of the Royal Cavalry Order of
Ronda
, symbol and soul of the city.



There were two great ideas in order to built this bridge. The first of them was thought in 1735, being king Philip V, consisting of a 35 metres diameter arch, and whose works finished only 8
    months later.

The Old Bridge



Mostar - Bosnia and Herzegovina




Stari Most
(English: Old Bridge) is a reconstruction of a 16th-century
Ottoman bridge
in the city of
Mostar
in
Bosnia and
    Herzegovina
that crosses the river Neretva and connects two parts of the city. The Old Bridge stood for 427 years, until it was destroyed on 9 November 1993 by Croat forces during the
    Croat–Bosniak War. Subsequently, a project was set in motion to reconstruct it, and the rebuilt bridge opened on 23 July 2004.



One of the country's most recognizable landmarks, it is also considered one of the most exemplary pieces of Islamic architecture in the Balkans and was designed by Mimar Hayruddin

Pont de Rohan Bridge



Finistere - France



There are precious few inhabited bridges in the world, and they are constructions unlike any other. The
Pont De Rohan in Landerneau
(France), with its shops, restaurants and
    homes, was one of the last inhabited bridges to be built in Europe, having celebrated its 500th birthday in 2010.



You can find traces of a bridge over the Elorn that connected the lands of Léon and Cornouaille way back in the 12th century. The stone bridge that can be seen today dates from 1510 and was built
    on the orders of the Viscount de Rohan. Its impressive pillars and 6 arches support buildings that have housed a succession of generations including millers and milliners, drapers and jewellers,
    saddlers and more…

The Garabit Viaduct



Cantal - France



By the end of the 1870s
Eiffel & Cie
, the company formed by
Gustave Eiffel
in partnership with
Theophile Seyrig
, had an established position
    among the leading French engineering companies. Between 1875 and 1877 the company had built
the Maria
    Pia Bridge over the Douro
at Porto, and when it was proposed to construct a railway between Marvejols and Neussargues in the Cantal department the work of constructing a viaduct to
    cross the River Truyère was given to Eiffel without the usual process of competitive tendering at the recommendation of the engineers of the state Highways Department since the technical problems
    involved were similar to those of the Maria Pia Bridge; indeed, it was Eiffel & Cie's success with this project that had led to the proposal for a
viaduct at Garabit
.

The Vasco da Gama Bridge



Lisbon - Portugal




The Vasco da Gama Bridge
is a cable-stayed bridge flanked by viaducts and rangeviews that spans the Tagus River in Parque das Nações in
Lisbon
, capital of
Portugal
. It is
the longest bridge in Europe
(including viaducts), with a total length of 17.2 km (10.7 mi).



Construction began on February 1995; the bridge was opened to traffic on 29 March 1998, just in time for
Expo 98
, the World's Fair that celebrated the 500th anniversary of the
    discovery by Vasco da Gama of the sea route from Europe to India.

The Pont du Gard Bridge



Gard - France



The
Pont du Gard
is an ancient Roman aqueduct bridge that crosses the Gardon River in Vers-Pont-du-Gard near Remoulins, in the Gard département of southern France. It is part of
    the
Nîmes aqueduct
, a 50 km-long (31 mi) structure built by the Romans to carry water from a spring at Uzès to the Roman colony of Nemausus (Nîmes). Because the terrain between
    the two points is hilly, the aqueduct – built mostly underground – took a long, winding route that crossed the gorge of the Gardon, requiring the construction of an aqueduct bridge. Built in the
    1st century AD, the Pont du Gard is the highest of all Roman aqueduct bridges and is, with the Aqueduct of Segovia, one of the best preserved. It was added to
UNESCO's list of World
    Heritage Sites
in 1985 because of its historical importance.
