Bockenheimer Warte station



Frankfurt - Germany



Planning began in the 1950s to replace the overburdened streetcars with a more robust public transit system. The political parties put forward plans for a full U-Bahn, a streetcar system with an
    underground section downtown, and an elevated railway. Eventually politics, in the form of the 1964 municipal election, resolved the issue in favor of the
U-Bahn
project that
    began as a light rail/Stadtbahn network using tunnels in
Frankfurt's city
core, but which in the future would be
    transformed into a fully rapid transit U-Bahn network.
