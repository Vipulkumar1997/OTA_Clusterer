The
Skicircus Saalbach Hinterglemm Leogang Fieberbrunn

, with an extensive range of exciting activities,
        international flair and breath-taking natural landscapes, it is

        runs for the more advanced. With 70 lifts, more than 60 cosy mountain huts, numerous Snowparks, Freeride Parks, flood-lit pistes and toboggan runs, the region is one of the most diverse ski
        areas in Austria. SkiMovie-, Speed and Race tracks, Snow Trails and Snowtubing provide fun packed action. What’s more, there are many other additional offers such as Snowmobil-City, Flying
        Fox XXL as well as the Baumzipfelweg (Tree Top Trail) and Timoks Alm Coaster.




3 Towns – One Common Ground




The Skicircus Saalbach Hinterglemm Leogang Fieberbrunn comprises of three towns which connected, make up one of the largest ski regions in Austria. But, it is the diversity of the individual
        towns that is so appealing for visitors from all over the world. Saalbach Hinterglemm is not only renowned for its breath-taking mountain scenery and the fact it is set amongst the rolling
        pastures of the Pinzgau Grass Moun-tains. In winter the region is well-known for its spectacular events and legendary Aprés-Ski. The con-trasting region of Saalfelden Leogang offers guests a
        range of sports activities as well as cultural high-lights. Rest and relaxation paired with a variety of recreational opportunities are a perfect mix. Fieber-brunn is the smallest location in
        the Skicircus. Here it is all about leaving the stress of everyday life be-hind, sitting back and taking in all that nature has to offer. “Easy up – Wild down” is the motto in Fieberbrunn,
        the youngest town in the Skicircus. The Freeride-Hotspot is located at the centre of the Kitzbüheler Alps and lures guests with its deep virgin snow, sunny slopes and easy-going atmosphere.




Winter Activity Programme




High flyers will be thrilled with the Flying Fox XXL at the Asitz in Saalfelden Leogang. Adrenaline levels will be sky high on one of the longest and fastest steel rope slides in the world,
        where your speed will reach up to 130 km/h on the 1.6 km long steel rope.

In the Talschluss of Saalbach Hinterglemm, one will find the highest Tree Top Trail in Europe. Combine a visit to the Tree Top Trail with the “Golden Gate Bridge of the Alps”, a truly unique
        project.



Tobogganing - fun and action is guaranteed for young and old alike. One will find many numerous toboggan runs and flood-lit pistes throughout the region – each one unique in its own way. Ice
        skaters will enjoy the natural rink at the Ritzensee, near Saalfelden, with the picturesque backdrop of the Steinernen Meer Mountains. At the ice-skating rink at the Sportzentrum in Saalbach
        Hinterglemm, you can pirouette to your heart’s content.



Snowshoeing is a unique experience in the Skicircus Saalbach Hinterglemm Leogang Fieberbrunn, thanks to the natural landscape and incomparable panorama. A sleigh ride is an activity that be
        enjoyed by all ages and romantics, cuddled up in a cosy blanket. Those who prefer not to take a lift up the mountain, will enjoy one of the numerous guided ski tours and ski touring
        evenings.



Only the crunching of snow beneath your feet will break the silence when you are out in the crisp fresh air on a winter hike, or snowshoeing in a winter wonderland. This will be a truly
        unique experience as your companions will be lamas Ronaldo, Simon and Loriot, who belong to Barbara Steinlechner, a local farmer from Fieberbrunn. Try your hand at the traditional “Moarn”
        curling, a sport which is popular amongst locals. After an action-packed day, you will find many wellness facilities where you can recharge your batteries and relax. The Aubad adventure pool
        offers the opportunity for water fun galore, with a tubular slide, warm water swimming channel which connects with the outdoor massage pool, as well as the swimming pool and children’s
        paddling pool.
