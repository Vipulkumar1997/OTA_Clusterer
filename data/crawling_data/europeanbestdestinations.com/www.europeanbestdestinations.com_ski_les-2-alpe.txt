Les 2 Alpes Ski Resort

France












Hotels in Les 2 Alpes



































LES 2 ALPES





Skiing is the driving force behind French mountain tourism and the number 1 reason that holidaymakers come to winter resorts!
France is Europe’s top skiing area
and the
        number 2 skiing destination in the world behind the United States and ahead of Austria. France is home to 325 ski resorts, including the
young, dynamic, sporty and cosmopolitan
        resort
of Les 2 Alpes. The resort, situated in the Isère region, numbers among the major snowsports resorts with 1,200,000 skier days (53.9 million across the French mountains) and
        is listed in the TOP 15!



Regardless of how much snow falls, Les 2 Alpes is one of the French resorts that guarantees
you can ski almost all year round
(winter, summer and autumn), thanks to its high
        summits that reach up to 3,600 metres, and to the exceptional work developing the artificial snowmaking network that ensures ski access back to resort from the start to the end of the season.
        The resort has other advantages, including a freestyle area for everyone (2 ALPES FREESTYLE LAND), a glacier that is accessible to all, the resort’s human-scale which means everything is
        within reach, doorstep skiing, a blue run between 3,400 and 1,600 metres, one of the longest vertical drops between 3,600 and 1,300 metres, trendy shops, a wealth of activities and
        entertainment, a
party atmosphere
, quality gastronomy (68 restaurants) and a philosophy of always moving forward in terms of equipment, services,  events…



Les 2 Alpes also bears labels certifying the privileged welcome it extends to families (FAMILY PLUS), the faultless welcome it provides to all holidaymakers (QUALITY TOURISM), and the quality
        of its apartments with LES 2 ALPES QUALITY accommodation label.

Top things to do

in Les 2 Alpes









Skiing


The ski area covers 415 hectares, totalling 200km of runs between altitudes of 1,300 metres (Mont de Lans) and 3,600 metres (glacier). 60% of the runs are aimed at beginners and intermediates and
    40% at experienced and expert skiers One of Les 2 Alpes’ special characteristics is that “the higher you go, the easier the runs are”, making the glacier ideal for beginners. 25% of the resort’s
    visitors are snowboarders (national average: 10%). Les 2 Alpes was the first ski resort to enable snowboarders to use all of their ski lifts, including ski tows. Before that, they had to get
    around using snow-scooters!!! The runs are divided into 5 sectors: Mont de Lans (1,300 metres), Vallée Blanche (2,100 metres), Les Crêtes (2, 100 metres), La Fée (2,600 metres) and the glacier
    between 2,900 and 3,600 metres.

The longest vertical drop in the world (Le Parisien newspaper): 2,300 metres of vertical drop from the glacier (3,600 metres) to the village of Mont-de-Lans (1,300 metres), without using ski
    lifts!!!

Alongside the ski patrollers...first tracks skiing


Every Wednesday morning, discover the day-to-day life of a Les 2 Alpes ski patroller: work stations, daily routine, keeping the slopes safe, client information, rescue, dog-handling,
    avalanche blasting, opening the ski runs for the day… it’s rare opportunity to share in the early hours of the morning. There’s just one condition: you’ll have to set your alarm to wake you up
    very early! Meet at the “Jandri Express” gondola lift at 8am. At the end of the session you’ll be rewarded with a hearty breakfast at the foot of the glacier in Le 3200 restaurant, facing the
    majestic Oisans mountaintops.... For more information and to book, head to any of the ski pass sales outlets – (15€)

Freeride attitude - Raising awareness of the risks of the off-piste skiing.


800 hectares of off-piste skiing, beautiful untouched spaces, including access to the legendary La Grave. The difficulty, gradient and vertical drop mean it is important to be accompanied by a
    professional. In Les 2 Alpes, visitors share their experiences and get more information about off-piste skiing at the FREERIDE ATTITUDE event. Every Tuesday, the Tourist Office holds a free
    workshop to raise awareness of the risks of off-piste skiing, with a presentation on how to use safety equipment (DVA avalanche beacon, shovel and probe), talks, debates and Freeride sessions
    supervised by professionals (from Les 2 Alpes Mountain Guides Office). This weekly (Tuesday) free event is an awareness workshop about the risks involved in going off-piste. Presentation and
    guidance on handling safety equipment (DVA avalanche beacon, shovel, probe), Q&A sessions, debates, and professionally supervised Freeride sessions.

Belvedere des Ecrins: Be suspended in the air at 3,400 metres.


Step into the void» for an unforgettable experience facing the Ecrins mountain range! Set on the Soreiller summit, at an altitude of 3,400 metres, it welcomes both skiers and non-skiers. It’s
    just a 5-minute walk from the arrival of the funicular at 3,400 metres for non-skiers and boasts unique panoramic views of the Ecrins Massif in particular. The 7-metre long step into the void
    overlooks La Selle valley 1,500 metres below. Free of charge.

Les 2 Alpes Night Snow Trail

    Participants experience an unusual, extraordinary evening, racing above the resort of Les 2 Alpes at night une course, and taking in stunning views! Instead of running down snow-covered slopes,
