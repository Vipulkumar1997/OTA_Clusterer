Tourism in Stockholm

Sweden












Hotels in Stockholm




































Stockholm
is a ground breaking, welcoming and innovative trendsetter.
Fashion, technology, music, film,design
and the game industry thrive here like never
        before. It is a place where creativity grows, and where dreams and new ideas are realized. But most of all – A city open for everyone!



Stockholm is also widely regarded as one of the
world’s most beautiful cities
, built where lake meets sea, on fourteen islands, with eight centuries of history and culture to
        choose from. Here are our Top Reasons for visiting Stockholm.




The beauty


It’s said that beauty lies in the eye of the beholder. But whoever came up with that proverb, probably never made it to the Capital of Scandinavia. Once you’ve seen them, you’ll never forget
        the islands in the stream.




All that water


The sparkling blue water and the archipelago next door is what defines Stockholm and gives it its unique character. Wherever you look, there’s water. And since it’s so clean, you can use it
        for all types of activities, like fishing and even swimming in the middle of town.




The green spaces


Green is the new black and no large city has more green spaces than Stockholm. And what’s more: the air and the water is clean and fresh and you’re never far away from nature.




The attractions


Few cities pack so many interesting attractions into such a compact and easily accessible area. Castles? Check. Medieval old town? Check. Wide selection of museums and galleries? Check. Cool
        restaurants and nightclubs? Check! We could go on but we’ll stop there.




The welcoming


You don’t have to master the language made famous by the chef from the Muppet Show to get by in Stockholm. Almost everyone speaks at least English and are (according to surveys) welcoming,
        open and respectful towards visitors.




A year-round destination


Yes, the never-ending summer nights are magical, but a nighttime Christmas market in the Old Town, powdered in white, is not to be missed either. In fact, all four, distinct seasons in
        Stockholm have their unique charms.




Sophisticated and friendly


There’s a willingness to try anything new and fresh that runs through every facet of life in Stockholm. Be it fashion, design, food or new lifestyles. And yet the atmosphere is friendly,
        relaxed and sophisticated. A contradiction? Maybe, but still very true.




The archipelago


There’s no getting away from the fact that the archipelago with its 30,000 islands and skerries plays a huge role in Stockholm’s appeal. The soothing vistas and the sea breeze is the perfect
        counterweight to the metropolitan feel of the city.




Creative and trendy


Art, architecture and design play an integrated part of Stockholm city life. Music, food and fashion are at the cutting edge and the shopping is as good or better than even the largest
        capitals.

The Royal Palace


Welcome to one of the largest palaces in Europe! The Royal Palace is the official residence of His Majesty the King of Sweden, with over 600 rooms.

The Palace is open to the public and offers no less than five museums. The Palace was largely built during the eighteenth century in the Italian Baroque style, on the spot where the “Tre Kronor”
    castle burned down in 1697.

Gamla Stan


All of Gamla Stan and the adjacent island of Riddarholmen are like a living pedestrian-friendly museum full of sights, attractions, restaurants, cafés, bars and places to shop. Gamla Stan is also
    popular with aficionados of handicrafts, curios and souvenirs. The narrow winding cobblestone streets, with their buildings in so many different shades of gold, give Gamla Stan its unique
    character.

Boat Sightseeing with Strömma


Seeing Stockholm from the water is an enjoyable must. Fortunately, there are many tours to choose from depending on your interests.

Under the Bridges of Stockholm, Royal Canal Tour and the early Good Morning Stockholm Tour concentrate on central Stockholm and take from 50 minutes to 2½ hours. The Good Morning tour is given in
    Swedish and English only.











©Henrik Trygg, Visit Stockholm









SkyView - On the top of the Globe


SkyView is the new world-class attraction that takes you to the top of the world’s largest spherical building, the Ericsson Globe, a Stockholm landmark. From the apex 130 meters (425 feet) above
    sea level, you get a fantastic view encompassing all of Stockholm. The two SkyView gondolas depart every 10 minutes, and the entire visit takes about 30 minutes. Restaurant, café and souvenir
    shop are adjacent to SkyView.







©Soren Andersson, Visit Stockholm









Fotografiska


Fotografiska is one of the world’s largest meeting places for contemporary photography. Fotografiska presents four unique large exhibitions and about 20 smaller exhibitions annually. In addition
    to the large exhibition, Fotografiska also houses a book and souvenir shop, a restaurant, a photo gallery. In the bar on the top floor you will find one of Stockholm’s very best vantage points.
