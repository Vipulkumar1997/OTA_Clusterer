Zadar in Croatia



European Best Destination 2016






















Welcome to
Zadar European best destination 2016
!
Zadar is a great city, a city full of tradition and modernity, a city open to the sea. Stroll along the waterfront and hear the amazing sound of the "sea
    organ" while watching "
the most beautiful sunset in the world
" according to Alfred Hitchcock.



This
city of Zadar
is marked by its history and turned  towards modernity. Zadar is a different city, incomparable, with
    a soft and cozy atmosphere, a
holiday atmosphere of tranquility and serenity
. Zadar is quiet and safe: you can go for walks during the night as well as during the day. You
    will discover
splendid vestiges
of the Roman era, but also fine shops, restaurants at
affordable prices
, fruit and vegetable markets, outdoor concerts.



In Zadar you will enjoy delicous food and nice walks along the docks and you will listen to the sound of the sea organ, a
unique facility in Europe
that allows the sea to
    compose a sweet and enchanting music.

2. Athens



Greece



From the iconic Acropolis, rising above the city, to charming up and coming neighborhoods and contemporary art galleries, the city of Classic Marathon and Olympic Games is a majestically quirky
    clash of past and present.



One of the
world's oldest cities
with a recorded history of 3,500 years, the Greek capital is constantly undergoing urban renewals to keep up with the evolution of
    time.
Athens
lives up to all the hype!

3. Plovdiv



Bulgaria



Nestling in the south part of Bulgaria,
Plovdiv
is a leading cultural, religious, wine and shopping
    destination which never fails to reveal exciting, new facets of its character.



With its 8-millennia history, Plovdiv has been proclaimed the oldest continuously-inhabited city in Europe and the 6-th oldest in the world. I
n 2019
    the city will be the
European capital of culture
.




Various sites and activities turn Plovdiv into a real treasure on Earth, which must be discovered!

4. Nantes



France



Once a busy seaport in the estuary of the Loire, the fascinating city of
Nantes
was chosen in the old times by the
    dukes of Brittany as their historical capital. If the city still boasts a unique architectural heritage with its magnificent Château des ducs de Bretagne, a Renaissance-style castle nestled
    in a fortress, a medieval quarter and one of the highest cathedrals of France -  it has been transformed in the last 20 years probably more than any other city in France.



It is not only a vibrant and young metropolis often rewarded for its top-quality of life - Nantes was also Green Capital of Europe in 2013 – but a city where art has
    literally been integrated in all possible aspects, making it a true example of how artists can turn a city upside down!

5. Azores



Portugal



In the blue Atlantic Ocean, between Europe and America: the
Azores islands
, an autonomous Region of Portugal, are
    divided in three geographical groups: the Eastern Group, comprising Santa Maria and São Miguel, the Central Group, including Terceira, Graciosa, São Jorge, Pico and Faial, and the Western Group,
    composed by Corvo and Flores. Brought together in an archipelago, each Azorean island has its own identity. Even if they all share an extraordinary natural legacy, they also have their
    own unique strokes in their landscape, traditions, cuisine and architecture.



There are no words capable of describing and classifying the charm of these nine charismatic islands!

6. Paris



France




Paris
is one of the world’s few really legendary capitals. Far from resting on its laurels, the French
    capital has taken a pro-active approach to enhancing its appeal by undertaking a quality-focused and sustainable development strategy based on constant innovation. This great city is a blend
    of past and future. Its pleasingly symmetrical layout, the result of the work of visionary rulers and architects, dates to the 19th century, while 21st-century Paris is a laboratory of the
    future.



Paris is a dream destination for French and international visitors alike.

7. Novi Sad



Serbia




Novi Sad
is the city that provides the visitors the agenda of unbelievably rich content with its urban core
    and rural surroundings. Each visitor, according to his or her internal feeling for nice and pleasant, attractive and joyful, useful and accessible can create his or her own experience while
    learning about all the layers of the past and present of Novi Sad.



Novi Sad, the city on the Danube, the city with the European history and tradition and Balkan hospitality is the experience you must not miss.

8. Brussels



Belgium




Brussels
, the capital of 500 million Europeans, is waiting to share its treasures and talents with you and to tell you its
    story. It has an ability to adapt to its visitors: no matter when you come,
there’s always something happening here
; no matter how long you stay, there are several different ways
    to experience Brussels, each with some brilliant surprises in store.



A
multicoloured heritage
of the most diverse styles, a contagious creativity tinged with
surrealism and humour
, a sociable and epicurean art de vivre.

9. Kotor



Montenegro



Beautiful
Kotor
, a cultural and natural world heritage site is located in a secluded part of the Boka bay.



If you are passionate for nature, art, history and want to know more about the rich cultural heritage and customs of this region, visit the town of Kotor, the baroque city of
    Perast, visit the islet Our lady of the rocks, and finally discover the archaeological site Roman mosaics in Risan with mostly superb representation of the god Hypnos and observe the traces of
    the first civilization.

10. Milan



Italy




Milan
has been interesting and vibrant at least since it was the capital of the western half of the Roman Empire. Have a
    look at the imposing marble
Duomo
, at our churches, palaces and museums. You will also be delighted by
contemporary art
and architecture.



While you visit, let the atmosphere of
Italy’s most modern and advanced city
seep in. You will be captured by the elegance and style; by the energy and the international flair.

11. Prague



Czech Republic




Prague
has been considered as one of the most beautiful cities in the world since Middle Ages. Adjectives such as
    “golden“, “city of a hundred spires“, “the crown of the world“ were attributed to Prague, which is located right in the heart of Europe. And how to get the city into your heart? Try with us to
    wander not only in the Historic Centre of Prague that has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1992 and with its 866 hectares is the largest historic city centre on this list in
    the world, but also in the vibrant cultural metropolis.

12. Rome



Italy



The province of
Rome
is a matching frame for the
many treasures of the capital
, and the surrounding area has,
    more or less directly, experienced the influence of the history of the
Eternal City.




A region with a great deal to offer:
sea, nature, good food
and villages rich in history and art. The sea, the hills, lakes, rivers and vineyards: the surroundings of Rome offer
    a kaleidoscope of diversity and attractions for nature lovers.

13. Vienna



Austria










Vienna
'
s Ringstrasse is the
most beautiful boulevard in the world
. Nowhere else can you find such a dense
    concentration of so many representative buildings, palaces and parks.



All of these splendid buildings still have their full radiance today. An elegant promenade for the wealthy and beautiful has become a modern boulevard for everyone.  And the section of the
    Ring along the Danube Canal has become a hotspot: an
urban bar scene and modern architecture attract
a primarily young audience.

15. Nicosia



Cyprus



For the lovers of the Mediterranean the island of Cyprus is an absolute must. The legendary birthplace of Aphrodite is famed for its spectacular beaches, its breathtaking sceneries
    and the warmth of its people. It offers the visitor a large selection of unique activities that can fulfill almost any wish.






Nicosia
is the island’s 10 century old capital. It is situated in the middle of the island and is a busy commercial and
    business center. Its old quarter is surrounded by a Venetian sandstone wall, a vivid remembrance of Nicosia’s turbulent, medieval history. Wandering around the narrow streets with the overhanging
    balconies and the beautiful pedestrianized precincts is an experience that should not be missed!
