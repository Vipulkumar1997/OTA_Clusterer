Kuldīga - the one of the most charming and magical towns in West Latvia, situated less than two hours drive from Capital Riga. It is a town which has preserved its medieval appearance and
        charm. The architecture, the ancient houses, the hills and the valleys of the town, the colours red, ocher, green, gray, and a little bit of pastel. Fall, winter, spring, and summer - the
        town maintains its charm all throughout the year. Kuldīga has established and maintains a strong link with culture and art. Kuldīga has the widest, naturally formed, waterfall in Europe (249
        m) is associated with a number of legends and historic events.



In old day's, due to the Duke Jakob’s invented fishing devices installed on the waterfall, Kuldīga was known as the city where salmons were caught in the air. In 2011 Kuldīga was included in
        the List of UNESCO World Heritage, Latvian Tentative List. The town is architecturally preserved, there are no plastic windows and doors. The true richness of the town is its people. Here you
        can have a good time and a great meal. Sophisticated cultural life, tranquility and the charm of a small town, that is Kuldīga. From 1368 Kuldīga(medieval name Goldingen) was included as a
        member town of the Hanseatic League. Through Hansaetic routes Kuldīga trades crop, leather, linen and timber.



From 2007 Kuldīga received the international title “European Destination of Excellence”. In 2008 the old town of Kuldīga received the European Heritage Label as one of the most unique 17th -
        18th century wooden architecture ensembles in Latvia. In 2013 Kuldīga received the EU prize of cultural heritage – ‘’Europa Nostra’’. In 2014 Kuldīga was icluded in the List of the World
        Sustainable Global TOP100 Green Destinations. On March of 2014 Kuldiga was given the 'Vision for Innovation in Sustainable Tourism Award' or 'VISTA 2014' during the international tourism
        exhibition ‘ITB 2014’, Berlin, Germany. Now Kuldīga is famous all around the Europe for its unique oldtown, iconic culture events and incredible food, it is one of the most visited towns in
        the Baltic States. And there is no other place like Kuldīga.

Top things to do

in Kuldiga





Cycling and Nordic Walking tours within widest Waterfall of Europe to the Sand Caves


In the early period of the Duchy of Courland, Dutch merchants settled in Kuldīga, but in the 17th century, historic documents often included references to merchants of Lübeck in Kuldīga and
    merchants of Kuldīga in Lübeck. Kuldīga not only had very close commercial ties with Lübeck, which was the largest Hanseatic city at the time, but also kinship ties among the population. Perhaps
    these ties are still alive today through the love of bicycles. Each year in May, Kuldīga brings together several thousands of cyclists, who join together for a cycling marathon.
