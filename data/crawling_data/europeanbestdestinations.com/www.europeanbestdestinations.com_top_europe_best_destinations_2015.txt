Bordeaux : European Best Destination 2015 !















Bordeaux
has always been a dynamic, cosmopolitan city and never ceases to reveal exciting, new facets of its character. The city of Bordeaux’s inscription as a UNESCO World
    Heritage Site in 2007 and its bold modernism have made it a key destination for everyone interested in
French culture, lifestyle... and wine!





Centre of a legendary winegrowing region, this vibrant and sophisticated city is a top gourmet and culture destination. Synonymous with fine wines, Bordeaux is
one of France’s most
    elegant cities
.



Bordeaux’s setting on the River Garonne has made it an important port for centuries. Bordeaux is the ideal base for exploring
wine châteaux of Médoc, St Emilion and Bordeaux
,
    fringed by the largest pine forest in Europe, just 45 minutes from Arcachon Bay (famous for its delicious seafood and oysters!) and superb beaches. The Basque Country and Spain are only 2 hours
    away and in 3 hours you can be on the Pyrenean ski slopes.

Book your stay in Bordeaux



Bordeaux travel guide





















2. Lisbon



Lisbon is an illuminated city. The almost constant presence of sunshine and the River Tagus transforms the
Portuguese capital
into a mirror of a thousand colours - highlighting
    the
city’s unique architecture and beauty
.



Have fun in Lisbon, where nightlife continues till dawn. Experience calmer moments in Lisbon in the city’s parks, gardens, belvederes, cafés and esplanades. Or simply
enjoy the
    pure pleasure of being in Lisbon
, through its gastronomy, luxury hotels, spas and shopping centres.




Book your stay in Lisbon




























3. Athens



Athens is considered the
cradle of western civilization
. Over the years, a multitude of conquerors occupied Athens, and erected unique, splendid monuments - a rare historical
    palimpsest, evident everywhere in the city.




The contemporary urban scenery of the sprawling city reflects its exciting history, its
multi-cultural modern personality
as well as the infrastructure and facilities. In
    other words,
Athens is a must destination
that combines modern urban innovation with history, culture and natural beauty throughout the year.




Book your stay in Athens

























4. Valletta - Malta



In
Malta
you can span the millennia with an astonishing array of things to discover. And wherever you go, the scenery and architecture provide a spectacular backdrop. The colours
    are striking, honey-coloured stone against the deepest of Mediterranean blues.



Malta is holidaying as the mood takes you. And with near
year-round sun
, you can indulge in outdoor living at its best. And, if this were not enough, there are the other two
    islands -
Gozo and Comino
-which can be a pleasant change-of-scene during your stay.



Book your stay in Malta

























5. Riga



The first, indelible impression that most visitors get of the Latvian capital is its
majestic skyline
, as viewed from the left bank of the Daugava River.




One will find a
breathtaking range of architectural styles
in the historical centre. Furthermore, Riga’s wealth of Jugendstil or Art Nouveau buildings, complete with their
    fantastically ornate flourishes, stands out as unparalleled anywhere in the world. Proud of its heritage, it is a thoroughly
modern city with a highly developed
    infrastructure
and opportunities for a variety of activities.




Book your stay in Riga

























6. Zagreb



The impressions of many foreigners who live in Zagreb, business people and tourists can be summed up in a single sentence :
a large city which managed to stay romantic and safe
.
    There are unlimited possibilities for visiting music and theatre events, art exhibitions, museums, sporting events and enjoying pleasant walks, interesting architecture, plentiful parks in the
    centre of the city, pedestrian zones and the atmosphere.




Spacious pedestrian zones with
many open cafes with garden
and street terraces scattered all over the city add to the charm of Zagreb hospitality.




Book your stay in Zagreb

























7. Ljubljana



What is it that sets Ljubljana apart from other cities and capitals ?
A vibrant city of delights
characterized by its unique historical heritage, cultural creativity,
    friendliness and relaxed atmosphere.




Due to its compact size, Ljubljana is a walking and environmentally friendly city, dotted with many green spaces. Nestled on a hill above the Old Town, the
medieval Ljubljana
    Castle
looks like a mighty guardian protecting the city at its foot. Even at first glance, Ljubljana seems
pleasant and familiar
to visitors.




Book your stay in Ljubljana

























8. Innsbruck



Picturesque and snazzy, on the pulse of nature and the city at the same time, that is how the city on the banks of the river Inn presents itself to its visitors.
Innsbruck, the capital of
    the Alps
, is a vibrant and refreshing city that combines alpine, urban and historical components in a unique way and offers a myriad of possibilities to its visitors.



It fascinates with the beauty of the nature surrounding it, its long history and traditions that are interwoven with modern elements:
star architects and gourmet restaurants
coin
    the face of this city just as much as the alpine scenery surrounding it.



Book your stay in Innsbruck

























9. Milan



Milan has been interesting and vibrant at least since it was the capital of the western half of the Roman Empire. Have a look at the imposing marble
Duomo
, at our churches,
    palaces and museums. You will also be delighted by
contemporary art
and architecture.



While you visit, let the atmosphere of
Italy’s most modern and advanced city
seep in. You will be captured by the elegance and style; by the energy and the international flair.
An incredible shopping experience
for all tastes and pockets, in a place where design and fashion have made their home.



Book your stay in Milan

























10. Brussels



Brussels, the capital of 500 million Europeans, is waiting to share its treasures and talents with you and to tell you its story. It has an ability to adapt to its visitors: no matter when you
    come,
there’s always something happening here
; no matter how long you stay, there are several different ways to experience Brussels, each with some brilliant surprises in store.




A
multicoloured heritage
of the most diverse styles, a contagious creativity tinged with
surrealism and humour
, a sociable and epicurean art de vivre.



Book your stay in Brussels

























11. Vienna



Vienna's Ringstrasse is the
most beautiful boulevard in the world
. Nowhere else can you find such a dense concentration of so many representative buildings, palaces and
    parks.




All of these splendid buildings still have their full radiance today. An elegant promenade for the wealthy and beautiful has become a modern boulevard for everyone.  And the section of the
    Ring along the Danube Canal has become a hotspot: an
urban bar scene and modern architecture attract
a primarily young audience.





Book your stay in Vienna






















12. Rome



The province of Rome is a matching frame for the
many treasures of the capital
, and the surrounding area has, more or less directly, experienced the influence of the history of
    the
Eternal City.




A region with a great deal to offer:
sea, nature, good food
and villages rich in history and art. The sea, the hills, lakes, rivers and vineyards: the surroundings of Rome offer
    a kaleidoscope of diversity and attractions for nature lovers.




Book your stay in Rome






















13. Barcelona



In
Barcelona
, you don't have to choose between going shopping or sightseeing. Wherever you go, you'll see that shops are part of city life. And while you discover unforgettable
    sights, you'll be welcomed by the window displays of leading international brands,
modern designer shops
and traditional shops that have been there since time immemorial.




The city has set the benchmark for the international electronic music scene and dances to the
sounds of the world's top DJs
. It's also the perfect place for lovers of jazz, rock,
    Latin rhythms and pop.




Book your stay in Barcelona






















14. Istanbul



With one foot in the East and the other in the West,
Istanbul is the perfect city destination
with its captivating blend of sights, sounds and colours. Admire magnificent
    mosques, atmospheric churches, intriguing museums and Sultans' palaces or take to the waters of the Bosphorus to enjoy fresh fish overlooking the Black Sea.




Explore the warren of streets in the
Grand Bazaar
and discover the metropolis of the moment that Istanbul is today with its stylish art galleries, world-class restaurants
    and electrifying nightclubs.




Book your stay in Istanbul






















15. Madrid




Madrid
is an open-minded city where culture and entertainment share a thriving space. The Spanish capital makes everyone feel right at home while providing them with some of the
    world’s most interesting tourist attractions.






Madrid
is one of the world’s liveliest, most entertaining and vibrant cities during the day, but even more so at night. The
Spanish capital
does not only offer
    art, shopping, nightlife and excellent
gastronomy
but it also presents both visitors and locals with all imaginable options for leisure.
