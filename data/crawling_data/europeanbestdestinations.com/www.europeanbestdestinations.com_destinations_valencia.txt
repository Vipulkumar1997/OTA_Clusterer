The City of Art and Sciences


The City of Arts and Sciences is a cultural entertainment centre with stunning architecture and great capacity to entertain, teach and excite by promoting public participation. Situated along
    almost two kilometres of what was formerly the bed of the River Turia, with a surface area of 350,000 square metres, the City of Arts and Sciences is a huge open space. Offering cultural and
    intellectual leisure, it has given Valencia the best centre of this type in Europe.

Visit the Old Town


Twenty-one centuries of history right at the heart of the city, where you’ll find such historical treasures as Valencia Cathedral, the Micalet, the Basilica of the Virgin and the Almoina. Don’t
    miss the Tribunal de las Aguas (Water Court), a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage (noon on Thursdays). immerse yourself in one of Europe’s biggest markets, the Mercado Central, situated inside
    a jewel of pre-modernista architecture.

The Royal Marina and Valencia's beaches


The Juan Carlos I Royal Marina is one of the city’s most important landmarks, not only due to the events that are held there, but also due to its unique buildings. It houses the 19th Century
    Harbour Sheds, the Edificio del Reloj and the Veles e Vents building, the emblem of the new Marina.

Bioparc of Valencia


This innovative zoo, in which the barriers are practically invisible and the animals feel right at home, covers some 100,000 square metres and is located in the Parque de Cabecera within the
    former Turia Riverbed. Contrary to traditional zoos, this park has the unique feature of bringing the visitor totally into the habitat of the animals.

Old riverbed


The redirecting of the River Turia that ran through Valencia in order to avoid the periodic flooding that the city suffered left an expanse of land crossing from the east to west, surrounded by
    the old town and city centre. After a profound urban study an ambitious project produced a fantastic river-bed park with all sorts of facilities for children, sporting activities, ponds,
    fountains and the wonderful infants’ park – the Parque del Gulliver.
