The Atomium



Brussels - Belgium



“The story of the
Atomium
is, above all, one of love, the love that the
Belgians
have for an extraordinary structure symbolising a frame of mind that wittily
    combines aesthetic daring with technical mastery. The appearance of the
Atomium
is unusual and unforgettable. It has a rare quality of lifting everyone’s spirits and firing their
    imagination ». Diane Hennebert, 2008

The Church of Hallgrimur



Reykjavik - Iceland



State Architect Guðjón Samúelsson's design of the church was commissioned in 1937. He is said to have designed it to resemble the basalt lava flows of Iceland's landscape. It took 38 years to
    build the church. Construction work began in 1945 and ended in 1986, the landmark tower being completed long before the church's actual completion.

The Cristo Rei



Lisbon - Portugal



The idea to build the Monument to
Christ-King
comes up in 1934, when the late Cardinal Patriarch of
Lisbon
,
    His Eminence Manuel Gonçalves Cerejeira, is visiting Brazil. Traveling through
Rio de Janeiro
, he comes upon the impressing site of the Statue of Christ the Redeemer in Corcovado
    and immediately is born in his heart the desire to build something similar in front of
Lisbon
. So, in 1936, the idea to build the Monument to Christ-King was made known to the
    Apostolate of Prayer, which welcomed it with enthusiasm.

La Sagrada Familia



Barcelona - Spain



The expiatory church of
La Sagrada Família
is a work on a grand scale which was begun on 19 March 1882 from a project by the diocesan architect
Francisco de Paula
    del Villar
(1828-1901). At the end of 1883
Gaudí
was commissioned to carry on the works, a task which he did not abandon until his death in 1926. Since then different
    architects have continued the work after his original idea.



The building is in the centre of
Barcelona
, and over the years it has become one of the most universal signs of identity
    of the city and the country. It is visited by millions of people every year and many more study its architectural and religious content.

Facteur Cheval Palace



Hauterives - France




"I was walking very fast when my foot caught on something that sent me stumbling a few meters away, I wanted to know the cause. In a dream I had built a palace, a castle or caves, I cannot
    express it well... I told no one about it for fear of being ridiculed and I felt ridiculous myself. Then fifteen years later, when I had almost forgotten my dream, when I wasn't thinking of it at
    all, my foot reminded me of it. My foot tripped on a stone that almost made me fall. I wanted to know what it was... It was a stone of such a strange shape that I put it in my pocket to admire it
    at my ease. The next day, I went back to the same place. I found more stones, even more beautiful, I gathered them together on the spot and was overcome with delight... It's a sandstone shaped by
    water and hardened by the power of time. It becomes as hard as pebbles. It represents a sculpture so strange that it is impossible for man to imitate, it represents any kind of animal, any kind
    of caricature. I said to myself: since Nature is willing to do the sculpture, I will do the masonry and the architecture"
Ferdinand Cheval.

Pisa Tower



Pisa - Italy



The Leaning Tower of
Pisa
is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known
    worldwide for its unintended tilt to one side. It is situated behind the Cathedral and is the third oldest structure in Pisa's Cathedral Square (after the Cathedral and the Baptistry. The tower's
    tilt began during construction, caused by an inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the structure’s weight.

The Cube Houses



Rotterdam - Netherlands










The
cubehouse
(or polehouse or treehouse) is a design of the
    Dutch architect
Piet Blom
. He thought of this design as an (abstract) tree and of the Total complex as a wood. So Blom’s idea was to create a kind of village within a town, a
    safe oasis where several functions could take place : Smallscale business, shops, a school and a children’s playground. The strong interaction between the private (upstairs) and the public
    (downstairs) is characteristic for this situation. The complex is in fact a pedestrian bridge crossing a traffic artery. (

Stone House



Fafe - Portugal



“Constructed between two giant stones and linked with a concrete mix, the house is rumored to be inspired by the popular American
Flintstones cartoon
. Although quite unusual, the
    prehistoric-looking residence does feature some traditional components such as windows, a front door, and even a shingled roof. As you might expect, the house’s design attracts thousands of
    tourists each year ».

Dunmore Pineapple



Airth - Scotland



"The Dunmore Pineapple, a folly ranked as the "
most bizarre building in Scotland
", stands in Dunmore Park, near Airth in Stirlingshire, Scotland.



Discovered by Christopher Columbus on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe in 1493, pineapples became a rare delicacy in Europe, with associations of
power, wealth, and
    hospitality
. Architects, artisans and craftsmen adopted the pineapple as a motif, sculpting it into gateposts, railings, weather vanes and door lintels. The motif also featured
    prominently in interior decoration, fabrics and furniture. The Dunmore Pineapple represents perhaps  the most spectacular architectural use of the motif."
