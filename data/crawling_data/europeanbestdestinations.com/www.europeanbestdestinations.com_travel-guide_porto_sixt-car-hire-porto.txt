Everywhere in Porto with my Sixt car.


Cais de Ribeira, Sé Cathedral, Clerigos Tower, ... Porto is beautiful and hilly. Travellers love the city, but many of them can only see a few places if they do not use a car. You have to be very
    fit if you want to visit the city centre on foot : the city is hilly as we said before. You will enjoy the most beautiful places in Porto more easily with your Sixt rental car such as the summit
    of Serra do Pilar, the Serralves Foundation or the beaches of Porto.



Get out of the city centre in your Sixt rental car, visit the chic neighbourhood of Foz in Porto, the Portuguese Beverly-hill with the most famous brands and luxury shops. If you like
    authenticity and a unique atmosphere, take your Sixt rental car and visit the traditional and charming fishing village located in the Afurada neighbourhood in Vila Nova de Gaia. Enjoy the nature
    reserve of Gaia and stop at Pedra do Cao car park, located at the mouth of the River and facing the sea.

With Sixt on the most beautiful beaches in Europe.








You feel good in your Sixt rental car and want to discover one of the most beautiful beaches in Europe? Discover Senhor da Pedra ; it is only 20 minutes away from the city centre by car. You will
    love the chapel built on the rocks and facing the sea.













Senhor da Pedra Beach near Porto © De Visu











Discovering the Douro Valley


Discovering Porto and missing the Douro Valley is like going to Paris and missing the Eiffel Tower! Extend your stay in Porto. After a 3-4 day shopping, wine tasting, visiting the cellars, come
    discover one of the most beautiful landscape of Europe, the Douro Valley. You will enjoy every moment of this beautiful journey from Porto to Pinhao. In less than two hours with your Sixt rental
    car, you will be immersed in the valleys drawn by the hand of man to cultivate very large vineyard tracks. We advise you not to waste your time on road tolls and activate the option "Via Verde"
    from your online car rental on the Sixt site. This option offered by Sixt is much faster and will help you avoid waiting at the road tolls.



Park your car in the Vintage Hotel car park upon arrival in Pinhao - the hotel is a perfect address for a dream holiday - or in the many car parks of the city. Then come aboard a small
    traditional "Rabelo" boat and enjoy a one hour walk on the Douro, the golden river that crosses Portugal and flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Travelling with Sixt makes you save money ! Enjoy a
    unique experience in the Douro valley such as one day wine tasting.



Whether for a city break or a week, you will appreciate your stay in Porto, the warm welcome of the Portuguese people, the marvellous landscapes, comfortable and recent rental cars at the best
    price and Sixt assistance to make your stay in Portugal an unforgettable moment.
