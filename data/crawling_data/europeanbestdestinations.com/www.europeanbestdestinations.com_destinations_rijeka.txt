Welcome to Rijeka

Croatia












Hotels in Rijeka




































Rijeka is the
third largest city in Croatia
and the
capital of the Primorsko - goranska County
, which boasts with its amazing combination of sea and
        mountains. The
Kvarner Bay
on one side, the countless beauties of the
Učka Nature Park
on the other and the mountains of Gorski Kotar in the hinterland have
        given Rijeka an enviable geographic location making it one of the most desirable Croatian cities to live, work and the best starting point for travelling. Because of its openness to the
        world, the city is known for its hospitality. Rijeka feels the same sparkle in the morning, afternoon and in the evening.



Numerous museums, theatres, galleries, ports and other living reminders of interesting industrial history, ancient Gradina and the
Trsat Sanctuary
are just a part of the
        wealth offered by the city of Rječina for which is known lives 365 days a year. It is surely important to say that Rijeka ranks highly in the gastronomic stakes thanks to high-quality
        gastronomical facilities, café bars and restaurants.



The inevitable part of the city’s image is a
rich nightlife
. The offer is surely completed by the Tower Center,
one of the biggest commercial centers
in the
        region with cinemas, casinos, various stores and shops, cafes and other amusement. The main street, Corso, is alive throughout the day, and the terraces of many restaurants are open and
        lively all year round. In the evening the pubs and bars come alive with frequent musical performances giving the city a rich night life.



In Rijeka one can observe the effects of numerous cultures and nations such as Austrians, Italians, Hungarians and French which all left a mark in history and on the facades of the city's
        palaces including the famous Governor's Palace which houses the Historical and Maritime Museum of the Croatian coast. But by this day Rijeka has remained
a city of tolerance and
        coexistence
. Here multiculturalism has crept into all social pores permeating every corner of the city.



Both with its old and new Rijeka is
a city tailored for everyone
. As there are a lot of cultural, entertainment and sporting events in Rijeka the whole year round, you will
        undoubtedly find something at all times that will make your day and stay in Rijeka. Open, tolerant, hospitable … A city of positive energy, good vibrations and even better people.



It is up to you to see it for yourself and experience Rijeka - the city beyond your expectations.

Top things to do

in Rijeka





Rijeka Carnival


The Rijeka Carnival is the Croatian cultural heritage, a strong tourist ace of Rijeka, Primorsko goranska County of and the Republic of Croatia on both national and international level, a
    favorite entertainment and cultural event among citizens of all generations and interests.

Rijeka Summer Nights Festival


During summer months, Rijeka’s squares, streets and terraces become a theatre scene. Famous city locations as well as places for which even the citizens of Rijeka can hardly imagine that could be
    turned into the backdrop for actors and theatre equipment are given over for a few weeks to artists of the most varied music and scenic expressions.

The Our Lady of Trsat Sanctuary


Back in 1291 Trsat's woodmen one morning saw a small house in front of them in the woods that was not there earlier. Scared and surprised, they notified the vicar Jurjević about the miracle who
    calmed them down by telling them that he already knew what it was. In fact, it was the Nazareth house of the Holy Virgin Mary which was, from fear of the Ottoman conqueror, transported by angels
    to Trsat where it remained for full three years and seven months.

Maritime and Historical Museum of Croatian Littoral


Located in the beautiful Governor’s Palace building, it preserves a large part of Rijeka's history and maritime tradition. Besides its continuous ethnographic exhibition, visit the collection of
    furniture and portraits of people from Rijeka’s public life.

Fiumanka


A view that definitely leaves us breathless is the view over the Rijeka Bay coloured by numerous white sails. Yachtsmen from all parts of the world gather once a year at the Sailing regatta
    Velika Fiumanka that takes place on the route from Rijeka to Omišalj and back.
