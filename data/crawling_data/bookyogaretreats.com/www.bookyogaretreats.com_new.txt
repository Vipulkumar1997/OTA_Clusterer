2nd Element of Yoga Practice: Drawing Attention Inwards

In this, the second of a 10 part series on the elements of the practice, the value and meaning of drawing attention inwards will be scrutinized. Directing attention inwards is an act of letting go of matters that occupy the mind. From this point onward the ability to concentrate is achieved leading to meditation. This is attempted not just when meditating but also during yoga postures. Maintaining such a state during yoga sessions leads to deeper practices. Beginners see the logic, yet the process of application is complicated. The postures are new. Grasping yoga for the first time is like a child learning to walk. Concentration on every step is paramount. It is not long till the steps taken are void of effort and thought. Ideal is a mind that is not occupied by thought and emotion and so kept open to the world.

This amazing flower is a metaphor for the journey of Evening, a yoga therapist who along with her partner Stipe, combined their love, talents, interests and experiences together into a sustainable holistic lifestyle, until they blossomed like sunflowers at dawn.

Learning to Surrender to Life with Grace and Flow

Growing up I wasn't told about the importance of surrender. When I think of it now, I wasn't informed of it during most of my adulthood life. This concept was only given to me when I was introduced to yoga.

From as young as I can remember, life has always been about those lyrics from the Bob Marley song, Buffalo Soldier. “Fighting for survival”. I often feel as if I've spent most of my lifetime either; fighting, pushing, pulling or surviving. Just like all of those busy commuters that I used to get on the train with, when I worked in London. It was that mentality of “everyone for themselves”. I admit that my mentality at that time in life was, “If I don't push my way through and create space for me, then no one else will help me”

Can Yoga and Nutrition Reverse Ageing?

As we age, our body tends to stiffen and tighten, which makes it increasingly uncomfortable to live in. There are many beauty products on the market claiming to prevent wrinkles, lots of ‘superfoods’ that are said to stop aging and many articles and websites that claim yoga can prevent or reverse aging…but what lies behind these claims?

Regular yoga practice can certainly help to improve your reach. For example, if you stand and bend forward (standing forward bend or Uttanasana) – maybe you can touch your toes or maybe you can not. Many people in their 30s or 40s or older, who are new to yoga, can not reach their toes without bending their knees. The body has become stiff from sitting hunched over a computer or laptop or at a desk for eight hours (or more) per day. The back muscles are tight, so too are the hamstrings. With regular yoga practice the flexibility in the body will improve and increase, until eventually you can reach your toes (and beyond) in comfort.

YOGathletA with Cat Haayen

Although Yoga has been around for thousands of years, it is currently more than ever sought out for its purposes of health, fitness, beauty, and
spirituality
. We’ve all heard about the many “trends” out there that will guarantee a happier and skinnier self, but can yoga really do the magic? Maggie Gori had a chance to interview Cat Haayen, who has been pioneering YOGathletA, a method of teaching that has proven to be as holistic as it is strengthening.

A Wonderful Week of Yoga in France

I was half way through a three-month trip across Europe and my intention to stay longer in fewer places had not quite gone to plan. Instead, curiosity kept getting the better of me and I was moving around a lot more than I originally intended. Whilst I love the freedom of being able to do this, it was exhausting. I decided that a full week of relaxation at a yoga retreat would force me to stay in one place for a week and give me time to properly rest and recharge.

Making Space in Your Life

One of the first things we learn as kids in a maths class is the art of addition. Fast-forward a few years down the track and we’ve all graduated with flying colors. We’ve got ourselves a Masters of Addition. We buy, we collect, we consume, we swap, we take, we build, and we produce. In a nutshell? We add. We are full-fledged experts at it so let's take it a notch up—how much do you dare to subtract? How much can you do without?

Why Getting Laid Off Could Be the Best Thing Ever

Traveling for some people is just a passing of time. For some, traveling gives them more clarity about life and the life they choose. But in Shari Hochberg's case, it turns her into a storyteller. In her book, "I Got Laid Off, Traveled, and Wrote This Story", not only that Shari wrote her own funny, embarrassing, and personal stories, but she also made us see some interesting sides of hers; not a typical yogi and an honestly hilarious storyteller.

How To Do a Camel Pose (And All Its Benefits)

Most yogis (even the most experienced ones) have a difficult time with camel pose. Understandably so, Ustrasana is a very intense deep back bend. A recent survey indicated that the most common word used to describe camel was "emotional". That is because camel pose opens up the entire front side of our bodies and our heart chakra which is associated with our emotions.

The Science of Silence

Silence is golden. Practicing silence is a powerful way to see ourselves more clearly and to observe the relationship between our inner and outer worlds with greater understanding. Time spent in intentional silence can go a long way toward revealing the architecture of our hearts and unfolding a life full of fulfillment and purpose.

If you’ve ever considered attending a yoga teacher training, whether it was five years ago or this morning, this information is for you. Perhaps you’ve always wanted to but never felt the courage to commit, never had the money, or simply never knew if it was right for you.
