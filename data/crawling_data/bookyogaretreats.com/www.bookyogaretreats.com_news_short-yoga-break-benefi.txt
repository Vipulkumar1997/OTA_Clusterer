How a Short Yoga Retreat Can Immediately Boost Your Mood


Henry Moore
wed November 29, 2017
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

That’s when you need a
short vacation
. Even taking only a few days somewhere else can help boost your mood and leave you feeling recharged. Read on to discover how travel improves your mental health and how you can make the most of your time away.



Travel Improves Your Mental Health




You look forward to taking some time off from work, but does that mean travel is good for you? After all, you probably look forward to a big piece of cake as well. However, the research is clear: travel improves your mental health.

As Psychology Today explains, taking a vacation can
boost your happiness
. First, it can reduce your stress by letting you escape the same old routine. Enjoying new restaurants, visiting novel places, and even just sleeping in at a hotel can all improve your mood. In fact, just planning your vacation can make you happier even though you haven’t left yet. And if you combine it with yoga, which can
make you happier
too, just imagine how radiant you’d feel on a short yoga break!

A
short vacation
does more than just lift your spirits. Going somewhere for a short trip can improve your creativity and productivity. By taking time away from problems and responsibilities, you gain a new perspective and can literally think better and you can even build stronger relationships with the people you travel with — which always helps your mood.



Making the Most of Your Vacation




That said, you won’t magically enjoy happiness simply by going somewhere new or just by doing yoga. Travel can be stressful, and mistakes can happen during your trip. That’s why The Huffington Post recommends you do
some research
on your destination.

Don’t just travel somewhere and sit around waiting for fun. Find things to do there first. And while you don’t want to over plan, you definitely want a few things lined up that will help you relax.

Another big tip to make the most of your vacation is to go somewhere underrated. Big travel destinations like Disney World or
New York City
promise a lot of fun, but they also have a lot of people already there. This can lead to a lot of stress as you fight for a parking space, wait in long lines, and deal with delays and crowds. Instead, pick an off-the-beaten-path destination.



Don’t Stress about Home while Away




Even with a great plan for a lesser-known destination, you can have trouble relaxing if you are worried about home. To help, you need to keep your home secure. Make sure all doors and windows are locked and ask a neighbor or friend to collect the mail, shovel snow, and so on so people think someone is still home.

And if you have a pet, make sure your furry friend is well
taken care
of. A trustworthy dog sitter can take a load off your mind while you’re on your trip. And if you’re planning on a longer vacation, consider finding a reputable kennel boarding.



Take a Fun Trip



Getting stuck in a rut can leave you feeling stressed, anxious, and even depressed. That’s where a short vacation can help. Make a plan before you go, pick an underrated destination and have fun!




Think you don’t have enough money to travel? There are plenty of
affordable yoga breaks
that you can go on anytime!
