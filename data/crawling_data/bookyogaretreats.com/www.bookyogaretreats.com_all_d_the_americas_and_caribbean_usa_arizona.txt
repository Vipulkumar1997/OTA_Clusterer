6 Ways Yoga Could Help You Learn a New Language
Did you know that when you started practicing yoga, you also started learning a new language? Sanskrit, that is. Think about it:
Savasana, Ahimsa, Ayurveda, Paschimottanasana…
Should we go any further?

Remote Yoga Retreats in the US

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.
