A Colombia yoga retreat, for unexpected tourist delights
Spend some time exploring one of South America's wonderful treasures! Whether you want to bond with nature or get caught up with its vibrant urban life, a Colombia yoga holiday has it all. Marvel over the romantic cobblestone streets of Cartagena or go salsa dancing in Cali. Of course, your trip here wouldn't be satisfying without a tour of the Amazon Jungle. And if you want a better glimpse of Colombia's history, try out trekking for a visit to pre-Incan tombs and statues.
