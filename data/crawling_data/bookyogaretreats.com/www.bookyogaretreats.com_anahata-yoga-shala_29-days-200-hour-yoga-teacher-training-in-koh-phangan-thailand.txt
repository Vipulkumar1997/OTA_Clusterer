Instructors







Vanessa Burger

Yoga Alliance RYT 200 (Yoga)
Shri Kali Ashram Yoga Alliance RYT 500 (Tantra Yoga)

With a deep knowledge and practice of Tantra yoga, shamanism, and Reiki, Vanessa blends her crazy wisdom with much humor, as she enjoys assisting her students to free themselves from their limited belief systems, encouraging them to live their truth of soul-consciousness-bliss, teaching them to expand their conscious awareness of themselves and the world they live in. Her free spirit has pushed her own ego's limits on her own path of healing. She has healed many of her students and inspired them to live a life of authentic bliss.





Anton Kazantsev

Anton met his first teacher with whom he practiced Tantra yoga in Osho style at Raja Budhi Yoga. He started to practice Hatha yoga in the new Iyengar school in Moscow, but unfortunately, he suffered a knee and lower back injury that took him five years to recover from. In 2005, Anton started to practice Vipassana and this changed his life completely. Anton studied yoga therapy in Russia in the tradition of T. Krishnamacharya. He studied Ashtanga Vinyasa, classical Iyengar yoga, Sukshma and Prana Vyayama, and Kundalini in the tradition of Dhirendra Brahmacharya.





Art McHeart

Art's expressive teaching style ranges from creatively infused, jovially energizing flows to deeply penetrating trauma releasing practices. His students are given the opportunity and encouraged to engage in a deep conversation with their body and opening up to the rhythms of their natural movement while embracing integrative self-healing. Art shares his practice internationally. He teaches classes, leads workshops, gives intensive training, and spreads heartfelt healing.


Location



The teacher training course will take place in Koh Phangan, Thailand. Koh Phangan is a little smaller and far less developed than her sister island, Koh Samui, and much larger than Koh Tao. The elder Buddhist monks' belief is that Koh Phangan Island carries the energy of transformation and since it is located under many crystal rocks, it is no wonder that there are so much yoga and Tantra on the magical island of transformation.
Anahata Yoga Shala is located on the west side of the island, where the sunsets are beautiful all the time. It is located about 30 meters from the Bovy Beach in the neighborhood of Sri Thanu on the magical island Koh Phangan, Gulf of Thailand, and close by you can walk to the famous Zen Beach, where you can join in on the daily Kirtan and musical sunset sessions on the beach overlooking the blissful sunsets.
Sri Thanu is also known as the conscious community where most of the yoga, Tantra, and vegan conscious restaurants and other interesting places and happenings of the island are located. Surrounded by a lot of jungle and coconut trees, the shala is kept cool, along with mosquito nets allowing the student to Shivasana in peace and calm.

Food



Daily healthy vegan brunch is included in the course. There are also many delicious vegan, gluten-free, and vegetarian restaurants to choose from. For the students still on a non-vegetarian diet, there is fresh fish, poultry, and red meat available around the village, also within walking distance from Anahata Yoga Shala.

Trains leave Bangkok several times daily, the journey time is about 12 hours. Sleeping booths are available for some services. Leaving the train at Surat Thani, the transfer by coach or taxi from Surat Thani station to Donsak pier takes about one hour. From Donsak, the ferry journey takes three hours to Koh Phangan.
