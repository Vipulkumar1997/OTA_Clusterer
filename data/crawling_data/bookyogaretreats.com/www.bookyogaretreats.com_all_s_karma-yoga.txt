Strive for perfection on a Karma yoga retreat
“Your work is your responsibility, not its result,” said Bhagavad Gita, the founder of Karma yoga. This increasingly popular style of yoga teaches selfless action as a way to perfection. If you want to walk the path of spiritual liberation, according to Hinduism, Karma yoga is the path of unselfish action. If this sounds appealing to you, book a Karma yoga retreat and hit refresh on your spiritual life.

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
