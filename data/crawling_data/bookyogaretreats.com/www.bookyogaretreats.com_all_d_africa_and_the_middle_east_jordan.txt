Pack your bags for memorable yoga vacations in Jordan
From wondrous ruins to vast deserts, a Jordan yoga retreat may just be the break you need. For a bit of insight in the country's history, Petra and Jerash are the places to go. Momentous buildings and poetic architecture are what it's all about here. And if you want to add something uniqueness to your already blossoming yoga holiday, swim around to your heart's content in the Dead Sea! This well-known body of water has so much salt that you're free to float however and wherever you please.

It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
