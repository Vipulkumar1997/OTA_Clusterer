Learn Tantra yoga on your next yoga holiday
Tantra yoga is probably one of the most misinterpreted style of yoga. You should know it’s related to a lot more than just sex. The practice itself combines a lot of asanas, energy work, and mantras. This way, yogis can gain inner power and serenity. ‘Tantra’ means ‘technique’, so this yoga style focuses on personal growth and control in order to reach your full potential. Sexuality is only one aspect of this very complex yoga style. Book a yoga retreat that teaches Tantra yoga and prepare to learn how to be in union with the universe!

Savasana, Ahimsa, Ayurveda, Paschimottanasana…
Should we go any further?

Remote Yoga Retreats in the US
If you’re feeling the strains and stresses of everyday life, why not escape from it all at one of the many remote yoga retreats in the US? Yoga has been increasing in popularity in the country over the past decade, meaning there are now dozens of world-class teachers across the country.

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
