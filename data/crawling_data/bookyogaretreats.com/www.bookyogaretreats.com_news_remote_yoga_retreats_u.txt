Top 5 Remote Yoga Retreats in the US


Damien Troy
thu November 30, 2017
If you’re feeling the strains and stresses of everyday life, why not escape from it all at one of the many remote yoga retreats in the US? Yoga has been increasing in popularity in the country over the past decade, meaning there are now dozens of world-class teachers across the country.

Most
yoga retreats in the US
are highly acclaimed to help you take your yoga practice to the next level, and you can now find a retreat just about anywhere in the country. However, if you are looking to go beyond the tourist hubs and practice yoga in a quiet environment while overlooking stunning coastlines and pristine forests, these
remote yoga retreats in the US
will sweep you off your feet.

Don’t forget to apply for your
USA visa
before your trip. Otherwise, you won’t be getting very far!



1. Sagrada Wellness, California

Sagrada Wellness
is based on the stunning Central Coast of California region and offers a peaceful retreat for both those who are new to such a trip and those already familiar with
yoga and meditation
.

If you’re interested in learning more about how yoga and meditation can connect you with your spiritual self, the
Rolling Meadows retreat
could be the right one for you. Set in the stunning countryside of mid-coast Maine, guests will stay in a restored 1840’s New England farmhouse, which offers home comforts while remaining far away from everyday stress.

The nearest town, Belfast, is 15 miles (24 km) away, so you won’t be disturbed during your course of yoga and relaxation. If you’re looking to go one step further in your spiritual journey, you could try a silent retreat which will allow your mind and body to be quiet in a way that you’ve likely never experienced before.



3. Zen Den Yoga School, Florida

Zen Den Yoga School
, you can do exactly that. The resort-style set up will give guests plenty of time to enjoy lounging by the pool, as well as participating in healing massage sessions, daily mediation, and various different yoga classes.
