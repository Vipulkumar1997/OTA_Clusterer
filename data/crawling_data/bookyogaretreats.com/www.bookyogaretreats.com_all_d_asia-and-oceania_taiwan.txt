Feel refreshed and renewed on a Taiwan yoga getaway
Welcome to an Asian destination that will delight any traveler! Taiwan has sensational food, traditional festivals, and a diverse range of sights to see. We highly recommend Kenting National Park, which is the country’s first ever national park. It features plenty of wonderful beaches and great hiking trails. But if you’d rather join the hustle and bustle of the city, Taipei is the place to be. You’re definitely in for an exciting and vibrant yoga retreat in Taiwan. So, why don’t you book yours today?

Savasana, Ahimsa, Ayurveda, Paschimottanasana…
Should we go any further?

Remote Yoga Retreats in the US

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
