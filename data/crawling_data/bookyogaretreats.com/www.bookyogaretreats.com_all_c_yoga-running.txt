Yoga and running retreats for your body, soul, and mind
In order to join a yoga and running retreat, one must train their stamina and strength. Considered as a form of wellness, running helps you to relax your soul and mind away from all the stresses of your life. Before you head out for some running, get yourself stretching with yoga practices to flex and relieve every tension in your body. What is even better is that, while you are on your running adventure or just doing simple yoga practices, you will get to enjoy beautiful picturesque views at the same time. If that sounds good, why not start joining a running and yoga vacation now!

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
