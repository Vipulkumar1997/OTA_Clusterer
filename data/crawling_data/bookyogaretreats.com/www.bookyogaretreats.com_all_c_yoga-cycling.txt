An adventure with cycling and yoga holidays
The yoga and cycling retreat is a great choice to those who are looking for health and wellness, at the same time. Before setting out to the day’s adventure, start your day with some yoga practices to get your body all warmed and prepared. Yoga helps to restore and relax, not only to the body but also to the mind. Enjoy the rest of the day with cycling to the roads less travelled, while embracing the beauty of the surrounding views along the way.

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
