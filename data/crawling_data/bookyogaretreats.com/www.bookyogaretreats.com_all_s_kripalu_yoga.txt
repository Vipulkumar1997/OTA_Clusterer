Kripalu yoga retreats, for a gentle and soothing experience
Kripalu yoga is also known as meditation in motion. This yoga style was developed by The Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health, a non-profit organization that operates a health and yoga retreat in Massachusetts. It emphasizes meditation, breath-work, inward focus, and spirituality. On top of that, you will learn how to move your practice off the mat and on to your daily life! The way you coordinate your breath to the asanas is very important in the Kripalu yoga classes. Book your spot in a Kripalu yoga retreat today and take your yoga practice to a new level!

It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
