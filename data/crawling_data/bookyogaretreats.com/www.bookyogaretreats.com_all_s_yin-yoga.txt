Yin yoga retreats, for deep stretching and inner peace
On a Yin yoga holiday, your sessions will usually be combined with Chi practices to help you with your meditation. Knowing the Chi energy that flows throughout your body will also lower your chances of injuries or pain. You should know that during the Yin yoga practice, you’re going to sustain each asana for at least 45 seconds. This will have a deeply stretching effect on your ligaments, tissues, and muscles. You will instantly feel more relaxed, connected, and at peace. Book your spot into a Yin yoga retreat today and see the countless benefits for yourself!

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
