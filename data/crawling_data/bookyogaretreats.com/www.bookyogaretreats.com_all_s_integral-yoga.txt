Transformational Integral yoga retreats for you
Established in 1921 by Sri Aurobindo and The Mother, Integral yoga is a great way to help elevate your spirit, as well as your body. Also called supramental yoga, Integral yoga is actually a yoga-based philosophy and practice. The ultimate goal is the self-relevation of divinity in all things. This can be achieved through practice, retaining the idea that the Spirit manifests itself in a process of involution. If you’re curious to find more about this cryptic yoga style, book an Integral yoga retreat now!

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
