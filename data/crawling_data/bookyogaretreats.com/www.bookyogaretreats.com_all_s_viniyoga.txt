Experience a different style of yoga practice
Viniyoga is a gentler type of Hatha yoga, also known as yoga of the heart. On a Viniyoga retreat, you will practice plenty of yoga poses, pranayama breathing, mantra chanting, and meditation. So, expect to learn more about the spiritual side of yoga too! Additionally, you should know that Viniyoga will be adapted to your own ability. Such personalized sessions will only add to the quality of your overall practice. Viniyoga therapy is also about integrating your breath flow into the movements. By doing so, you will feel more balanced and at peace!
