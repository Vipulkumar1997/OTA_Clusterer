Let tranquility in on a Kriya yoga retreat
Kriya yoga was founded in the year 1861 by Indian saint and yogi Mahavatar Babaji. The style was popularized in the West by Paramahansa Yogananda through his 1946 book, “Autobiography of a Yogi”. Kriya yoga focuses on spiritual development and welcomes tranquility into the lives of its practitioners. If you want to learn and practice Kriya yoga, we recommend you book yourself a spot on a Kriya yoga holiday today!

Savasana, Ahimsa, Ayurveda, Paschimottanasana…
Should we go any further?

Remote Yoga Retreats in the US

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
