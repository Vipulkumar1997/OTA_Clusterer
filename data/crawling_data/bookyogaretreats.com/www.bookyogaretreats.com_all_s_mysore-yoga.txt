Embrace serenity on a Mysore yoga retreat
Mysore yoga is a blossoming yoga style that was introduced by Sri K. Pattabhi Jois in the city of Mysore, India. Mysore yoga focuses on one-to-one instruction, being the traditional way of practicing Ashtanga yoga. If you want a personalized approach to your yoga practice, we recommend you book a spot on a Mysore yoga retreat and discover this special style of yoga.

Remote Yoga Retreats in the US

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
