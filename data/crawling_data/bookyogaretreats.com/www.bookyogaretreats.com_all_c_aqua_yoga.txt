Relax your body completely with an aqua yoga retreat
An aqua yoga retreat will have you practice yoga in a mineral water pool or in the sea. You will stretch and strengthen, while the water will relax your body. Some aqua yoga retreats also offer aqua healing therapies or aqua floating meditation sessions, for you to relax even deeper. We all know that the healing power of water is huge.

You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
