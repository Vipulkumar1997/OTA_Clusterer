Improve your inversions with Aerial yoga retreats
Also known as Antigravity yoga or AG yoga, Aerial yoga is a new style that has caught yogis’ attention in the past years. The hammock is the essential prop that will support your body throughout the practice. You should know that Aerial yoga is not suitable for pregnant women and people with vertigo. But the best part about an Aerial yoga class is that inversions and more complex asanas will suddenly seem a lot easier to do. Book your Aerial yoga retreat today and prepare to float your way into the perfect yoga pose!

It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
