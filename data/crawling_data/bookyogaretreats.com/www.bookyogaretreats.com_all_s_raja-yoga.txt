Gain control over your mind on a Raja yoga vacation
As “raja” means king, Raja yoga is also known as Royal yoga. It is known as the oldest system of yoga, one that helps you control not only your body, but your emotions and your mind too. On a Raja yoga retreat, you will focus on meditation practices and learn the path to self-knowledge. You will experience an ancient yoga style, as it was taught by the early masters. Some Raja yoga retreats also offer discussions on yoga philosophy.

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
