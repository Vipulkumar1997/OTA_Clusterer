Energize yourself on a Rocket yoga retreat
Larry Schultz developed Rocket yoga in the 1980s. It is rooted in Ashtanga Vinyasa yoga, but the asanas are simplified so everyone can practice them, even beginners or the less flexible yogis. Rocket yoga offers a great substitute for the more advanced poses. So, expect to never get stuck again while trying to get into a pose. Book your Rocket yoga retreat today and prepare to progress faster, improve your flexibility, and calm your mind!

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
