An AcroYoga retreat, for teamwork, strength, balance, and flexibility
AcroYoga is also known as flying yoga, and as you might have guessed, it combines yoga and acrobatics. But you really don’t need to be a gymnast or circus acrobat to practice it. All you need is great teamwork. One person will be the base, supporting the other person who will move into several positions. This way, you will train your strength, balance, and flexibility. If you are travelling alone, there is always someone to practice with you in an AcroYoga holiday. Book your spot today and prepare to experience all benefits of Acroyoga classes!

It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
