Embark on an enjoyable El Salvador yoga experience
Despite being the smallest and most densely populated country in Central America, El Salvador has a lot more to offer than you think. With pristine forests, crystal clear lakes, and hot surfing spots, your yoga retreat here will be full of great surprises! What we recommend the most is definitely the butterfly spotting in Barra de Santiago. Other than that, you can visit coffee plantations, go horseback riding or white water rafting, and even sail on volcanic lakes. Make the most of your next vacation by booking an El Salvador yoga retreat!
