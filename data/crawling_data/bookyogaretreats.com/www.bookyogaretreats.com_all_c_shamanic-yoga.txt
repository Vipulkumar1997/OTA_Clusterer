Rebuild your soul with a shamanic healing and yoga retreat
During a yoga and shamanic retreat, you will learn to channel spiritual, transcendental energies into your world. Shamanic healing is part of a holistic system that will help you reach an altered state of consciousness, through the use of divine plants, rituals, or a shamanic diet. Shamans will help restore portions of your soul. They will put you in a trance, so you can see life with a different pair of eyes. A shamanic yoga retreat can be a revelatory experience.

How a Short Yoga Break Can Immediately Boost Your Mood
It’s starting to get to you. Every day, you wake up, spend most of your time working, and then try to squeeze a little fun into your schedule before the family demands your attention. You’re an adult, and you know this is part of life. But it sure would be nice to stop feeling so irritable and tired.

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
