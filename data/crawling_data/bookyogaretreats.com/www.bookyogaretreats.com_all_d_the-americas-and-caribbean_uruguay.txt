Get lost in a haze of sightseeing on a Uruguay yoga retreat
In contrast to other South American countries, Uruguay is often overlooked. This is because most people think that there isn't much to do here. Well, that is surely not the case! If you decide to go on a yoga holiday in Uruguay, expect to stumble upon wonderful sights. We advise you to visit the Barrio Histórico of Colonia del Sacramento, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The mix of the old and new in this town will dazzle you. What could be a more perfect place for rejuvenation and reflection?

Pros and Cons of Drinking Water during Yoga
Is it okay to drink water during yoga practice to quench that burning thirst, or do you better wait until class is over before you have your next refreshing sip? This has been an ongoing debate among yoga students, teachers, and gurus.
