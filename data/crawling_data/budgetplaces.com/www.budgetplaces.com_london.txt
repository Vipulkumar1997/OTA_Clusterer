About London

London is quite simply the place to be; the UK capital is one of the coolest, most dynamic and cosmopolitan cities on the planet with a virtually endless array of attractions for all tastes and ages. As the saying goes: “when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life.”
Highlights:
Watch the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, see ancient treasures from around the globe in the British Museum, shop until you drop on Oxford Street and take in the view from way up high on the London Eye. In the evening check out the city’s famous nightlife in trendy Soho and Camden or catch a West End show before heading back to one of our hotels in London.
Food & Drink:
The infamous fish and chips are a must while in London, and there's nothing better than tucking into a steaming shepherd's pie on a rainy London day. Savour the city's international flavours by going in for dumplings in Chinatown or trying out a creamy curry at one of London's many traditional Indian restaurants.
Off the Beaten Track:
Travelling with kids? Take them to the Hackney City Farm just above Shoreditch where they can pet the animals and you can partake in a farm-fresh brunch. For an alternative bird's-eye view to the London Eye, try the Emirates Air Line Cable Car across the Thames from the Royal Docks to The O2 Arena.
Are you packing your bags yet? Reserve one of our hotels in London and you'll be on your way!
