About Brussels

Highlights:
Polished Brussels exudes elegances from each of its quaint cafés, cobblestone squares and charming churches. The city's mascot, its cheeky little statue, the Manneken Pis, gets dressed up in whimsical costumes ranging from Elvis to Nelson Mandela and everything in between. Just steps away is Brussels' Grand Place, the buzzing central square the rest of the city swirls around. Here you'll be surrounded by opulent buildings bedecked in gold trim, and the marvellous Flower Carpet in August. An art lover's paradise, the Sablon neighbourhood contains the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, the Centre for Fine Arts and the Magritte Museum, the surrealist son of Belgium. The young and the young at heart will love the Brussels Comic Book Museum as well as the awesome Atomium, a gigantic model of an atom housing various exhibitions, and the Mini-Europe Park, where you can wander by models of Europe's top architectural gems. Finally, don't forget to check out the European Union buildings, glittering edifices on the edge of the Jubelpark, before heading back to one of our hotels in Brussels.
Food & Drink:
Belgium is famous for its beer and chocolate, both of which are on offer in Brussels! When you need to wet your whistle, you can sip on Saisons, Belgian blondes, and fruity lambics. Every beer has its own distinctive glass, so order at random for the most variety! Belgium's coveted chocolates are legendary, and in Brussels you can pick up these blissful blends at Neuhaus,  Frédéric Blondeel, Godiva and Leonidas among countless others. Finally, if you're feeling peckish, pick up some frites on the go, preferably smothered in andalouse, a sauce of tomato paste, mayonnaise and peppers.
Find one of our hotels in Brussels that's perfect for you and see why Belgium is the place to be!
