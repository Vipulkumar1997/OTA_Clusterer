About Prague

Highlights:
It's impossible not to fall in love with Prague. With its gingerbread house architecture scattered around cobblestone squares, this Czech city will give you an eyeful of stunning sights. Start off by crossing Charles Bridge, where you'll wander by artists hawking their wares and watercolours as you cross the Vltava River. Up on Golden Lane, you'll find colourful houses littered along this alleged alchemists' alley, one of which where writer Franz Kafka once resided. From here you're perfectly poised to visit the medieval Prague Castle and the Gothic-style St Vitus Cathedral, which will keep you occupied for the better part of a day. After you've soaked up the views on castle hill, head to the Old Town Square where you can marvel over the magical Prague Astronomical Clock with its golden gears, and appreciate Czech art at its finest in the Prague National Gallery. A cruise down the Vltava makes a perfect evening activity before heading back to one of our hotels in Prague for a well-deserved rest.
Food & Drink:
Packing a punch of flavours, Czech goulash is slow-food at its finest. This rich stew incorporates tender braised beef and veggies with a side of Prague's famous bread dumplings. Pair it with a Pilsner (Prague's local beer) and you've got the makings of a fantastic meal! Don't miss the savoury street food found at sausage stands where you can pick up a sauerkraut-topped brat. If you've got a sweet tooth, make sure to sample trdelnik, a curly cue of a pastry sprinkled with sugar.
Off the Beaten Track:
David Černý's offbeat art can be found throughout Prague, most notably his climbing alien baby sculptures on the Žižkov TV Tower. Černý's creations stick out in classical Prague, so make sure to go hunting for all of his offbeat gems!
This storybook city is a must on any traveller's list, so have a look at our hotels in Prague and plan your next getaway!
