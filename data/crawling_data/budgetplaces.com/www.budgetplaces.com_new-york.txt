About New York

Highlights:
New York City – the Big Apple, the city that never sleeps, and immortalised in Frank Sinatra's famous song – in a single day, you could take an early morning stroll across the Brooklyn Bridge, shop Soho, picnic in Central Park, see the sun set from the top of the Empire State Building, and top it all off with an evening Broadway show. Museum hop to your heart's content from the MoMA to the American Museum of Natural History, wander through the lofty New York Public Library and Grand Central Station, catch a Yankees or a Knicks game, and ride on the Ferris wheel on Coney Islands' beachside boardwalk. The best part? All of our hotels in New York are right in the heart of the action.
Food & Drink:
The New York City food scene is a smorgasbord of every imaginable style and ingredient under the sun. You'll have to work up an appetite to fit in all of the city's standbys, starting with a cheesy slice of New York pizza from Joe's, a Gray's Papaya hot dog smothered in ketchup, mustard and caramelised onions, a triple-decker pastrami sandwich from Carnegie Deli, chicken and waffles for a taste of soul food in Harlem, and Peking duck and dumplings in Chinatown. Save room for dessert, because it would be a sin not to try a cannoli from Ferrara Bakery in Little Italy and a slice of Junior's New York cheesecake in Brooklyn. Don't worry – you'll be doing lots of walking.
Off the Beaten Track:
The New York High Line, completed in 2014, is a 1.5 mile-long park spanning the Meatpacking District and Chelsea overtop the former railroad tracks of what was once the West Side Line. Now you can stroll along the train tracks full of flowers, greenery and park benches and enjoy views of the Hudson River and the city.
Everyone is dying to take this trip, and choosing one of our hotels in New York is the first step to turning your dream vacation into a reality.
