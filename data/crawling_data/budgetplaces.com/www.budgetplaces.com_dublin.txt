About Dublin

Highlights:
From the rich red pub fronts of Temple Bar to pedestrian Grafton Street lined with historic brick buildings and shops to the emerald expanses of St. Stephen's Green and Trinity College, Dublin is a postcard of a city. There are many sights that merit a visit, including the ancient Book of Kells in the Trinity College Library, the busty statue of Molly Malone and the dapper bronze likeness of James Joyce, and the religious sites of Christ Church Cathedral and St. Michan's Church, complete with a grisly crypt. On the flip side, Dublin is a city to be experienced. Chat up the locals in one of Temple Bar's lively pubs while the band plays Irish folk music, catch a Gaelic football game at Croke Park Stadium, and picnic in the sprawling Phoenix Park. Our hotels in Dublin are nearby all of these top sights, but should you ever find yourself in need of directions, just ask a friendly Dubliner.
Food & Drink:
Drinks in Dublin are a no-brainer – you can pick your poison from beer and whiskey, with mandatory visits to the Guinness Storehouse and the Old Jameson Distillery. With all the drinking you'll be doing, it's a good thing Irish eats are hearty, from savoury stews loaded up with tender beef, potatoes and veg, to fresh fish and chips, to piping hot meat pies. Don't skip out on dining in a traditional Irish pub – it's a quintessential Dublin experience!
Off the Beaten Track:
While Ireland calls to mind rolling green hills and dramatic cliffs, Dublin is a cosmopolitan city. To catch a glimpse of the Irish Sea, take a 40-minute journey on the DART to the seaside town of Bray, where the Bray Head Cliff Walk winds along the sea cliffs through the green hills for 7 kilometres before finishing up in Greystones.
Make your way to the Emerald Isle, starting by choosing from our amazing hotels in Dublin!
