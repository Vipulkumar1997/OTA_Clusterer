Education & research


















Studying in Valais

Valais attaches great value to the quality of the courses it offers. Located in the heart of the Alps and at the centre of Europe, the canton has several aces up its sleeve: bilingualism, pleasant living conditions which are conducive to learning and a low cost of living. Infrastructure based on state-of-the-art technology provides the best possible basis for the acquisition of new skills. Valais is an attractive and tranquil region. It is a place where you can pursue your hobbies all year round in the midst of nature.















HES-SO Valais-Wallis

The Valais campus of the University of Applied Sciences and Arts, Western Switzerland (Haute Ecole Spécialisée de Suisse occidentale – HES-SO) is positioned midway between research, teaching and innovation. As the organisation which symbolises the canton, it offers nine courses of study and consists of four colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management and Tourism, the College of Social Work and the College of Health. It awards Bachelor of Science degrees, as well as offering a Master of Science in numerous fields. It also organises continuing education and post-doctoral courses. With its six research institutes, HES-SO Valais is currently engaged in more than 950 research projects. It attracts 2,000 students every year and has 500 employees.















Campus Valais/Wallis

The Valais campus of the Federal Polytechnic College of Lausanne (École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)) represents one of the most important strategic projects for the canton's future. What is at stake here is the creation of an innovative partnership covering the entire value chain, from theoretical research (EPFL) to applied research and development (HES-SO Valais-Wallis) and economic development (The Ark Foundation). The goal is to create a joint campus in Sion uniting eleven faculties of EPFL and the College of Engineering of HES-SO Valais, as well as promoting the exploitation of synergies between the various local research institutions.















Research institutes

Research is conducted in the canton of Valais in a wide variety of scientific fields, ranging from energy, tourism, health, social affairs, management and ICT to biotechnology and industrial systems. The research conducted in Valais has global implications, as well as being a central factor in economic growth and playing a key role in creating highly skilled jobs for the canton's students. In the last resort the canton's research institutes, working together with local small to medium-sized businesses, develop innovative solutions with a high degree of excellence, thus creating significant added value for the Valais economy.















Business support

The canton of Valais is one of the most promising cantons for innovative companies: its economic network consists of more than 15,000 companies, and it is home to numerous technology parks operated by companies and start-ups in the fields of information technology, biotechnology and the natural sciences. The canton's central geographical position between major European international airports represents a strategic advantage for business development. In a unique environment with highly qualified staff, state-of-the-art infrastructure and low operating costs offer many opportunities. Expert institutions can help businesses relocate and provide advice and assistance in the implementation of new projects.

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
