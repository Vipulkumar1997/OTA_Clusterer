More information













With its lively past, Valais has many stories to tell. Castles, fortresses and museums remind us of periods in history when emotions ran high. Over many centuries, the people of Valais have learned to celebrate in style and seize every opportunity they can to get together and socialise. Cow fights and cattle drives to Alpine pastures live on here today. A Valais without these utterly typical traditions is unthinkable. They stand in contrast to the internationally renowned music festivals, exhibitions and theatre productions that embody the modern side of Valais with its cosmopolitan and life-affirming flair.
























Culture

The cultural wealth, creativity and diversity of the Valais are all on display in numerous museums, galleries and exhibitions. Always worth a visit!






















Castles & fortresses

A tale of wealthy merchants, mercenaries and traders – the venerable manors, castles and fortresses of the region make the exciting history of the Valais come alive.






















Cow fights

A unique spectacle: the powerful Herens cows challenge one another by locking horns – feverishly cheered on by their proud owners and the enthusiastic crowds.






















Traditions

Customs and traditions are cared for and preserved in the Valais. Visitors will find unforgettable experiences and fascinating impressions in their interaction with Valais culture.






















St Bernard dogs

They are the best-known and most-loved rescuers in Switzerland. The gentle St Bernard dogs from the Great Saint Bernard Hospice have become icons.

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
