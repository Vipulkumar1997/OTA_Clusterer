Situated on a south-facing slope high above the Visp Valley, Törbel is one of the few authentic Valais mountain villages: centuries-old sun-scorched enclosed houses, narrow passageways, traditional artisanal labour at the water mill, a rift saw and churn at the village stream.

The Moosalp lies about 500m above Törbel, and much its high moor and low moor biotopes are under protection. But the Moosalp also offers many activities for winter sports enthusiasts, as well as a broad network of hiking trails. And during the summer it is the home of a popular alpine festival.

This destination is a perfect place for

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
