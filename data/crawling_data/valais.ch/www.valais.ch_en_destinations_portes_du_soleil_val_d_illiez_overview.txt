Overview

Weather













Nestled at the foot of the majestic Dents du Midi massif, the Val d’Illiez municipality also includes Les Croset and Champoussin. It stretches several kilometres through a neighbouring valley of the Rhone by the same name: the Val d’Illiez.

During the winter the Portes du Soleil ski resort offers nearly endless possibilities. And in the summer visitors are thrilled to discover the many hikes, bike tours and the Via Ferrata, a secured climbing route. The thermal baths are unique: the waters are rich in healing minerals and originate from 1200m depths to emerge into the outside pool at 32° C, and create a naturally warm river.

This destination is a perfect place for

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
