The people of Evolène honour their traditions, seen in the trachten (traditional folk garb) worn to church every Sunday.
The region offers a grand panorama, stretching from the upper Val d’Hérens to the Italian border. The area’s highest point is the peak of the Dent Blanch (4357m).
The picturesque natural setting leaves its indelible mark on visitors. Untouched glaciers, the Borgne flowing through the valley, as well as the majestic mountains are the inspiration for extraordinary stories and beautiful images.

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
