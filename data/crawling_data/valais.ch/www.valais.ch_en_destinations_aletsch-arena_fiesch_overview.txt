The Vios village (later named Viesch) was first mentioned in 1203. The steady growth of the glacier was the greatest threat to the village in previous centuries. Locals regularly prayed that the glacier should melt. Since 2010, however, Fiescher citizens have the Papal blessing to pray that the glacier (part of the UNESCO world natural preservation site) should be sustained.

Take the teleferique from Fiesch to the Eggishorn. At 2927m, the peak offers spectacular views to the entire length of the Aletsch Glacier and smaller sibling the Fiescher Glacier.

A family paradise, this resort has been awarded the Family Destination label by the Swiss Tourism Federation.

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
