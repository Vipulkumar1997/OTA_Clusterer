Vouvry is a typical Chablaisian village in the lower Valais, a short distance from Lake Geneva. As early as the 5th century the Burgondes stopped here, tasting the local cuisine and native wine – eventually settling permanently.

Today charming shops, authentic restaurants and historic architecture draw visitors. Just north of the town centre, the Porte du Scex is a narrow between the steep base of the mountain and the Rhone River. The castle of Porte du Scex is no longer a customs site as it was in medieval times; rather it is the site of cultural exhibits.

This destination is a perfect place for

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
