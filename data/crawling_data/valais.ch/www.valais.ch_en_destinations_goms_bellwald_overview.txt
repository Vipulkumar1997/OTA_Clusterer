Bellwald is extremely family friendly – thanks not only to the absence of cars in its centre, but also thanks to the many family activities on offer during the summer and winter months. Here, everbody can enjoy non-stop outdoor action. Chairlifts bring guests swiftly up to an altitude of 2,560 m

Bellwald enjoys many sunny days each year – which can be seen in tanned wooden houses and barns so typical of the Valais. On the edge of the historic part of the village visitors will find the baroque church of the Seven Joys of Mary.

A family paradise, this resort has been awarded the Family Destination label by the Swiss Tourism Federation.

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
