More information













With vineyards covering 5,000 hectares, Valais is the largest wine-making region in Switzerland: magnificent landscapes with unusually sunny hillsides, almost 60 grape varieties that form the basis for a number of great wines, and traditions that lend them character and identity. Fine aromas, intensely flavoured fruits, rare spices and golden cereals are the result of thousands of hours of sunshine that turn the Valais into a garden full of tasty delights and make it a source of inspiration for gourmet chefs throughout the land.
























Wine tasting

Steep hillsides, the ideal climate and terroir make the Valais an exceptional winegrowing region. Vintners tend their numerous varietals with a great deal of passion and success.






















Raclette tasting

Raclette is the most famous culinary speciality of the Valais. Many restaurants and cheeseries invite visitors to come taste this melted cheese dish. A special treat!






















Baking rye bread

Rye bread is just as much part of the Valais as raclette and wine. The hearty bread is as full of character and just as unique as its surroundings.






















Saffron

Probably the most exclusive Valais speciality is grown on a sunny high plateau above Brig: saffron has been grown for hundreds of years here in the idyllic village of Mund.






















Visit the chestnut groves of Valais

Chestnuts were once prized as a nutritious source of food in the Valais. Today the chestnut forests are great for walks. And in the autumn everyone can enjoy roasted chestnuts.

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
