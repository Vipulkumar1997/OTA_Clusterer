Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.

New covered car park at Betten cable car station
