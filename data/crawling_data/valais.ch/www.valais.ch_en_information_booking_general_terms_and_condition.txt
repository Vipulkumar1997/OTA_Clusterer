General Terms and Conditions











General Terms and Conditions of Valais/Wallis Promotion, Sion, Switzerland

Thank you for your interest in holidaying in Valais. Please read through these General Terms and Conditions of Valais/Wallis Promotion, 1951 Sion, Switzerland (hereinafter referred to as VWP) carefully. They serve as the basis for all bookings made at valais.ch.

I. Introduction

VWP provides a search platform on valais.ch, which brings together accommodation and tourism-related offers for destinations in Valais and from other providers, and makes these accessible for online booking.

II. Scope

These General Terms and Conditions apply when the User  books accommodation and other tourism-related offers via the www.valais.ch website. The General Terms and Conditions govern the relationship between the User and VWP. VWP provides the User with a search engine for accommodation and other tourist services offered in Valais. The offers published on www.valais.ch/book are posted by the various local tourism organisations and service providers on their own responsibility.

If the User decides to book a certain service, he will automatically be redirected to the booking platform of the respective provider. Bookings made on the booking platform of the chosen service provider are subject to that service provider’s general terms and conditions.

VWP does not offer any services of its own on www.valais.ch. VWP’s involvement is restricted to bringing together the tourism-related offers in Valais in a single search engine. VWP does not perform any other function; in particular, VWP does not have any obligation to provide advice and is not the contracting party for the services that are booked.

III. Booking and payment

If the User wishes to book a service and clicks on the advertised offer, he will automatically be redirected to the booking platform of his chosen provider. An “intermediate screen” will draw the User’s attention to the fact that he is now leaving www.valais.ch and entering the website of the chosen provider. The actual booking and handling of the booking takes place on the website of the respective provider (hereinafter referred to as the Service Provider). The Service Provider is responsible for the booking process and providing the booked services.

Payment for the booked services is subject to the terms and conditions of the Service Provider with whom the booking is made.

IV. Description of offers, contract terms and services

The Service Provider is solely responsible for compiling its own offer advertisements. It is responsible for providing a correct description of the services (holiday homes and apartments, rooms, package offers and any additional services) and prices.

V. Availability, changes to services and prices

The services published on www.valais.ch are not binding offers. Service providers reserve the right to change the advertised offers, prices etc. at any time prior to booking. The information published at the time of booking on the Service Provider’s booking site shall apply.

The User makes the Service Provider a binding offer. The Service Provider is free to accept this offer. If the Service Provider declines to accept such an offer, it must immediately notify the User accordingly.

VI. Cancellation and change of contract by the User

If the User wishes to change or cancel his booking, he must directly contact the Service Provider with which he made the booking. Changes, alterations to bookings and cancellations are subject to the Service Provider’s general terms and conditions. VWP draws the User’s attention to the fact that changes and cancellations of confirmed bookings may incur a charge.

VII. Cancellation and change of contract by the Service Provider

In their general terms and conditions, service providers reserve the right to change or cancel the booking under certain circumstances. The terms and conditions of the Service Provider with which the booking has been made shall apply.

VIII. Responsibility of the User

The User acknowledges that use of the internet entails certain risks. He is responsible for ensuring sufficient protection against malware and other harmful programs (viruses, etc.). Neither VWP nor its partners or service providers with which bookings are made are obliged to protect the User from such threats by means of special software etc.

IX. Responsibility of Valais/Wallis Promotion,

exclusion of liability
Valais/Wallis Promotion is not the contracting party for the booked services. Therefore, Valais/Wallis Promotion is not liable for proper performance of the contract for the booked services by the Service Provider. Should the User not be satisfied with the services provided or incur any loss, he must directly contact the Service Provider with which he made the booking. The latter is solely responsible for handling complaints etc.
The offers published on www.valais.ch are posted by the service providers themselves. Valais/Wallis Promotion is not able to check them for correctness etc. Therefore, Wallis Promotion is not liable for any false information, inexact descriptions etc.

Valais/Wallis Promotion provides the www.valais.ch booking platform free of charge. Valais/Wallis Promotion does not guarantee uninterrupted access to the booking platform and is not liable for any interruptions in service. Valais/Wallis Promotion particularly reserves the right to suspend the service in whole or in part during maintenance work etc. Valais/Wallis Promotion also reserves the right to remove services advertised on www.valais.ch, to suspend operation of the booking platform in whole or in part, etc. The User is not entitled to uninterrupted access to www.wallis.ch.

Furthermore, Valais/Wallis Promotion disclaims all liability for auxiliary personnel. Valais/Wallis Promotion is liable only for its own gross negligence and intent. Such liability is limited to direct, immediate loss.

These provisions regarding liability apply to contractual, quasi-contractual and non-contractual claims.

X. Information on tourism-related offers in Valais

When the User books tourist services on www.valais.ch, VWP saves their e-mail address and uses it to make contact in the form of welcome e-mails and newsletters or for promotional purposes. The various e-mails contain a link enabling the User to remove himself from the distribution list free of charge. The User may unsubscribe from this service at any time through newsletter@wallis.ch.

XI. Prevailing language

The General Terms and Conditions have been drawn up in German, French, English and Italian. In the event of discrepancies, the German version shall prevail.

XII. Applicable law and place of jurisdiction

The legal relationship with Valais/Wallis Promotion is governed exclusively by Swiss law with the exception of the Vienna Sales Convention (United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, CISG) and any renvoi.

Sion, Switzerland shall be the sole place of jurisdiction.

This clause is subject to mandatory provisions of the law which are not alterable by contract and the corresponding provisions of applicable international agreements.

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
