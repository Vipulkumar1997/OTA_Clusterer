More information













Valais and the sun – a true love affair. Our valley is blessed with 300 days of sunshine every year. While the temperatures down in the valley rise to 30°C, it remains refreshingly cool at a higher altitude. These are ideal conditions for all sporting activities in the great Valais outdoors: whether playing a round of golf on the high plateau, inline skating or cycling along the Rhône, climbing high up on fixed rope routes or riding the bike trails that wind their way down the mountainsides. And visitors curious to get a bird’s-eye view of Valais can do so while paragliding.
























Fixed rope routes

As the land of 45 four-thousanders, Valais is home to more hotspots for climbers and adventurers than anywhere else in Switzerland






















Outdoor/indoor pool

On hot summer days, there is nothing nicer than enjoying the fresh mountain breeze or taking a cooling dip in one of the public open-air pools.






















Water sports

The crystal-clear, refreshingly cool mountain lakes are an integral part of the magical Alpine landscape.

Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.
