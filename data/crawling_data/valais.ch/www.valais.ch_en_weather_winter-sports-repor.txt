Cabane des Violettes Crans-Montana



Few SAC mountain huts in Valais are as easy to reach by cable car as the Cabane des Violettes. This fact allows mountain guide Pierre-Olivier Bagnoud and chef Franck Reynaud to pamper guests with culinary treats at over 2,200 metres above sea level in the middle of the Crans-Montana ski area. Franck Reynaud also runs Le Pas de L’Ours, a gourmet temple with 17 Gault&Millau points, in the resort below.

New covered car park at Betten cable car station



A brand new multi-storey car park is being built at the Betten valley station (Aletsch Arena) that will house an additional 200 parking spaces. Bettmeralp Bahnen AG hopes the new building will improve the comfort and quality of the visitor experience. The new car park will have 568 parking spaces over five storeys and cost around CHF 13 million. The new car park is scheduled to open before Christmas 2017.
