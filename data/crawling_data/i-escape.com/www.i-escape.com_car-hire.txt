Car Hire
As you can imagine, we travel rather a lot, and in the process we have tested out lots of different car rental companies and brokers. Here are our 2 favourites - and some tips when booking.


Our favourite car rental company: Avis

Get a Quote Now
Reasons we like them:

They're a very reputable supplier, with over 5,000 locations in 165 countries
Almost all are "on site" within the airport, so no shuttling around to collect your car
They have a full-to-full fuel policy (you collect and return it full), which we think is the best
Or you can return it empty if you prefer (and they charge at below local pump price).
If you have questions during the booking process, their live chat is quick to help
We've used them regularly since 2005 and have never had any problems
If you do have any issues, it's easier taking them up with a direct supplier than if you've booked via a third-party consolidator
Things to be aware of:

They're a bit more expensive than the cheapest deals (but not a lot)
Some premium car rentals require 2 credit cards
The cost of reducing the damage / theft excess is not always clear during the booking process
Our favourite car rental broker: Rhino
Get a Quote Now
Reasons we like them:

They offer great value, comparing prices from big rental companies and local suppliers alike
Most suppliers allow you to ‘book now and pay later’ with just a small deposit payable to confirm
They also have a helpful Live Chat facility during the booking process
Many of our staff use them for their own holidays, and have never reported any problems
When enquiring through our link, you'll see the name of the supplier, their fuel policy, and whether it is at the airport terminal or not
Things to be aware of:

Having 2 middlemen means less precision about what car you are getting (we booked a 'Golf or similar' and got a significantly smaller Lancia Ypsilon')
Different suppliers have different T&Cs;, so be sure to read the small print
Some extras, like GPS and additional drivers, can be pricey
If you choose the 'Book now, Pay Later’ option, exchange rates may fluctuate before the final payment date
And 5 quick tips on booking your car rental
Read the full version
1. Check the fuel policy:
2. Check if the office is 'on site' (within the airport):
3. Check the excess amount, and the cost of reducing it:
insurance4carhire
4. Check the cost of a child seat (if relevant):
Bubble Bum
Trunki Boostapak
5. Get a good road map, satnav or app
NOTE:
While we've made every effort to select the best fit, we cannot guarantee that every provider will meet your price and service expectations. Delivery of all services is the provider's responsibility and not i-escape's. In some cases, i-escape receives commissions for bookings using the links above, but we regularly evaluate our providers and are happy to hear about your experience. While we take no responsibility for the providers' services,
your feedback
will assist us in our ongoing assessment.
