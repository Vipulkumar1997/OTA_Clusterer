“
Uber-cool converted colonial mansion in the hills of Santa Teresa, with killer views of Sugarloaf Mountain and Guanabara Bay
”


Nestled up in the hills of artsy Santa Teresa, this beautiful mansion has been thoughtfully converted by its Franco-Brazilian owners, Louis and Jeannine. Today it is a stylish boutique hotel, complete with a hip rooftop bar and pool; backing onto lush rainforest, it'd be easy to forget you were in Rio if it weren’t for the unbelievable postcard views of the city. Inside, urban Brazilian culture has been embraced, with contemporary graffiti and local artwork adorning the walls. Trendy yet timeless furniture features prominently, too - works by Brazilian design masters such as Sergio Rodrigues and Carlos Motta are pieces of art in themselves. And to top it off, all
12 spacious rooms
have floor-to-ceiling windows offering breathtaking views of Sugarloaf Mountain and Guanabara Bay.

A
lovely breakfast
is served either in the cool dining room, surrounded by curios collected by the owners over the years, or alfresco on the rooftop terrace. The small kitchen also opens for lunch, dishing up simple light meals. At night, friendly staff can suggest excellent local bars and restaurants, reserve tables and book taxis. All in all, a stylish yet easy base for the city.

Highs


Gorgeous rooftop pool, terrace and bar with panoramic views
A quiet location away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Rio
Ideal for anyone with a keen interest in design, and welcoming to couples and families alike
Relaxed, unpretentious but very knowledgeable staff
Great activities to help you get under the skin of this bewitching city: samba and Capoeira, favela tours and cookery classes





Lows


You’ll need cheap taxis to get around but this is not unusual in Rio, safety wise
No dinner served but staff can recommend restaurants or order in food for you. During the week, the rooftop bar is not always open in the evening
The pool is fairly small, more for cooling off in than doing lengths
Although families are welcome there are no baby cots, and extra beds are only for 0-4 year olds; if you're bringing an older child you'll need 2 rooms. Note, there are no twin rooms














Best time to go




“
We visited in April and found the weather just right - warm but not too hot and not too humid. Rain showers are more common at this time of year but they are usually short-lived. December - February offers the hottest weather, Carnival and biggest parties. July - September are the coolest months but also the driest. The hotel is open all year; stay over a weekend for the best of the local nightlife.
”



Our top tips




“
For the largest selection of bric-a-brac in Rio, visit the Praça Quinze antiques market on a Saturday morning. It’s set in historical Centro, under a noisy flyover. For better-quality antiques, head to Lapa on the first Saturday of the month.

The hotel can be be tricky to find, so ask for written Portuguese-language directions to show taxi drivers

Rooms

The 12 rooms (called suites) are split between the original house and an adjoining modern annexe, linked by a series of architectural bridges and stairways.
Decor is stylishly minimalist
, including designer chairs and artisanal rugs. Gorgeous modern bathrooms come with rain showers and Granado toiletries (a Brazilian environmentally friendly brand).
Huge windows
invite you to gaze at the views from the comfort of your kingsize bed, and all the modern-day essentials are in place: Nespressos, Satellite TV and Bluetooth music systems.

The
Master Suites
are vast, with incredible panoramic views of Guanabara Bay and Christ the Redeemer; one even has that view from its bathtub.
Deluxe Suites
are slightly smaller, but still roomy, uncluttered and airy, with views of Sugarloaf Mountain.
Standard Suites
are the smallest, but nothing else has been comprised on - you get views of Guanabara Bay, the same styling and the same comfortable bed.

Features include:


Air conditioning

Central heating

Coffee maker

Coffee tea making

Hairdryer

Ipod dock

Minibar/fridge

Phone

Safe box

Satellite tv

Toiletries

WiFi









Eating

For
breakfast
, expect a fine array of homemade fare to start: granolas, pastries and breads (don't miss the guava bread), along with freshly squeezed juices. You're then offered a la carte hot options - we particularly enjoyed the tapiocas with mushroom and Minas cheese.

The
lunchtime menu
, best eaten on the rooftop terrace, is a small selection of light dishes, salads and sandwiches, made with local ingredients. Our Club sandwich and quinoa, French bean, carrot and pesto salad were both very good (especially when washed down with a lunchtime Caipirinha!).

For
drinks and dinners
, Santa Teresa has plenty of options. Nearby
Bar do Mineiro
has a simple menu of local dishes, good cocktails and beers.
Aprazivel
, famous for its views, has a refined menu, but it's not cheap. Our favourite haunt was
Bistro Boutique
- a clothes shop by day, and small restaurant by night. Just a handful of tables sit in amongst the clothes rails; the food is simple but very good and there's a great atmosphere. They often have a live band on.

Features include:


Bar

Children meals

Coffee maker

Coffee tea making

Minibar/fridge
