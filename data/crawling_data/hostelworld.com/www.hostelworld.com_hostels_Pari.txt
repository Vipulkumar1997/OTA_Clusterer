About Paris

If you’re looking for the best hostels in Paris, you’ve come to the right place. There’s a good reason the French capital is on most backpackers’ bucket list – the city is home to some of the world’s most iconic monuments, including the world-famous Eiffel Tower; the Louvre Museum and its treasures including the Mona Lisa; the spectacular Notre-Dame cathedral, which was the setting for Victor Hugo’s most famous novel ‘The Hunchback of Notre-Dame’; and the chic Champs Elysées shopping boulevard. Not to mention awesome events such as the Roland Garros tennis tournament or Bastille Day.

Whatever your reason for coming to Paris, you’ll find the closest and cheapest Paris hostels on our site. Whether you want to be near
Montmartre
,
Bastille
,
Place d’Italie,
the Latin Quarter
, or
the Marais
district you’ll be able to find what you’re looking for easily. You can even narrow your search down to the most popular stations such as the
Gare de Lyon
,
Gare du Nord
or
Montparnasse
.

If you’re on a tight budget, try sorting your results by price to find the really cheap hostels in Paris. But hostels aren’t just for backpackers! You can now book private rooms in most hostels, meaning you can enjoy the social vibe with all the privacy and comfort of a hotel. So whether you’re a solo adventurer, a bunch of friends looking for fun or a couple going on a romantic holiday, don’t look any further because we have the accommodation you’re looking for.

If you’re not sure what to do when you arrive, here’s
15 free things to do in Paris
. Failing that, head straight for one of the many
mouth-watering restaurants
in the city. For anyone who’s been before, we’ve even got a blog post about how to
experience Paris like a local
.
