Who says you have to stay in a fancy-pants resort to experience tropical luxury? We have exotic hostels in some of the most staggeringly beautiful locations on the planet from tree houses in rainforests, infinity pools on mountains and beach huts on Caribbean shores. Whether you’re after a private room or a social dorm, here are some examples of how you can travel in paradise on a backpacker’s budget…

Monkey Backpackers Resort, Koh Rong Samloem, Cambodia

This hostel is tucked away in private beach on the tranquil island of Koh Rong Samloem and is only accessible by tail boat. Most of the island is unexplored, which means Mad Monkey is the ultimate base for outdoor adventure. The hostel’s schedule is jam-packed with activities and parties kicking off every night at the huge bar, so it’s super easy to meet other islanders. You can stay in a spacious dorm with separate showers or upgrade to a beachfront ensuite bungalow. Just heaven!

Casa Elemento, Minca, Colombia

Do you long for that fresh mountain air on your face? To wake up to the soft sound of toucans and monkeys? Then this hostel nestled in the Colombian Sierra Nevada Mountains is for you. Besides the 9.6 location rating from our customers, you can’t beat the family-type atmosphere here. There’s a campfire every night, a BBQ every Sunday *with smoked meats* and everything is locally sourced – even the beds are hand-made from jungle pine! We don’t have favourites, but we doubt things get any more blissful than watching the sunset in a giant hammock or eating breakfast in a treehouse looking out to sea. Read about Amy Baker’s experience at working at Casa Elemento

Far Out Beach Club, Ios, Greece


The Greek Islands are known for their wild nightlife, and this hostel is a fun-packed party zone anchored on Mylopotas beach with the idyllic backdrop of the Agean Sea. There’s accommodation for all budgets including dorms, privates, and cabins from £6 per night, plus the Far Out Camping site next door if you are on a cheaper budget. Aside from the pool parties and live music, there are facilities coming out of your eyeballs here, such as tennis and volleyball courts, a diving centre, sushi restaurant, and an outdoor cinema for chilling under the starry night sky. It certainly ticks all of our boxes!

Tribu Hostel, Holbox Island, Mexico

Ah, La Isla Holbox, where have you been all our lives? Holbox – meaning black hole – was founded in 1873 by pirates, and today it’s just 40 miles north-west of Cancun where the Gulf of Mexico meets the Caribbean. Today the island retains its magical charm with pink flamingos, colourful murals and yellow golf buggies, the only method of transport. The rainbow-painted Tribu hostel is just 40 metres from the beach. Owners David and Mia (plus Mango, the hostel dog) encourage you to “leave your footprint” and try Spanish language courses, yoga sessions, a “blind dinner”, or just simply flop in the hammocks for your Mexican siesta!

Let Hangover Hostels be your modern paradise. With free breakfast and morning yoga on the overhead deck, it’s no surprise our customers stay longer than they intended: “

Lol indeed ?

You can choose from dorm rooms, female sanctuary dorms (which includes a sanctuary pamper package on arrival) or a double room if you want to wake up to the Pacific horizon every day. It’s certainly not deserted here though – the hostel bar is one of the liveliest on the Island, and every month they ignite their beach to throw the legendary Full Moon Down Under party. A note to Scuba enthusiasts – you better get your flippers on because Base ensures that you that you won’t find a cheaper diving qualification anywhere else in Australia!

You can go for a double room or set up camp at this peaceful sanctuary on the remote and unspoiled island of Eleuthera. There’s discounted surf lessons and the owners encourage yogis to practice their cobras and lotuses with a work exchange for anyone interested in teaching. Our customers gave it a 10/10 “Value for Money” score which might refer to the free Wi-Fi, regular Poker nights, pizza nights, JAMNITEs and maybe that it’s on one of the most jaw-dropping, dazzling beaches we have ever seen!? Tip – don’t miss the annual Pineapple Festival in Gregory Town which honours the pineapple farming with fruity activities such as the Pineappleman Sprint Triathlon!

Smugglers cove is not all that.

Staff are abrupt, dorm is too big, and no lockers.
The food isn’t wonderful and it’s OK to have spoil but it need to a) be open and b) have room around it to chill.

In fact of the 7 hostels I stayed on on Fiji it came in the bottom half.

Awwww my friend owns Good Vibes in Gili Trawangan, Indonesia! Greg is the nicest guy ever 🙂 such beautiful bungalows he has created! And it’s just as good as u said it is! They have a rule here in Gili T that no dorms are allowed more than 3 beds so Good Vibes private rooms are a much better idea

My friend, Andrew, is one of the co-owners of Casa Elemento.  Really proud of all the reviews they’ve been getting through the years for a Hostel that’s only a few years’ old.  Glad it made your list, as well!
