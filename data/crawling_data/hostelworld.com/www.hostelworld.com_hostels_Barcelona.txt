About Barcelona

It’s safe to say that hostels in Barcelona are some of the best in the world. Whether you’re in search of a luxurious private room or want to find the cheapest deal,
Barcelona Hostel Bible
Youth hostels in Barcelona are a reflection of the city’s attitude, fusing traditional Catalan culture with modern design and facilities. We have properties all over the city,
Foodies will be right at home in the city as well. La Boqueria attracts over 45,000 visitors a day with its cheeses, charcuterie, seafood, and fresh produce.
Some of the best areas to stay include Barceloneta for the beaches, the port district of El Raval for its food, diversity and drinking,
We’ve only scratched the surface of what the Catalan Capital has to offer. There’s no shortage of restaurants, stunning architecture, art, museums and more.
