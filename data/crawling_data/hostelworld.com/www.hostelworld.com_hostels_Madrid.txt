About Madrid

What could possibly be better than a Madrid hostel (or hostal in Spanish) when it comes to fiesta and siesta? Youth hostels are indeed perfect places to have a great time with people from all around the world. Plus, if you are lucky, the hostel staff might be organising social events like free flamenco classes or pub crawls! In need of a quiet night sleep after all the partying? Book a private room, this way there is no chance you’ll be woken up by fellow travellers.

After making the most of your night, make the most of your day! Many of our Madrid hostels are within a short distance from the main attractions of the city like the Puerta del Sol, the Prado Museum, Retiro Park and the Santiago Bernabeu stadium to name just a few. And the icing on the cake: some hostels offer tapas and shopping tours!
