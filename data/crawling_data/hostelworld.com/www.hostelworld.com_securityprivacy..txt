Hostelworld.com Privacy and Security Statement








Hostelworld.com Privacy and Security Statement

Hostelworld.com Limited ("
Hostelworld
") operates the Hostelworld.com website, mobile site, mobile
    app and a booking engine, which is integrated into third party websites (together the "
Hostelworld
        Sites
"). This privacy statement sets out our privacy and security practices and forms part of the Terms
    and Conditions that apply to your use of the Hostelworld Sites. Please note that where you access our booking engine
    on a third party website this privacy statement only applies to information we collect through your use of the
    booking engine, and does not data collected or held by the operator of the third party website.

Hostelworld has been processing online hostel reservations since 1999 and we have always placed the security of our
    internet transactions and our customers" credit card details as our top priority. We will continue to offer our
    customers the highest level of security available for online transactions and hope this reassures you when you make
    your reservations with us.

Hostelworld realises that some people are unsure about entering their personal details into websites and apps over
    the Internet. Below, we explain how we use your information and how we protect your privacy. Hostelworld and its
    associated companies respect and protect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with the Hostelworld
    Sites. Any information which is provided by you to Hostelworld via the Hostelworld Sites or otherwise will be
    treated in accordance with the terms of the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 and/or such amending or
    replacement legislation as may be adopted in Ireland from time to time.

INFORMATION REQUIRED TO PROCESS YOUR BOOKING

For us to process a booking for you on behalf of a travel services provider, we require some information from you.
    This includes your name, nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number and
    email address. Also, since we confirm your booking while you are on the Hostelworld Site, we require your credit or
    debit card details so we can guarantee your beds when you pay your deposit.

WHO SEES YOUR INFORMATION

We are required to send your information to the travel services provider with which you booked travel services so
    that the travel service provider knows who you are and when you will use its travel services. We give your name,
    your nationality, your gender (or the gender of the group you are in), your phone number, your email address, your
    credit card details and of course, the details of your booking. The travel service provider requires this
    information to accept a confirmed booking from you. All travel service providers on whose behalf we facilitate
    bookings have agreed to the Hostelworld terms and conditions and accept this privacy policy.

We may also pass your personal information to third party service providers who process it on our behalf in order to
    allow us to provide the best service to you. For example, we use various technologies provided by Google, including
    its Maps product and its analytics products, to enhance the Hostelworld Sites. The following websites set out
    Google"s privacy policies in connection with these services
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/
and
http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/
.

We only pass your personal information to trusted third party services providers in accordance with our obligations
    under the Irish Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003.

SECURITY

All personal information exchanged between your device and the Hostelworld Sites is encrypted using TLS. Our TLS
    Cert. is provided by GlobalSign. This ensures that your information is transmitted securely and is safe from third
    parties.

You should be aware that where you link to another website from the Hostelworld Sites, Hostelworld has no control
    over that other website. Accordingly, Hostelworld cannot guarantee that the controller of that website will respect
    your privacy in the same manner as Hostelworld.

HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

In addition to the use and disclosure of information which is required when you avail of our travel related and data
    processing services (and which we describe above), we use your email address for sending you a confirmation of your
    bookings, pre-trip reminder e-mails, an email reminder to provide a guest review of your last accommodation stay, or
    occasionally to inform you of new features on the Hostelworld Sites. Our booking confirmation and pre-trip reminder
    emails may contain banner advertising. We only use your phone number to contact you urgently if there is a problem
    with your booking. In circumstances where you contact us with a query, we use your contact details in order to
    respond to your query.

Where you have given us your consent, we may send you emails that we think will be useful to you. This may include
    our regular e-newsletter, special offers, travel tips, customer surveys and information about products and services
    offered by us or our selected partners. Where your settings on your device permit us to send app notifications we
    may also send you app notifications containing similar information. You may opt out of receiving email messages at
    any time by clicking on the link provided in the email messages, and app notifications by changing the notification
    settings in your app.

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your information is relevant to its intended use, and that it is accurate
    and up to date. As a registered Hostelworld.com user, you can access and update your contact information, personal
    preferences and e-mail subscription choices at any time by visiting the account section of the Hostelworld.com
    website. The information that you submit helps us to make your emails more useful, interesting and relevant to you.

    which is available
here
.

On occasions, we may supply statistics about our customers to third-parties such as hostels or other agents. These
    statistics never contain personally identifying information.

We would not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your prior
    consent.

TARGETED ADVERTISING

We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of the travel related opportunities which we feature on the
    Hostelworld Sites. We work with our advertising partners in order to try and ensure that when you see an advert for
    a Hostelworld brand it will be relevant to you and your interests. This applies to adverts that are displayed on
    Hostelworld"s own websites (including the Hostelworld Sites, in Hostelworld emails, and on websites owned by third
    parties). We do this by allowing our third party advertisers to collect non-personally identifiable information
    about your visit to the Hostelworld Sites, such as the pages you visit on the Hostelworld Sites and the locations
    you appear to be interested in. We also provide third party advertisers with non-personally identifiable information
    that we collect about you when you use the Hostelworld Sites in order to only show you relevant adverts. We may also
    use such information in order to avoid showing you adverts on third party websites like Facebook and Twitter if we
    don"t think that you will be interested in them.

When we share your information with third party advertisers we always ensure that we do so in compliance with our
    obligations under data protection law. We may use technologies such as "hashing" to ensure that we do not provide
    our third party service providers with your personal data. For more information on how our third party advertising
    service providers gather information about your use of the Hostelworld Sites, please refer to our Cookies Policy
    which is available
here
.

Some of our third party advertising partners ask us to make you aware of their privacy policies. These policies are
    available by following the links below:

Your review settings in your Hostelworld account will automatically default to showing your profile photo and
    username for your reviews. You can modify this profile setting at any time by logging into your account.

Where you have chosen not to show your profile photo and name with your reviews, any reviews that you submit will
    show your trip type only.

We offer you the opportunity to post reviews of the accommodation you book through the Hostelworld Sites. Where you
    provide us with a review, we may include your review on the Hostelworld Sites and on selected partner sites.

We use various technologies to allow us to test how the Hostelworld Sites operate and allow us to improve our
    services. Further details of such tests are available
