Latest Review



"

We only stayed here one night. We wished we had been able to stay a few more days. It was a great location. This was my first time staying in a hostel in the states. It was very clean and safe. The staff was very helpful. When we called to ask about parking we were told the valet was the best option for $44 and we may be able to find something for $30. However we found a place right down the street for $12.
