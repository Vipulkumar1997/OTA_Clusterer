Hostelworld - HTTP Cookies

What is a Cookie?

A cookie, also known as an HTTP cookie, web
    cookie, or browser cookie, is usually a small piece of data sent from a website and stored in a user's web browser
    while a user is browsing a website. When the user browses the same website in the future, the data stored in the
    cookie can be retrieved by the website to notify the website of the user's previous activity. Cookies were designed
    to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember the state of the website or activity the user had taken in the
    past. This can include clicking particular buttons, logging in, or a record of which pages were visited by the
    user.

Other kinds of cookies perform essential functions in the modern Web. Perhaps most importantly,
    authentication cookies are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not,
    and which account they are logged in under. Without such a mechanism, the website would not know whether to send a
    page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate himself by logging-in.

Types of Cookies in Use

The following types of cookie are in use within Hostelworld systems:

Strictly necessary cookies

Performance cookies

Functionality cookies

Targeting / Advertising cookies

These cookies are a mixture of first party cookies, which we set ourselves, and third party cookies, which are
    set by other websites.

    and emails to improve their performance and enhance your user experience.

Personalization – For example, a customer’s language preference is remembered.

Session management - To ensure that a user’s session is routed to the correct system within the Hostelworld
        infrastructure for the duration of their visit.

Usage Tracking - Hostelworld use Omniture web analytics / Google Analytics solution to provide analysis of a
        users’ ongoing usage of the website. This facilitates ongoing improvements to the website.

AB Testing / multivariate testing - We can display multiple versions of a page to a customer to assess which
        generates the best customer experience.

Advertising - Display advertising content depending on location, language, and your past browsing history.

    access our websites, to move between pages and to receive services which you have requested. The following are

    may analyse data they collect about your use of the Hostelworld website, through first and third-party cookies, in
    order to serve adverts to you on the Hostelworld website or on other third party websites. We also work with
    advertisers in order to display Hostelworld adverts on third party websites, based on cookies set on your visit to
    the Hostelworld website. Advertisers may also use information about your previous web activity to tailor the adverts
    which are displayed on the Hostelworld website. Advertising/targeting cookies may also be used to track your
    responses to particular adverts, which helps advertisers to ensure that you see the most relevant advertisements in
    future, both on Hostelworld websites and on third party websites. The following are examples of the types of
    targeting/advertising cookies which we use:

            clicks are made on the adverts which lead to users visiting our websites or installing our apps (this is
            known as Pay Per Click advertising). We use these cookies to allow reporting of customer activity on the
            site and to track app installations and in-app conversions.

            done on an anonymised basis, using non-personally identifiable information. We may also use Google Analytics
            advertising features to help ascertain how many times our adverts are seen on other sites, and to be
            provided with aggregated and anonymised details about the demographics and interests of users of
            Hostelworld.

            on an anonymised basis, using non-personally identifiable information. The DoubleClick cookies are an
