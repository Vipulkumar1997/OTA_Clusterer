Europe’s hostels may be killing it in the hostel talent contest, but make no mistake, the United States now has some RIDICULOUS hostels. Deciding on where to stay in the US has never been easier: think speakeasy bars, central AF locations, and rooftop pool parties you’ll be telling your grandkids about (the censored version, of course). Hostelworld has some of the best hostels in America, with demand growing fast. Read on for the top hostels in the USA.

Let’s face it, travelling in North America is not exactly like South East Asia. Your budget will need to be bigger for the popular cities like New York and San Francisco, and we suggest booking even more in advance than normal to get a cheaper deal, especially for states that have a smaller selection of hostels such as Colorado. Scroll down to the bottom of the article for more practical info ;).

On the flipside, USA hostels also offer endless freebies (Cuban pastries and locally roasted Panther Coffee for breakfast anyone?!), activities money can’t buy, and views you won’t believe. From the neon lights of Miami to the snow-tipped mountains of Denver, we’re giving you the hostel lowdown on where to stay in the US without the big fat price tag.

Freehand Los Angeles

@gkmilne1

Think of Freehand as a magical accommodation centaur – half hostel, half hotel. These ritzy mofos were invented for adventurers who love community vibes but don’t want to compromise style and comfort. Freehand has hostels in Chicago, Miami, and has just opened one in the hipster playground of Downtown LA! You get the hotel treatment with a rooftop pool deck, AND a 9.8 rating for customer service. Upgrade to a private room for fluffy bathrobes and slippers!

Ocean Beach, San Diego


Beach and surf lovers, pay attention! This newly relaunched hostel is located just a couple of blocks away from the ocean in sunny San Diego. There’s discounted surf lessons, wet suit rental, and for when you want to let your salty hair down, a beach bonfire party twice a week with *free* food.

HI San Francisco City Centre

@shapovalelena

This former 1920s boutique hotel is vintage at its nu-bohemian best. HI City Centre is marble-tiled, mahogany-railed, and full of character, but with modern features such as a professional-grade guest kitchen. The location couldn’t be more fitting with the edgy Tenderloin and Arts Districts around the corner, where you’ll find the coolest nightclubs and bars. And you must not leave SF without visiting the gritty
Mission District
!

@avamargeauxtierney

America’s oldest city is the perfect place for a bit of ye olde culture, and where better to stay than a renovated Otis Elevator building?! The old-world charm of this hostel is mixed with modern facilities and Richmond locals are on hand to guide you through the “River City”. HI Richmond is located near several national parks and the Belle and Mayo Islands for your wilderness fix, yet it’s just a 15 minute walk to downtown. Just don’t let East Cary St’s happy hours have their wicked way with you…

It’s located in between Hollywood Boulevard and Sunset and has an epic garden patio where they hold weekly BBQs for meeting new travel pals. They’re pretty generous with their freebies too with those all-you-can-make pancakes, a beach shuttle, discounted city tours and Disney trips. And make sure you use disco laundry room!

HI Santa Monica


Imagine a hostel that’s two blocks from golden sands and that famous pier (the one that Forest Gump ran), in a neighbourhood with serious community vibes? Aloha, HI Santa Monica! Think exposed brick with splashes of Cali-colour, and an outdoor common room with a fountain – and check out the rooms! The best part is you can now escape that hideous traffic with the new Metro Expo line that goes straight to Venice Beach and Santa Monica ;).


Customer rating: 8.7

The Local, New York


Located in the edgy and diverse LIC neighbourhood of Queens, these guys say “staying at The Local is like staying with your coolest friend who knows NYC like the back of his hand and loves having visitors.” As for décor and atmosphere, think Andy Warhol’s “The Factory” with a spacious lounge, cocktail bar and café (XL coffees for just $2) and a rooftop terrace that boasts some of the best sunsets in the city.

@nymoorehostel

More art gallery than hostel, the multicoloured NY Moore Hostel is located in the centre of Brooklyn, arguably New York’s hippest neighbourhood. Free parking and a no-curfew policy gives you free reign to explore the vibrant creative commune of East Willamsburg, and the hostel is a playground itself. Your give free reign to unleash your inner child with block parties, bouncy castles (above), and rooftop cinema nights!

This buzzing Atlantic metropolis is located amongst the warm sand and soothing sunshine of South Florida, so you’ll need somewhere to party all night where the heat is on! Freehand is just 1 block from the beach, and even has a fairy-lit pool for all your exotic animal inflatables to enjoy. If you’re keeping it FRESH, try the hostel’s steam room, sunrise beach yoga and free salsa lessons.


Customer rating: 8.7

HI Boston


HI is the no. 1 place to stay in Boston. It’s affordable, has an outrageously central location near Boston Common, Chinatown, and the subway. Plus, meeting people is a piece of cake with social spaces such as the bar (with red pool table), self-catered kitchen and a coffee bar where they serve complimentary breakfast at the coffee bar. P.s just in case you get lost, the shower curtains have a map of the subway ;).


Customer rating: 9.1

Dorm beds from: £23/$29

Privates from: £76/$99

Freehand Chicago


Chicago was recently voted one of America’s sexiest cities, so it’s only right that it should get an equally sexy hostel. Freehand Chicago opened last year in the vibrant River North neighbourhood, surrounded by art galleries and indie coffee shops. You’ll be gobsmacked that this is actually a hostel with the dark mahogany furnishings, woven wall hangings, and flat screen TVs. They even have their own gourmet café and mixology bar, “The Broken Shaker”! Fall is the best time to visit for the street festivals and those crunchy crimson leaves.

Hostel Fish
, Denver


📷
@milehighandhungry


The historic Airedale building was once a saloon, a brothel, an adult bookstore, peep show, and has been recently transformed into a luxury hostel. The old interior has been jazzed up with neo-urban decor, a lively atmosphere, and friendly staff who are “stoked to host you” – and we believe them! They were once backpackers themselves and know what it takes to create a safe, spotless, upscale hostel with 24 hour support and activities for meeting fellow adventurers. There’s even a bar next door for drinks on site or you can stroll in to LoDo Denver where you’ll find local beer houses and bars aplenty!


Customer rating: 9.0

Dorm beds from: £39/$51

Beds&Drinks
, Miami


Bienvenido a Miami! This is a shiny, colourful brand new art deco building slap bang in the middle of Miami Beach, which would explain the 95% location customer rating. It’s easily the most sociable hostel in South Beach with a whale of an outdoor terrace and two lounge areas. If you’re feeling knackered after a hard day’s adventuring, there’s even a big screen movie room with free screenings – bonus!

Dorm beds from: £14/$18

Some of your questions answered…


Are hostels safe in the USA?

You can bet your last dime that these hostels have some bad ass security. Say hello to secure lockers, card keys à la hotel style, and if you’re keeping it on the DL at night, nine out of ten hostels now have private rooms (but we still think dorms are the spicier option!)

Why are hostels more expensive in the US?

The high cost of transportation compared to other countries means the distances are huge and the flights are expensive. However it depends on seasonality of the city itself, so they are not always more expensive. Hostels offer bucket loads of freebies such as yoga classes, breakfasts, and local knowledge you can’t buy! The most expensive cities to travel is San Francisco, New York and New Orleans, and the cheaper ones are Seattle and Boston.

Why aren’t there as many hostels in the US?

It’s true that hostels aren’t as widespread as elsewhere, but there are a good selection in the main cities with California having the most with 76 in total. Less visited places like Arkansas and Connecticut have the least, so popularity is a factor for deciding on where to stay in the US. Owners of hostels in the US have revamped and re-styled them into trendy, fun, sociable accommodation, combining a sense of adventure with comfort and safety. Along with traditional dorm rooms many US hostels now come complete with private bedrooms, en-suite bathrooms and some even have pools, saunas and bars.
