About Berlin

Berlin is a city where everybody will find what he or she is looking for in a break abroad. The capital city of Germany will be a delight for those of you who are passionate about history, but it is also one of Europe’s coolest place to party in.

Staying in a youth hostel, you will have the best of both worlds. Our properties are centrally located, so you will have no problem finding your way to the main attractions like the Wall, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag Building and a wide range of museums. If it is fun you are looking for, mingle with the other travellers in the common areas and go for a beer! Berlin surely has
bars to suit every taste
, but if you are lucky, there might even be a bar right inside your hostel!

Note that there are
different neighbourhoods in Berlin
. Our hostels are located in
Charlottenburg
,
Friedrichshain
,
Kreuzberg
,
Mitte
,
Neukoelln
,
Prenzlauer Berg
,
Schoneberg
,
Steglitz
,
Tiergarten
,
Wilmersdorf
, and
Zoo
. Mitte is the best option if you want to stay in the heart of the city and Friedrichstain – popular for its nightlife – is where you are more likely to find cheap accommodation.
