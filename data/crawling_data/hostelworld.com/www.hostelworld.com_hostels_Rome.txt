About Rome

Ancient Romans called Rome the eternal city because they believed that even if the world was to face major crisis, their city would live for ever. Up to these days, they have been proven right as the city is one of the most popular destinations in Europe.

Staying in a hostel is the best way to feel the vibes of the capital city of Italy as most of our youth hostels are centrally located. So whether you are looking for accommodation close to Termini station or to any of the main attractions, we have the right hostel for you!

You might consider visiting Rome’s most popular landmarks like the Colosseum, the Pantheon, the Trevi Fountain or explore Vatican, the smallest country in the world. However, we suggest you experience the city like a local would. Have a “gelato”, a delicious Italian ice cream and do some people watching on one of the main squares. If you are feeling adventurous, you can rent a Vespa and drive through the narrow cobbled streets of the city centre and beyond (the district of Trastevere is a must see) to get a feeling of its atmosphere and to discover its hidden secrets.

The good news is that you don’t have to break the bank to live la dolce vita. You can find many cheap hostels in Rome. Some of them even offer breakfast for free as well as pizza! And if you are very lucky, your hostel might also be organising free events, a nice way to mingle with like-minded travellers! There are also plenty of
things to do for free in Rome
and you won’t have difficulties coming across
insanely cheap restaurants
.
