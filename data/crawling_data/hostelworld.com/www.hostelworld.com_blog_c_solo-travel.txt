Solo Travel

Addictive. Life altering. Intense. Liberating. Solo travel is hard to explain with words alone.

For first timers, the idea of travelling alone can seem quite daunting. Will I be lonely? Will I be safe? What‚Äôs the best place to travel solo? Can I do it without joining a solo travel tour? It requires a lot of courage to set off on your first solo trip, but once you‚Äôve taken that leap, you‚Äôll never look back.¬†It will change who you are as a person, and your travels will never be the same again.

In this section you‚Äôll find everything you could possibly need to help you travel solo: from the best solo travel destinations to solo travel tips and advice from our amazing community of backpackers across the globe. Got a question? Tweet us @hostelworld or tag us on Instagram.
