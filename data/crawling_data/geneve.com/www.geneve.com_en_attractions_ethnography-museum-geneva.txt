Times and prices





































One of Switzerland’s two most important ethnographic collections!

Through exhibitions and temporary stage sets, the Ethnography Museum Geneva addresses the diversity of cultures and the riches of their differences. With a structure that reflects the importance of its collections, the MEG has been revived and suggests approaching ethnology from multiple angles, between social sciences, arts, natural sciences and living practices.
