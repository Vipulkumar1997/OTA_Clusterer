Antigua

Boasting the accolade of having the most sunshine of all the Eastern Caribbean Islands,
Antigua
is a destination full of history and tropical beauty. With an easy going friendly population, 365 idyllic beaches and a peaceful atmosphere, this island is a haven of relaxation and positivity.

Get fit and tone up in state of the art gyms and fitness classes or pamper yourself with advanced holistic treatments, from massages to facials. Practice your swing on the golf course or snorkel with vibrant tropical fish in the refreshing sea.

Antigua is a small and peaceful island, but it offers everything you could hope for.
