Pilates Holidays

Focusing on balance, strength, flexibility and posture, Pilates is a full-body conditioning system that draws training elements from yoga, gymnastics and dance. We offer a number of recommended
Pilates holidays
in locations ranging from Grenada to Cyprus, that provide classes alongside other holistic activities including meditation, cardiovascular fitness and natural spa treatments. Teaming Pilates with other healthy activities is a great way to slim down and tone up, so indulge in a variety of classes and tailor your trip to your own personal wellness goals.
