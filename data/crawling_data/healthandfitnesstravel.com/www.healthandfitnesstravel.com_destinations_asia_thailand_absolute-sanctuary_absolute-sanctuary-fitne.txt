Paul's Review of Absolute Sanctuary

Arriving in Koh Samui, I was greeted by a friendly Absolute Sanctuary driver and taken to this healthy hideaway, located in a quiet part of the Island. Absolute Sanctuary is Thailand's premier detox and yoga resort and just five minutes from the airport, a stunning Moroccan-inspired boutique resort for those seeking a holiday to rejuvenate, unwind and lead a healthy lifestyle.

Charlotte's Review of Absolute Sanctuary

If you're a fan of yoga, sunshine, delicious healthy food, fresh fruit smoothies and incredible juices that can't do anything but whack a huge smile upon your face - then this is the place for you! In fact, I can honestly say, being healthy has never been so easy for me as it was during my week at this retreat.

Guest Reviews of Absolute Sanctuary


I had such a great time at Absolute Sanctuary. The setting is beautiful and for me the highlight was the really amazing yoga sessions, the teachers are truly fantastic! Also, the personal training sessions are the best I have ever had! The Reception lady had the most wonderful attitude and was a true problem solver, in her own words 'anything is possible'. Great service and friendly attitude from everyone, which made a real difference on my holiday! Fantastic experience overall. Thanks a lot Health and Fitness Travel for booking all for me hassle-free.

- Clare, April 2017


This is a really fantastic holiday! Lovely hotel, great food and excellent Pilates. A brilliant place to go to relax and get fit and healthy! Highly recommend!

- Jo, April 2017


It was truly amazing and I am already thinking about my next holiday at Absolute Sanctuary! The hotel was wonderful and the Pilates instructor absolutely fantastic.


- Jo, December 2016



The holiday was just what I needed! Perfect weather and a week to relax, eat well and get myself back into some good exercise habits. I plan to do this yearly. I highly recommend Absolute Sanctuary for those travelling alone and wanting a stress-free break. Everything was taken care of and the staff were superb.


- Michelle, October 2016



I had a lovely time . The food, accommodation and staff were great. It was a great place to go as a solo traveller. I met some lovely people but also felt ok about being on my own. I’d definitely go again!


- Natalie, June 2016



Thank you, I had such a lovely holiday it's just a shame I had to come back!! The hotel was wonderful, the staff was brilliant, as well as the food. Pilates classes were incredibly good. I highly recommend Health and Fitness Travel and Absolute Sanctuary! Thanks again for all your help.


- Linda, March 2016



I’m feeling revitalised, healthier and stronger! Everything was great - the hotel, the flexibility (it was easy to make changes to my program) and the treatments. The personal trainer was amazing and I was able to try all kinds of activities. It turned out that yoga wasn't really my thing, but there was so much more on offer! I would love to go back sometime soon. To me, it was a trip of a lifetime! Thank you for organizing everything, I really appreciate your service and the way you managed everything!


- Kjersti, January 2016



Health and Fitness travel found me the perfect holiday to fit my needs!  The experience was quick, easy and professional.  Despite there being lots of choices it was easy to hone in quickly on the holiday that suited what I wanted and my budget.

In between leaving a job and setting up a new business I spent 10 days at Absolute Sanctuary on the fitness program - I wanted to feel fitter, lose weight and relax and I achieved all 3 aims. The place is so nice - really relaxed, great service and people (fellow guests and staff). The food was just fantastic, but even those doing the full detox program seemed happy with the drinks they were being given.

The gym could do with some more equipment but Marco, my personal trainer, was really creative and effective with the kit that he had. In particular, the boxing and pool sessions made a real difference and were fun too. I really enjoyed my daily personal training sessions. The yoga was great, Jana is wonderful and gave me a great introduction to various different types of yoga.

It's a great place to go as a solo traveller - in part because most of the other guests are on their own too but also because of the type of holiday. The fitness program gives your day just enough structure that you are always 'busy' but never to the extent that it affects your ability to relax. Daily treatments (massage, saunas etc.) were just heaven. I've had long term back and neck problems and within days of arrival felt so much better (I think the yoga had a lot to do with that too).

Like a lot of other people there who are already regular visitors I plan to go back at least once a year. For the first time ever losing weight didn't feel like an exercise in deprivation - Absolute Sanctuary makes it feel like a pleasure with such lovely food, fun exercise, yoga and indulgent massages and treatments. It's changed how I think about food and exercise and the weight is still falling off 3 weeks after coming home.

The Morrocon inspired sanctuary exceeded all the expectations I had heading to Ko Samui. From the staff to the spa to the yoga classes and teachers, it was absolutely fantastic!! The staff around the pool, in the kitchen, at the help desk, in the reception were always smiling and looked very happy. They helped us with any issue we had and were always willing to lend a hand. The spa was so a heavenly experience. I took the yoga holiday package and so, I had a massage everyday. It was great, my favourite was the detox massage and aroma therapy. The yoga classes, I have no words for. They were far beyond exquisite, the teachers were extraordinary and were really great at teaching you and pushing you. I definitely felt much better after visiting the sanctuary, I started implementing the healthy food routine and exercise into my daily life and I strongly recommend for you to visit the place.

- Jacaranda_blossome, TripAdvisor Review -October 2015



First went here around five years ago to do a total detox program over 10 days - this can be a pretty rewarding experience - but also takes you a bit out of your comfort zone if you've never done this before. The health results of this stay impacted me positively over a number of years after. I just got back last month from my second visit to Absolute Sanctuary and I think it's gotten even better. The serene surroundings and the excellent and encouraging team at AS make the process of detoxing less daunting and enjoyable and pretty relaxing. The resort is high quality property and offers lots of various areas for yoga, treatments and therapies, communal areas as well as more private areas as some times you just want your own space when you are detoxing. I don't feel I would get around to detoxing or focusing this much on my health on a if it was in this type of resort where you really can solely focus on yourself and your health. I could see myself coming once a year and doing some of the less aggressive programs that aren't a full fast, as the food from the on site Love Kitchen is great. I budget for plenty of treatments and massages etc. as they are fantastic and I tried a few first time ones like Reiki which was brilliant and enlightening. Big thanks to Janelle on this last trip who was my consultant and helped me not only drop kilos and start to feel generally better but gave me plenty of tips to take away back into the "real world". Would definitely recommend AS to anyone who wants to try detox,destress or just a clean eating holiday in a fantastic well thought out resort in a private and peaceful location.
