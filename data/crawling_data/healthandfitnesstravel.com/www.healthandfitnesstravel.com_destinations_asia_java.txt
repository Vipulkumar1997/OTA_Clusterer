Java






Java

From the monumental temples on the outskirts of Yogyakarta to the bustling streets of Indonesia’s capital city, the island of
Java
is bursting with local colour. While you experience this vibrant culture, you can also re-charge your batteries with soothing spa treatments like sea salt scrubs and a traditional Javanese massage, or get in shape with circuit training and aqua fitness.

In Java, you can unwind with the help of South East Asia’s only genuine hammam, learn about local agriculture on a tour of a coffee plantation, nourish your system with organic local produce or have a go at Javanese dancing. Our Javanese healthy holidays offer everything you need to have a wellness trip that is both revitalising and enriching.
