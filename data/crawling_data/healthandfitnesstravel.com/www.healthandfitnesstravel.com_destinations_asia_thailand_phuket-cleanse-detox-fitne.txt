Adam’s Review of Phuket Cleanse in Thailand

After opening its doors in 2012, Phuket Cleanse has very quickly become the go-to place for an all-encompassing fitness and detox holiday. Unlike other detox retreats, Phuket Cleanse has a strong focus on complementing a raw food or juice detox with fitness and organic supplements. Designed to be structured, everything is laid out for you so you can do as many of the activities as possible. ...

Guest Reviews of Phuket Cleanse

I really do think this is one of the best trips I've ever had and even more so because it came at such a perfect time for me personally. Its not a one-time place where you go and don't think back as 'that was fun'. Its just the opposite - its the start of something. You learn about so much about nutrition, anti-aging (and how it works down to a cellular level), exercise and balance that you leave genuinely wanting to be mindful at taking better care of yourself going forward.

Location wise, the villa is in a nice neighbourhood about an 8 minute walk to the main street. There you could easily pop into the pharmacy, 7-11, ATM, mani/pedi, etc. The Raw Fitness Gym (owned by PC) was about a 10 minute drive from the villa on the main street. Open air (covered rooftop) and perfect for a day's workout. Lots of boxing bags and cross-fit type of equipment on site for the various classes. The drive to Hot Yoga (Kata Beach) is about 20 minutes, but a beautiful drive at that. We walked there one morning (1hr 15min) before class - recommended for the views.

If someone wants to take charge of their life and do a self-improvement sort of holiday, this is the place. Its not a 'relaxing' place to pamper yourself like a lot of other luxury / pretentious spas, and there's honestly not a lot of down time (unless you opt out of all the activities, exercises and talks but that would defeat the whole point). It really is what you make out of it. I put in my all because I didn't want to miss a beat. I friend almost all work-out classes. However, there were a few people who decided to do just a few classes a day so they could enjoy the beach, read/relax or go on a longer bike ride. They enjoyed that just as much. At the end of the day, its really up to the individual to decide how much and what they want to do. One thing I think we could all agree on was that it was never boring.

Lindsay N, Jan 2014


From the moment I arrived I was made to feel welcome and to feel a part of something special.

Mel and the staff at Phuket Cleanse were amazing and always available to give handy hints and tips. A special shout out to Phil who made my experience so much better than it ever could have been. A true devotee to health and fitness. Being around Phil just made me want to push harder and to try and be better and this really paid off for me.

We were straight into it from day 1 – A 90 minute hike followed by 90 minutes of hot yoga. From then on I was involved in many different classes including muay thai, boot camp, boxfit, pilates, Tabata, TRX, cardio tennis, born to run, parkour etc. I am quite passionate about fitness and generally quite fit but one thing I will mention is that some of these classes really challenged me physically and mentally, which I absolutely loved.

Now let me talk about the food. I am a vegetarian so switching to raw vegan didn’t seem like a massive issue. What I wasn’t ready for was how much I enjoyed the raw vegan menu and how much better my body was running after a few days of just eating the raw food. I had so much energy, it was amazing. I dropped about 6kg in the first week (training about 4 times a day). My aim was never to drop weight, it was simply to cleanse and be healthier and happier, which is definitely what I achieved from this retreat.

I have done many fitness/detox retreats but this is the only one that I walked away thinking that I really wanted to change something in my life. I wanted to feel this amazing all the time!! When I left Thailand I felt energised, refreshed, thoughful and with a new found passion for muay thai training!

Millymoo999, Trip Advisor Review - December 2013



Everything was just fantastic! Mel and her team were energetic, supportive and just fabulous! Special shout out to Phil!!!

I was some what tentative about eating raw food for a week but they were delicious and so creative that it was hard to believe everything was made with raw food.

They offer great variety of exercises classes with fun/encouraging instructors so everyday was unique and provided an opportunity to try out new things.

My week at Phuket Cleanse was rewarding in so many ways to list all here but to name a few: met amazaing people from all of the world, learned to nourish my body and mind in loving and family like envionrment and positive energy from everyone.


- sunshiney1, Trip Advisor Review - December 2013



My friend and I were looking for a detox holiday, but I wanted one that was not just fasting and sitting by a pool. I wanted one that would challenge me both physically and mentally, one that I could maintain when I got home. Phuket cleanse was that and more! The food was incredible, I lost weight and felt amazing. But I think it was Melanie's enthusiasm and knowledge that will stick with me. She has such a passion for everything she teaches. The whole program is well done,the trainers are amazing. I never thought I would be able to exercise as much as I did, let alone on raw food and juices but you never know what you can achieve till you try! But I think it s the friends that you make at phuket cleanse that are what makes it so unique, everyone has a common goal and is there to support you, especially when you dont think you can handle the ice bath a second longer. I hightly recommend Phuket cleanse to anyone that wants a challenge, and opportunity to leave there comfort zone. Oh and the daily massages are incredible!


- Lucienne C, Trip Advisor Review - November 2013


What can I say? In short, this is the best place for recharging your batteries. From the food and exercise classes, to all the recovery options like ice bathing, infrared sauna, and steam sauna, I feel both relaxed and full of energy at the same time.

Simply stated, the staff is amazing. Melanie is full of information on everything from raw foods preparation to anti-aging strategies, and a lot more. The other guests were awesome, and while they were full (20 customers during my stay), it really enhanced the experience for me. I just read the previous review and don't understand at all why this guest would be anything less than fully pleased. The guests only serve to make the experience more enriching. I was there with everyone from college students to a British Knight. Yes, a Knight, good sir.

Trust me. Phuket Cleanse is a life-changing experience. The staff really was extraordinary, and totally committed to each guest and his or her personal goals.

Regarding the guest rooms, the new Extension rooms are opened. And my friend stayed in one of those rooms. I stayed in the main villa, as I like to be close to the action. I like to be close to Melanie and pick her brain about everything from plant-based nutrition to things like hormesis training (shocking the body and turning on some of those anti-aging genes). It does not get any better than this.
