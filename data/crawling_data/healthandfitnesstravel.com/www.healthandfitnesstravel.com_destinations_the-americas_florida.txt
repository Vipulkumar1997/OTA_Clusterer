Florida

Any visitor looking for a luxury wellness break cannot fail to be enticed by Florida, a stunning destination with more than 1,100 miles of sandy shores. This Sunshine State is the perfect place for a spa retreat with the focus on outdoor activity to being fit and Zen.

Step back from the rollerbladers and sunbathers in Miami, and you will discover sanctuaries of health and holistic healing. Enjoy detoxifying skin therapies and signature spa facials focused on repair and renewal; elevate your fitness with personal training; or find balance with rooftop yoga classes. For a relaxing and rejuvenating healthy holiday by the beach, Florida has everything you could want and more.
