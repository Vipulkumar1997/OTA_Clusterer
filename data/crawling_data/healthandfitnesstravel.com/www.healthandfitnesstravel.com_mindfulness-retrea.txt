Mindfulness Retreats

Mindfulness is a meditative practice that encourages a heightened awareness of the present moment to increase attentiveness, disrupt negative thought processes and find greater peace and happiness. Our luxury
mindfulness retreats
provide a holistic approach to mental and physical well-being, set in stunning locations where guests have the opportunity to ‘switch off’ from the demands of daily living to focus completely on mind-body rejuvenation. Led by experts in beautiful, relaxing destinations, combine meditation with other mindful activities, such as mindful movement sessions and nature walks, to restore your inner-balance and return home feeling more capable of dealing with life’s challenges.
