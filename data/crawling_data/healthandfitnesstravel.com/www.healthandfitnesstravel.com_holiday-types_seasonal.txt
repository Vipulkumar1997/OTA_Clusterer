Seasonal Holidays

Because different seasons call for different types of wellness getaways, we offer a wide range of
seasonal healthy holidays
over the course of the year. For example, if the grey December weather is getting you down, you can try one of our Christmas Healthy Holidays or Winter Escapes to a diverse selection of warm destinations ranging all the way from Oman to Grenada. Alternatively, our Spring Renewal trips are a great way to come out of hibernation and improve your fitness in inspiring destinations like Portugal, India, Thailand, and more.
