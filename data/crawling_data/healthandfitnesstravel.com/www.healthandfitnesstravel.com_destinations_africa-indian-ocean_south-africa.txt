South Africa






South Africa

With breath-taking bio-diversity, top-notch luxury facilities and nutritious cuisine, a getaway to the Rainbow Nation is an excellent chance to get back to nature while you get in touch with your own body. Divide your time between safari and spa so that you can experience hippos, rhinos, giraffes and zebras one day; and coconut body polishes, grapefruit facials, and Royal Thai massages the next.

You can relax with hydrotherapy facilities like steam rooms, saunas, and Kneipp pools; fill your time with fun activities like fishing, mountain biking, and Bamboo dancing; or try more specialised holidays like detox and weight management.

Whatever your fitness goals are, a memorable trip to one of our South African resorts can help you to look and feel better than ever.
