Post-Cancer Recovery Retreats






Post-Cancer Recovery Retreats

Conquering cancer can be a draining battle and after emerging victorious, you may find yourself in need of some relaxation and time to re-charge.  Beating cancer may have been a difficult time, but there are things that can be done to make your recuperation as smooth as possible. Our post-cancer recovery retreats offer a range of holistic spa therapies and alternative natural medicine treatments, from acupuncture to Ayurveda. Meditation, expert medical and wellness consultations will help to personalise your stay, allowing you to rejuvenate and improve your self-esteem, meaning that you can be nurtured and cared for. For those still battling cancer or those who have entered the recovery stage, these retreats would be a great opportunity for you to feel like your old self again.
