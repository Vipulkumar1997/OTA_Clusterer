How We Work













For the daydreamers who love to envisage themselves on holiday before the plane even leaves the tarmac, here is the chance to see what
a typical day
on one of our health and fitness holidays looks like. Discover our philosophy to find out more...





We are Passionate
We love everything about health and wellness travel, each holiday is carefully selected and crafted by our specialists who are passionate about improving people's well-being to lead happier and healthier lives.



We are Creative
Every person has different needs and we understand this, which is why we create bespoke healthy holidays to match your goals and interests. We listen to your requirements and find you something that exceeds your personal expectations. We are innovators and pay the most attention to detail on all the holidays we create.



We Go the Extra Mile
Customer experience is our business, we aim to please and nothing is too much trouble.

We will organise your spa schedule, arrange a private boat trip, a volcano climb or even a special event for an occasion like your birthday or anniversary.



Seamless Service
We are confident that our service is hard to beat; our standards are high and we always aim higher. Our team is dedicated in providing every client an exceptional service because if you're not happy, we're not happy - your success is our success.



Trustworthy
We are responsible and reliable; we will consult on your preferences and inspire you with our honest and personal recommendations. Our passion for healthy travel makes us meticulous in selecting the best holidays. We have researched and reviewed our holidays extensively so when you ask us where to go for the best silent meditation retreats, tennis coaches, osteopaths or martial art teachers, we make recommendations you can rely on.



Knowledgeable
We are well-travelled and have a genuine passion for health and well-being. We work with holistic experts, fitness trainers, meditation gurus, life-coaches and many specialists who share our vision. As a team we have over 40 years of combined experience in spas, travel and well-being.



Our Product
We spend a lot of time in crafting the perfect healthy holidays from the activities and spa treatments to the service at resort. All our holidays are carefully researched and receive our seal of approval so when you call us, you'll be speaking with someone who can guide you towards the perfect holiday experience. We understand the difference between a healthy break to de-stress and boost your well-being through treatments and exercise or a wellness holiday that seriously addresses your health goals. From climbing an active volcano in Bali to detoxing in Spain or getting fit in Thailand; we will offer the right holiday to suit you.



Happy Clients
Your happiness is our happiness. Your health and fitness journey is much more than just a holiday but a life-enhancing experience, where you will reap the physical and emotional benefits so you return home energised, inspired and informed to make the small changes that manifest themselves into a healthier and happier lifestyle. It's not just the improvement of your health and well-being, but the attention to the small important details that make the difference to a holiday experience that you will remember for a lifetime.
