Caribbean

In addition to the pristine beaches and turquoise waters that
Caribbean holidays
are usually associated with, this idyllic region also offers a tremendous selection of stimulating fitness opportunities for solo travellers, couples, and families. You can focus your mind and body on a yoga & Pilates retreat to the Turks & Caicos; work out and relax with a spa & sport holiday on Antigua; or try a little of everything during an all-inclusive stay on St. Lucia.
