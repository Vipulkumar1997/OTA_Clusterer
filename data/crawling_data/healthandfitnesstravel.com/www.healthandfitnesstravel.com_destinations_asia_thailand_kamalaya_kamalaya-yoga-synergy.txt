Paul's Review of Kamalaya

Having spent seven days in Thailand including a two night stopover in Bangkok at the Anantara Riverside Resort & Spa, I was ready to begin my healthy holiday at Kamalaya in Koh Samui. Voted as Destination Spa of the Year in Asia and Favourite Spa in Thailand, I was looking forward to spending one week re-energising myself at this stunning Wellness Sanctuary and Holistic Spa.

Samantha's Review of Kamalaya

There is a special magic at Kamalaya, an award-winning sanctuary and holistic spa carved into the hillside of the lush Thailand jungle and overlooking the aqua blue sea. It is the perfect setting, a delight for the senses and also the winner of the title of Thailand's best spa. My journey begins at Koh Samui airport where I am greeted with a cool towel and a warm smile, I am glad to arrive...

Guest Reviews of Kamalaya

Staying at Kamalaya was the most amazing, positively life-changing experience I have encountered. I highly recommend paying a visit to this mind-blowing retreat, it was truly transformative and I’m now planning an annual visit, at least. Treatments are second to none and the environment, staff, food, communal table and everything else is just perfect, not to mention the weather which is amazing all year round. I have no words to describe how skilled and knowledgeable the wellness team is and nothing was a problem for them – I requested to change my schedule a couple of times and they were extremely helful.

-Susan, July 2017


Kamalaya is a dream! It totally exceeded my expectations! Almost every day I rescheduled my treatments and they were so accommodating. The food really astounded me in terms of quality and choice, the freshness and variety were abundant! Excellent value when you choose a wellness plan as there is no real need to add any extra costs. I cannot wait to go back and next time will stay at least 10 nights. This is 100% the best place to recharge oneself with goodness! My advice to other travellers is: don’t pack too many clothes, you won’t need them. Just comfortable exercising gear and swimsuits.

-Sandra, June 2017


Kamalaya truly exceeded my expectations! The service from all staff was exceptional! I booked an entry level room type and it was very comfortable – frankly, I barely spent anytime inside, as the resort has so many places to explore and relax (by the pool, on the beach or my favourite: by the loungers next to the plunge pools by the infra-red saunas. My room had fresh ice delivered every evening with the turn down service and the insect repellent candles were lit in my bathroom too. Sporadic presents were also left on my bed which were a nice touch along with a leaving gift and a birthday present which made my stay even more memorable! The night before departing, I was most impressed with the offer to choose a pack lunch for the journey back home - so practical and thoughtful as they really have thought of everything to make the stay utterly heavenly and easy at the same time.

My favourite spa treatment was the Pathaganjaly Massage – it was the highlight of my holiday! I also enjoyed the island tour excursion, which was good value and the right duration. The communal dining table is such a good idea! We sat there many times and swapped details with other guests and formed friendships from all over the world. The food was incredible! Fresh and varied! I loved it how I could choose from the detox menu as well. My palate was reset despite having no intentions of losing weight or eating better, you just come away from Kamalya feeling better about food and wanting to continue that Kamalaya glow/feeling vibe. Absolutely loved my trip and can’t wait to return!

-Sam, April 2017


Amazing holiday! I recommend taking a 7 day programme over 10 days’ timeframe, to allow for more flexibility in appointments and other activities, as there is so much to do! Great experience, Health and Fitness Travel is very helpful and recommended Kamalaya based on my requirements. Perfect match!
- Karen, April 2017


My holiday to Kamalaya was fantastic! Great location and facilities with very friendly staff. The upgrade to the suite was well worth the money (I’m still missing the outdoor shower!). As a single traveller looking for a healthy break it would be very difficult to fault, having the communal table at dinner was a really treat with a fantastic mix of people. I would fully recommend Kamalaya to any solo travels looking for a fitness / wellbeing break, and I’m sure I’ll visit again.


- Stuart, November 2016



I just wanted to recommend this truly amazing holiday to everyone looking for long term healthy transformation. It was truly brilliant!


- Sarah, October 2016



I enjoyed my stay at Kamalaya very much. It's a beautiful resort, which has a lot to offer. I'm admittedly a picky customer, not quite diva level but certainly, shall we say, discerning! But I have nothing negative to say about Kamalaya! The staff were very courteous and friendly in addition to helpful and professional. The massages and food were outstanding! Great balance between peace and relaxation, and a sense of being part of a social community. I can't wait to go back! I felt reinvigorated and fresh coming home.


- Vanessa, September 2016



I had a fantastic time! Kamalaya is so relaxing and peaceful and perfect for what I needed. All the treatments were superb and the food was excellent too! I would definitely visit again so may be in touch next year!


- Carol, September 2016



Such a fabulous place! I cannot wait to return. I did a 5 day program spread over 7 days as I never felt rushed. Total bliss!


- Julie, July 2016



Kamalaya was great, this place really is amazing! I’m now back home smiling and feeling much happier inside. All the treatments were world class, the therapists were so professional and skilled. Thailand is famous for the massages, but Kamalaya was a step further! The perfect place to relax, rejuvenate, calm down after busy times or even serious burnt out. The food is amazing too. The best detox food I have ever tried. They even have detox desserts. My partner was not on detox, but he was encouraged to eat lean protein with every meal. I’m definitely coming back.


- Carolina, June 2016



Kamalaya is a wonderful place for solo travellers and couples who want to chill. Great for meditation, yoga, pilates, natural medicine... The atmosphere there is one of calm, there is a spiritual feel about the place that comes from nature and Buddhism and the calmness of the people who work there. The gardens are amazing, the slope allows for running water, waterfalls and pools. At the heart of Kamalaya is it's Wellness Center. There is a genuine interest in you, body and mind. I'm not sure if everyone gets this or it depends on what program you are on, but I got a medical check shortly after I arrived, was assigned to a 'naturopath' and to a 'mentor', which was a bit like having your own Gandhi to talk to. They both made suggestions to change my program to optimise my time there, and I met with both of them a number of times during my 10 days there. The food was excellent, I am a vegetarian and ate from the detox menu and found the variety and quality plenty to keep me interested. I was in one of the least expensive rooms but found really pleasant. Thank you to you all for making this holiday an amazing experience.


- David, March 2016



Kamalaya was AMAZING!!! It was exactly as I needed it to be, the food was superb, the staff are fantastic, everything about it was super! I’ll be back next year!


- Pamela, March 2016



I enjoyed the stay at Kamalaya very much. It's a little spot in heaven. All staff were so friendly and helpful, the treatments were great. Even after 21 days I could stay even longer at this place. My room was absolutely big enough with all things a person could need. All day fresh fruit, water and tea. I even got some little presents during my stay, like an assortment of tea and the 10 years Kamalaya book, which is a great way to remember my days in this paradise. I particularly enjoyed to only have one program during my stay, so I had enough time to profit from the general program and could do a lot of sports for myself in the Gym and joined group classes in Yoga, Pranayama, Circuit Training, Pilates.....and I attended some interesting talks as also the Detox cooking class. On top I did book some other appointments in the wellness centre as for example the personal mentoring which I will go on with via skype from home. Food was very good and not too restrictive, even if I was in the ideal weight programme. I lost 3 kg, but even more important is that I became much fitter and this feels really good. It was a perfect holiday. I would recommend it, absolutely.


- Andrea, January 2016



I had a wonderful trip. Kamalaya was perfect for me, and for what I was looking for at this time. It is an expensive holiday, especially at Christmas, and in particular in the Suites, but it was worth it. Everything was done in a very low key, unfussed way and the comfort of guests is clearly at the centre of everything. The therapists are all excellent, experienced and very pleasant. The Wellness Sanctuary is extremely well managed and they were very flexible when I wanted to change to the Asian Bliss programme (so much better for me!). There were lots of lovely, unexpected touches, like complimentary classes (yoga, pilates, mediation, pranayama). I was surprised at the extent of them. There were several gifts during the visit including teas beautifully presented in a box, Kamalaya creams and shampoos, and a beautiful book. They didn’t charge for room service which I felt was a lovely touch. This made it feel like an experience instead of a business. I would go back, 100%. Everything ran very smoothly in terms of transfer and flights.


- Ciara, January 2016



All of the elements for a wonderfully restorative week are in abundance at Kamalaya. The health and wellbeing practitioners are brilliant, the staff in reception and the restaurants are wonderful and full of care and attention to detail. Everything was arranged or delivered to a very high standard. The food is a standout, absolutely gorgeous. The real difference between Kamalaya and other health retreats that I have experienced was in the flexibility. I arrived and left on dates I chose, I adapted the program to suit my needs and goals, I ate when I wanted and could sit quietly on my own if that's how I was feeling (as opposed to always eating in groups at set times). The tailored individual approach at Kamalaya combined with the high level of quality and care are why I will be back.

- pairoftravellers, TripAdvisor Review -October 2015


Have just come back from Kamalaya where I have been for the second time after last November. It is really like Paradise and a safe haven. It is wonderfully settled in the hills and with so much nature around. Great views on the sea and so inspiring and relaxing. The Yoga Classes, the possibilities for sports, the great healthy food, the meditations and workshops, the quiet and peace AND! Especially all the great employees who really make you feel like at home and truly welcome. Furthermore the possibiity to really learn things that will chance your life and perspective and let you grow! I will definitely come back again. Thanks for all!

- Judy_Niko, TripAdvisor Review - October 2015


I just spent 7 days at Kamalaya and loved every minute. From the moment I arrived to the moment I left, I was so grateful that I had chosen it as the place to re-charge and 'embrace change' before starting a new job. I didn't expect it to have such a profound impact on me but it really was a little slice of paradise, with a very calm and enriching energy. It is the perfect place to come and contemplate your life, to make some changes to your mind and body, to re-charge your batteries, to detox, or simply lie by the pool.
There are so many interesting treatments and classes on offer there is always something fascinating and relaxing to do. The international group of therapists were all outstanding - so intuitive, wise and knowledgeable I have come away with so much more awareness of life, my mind and health and have the tools to carry what I learnt with me. The staff were all so kind, friendly and attentive, the facilities wonderful - beautiful pools, delicious food (you are spoilt for choice!) I highly recommend Kamalaya, it is a very special soulful experience and I hope to return again soon. Thank you to all the wonderful staff for making it such a beautiful, life changing experience not just a lovely holiday.

- Hayley - July 2015

But I have nothing negative to say about Kamalaya! The staff were very courteous and friendly in addition to helpful and professional. The massages and food were outstanding! Great balance between peace and relaxation, and a sense of being part of a social community. I can't wait to go back! I felt reinvigorated and fresh coming home.

I had a fantastic time! Kamalaya is so relaxing and peaceful and perfect for what I needed. All the treatments were superb and the food was excellent too! I would definitely visit again so may be in touch next year!

Such a fabulous place! I cannot wait to return. I did a 5 day program spread over 7 days as I never felt rushed. Total bliss!

Kamalaya was great, this place really is amazing! I’m now back home smiling and feeling much happier inside. All the treatments were world class, the therapists were so professional and skilled. Thailand is famous for the massages, but Kamalaya was a step further! The perfect place to relax, rejuvenate, calm down after busy times or even serious burnt out. The food is amazing too. The best detox food I have ever tried. They even have detox desserts. My partner was not on detox, but he was encouraged to eat lean protein with every meal. I’m definitely coming back.

Kamalaya is a wonderful place for solo travellers and couples who want to chill. Great for meditation, yoga, pilates, natural medicine... The atmosphere there is one of calm, there is a spiritual feel about the place that comes from nature and Buddhism and the calmness of the people who work there. The gardens are amazing, the slope allows for running water, waterfalls and pools. At the heart of Kamalaya is it's Wellness Center. There is a genuine interest in you, body and mind. I'm not sure if everyone gets this or it depends on what program you are on, but I got a medical check shortly after I arrived, was assigned to a 'naturopath' and to a 'mentor', which was a bit like having your own Gandhi to talk to. They both made suggestions to change my program to optimise my time there, and I met with both of them a number of times during my 10 days there. The food was excellent, I am a vegetarian and ate from the detox menu and found the variety and quality plenty to keep me interested. I was in one of the least expensive rooms but found really pleasant. Thank you to you all for making this holiday an amazing experience.

I enjoyed the stay at Kamalaya very much. It's a little spot in heaven. All staff were so friendly and helpful, the treatments were great. Even after 21 days I could stay even longer at this place. My room was absolutely big enough with all things a person could need. All day fresh fruit, water and tea. I even got some little presents during my stay, like an assortment of tea and the 10 years Kamalaya book, which is a great way to remember my days in this paradise. I particularly enjoyed to only have one program during my stay, so I had enough time to profit from the general program and could do a lot of sports for myself in the Gym and joined group classes in Yoga, Pranayama, Circuit Training, Pilates.....and I attended some interesting talks as also the Detox cooking class. On top I did book some other appointments in the wellness centre as for example the personal mentoring which I will go on with via skype from home. Food was very good and not too restrictive, even if I was in the ideal weight programme. I lost 3 kg, but even more important is that I became much fitter and this feels really good. It was a perfect holiday. I would recommend it, absolutely.

I had a wonderful trip. Kamalaya was perfect for me, and for what I was looking for at this time. It is an expensive holiday, especially at Christmas, and in particular in the Suites, but it was worth it. Everything was done in a very low key, unfussed way and the comfort of guests is clearly at the centre of everything. The therapists are all excellent, experienced and very pleasant. The Wellness Sanctuary is extremely well managed and they were very flexible when I wanted to change to the Asian Bliss programme (so much better for me!). There were lots of lovely, unexpected touches, like complimentary classes (yoga, pilates, mediation, pranayama). I was surprised at the extent of them. There were several gifts during the visit including teas beautifully presented in a box, Kamalaya creams and shampoos, and a beautiful book. They didn’t charge for room service which I felt was a lovely touch. This made it feel like an experience instead of a business. I would go back, 100%. Everything ran very smoothly in terms of transfer and flights.

All of the elements for a wonderfully restorative week are in abundance at Kamalaya. The health and wellbeing practitioners are brilliant, the staff in reception and the restaurants are wonderful and full of care and attention to detail. Everything was arranged or delivered to a very high standard. The food is a standout, absolutely gorgeous. The real difference between Kamalaya and other health retreats that I have experienced was in the flexibility. I arrived and left on dates I chose, I adapted the program to suit my needs and goals, I ate when I wanted and could sit quietly on my own if that's how I was feeling (as opposed to always eating in groups at set times). The tailored individual approach at Kamalaya combined with the high level of quality and care are why I will be back.

Have just come back from Kamalaya where I have been for the second time after last November. It is really like Paradise and a safe haven. It is wonderfully settled in the hills and with so much nature around. Great views on the sea and so inspiring and relaxing. The Yoga Classes, the possibilities for sports, the great healthy food, the meditations and workshops, the quiet and peace AND! Especially all the great employees who really make you feel like at home and truly welcome. Furthermore the possibiity to really learn things that will chance your life and perspective and let you grow! I will definitely come back again. Thanks for all!

I just spent 7 days at Kamalaya and loved every minute. From the moment I arrived to the moment I left, I was so grateful that I had chosen it as the place to re-charge and 'embrace change' before starting a new job. I didn't expect it to have such a profound impact on me but it really was a little slice of paradise, with a very calm and enriching energy. It is the perfect place to come and contemplate your life, to make some changes to your mind and body, to re-charge your batteries, to detox, or simply lie by the pool.
There are so many interesting treatments and classes on offer there is always something fascinating and relaxing to do. The international group of therapists were all outstanding - so intuitive, wise and knowledgeable I have come away with so much more awareness of life, my mind and health and have the tools to carry what I learnt with me. The staff were all so kind, friendly and attentive, the facilities wonderful - beautiful pools, delicious food (you are spoilt for choice!) I highly recommend Kamalaya, it is a very special soulful experience and I hope to return again soon. Thank you to all the wonderful staff for making it such a beautiful, life changing experience not just a lovely holiday.
