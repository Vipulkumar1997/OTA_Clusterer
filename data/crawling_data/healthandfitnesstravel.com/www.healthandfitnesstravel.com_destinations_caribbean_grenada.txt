Grenada

In addition to tropical rainforests, volcanic craters, superb dive sites, and an inviting Caribbean climate, the island of
Grenada
boasts a wide variety of health and fitness opportunities. Adopting the laid back local pace is a great way to relax, but the island and the waters around it also offer a number of exciting ways to get active.

You can encounter vibrant marine life on a scuba diving trip, soak up the lush landscape with a spiritual hike, de-stress with a Balinese massage or regain a sense of balance with yoga classes. When you’re not busy with kayaking or Pilates, you can also enjoy a delicious mix of healthy local and international cuisine. After a visit to one of our award-winning Grenadian wellness holidays, you will come away feeling rejuvenated and refreshed.
