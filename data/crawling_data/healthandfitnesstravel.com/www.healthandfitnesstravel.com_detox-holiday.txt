Detox Holidays

The popularity of
detox holidays
derives from the health benefits through good nutrition, carefully chosen treatments and well-being activities such as yoga to achieve mental clarity, body detoxification and stress reduction. On our detox holidays you'll receive a specialised detox consultation before starting your programme to establish clear goals and, where necessary, customise your programme so that it's tailored to you. After completion of the programme you'll have a greater body awareness and the nutritional advice to keep it in good condition long after the holiday has ended.
