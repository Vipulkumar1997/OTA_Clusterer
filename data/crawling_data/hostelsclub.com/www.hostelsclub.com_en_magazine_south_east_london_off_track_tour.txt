9 Cheap & Free Places to visit in South-East London

Go off the beaten path and discover another side of the City following us on an off-track tour!

Secret Places
















From the red bus to Big Ben to our love of tea, London is nothing short of iconic. However, at the first mention of the bustling city these are only cliché symbols situated within the always-busy Central area, not to mention its reputation as an undeniably expensive travel destination. Outside of this circle London can sometimes (by the locals!) get a bad rap for being a little rough. However,
South-East London
has many interesting things to offer.

Take a look at these off-track locations to visit!



1) BRIXTON


* Instagram photo by @mbarbie

This colourful and effervescent community hub is full of multiculturalism, bursting with flavours from all around the world.
Brixton Village
is a mish-mash of Caribbean, Asian and African culture, offering everything from African accessories to French cuisine - there’s something for everyone, not to mention it is free to wander and take in the cacophony of sights and sounds. Around the corner,
Brixton POP
is the home to shipping-container popup restaurants and independent businesses as well as one of the best venues in town for a night out! A few seconds’ walk away in
Electric Avenue
you will find a clothing and home market where haggling is easy and a vast range of goods from different cultures are on sale, as well as a number of Afro hair stores. After a long day, have a dance and a giggle with some live music from buskers on the high street. In the summer there is even more fun to be had, with Caribbean-themed
Brixton Splash!
taking over the main square.



2) CRYSTAL PALACE PARK

A maze, a seemingly endless forest, rolling hills…if you’re looking for Disney World without the price tag, Crystal Palace Park has it all! Situated in SE19’s Crystal Palace, this sizeable park is
free to enter
. With beautiful architecture from a bygone era, it also features a colourful and bustling flower garden. There are even free maps available in the inevitable event that you’ll get lost! The park is also extremely popular with
cyclists and runners
.



3) RICHMOND PARK


* Instagram photo by @simonfromengland

Known for its rich, picturesque beauty, on paper Richmond Park can easily be compared to a scene out of Disney movie – deer, squirrels, horses and a pond can be found freely roaming here. Created in the 17th century originally as a
deer park
, the park is noted for its prominence in conservation and wildlife work. Open until late, it is particularly beautiful in the summer, offering first-class views of the sunrise and sunset. With a
bike hire facility
available on site, a carefree ride and a leisurely picnic afterwards definitely wouldn’t go amiss! Nearby,
Roehampton University
also offer free self-guided tours.
Froebel College Campus
is highly recommended, with equally-impressive horticulture, architecture and Grade I and II-listed buildings usually hired out for weddings and even Strictly Come Dancing on occasion! Afterwards take a
boat ride
(on the Transport for London network) from
Putney Pier
(close to Putney High Street).



4) WALWORTH & CAMBERWELL


* Instagram photo by @m.is.c

Although not often recommended as a tourist attraction, you could easily turn into one if you know where to look. Here the big attractions are
East Street Market
, Burgess Park and the range of affordable Turkish, Lebanese, Ethiopian, Ghanaian, Nigerian and Latino eateries. Being away from the more trendy areas it offers a cheaper alternative for sightseeing. Turn left into
Camberwell Church Street Farmers Market
every weekend.



5) PECKHAM


* Instagram photo by @caterinaem

Peckham is the much cheaper and more local sister of Shoreditch. Rich in
African cuisine
, it predominantly features a number of fishmongers and butchers where it is fairly easy to haggle, as well as Afro hair stores, cafes, shopping arcades and up-and-coming restaurants. For those who love a good knees-up, visit the
Bussey Building
which regularly features many a number of independent underground artists and raves. There is also a farmers’ market in
Peckham Pulse
(outside Peckham Library) every Sunday.



6) MARITIME GREENWICH & CUTTY SARK


* Instagram photo by @visitgreenwich

Greenwich is most widely known as the home of the
O2
, an internationally-renowned arena, however there is a lot more (and cheaper!) to do in the SE10 district. See a movie at the
Greenwich Picturehouse
, an indie cinema, or take a wander down the high street which is chock-a-block with global palettes and a somewhat romantic atmosphere. The jewels in Maritime Greenwich’s crown however are the amazing views across the
River Thames
, the architecturally-impressive grounds of
Greenwich University
which are open to all and feature grand Grade I- and II-listed buildings and the grand accolade of being the location of several blockbuster films including Thor, and the free (from outside!) view of the
Cutty Sark
, a famous tea clipper built in 1869 with a whisky even named after it!



7) DULWICH


* Instagram photo by @georgianlondon

This quaint but modern family town has lots to offer if you’re after some peace and quiet away from the city:
Dulwich Park
is perfect in the summer for a
bike ride
(with seating space in the back if you’re too lazy to pedal), or an ice cream – these are dotted around the park. Afterwards take a gander at the dollhouse-esque scenery in
Dulwich Village
. easily accessible from the other end of the park. The high street also features a mix of well-known names and independent charity shops and cafes. Just up the road
Dog Kennel Hill Adventure Playground
is a young adventurer’s dream – free to enter with a zipline, swings, a treehouse and even a faux forest at the back!



8) LONDON BRIDGE


* Instagram photo by @ilona.florence

Set in chic SE1, the London Bridge area is hugely popular and is one of the main employment hubs in the city. Away from the hustle and bustle of people going about their business, take in
Borough Market
where British and international produce is sold and is London's most renowned food and drink market. Afterwards visit
Cathedral Street
, lined with and take a gander at
Southwark Cathedral
and the wide range of restaurants and pubs.



9) SOUTHBANK CENTRE FOOD MARKET


* Instagram photo by @mrfoodster

Nearby on
Southbank Centre Square
, this market is street foodie paradise - vegan food from Ethiopia, authentic Thai, crêpes inspired by Brittany, freshly grilled corn on the cob, juicy burgers, salted caramel brownies…the list goes on and on! Open on Fridays, weekends and bank holidays, there’s always an opportunity to pass through for a worldly bite!
