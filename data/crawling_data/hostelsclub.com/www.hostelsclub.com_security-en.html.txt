Hostelsclub.com and its connected domains are secured with a secure SSL 128-bit encryption protocol, which is signed by Thawte, the global certificate authority, for your guarantee. All information you provide us (both your personal data and credit card number and expiry date) is encrypted with the SSL protocol before being transmitted over the Internet, and is virtually impossible to decrypt. A padlock symbol on your browser window will signal that you have entered a secure connection with our servers, and that all information you are sending is secure.
