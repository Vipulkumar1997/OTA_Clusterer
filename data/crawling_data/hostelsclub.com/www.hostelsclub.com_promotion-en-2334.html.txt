HostelsClub appreciates customers sharing their opinion, and that’s why we have decided to support those who rate their stay and leave a comment, with 2€ of travel credit they can use towards their next online reservations.

avoid unpleasant experiences
and to make sure you are booking a hostel up to your expectations!

This is one of the reasons why we have decided to
support travelers writing reviews

2€ of virtual credit
