About Fiji

Fiji is a must visit tropical paradise. Whether you are wanting to chill out on one of the many tropical sun kissed blue lagoon islands in The Mamanuca and Yasawa island groups, or just want to luxury it up in any 5 star resort or quality holiday home in around Viti Levu then Fiji has it all!
Fiji’s variety of activities will not disappoint you. Enjoy white water rafting clear and clean waterways, trek rainforests, visit welcoming villages, and experience sustainable living, or immerse yourself in the unique culture and rich history. For the more indulgent cruise the ocean in a boat and discover some of the 300+ islands nature has blessed Fiji with.

Fiji’s People and Lifestyle

The main religions in Fiji are Christianity 52.9%, Hinduism 38.1% and Islam 7.8%.
Endowed with forest mineral, and fish resources, Fiji is one of the most developed of the South Pacific island economies, though it remains a developing country with a large agriculture. Sugar exports and a growing tourist industry are the major sources of foreign exchange. Sugar cane processing makes up one-third of industrial activity; coconuts ginger and copra are also significant.

Fiji - Getting There

A lot of airlines that travel to New Zealand and Australia stop over in Fiji, as it’s the busiest stopover port of all the many surrounding South Pacific Islands. Both Air Pacific and Qantas both fly to Fiji out of Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane. Flight time is 3.5 hrs from Sydney and 4.5 hrs from Melbourne. Air New Zealand and Air Pacific fly from Auckland to Nadi.

Fiji - Getting Around


Bus:
Fiji's larger islands have extensive and inexpensive bus networks. Local buses are cheap and regular and a great way to mix with the locals. There are bus stops but you can often just hail buses, especially in rural areas.
Car & Motorcycle:
About 90% of Fiji's 5100km of roads are on Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, of which about one-fifth are sealed. Both of these islands are fun to explore by car, 4WD or on motorcycles. Petrol stations are common and easy to find on Viti Levu and Vanua Levu. Rental cars are relatively expensive in Fiji but despite this it is a good way to explore the larger islands and when you split the cost with others its good value overall.








Weather and climate

Fiji's wet season is from November to April, with the heaviest rains falling between December and mid-April. Fiji has a mild average temperature of 25°C, however it can climb to 30+°C in summer from December until January, and then sink to 20°C in winter from July until August.
