Holiday Tenancy Terms and Conditions



Amazing Accom (AA) is an online accommodation booking and payment website that both Renters and Property Owners/Managers use equally. The two core functions of the website are:

a) To provide Renters with quality accommodation solutions in a safe online environment that is logical, easy to use, and fully automated. When an accommodation booking is completed online, the Renter is automatically connected with the property Owner/Manager to directly organise the check in and arrival time.

b) To provide Property Owners/Managers with a completely automated, safe and logical online environment in which they easily manage and control all aspects of their property listing, in order to get fully automated streamlined bookings.

AA is not a property management company and takes no responsibility for Property Owner/Manager related issues.

This agreement is between the Property Owner/Manager and Renter.
The Renter, and Property Owner/Manager agree with the following Terms of Tenancy.


1. DEFINITIONS

1.1. Terms are defined in clause 20 - If you don't understand or accept a term; phrase; clause; terminology; or anything is this agreement please contact:  Operations@AmazingAccom.com prior to accepting this Terms of Tenancy agreement.

2. PAYMENT

2.1. Deposit payment - If the start date of the Tenancy is more than 60 days from the date of booking the Renter is required to pay 50% of the total rent payable to secure the Accommodation at the time of booking. 
    2.2. Final payment - The final balance of 50% must be paid and received by AA at least 50 days prior to the start date (check in). A final payment email will be sent to your nominated email address 60 days prior to check in. Failure to pay any final balance will result in the accommodation being offered to other potential renters. 
    2.3. Full payment - If the start date of the Tenancy is within 60 days of the date of booking the Renter is required to pay 100% of the total rent payable to secure the Accommodation at the time of booking online.

3. AVAILABILITY OF ACCOMMODATION

3.1. In the highly unlikely event that the Renter booked and paid online, and then the property Owner/Manager confirms a booking was received from another source at the same time and the accommodation is no longer available for these exact dates, the renter is entitled to a full reversal of the funds received by AA. 
    3.2. In the highly unlikely event that the Renter booked and paid online, and then the property Owner/Manager confirms the price was accidentally processed incorrectly, the Renter can then choose whether to re book it at the correct price, and when choosing not to re book the Renter is entitled to a full reversal of the funds received by AA.


Note:

All property Owners/Managers get one chance only, before they are deactivated from AA for breaching clauses 3.1 and 3.2

4.1. Within 60 days of the start of the Tenancy all bookings are final, non-refundable, and not transferable. 
    4.2. All proposed requests for changes to bookings including cancellations must be in writing and sent by the Renter to the Property Owner/Manager, and AA. 
    4.2.1. AA is entitled to bank its non-refundable commission fee upon booking confirmation being sent, unless clauses

5. CANCELLATIONS

5.1. Cancellation requests must be received the Property Owner/Manager, and AA, at least 60 days before the start of the Tenancy. The Owner/Property Manager will use its best endeavours to ensure that the Accommodation is promptly re-listed as available on the AA website for the period of the cancelled booking.

1 The Renter agrees to provide its credit card details at or prior to check-in to the contact person named in the Renter's online automated booking confirmation email.
                    The details are held by the Owner/Property Manager as security against the Renter's failure to perform the obligations set out in the Terms and Conditions.

2 The Renter authorises the Owner/Property Manager to debit its credit card to deduct any money due to the Owner/Property Manager upon final resolution of any dispute between the Renter and the Owner/Property Manager.
