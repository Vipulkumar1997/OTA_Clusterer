About Thailand

Thailand is both fascinating and exotic famous for its beaches, cities, food and culture. From the crystal blue waters of the south to the hustle and bustle of Bangkok, Thailand has a penchant for the extreme. Whether you are after total bliss and relaxation, all day shopping in the city that never sleeps or a spiritual journey Thailand has it all.

Thailand’s People and Lifestyle

Thailand has a population of over 69,000,000. Known as incredibly friendly and gentle people many Thai live their lives practicing Buddhism. With most of Thailand’s traditional events having roots in the Buddhism, the religion is subtly reflected through many aspects of Thai day to day life.

Historically Thai people established their communities along the rivers, this way of life has deeply influenced Thai society, evident in the floating markets that survive today.

Thailand - Getting There

Flights operate direct to Thailand from New Zealand and take around 10.5 hours from Auckland to Bangkok.

Thailand - Getting Around


Air:
Most routes originate in Bangkok offering affordable and fast transport to the provincial capitals.


Train:
The government rail network is generally well run operating over four major lines – The Northern, Southern, Northeastern and Eastern. Although trains take longer they do offer advantages over buses.


Bus:
Bangkok has a large city bus system. Elsewhere tourist centers can arrange public transport between cities and towns.


Car & Motorcycle:
If you plan to explore Thailand by yourself cars, jeeps and vans can all be rented in most major cities and airports.  International companies allow you to book in advance through their websites.


Boat:
Long-tail boats are traditional Thai transport. Able to travel at fast speed they operate between islands and on most of Thailands rivers and waterways.


Taxi:
Taxi’s are efficient and convenient. Either chartered or metered they are relatively inexpensive.


Tuk-Tuk:
By far the most adrenalin rising mode of transportation. Tuk-Tuk can be found through-out the country and are a must have experience.


Skytrain:
Bangkok’s Skytrain’s alleviate the notorious traffic jams of the capital.  Fast, efficient and easy to use.
