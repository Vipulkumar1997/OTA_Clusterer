Weather

New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world that is protected from weather extremes. In summer temperatures hover around the mid twenties, and in winter around the mid teens in most populated areas, towns and cities. For these reasons New Zealand is a mild and comfortable climate where you can enjoy activities all year round.

Weather in New Zealand is very changeable due to its geographical positioning and length. Within one hours drive you can often see four seasons in one day as the diverse and sudden landscape changes and temperature pockets in one town to the next peak and trough. For the adventurous both mountains can be climbed then skied down, and then waves surfed in the warmth of the sun that very same day!

Two main geographical features dominate New Zealand climate: the mountains and the sea. Our climate is largely temperate with the far north experiencing sub-tropical weather in summer and the alpine areas of the south dropping to low temperatures in the winter. With much of the country near the coast, it means mild temperatures, moderate rainfall and lots of sunshine! The average temperature does decrease as you travel further south.

The warmest months of the year are December, January and February - our summer where the average maximum temperature is between 20-30° C and the coldest months are June, July and August where average maximum temperatures are between 10-15° C.

Most of New Zealand receives over 2000 sunshine hours a year - the sunniest areas are Northland, Waiheke Island, Hawkes Bay, Nelson and Marlborough, which receive on average about 2350 hours a year. In the summer months with daylight savings, the day can last up until about 9.00pm and in winter a little after 5.00pm.





Climate and Temperatures

The following temperatures are mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures in Celsius and Fahrenheit for New Zealand. Rainfall is indicated as the average rainfall days per season.

Please note: whilst the mean temperatures are quite low New Zealand does get hot in summer and often days are 25-30 degrees consistently in most holiday destination hot spots scattered all over the North and South Islands of NZ.

Seasons

New Zealand has 4 distinct seasons being summer, autumn, winter and spring.

All these seasons represent beautiful change that is embraced with the dynamic and diverse change from one regions landscape to the next. As you drive or travel through New Zealand your eyes will feast on the abundance of spectacular scenery, which has made NZ one of the most respected destinations in the world to visit.


Summer
(December - February)

Summer in New Zealand is when school finishes for students and many families will head away for their Christmas holiday. This is typically the busiest time of the year for both international and domestic tourists. Days are long and sunny, nights are mild and it's an excellent time for walking or hiking and a variety of outdoor activities. There are many gorgeous beaches and lakes that are ideal for swimming, surfing, boating and sunbathing during summer. Note: Day light saving time changes are effective from late Sept until the beginning of April, thus ensuring New Zealanders gets the maximum hours of daylight enjoyment over this festive and invigorating season.


Autumn

(March - May)

While temperatures are a little cooler, the weather can still be excellent and swimming at the beach is still possible! Easter falls in autumn and it's generally the last rush of the season before heading into the quieter winter months for those that are traditionally busiest over summer. The leaves are changing colour and are particularly beautiful in the Hawkes Bay and Central Otago.


Winter
(June - August)

Winter brings cold weather too much of the country with snow in the South Island and Central North Island and rain to other parts of the country. The mountain ranges glisten with fresh snow and the alpine villages and resorts come to life. There are plenty of ski-fields and resorts with excellent options to cater from the beginner to the most experienced skiers and snowboarders


Spring

(September - November)

Spring is a magical time in New Zealand. The weather can range from cold and crisp with frosts in the morning, to fine and warm, the days begin to lengthen and parts of the country wake from hibernation. New growth appears on the trees and lambs frolic and jump in their paddocks - a delight to see and one you can't help but smile at. The melting snow adds extra water to the rivers and it's the best time of the year to white water raft down the rapids or speed through the canyons in a jet boat.

Spring in New Zealand heralds the start of the grape harvest for wine makers and is an excellent time to head away to one of the many wine producing areas of New Zealand - the Hawkes Bay, Martinborough, and Marlborough offer the opportunity to sample some of the best wines in New Zealand.




What clothing do I bring to New Zealand in Summer?

Light clothes - shorts, t-shirts, open shoes, flip flops, walking shoes, however make sure you pack a sweater/long sleeve top should the weather turn a bit cooler, especially if you are visiting the high country. Also, pack a light jacket as some summer rain can be expected, especially in December.


What clothing do I bring to New Zealand in Winter?

Pack winter clothing if travelling to New Zealand between May and September and bring layers as the days can vary dramatically and rapidly. A warm jumper, long pants and closed in shoes will be your day-to-day ware, and a rain jacket would also prove useful. Most ski fields will have gear and clothing that you can hire, so you don't need to bring your bulky things if you do not wish.

New Zealand has a very strong sun so you need to cover up with high strength sun block especially in summer, and even in winter when up the skiing the mountains, or anytime enjoying the higher elevated regions of New Zealand.




Where are the best destinations in Summer?

People tend to head out of the cities to the warmest summer hotspots. For Auckland resident's that generally means a holiday at any of these places: Northland, Bay of Islands, Coromandel, or Waiheke Island (known to locals as Waiheke). For residents of Wellington then Lake Taupo , The Wairarapa, and Hawkes Bay are all easily accessed. In the South Island areas of Nelson and Golden Bay, Queenstown and Wanaka, are all very popular destinations over the summer. These destinations get booked out very quickly so you need to get in early when planning your next holiday.


What are the best destinations for Winter?

New Zealand is world-renowned for it's skiing and winter activity destinations. In the North Island, the Central Plateau is located equidistant from both Auckland and Wellington making it a great weekend ski destination. The closest accommodations are in National Park, Ohakune or just an hour away is the lakeside destinations of Taupo and Turangi

In the South Island, skiers are spoilt for choice as to where they go to get their fix. Queenstown is the ultimate 5 star alpine resort region, with 4 magnificent ski fields all within close proximity. Wanaka is an hour away and boasts another two great ski fields, and then further north to Canterbury you will find Mt Hutt and Methven and the club skifelds.

Winter in New Zealand is not just about skiing. Rotorua, Taupo and Hanmer Springs have steaming geothermal pools to sink into and warm up in, and the main cities of Auckland & Wellington are great for that weekend getaway, shopping trip or fine dining experience.

All towns, cities, and regions of New Zealand offer something special for everyone to enjoy, thus we recommend you travel all over the North and South Islands extensively, to ensure you really have the best time and experiences during your holiday.
