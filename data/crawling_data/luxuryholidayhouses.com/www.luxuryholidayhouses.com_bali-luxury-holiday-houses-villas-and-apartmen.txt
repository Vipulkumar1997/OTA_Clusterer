About Bali

Bali is the ultimate place to relax and escape - the fragrance of frangipani flowers, ribbons of white sandy beaches, incredible surf, volcanoes, rice terraces, temples, culture, dance, shopping and world class local cuisine. It may be small but its reputation as a holiday destination is huge. And the Balinese people are the most wonderful hosts.

Bali People & Lifestyle

Bali has a population of over 3,000,000. The coastal areas in the south are the most populous with over 370,000 people living in the capital of Denpasar. Farming has been the primary way of living in Balinese life. While fishing, trading and craftsmanship are also still common today.

Life in Bali is very communal and organized in villages. Temple ceremonies, marriage, cremation, farming and even the creative art festivals are decided by the local community institution called “Banjar”. Day-to-day life is administered by both the Banjar and the government. The local government is mostly responsible for schools, health clinics, hospitals and roads, and Banjar is responsible for all other aspects of life. There is another association exists in the banjar named “Subak” that concerns to the production of rice and organizes the complex irrigation system. Every family who owns a rice field must be a member of their local Subak, which then ensures that every member gets his fair distribution of water. A banjar consists of an average of 50 to 150 family members, owning a meeting venue called the Bale Banjar, which is used for regular gatherings and a center for local gamelan orchestras and drama groups.

Bali - Getting There

With the increasing number of direct flight, getting to Bali is easy. 8 hours from Auckland, 7 hours from Sydney, 6 hours from Melbourne and 2.5 hours from Singapore. Then its just a short 1.5 hour flight from Jakarta to Denpasar.

Bali - Getting Around

Because of the small size of the island, it is not difficult to get around Bali.


Bemo:
This is the most used transportation in Bali especially in the city of Denpasar. It is a miniature van with a routine route set by local government periodically. This type of transportation is good for short distance around town and cities, because of its size and passengers can get in and out at any point.


Buses:
There are buses for transportation between towns that relatively bigger compared to bemo. These buses connect all towns and most places of the island through local bus stations. Like bemo, buses also can be stopped at any point of the routes.


Taxi:
Taxis are the most efficient and convenience transportation on the island. Either chartered or metered ones, they are everywhere and quite inexpensive compared to other countries.


Rental Cars, Motorbikes and Bicycles:
If you plan to explore Bali, the best way is to hire a car with a driver. You can also rent a self drive car. An international driving license from your own country is required. This rule also applies to motorbike rental. Bicycles are normally available for rent at hotels.


Dokar:
In many areas of Indonesia, traditional horse and cart transportation still can be found, known as ‘dokar’. A dokar ride is a unique experience.
