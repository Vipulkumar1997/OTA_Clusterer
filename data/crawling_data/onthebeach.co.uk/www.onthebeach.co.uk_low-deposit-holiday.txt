On the Beach Limited
















On the Beach act as an agent providing a web search interface between you and various third party suppliers of travel products (e.g. flight, hotel or transfer). For flights we act as your agent in processing your booking with the airline; we are not the airline’s agent. Each product you choose has its own price independent of other products booked at the same time and creates a separate contract between you and the supplier of that product.
