Read more about Menorca



Known by many as the Jewel of the Balearics, Menorca is an extremely popular holiday destination. Bathed in Mediterranean sunshine, Menorca holidays offer fantastic attractions and top quality hotels that are very much geared towards families and couples, making Menorca one of Europe's hotspots for family holidays and romantic breaks. Nightlife wise, it's not quite on a par with its sisters Ibiza and Majorca, but it's still a great place for a week or two away with your friends.
There's an abundance of activities to keep the whole family entertained on Menorca holidays, and the many watersports and varied nightlife available means there's something for the adults too! Menorca is rich in historical sites such as the navetas, ancient burial sites, the naveta of Es Tudons being the oldest building in Europe. Many who come on holidays to Menorca enjoy seeing the island by boat, with glass bottom boat tours proving very popular.
Undoubtedly, one of the best things about Menorca holidays is the beaches - from the small coves of Alcaufar to the sunbathers' paradise of Sant Tomas, Menorca boasts some of the best stretches of sand in Europe. If you want to make your trip that little bit more special, try planning your holiday in Menorca to coincide with a fiesta or one of the three-day festivals of dancing, food and authentic Menorcan culture. The celebration of Sant Juan in Ciutadella is often the most popular with tourists as it is the largest fiesta the island has to offer.

Menorca Weather

Menorca's climate is perfect for a relaxing week or two away. The official holiday season runs all the way from May to October, and with 315 days of sunshine a year,
cheap Menorca holidays
are the perfect way to escape the dull British summer!
If you are planning to spend your Menorca holidays in the summer months you can expect temperatures to frequently reach around 30° Celsius, and it is not unheard of for August temperatures to climb even higher. Perfect for topping up your tan, but with a Mediterranean breeze providing a much needed reprieve from the sun, as well as keeping the sand cool enough to walk on! The extended holidays season means that for many, an off peak holiday in May or October provides the same great weather without the crowds.

Things To Do on Menorca Holidays

Unlike neighbouring Majorca and Ibiza, there is a much slower pace to the nightlife on Menorca. After topping up your tan on the beach, there's simply no better way to round off your day than a romantic meal watching the sunset. There are plenty of chilled out bars and restaurants to choose from in
Binibeca
and
Cala Blanca
with many offering local cuisine.

Culture

Menorca was originally attractive to the Greeks and Phoenicians as a means of expanding their Mediterranean trading empire because Menorca's location was central to shipping routes between the rest of Europe as well as parts of modern day Asia and Africa. The Romans took over in 123 BC and it was during this time which the island experienced some early developments - roads were built and settlements such as Ciutadella and
Mahon
were well and truly established.
The island then endured occupation at the hands of the Byztantines, but it wasn't until much later under the British in the 1700s when Menorca began to flourish. Often referred to the island's Golden Age, the British built about new roads, schools and switched capital cities. It is a partnership which lives on today, as British tourists flock back Menorca every year!
More recently, the island has benefited enormously from the increasing availability of tourism, with things really beginning to take off after the building of the Sant Climent airport in 1969.
