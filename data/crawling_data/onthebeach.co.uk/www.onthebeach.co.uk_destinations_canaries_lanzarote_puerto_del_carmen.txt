Read more about Puerto Del Carmen



When it comes to the best Lanzarote holidays, there's one resort that has it all: the best nightlife in Lanzarote, easy access to some of the finest blue-flag beaches - and indeed anywhere in the Canaries, lots to see and do for family and friends alike, and the opportunity to take in the town life of most popular resort in Lanzarote. Puerto del Carmen is the hub of the island's tourist industry, and gets more popular by the year. Surprisingly many of its beaches are still quieter than most in the Canaries, and relatively unspoiled too. Why wait? It only takes four hours to fly from the UK to Lanzarote, from where you can experience Puerto del Carmen for yourself!
Puerto del Carmen's main beach, Playa Grande, is a broad stretch of dark sand which stretches for over 3km along Avenida de las Playas. For parasailing and banana boat rides head to the aptly named Playa Chica, an attractive sandy cove just north of the well known Los Fariones hotel.
5km west of Puerto del Carmen, the très chic marina of Puerto Calero offers yacht, submarine and catamaran excursions, as well as Lanzarote scuba diving opportunities. Stay for lunch as there are some very good places to eat and drink along the attractive waterfront. The best way of getting here is by water taxi from the port at Puerto del Carmen.
Lanzarote is a relatively small island, and from Puerto del Carmen anywhere on the island can be visited as part of a great day trip. Not to be missed are the volcanic landscapes of Parque Nacional de Timanfaya, the incredible La Geria black lava vineyards, and as many as you can manage of César Manrique's landscaped visitor attractions.
Rather unsurprisingly, Puerto del Carmen holidays boast more restaurants, bars, nightclubs and discos than you could wave a stick at. But the nightlife here, while certainly vibrant, isn't as rowdy as is often imagined. Travel down The Strip to see what we mean; it's a masterclass in how to have a good time no matter what your age or tastes, from disco at Rumm to rock at Route 66 and raves in all-night clubs.

Puerto Del Carmen Weather

Lanzarote basks in year-round sunshine and warm temperatures. This Canary Island averages temperatures around 18° Celsius in winter and often rises above 26° Celsius during August's peak season. Soothing Atlantic breezes keep you from getting too hot on holidays in Puerto del Carmen, but don't be deceived; the rays are harmful, so get out the sunscreen and rather than going pink, get tanned!

Landscape

Aside from the buzz and bustle that comes with being Lanzarote's premier resort, Puerto del Carmen boasts some amazing beaches, world class in fact: there's the main beach of Playa Blanca in the centre, while within easy reach of this there's the quieter, golden-sanded seafront of Los Pacillos, perfect to get away from the throng and enjoy wide Atlantic panoramas day or night. Straddle the beautiful promenades from these gorgeous coastlines and you'll reach the third beach, Matagorda, smaller and more sequestered, with pristine, coffee-coloured sands.



Culture

Puerto del Carmen has its fair share of holy days, festivals and carnivals. Don't miss the spectacular revelry of Carnival in late February, and July's Feast of St Carmen, patron saint of the city and fishermen, with folk singing, dancing and colourful processions to the ocean. Something will be happening in Puerto del Carmen whenever you visit!
The new Museum of Canarian Whales and Dolphins at Puerto Calero is small but worth a visit; it has a wonderful art gallery next door, and both are free entry.

Families

Kids young and old will lap up the many Puerto del Carmen family attractions: the huge theme park of Rancho Texas with its multifarious wildlife and wild west theme, the Aqua Park in Costa Teguise for some water sports, museums dedicated to preservation as diverse as Canarian sea mammals and local architecture. Take a ride round the island itself to get to the Timanfaya Nature Park, and the villages and volcanic caves of Los Verdes, further inland.
