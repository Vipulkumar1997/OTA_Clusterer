Things To Do on Dalaman Holidays

Holidays in Dalaman offer such a wide variety of activities and things to see and do, you'll find it difficult to pack it into one holiday. Catering to all tastes, whether you want a relaxing break or an action packed few days, you will love Dalaman.

Culture

Dalaman’s largest and most exciting festival takes place at the end of June each year for three days and is an absolute must if you are in Dalaman at this time. The Kas Lycia Festival in Kas showcases international and local folk-dancing troupes and is a fantastic cultural day out for everyone.
The small town of Fethiye, one of Dalaman’s neighbouring resorts, stands on the ancient city of Telmessos and makes for a fascinating visit if you want to investigate the history and culture of the area. The cliff side tombs and the medieval Knights Castle make Fethiye an interesting and educational town to explore.

Couples

Spend a romantic evening together with a moonlit boat trip from Marmaris and along its coastline. There are many moonlit boat tours where you can dance under the stars and sip cocktails alongside your loved one, with many boats putting on entertainment like belly dancing.
Themed Turkish nights are an amazing way to spend an evening, and perfect for couples on holiday. Find an organised Turkish night and enjoy belly dancers, Turkish folkdance, Turkish food and wine and a
lot
of audience participation!
Butterfly Valley provides a romantic stroll, in a protected area you will walk through thousands of bright, multicoloured butterflies. Take a scenic boat ride or follow the Lycian walking trail to get to the Butterfly Valley and have a relaxing day enjoying the being so close to nature.

Adventure

For thrill seekers, white-water rafting in the Dalaman River is rated as one of the top rafting experiences in the world. For something a little less risky but just as sporty, get your walking boots on for a day of Trekking along the Lycian Way, which is a fantastic way of seeing some of Turkey’s most breathtaking sights.

Shopping

Dalaman is great if you want to shop, with a fantastic selection of boutiques, craft and souvenir shops and jewellers all with long opening hours meaning you can spend the day on the beach and the early evenings in the shops.
You will find leather goods, carpets and gold and silver jewellery in the shops and roadside stalls in Dalaman, but be prepared to haggle for a bargain. Many shop owners drop their prices dramatically in order to beat the competition. A local souvenir in Dalaman is a blue glass bead, which, according to traditional legend, will protect you from the evil eye.
Fethiye is a colourful and bustling market town and is perfect if you want to experience a traditional Turkish shopping experience. However, if you are more interested in designer goods, Isaranou has a good selection, but prices are heavily inflated so as we mentioned earlier, don’t forget to haggle!

Nightlife

The nightlife in Dalaman is fairly quiet, but Dalaman Town is lively and you will find hotels in Dalaman provide excellent evening entertainment with live music and belly dancing.
If you are looking for a great party scene you will love Dalaman’s neighbouring resort,
Marmaris
. With more than 100 bars and nightclubs, you're pretty much guaranteed a fantastic night out. You will also find several lively beachfront bars where you can watch the sun set whilst listening to live music. Hisaronu is also popular with young people looking for a good time, with many discos, karaoke bars and sports bars.
For more of a traditional Turkish night you will love the harbour town of Kalkan, which will offer you luscious local cuisine alongside belly dancing or jazz music.
If, however, you are looking for a quieter evening, visit the smaller resorts such as Dalyan, Kas and Calis beach where you can enjoy the laid back beach bars and fab restaurants.

Relaxation

Dalaman is the perfect destination if you want to relax and enjoy a quiet holiday. For a unique experience, visit the famous mudbaths of Dalyan and discover an amazing way to relax and unwind! These sulpher-rich baths are said to give relief to some rheumatic and skin conditions and could also make you look younger! Fab!
Lazy day boat trips are popular in Dalaman and are perfect if you want to sit back and be looked after by the crew. Many include a fantastic onboard BBQ and drinks. Marmaris offers lots of boat trips to the islands and bays nearby. The Paradise Island (Nimara) opposite to Marmaris, Turunç, Kumlubük, Çiftlik, and Phosphorus Cave are the most popular destinations for daily tours.
To see how the other half live, visit Gocek, which is often referred to as the St Tropez of Turkey. With beautiful, unspoilt beaches and an exclusive yachting marina, Gocek is one of Turkey’s most affluent areas and is fab to have a nosey round.

Dalaman is particularly popular with families, but couples and young groups also enjoy the area. Although Dalaman is quite quiet, its neighbouring resorts are lively and provide a fantastic mix to
Turkey holidays
.

Book a Dalaman Holiday now!

On the Beach offers a wide range of Dalaman resorts, from self catering to all inclusive.
Resorts in Dalaman
Dalaman itself is a little Turkish Mediterranean farming town south of the coastal road, however Dalaman as a region sports many different popular resorts all benefiting from their own unique twist:
Marmaris
This port is renowned for its natural beauty and possesses two major and a number of minor marinas. Marmaris has a very young vibe and is home to a fantastic nightlife, so if you are looking for beautiful scenery, watersports and a great night out then Marmaris is the resort to choose.
Icmeler
Icmeler lies within the Marmaris resort area, and provides breathtaking mountain top views over the stunning Aegean Sea. Icmeler's former function as a fishing and diving town has elevated its water sports facilities above those of neighbouring resorts, and its recent development as a tourist destination has provided high quality restaurants and hotels.
Fethiye
Another marine town, holidaying in Fethiye is really a burst to summer life. Crystal blue waters make the beaches the highlight of the town, although its heritage also plays a part in its tourism, with attractions such as the Lycian rock tombs carved into the faces of the cliffs.
Olu Deniz
Situated at the base of the Babadag Mountain, Olu Deniz provides tourists with the most photographed beach on the Mediterranean. Famous for its lagoon of aquamarine and turquoise, Olu Deniz is considered as one of the best places to paraglide in the world due to its unique panoramic views provided by the Babadag Mountain, with opportunities for beginners to do so.
