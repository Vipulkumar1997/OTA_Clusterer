Monarch Airlines Failure

We are aware that Monarch Airlines has ceased trading and all flights are cancelled.

If you are currently in-resort, we are working with the CAA to bring all customers currently on holiday home. Do not worry, you do not need to cut your holiday short. The CAA will arrange a new flight as near to the scheduled return date and time of your existing Monarch flight as possible. Replacement flights can be found on the following website:
https://monarch.caa.co.uk/
and will be available 48 hours prior to travel.

If you are due to travel from the UK with Monarch, unfortunately, your flight is cancelled so do not go to the airport.

We are contacting customers in order of departure with advice.

Due to the cancellations our Contact Centre is very busy; please bear with us. We will update this page and our affected customers with more information as soon as we have it.


Foreign Travel Advice

Customer safety is a priority for us and to help make sure that your holiday runs as smoothly as possible, we recommend visiting
www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice
to keep up to date with the latest travel news in your chosen destination.





Electronics banned from hand luggage on direct flights from certain destinations




All electronic devices larger than mobile phones should be carried in hold luggage when travelling from Turkey, Egypt, Morocco or Tunisia. For full information about luggage restrictions for UK airports,
visit gov.uk.







Environmental Tax introduced for the Maltese Islands




From 1st June 2016 an environmental tax will apply to anyone over the age of 18 who is staying in tourist accommodation in the Maltese Islands.

A small fee of €0.50 per person will apply for each night spent on a Maltese Island. This includes hotels, beds and breakfasts, holiday apartments, hostels and resorts.

You will be asked to pay this amount upon arrival at your accommodation, payments will be capped at a maximum of €5 per person for each continuous stay.






Sustainable Tourism Tax introduced for the Balearic Islands




The Balearic Parliament has approved a new sustainable tourism tax.

From 1st of July 2016, customers travelling to the Balearics will have to pay the new sustainable tourism tax. Up to €2 per day, per adult on all overnight stays in "tourist accommodation" will be payable in resort.

The tax costs from €1 per day for stays in one-star to three-star hotels and to €2 for stays in some four and five-star hotels.

Children aged under 16 will be exempt from the tax and during low season (1 November - 30 April), there will be a 50% discount.

Tax payable by long-term holidaymakers will be reduced to 50% from the ninth day of their stay.

The Sustainable Tourism Tax is intended to help preserve their environment. For further information please visit our
blog post
.






Travel to and from Egypt




We recommend checking each airlines websites for the latest information.


17 January, 2017


The Foreign and Commonwealth Office have updated their
advice for travel to Egypt
and are advising against all but essential travel by air to or from Sharm el Sheikh Airport while they investigate security arrangements at the airport.

With the on-going situation for travel to and from Sharm el Sheikh, we wanted to update our customers. Each airline has a slightly different cancellation policy and dates that their flights are cancelled up to; here's a summary for each airline:


Thomson
- flights are cancelled up to and including the 30th September, 2017.


Thomas Cook
- all flights are cancelled for the foreseeable future.

*Please note that this information is subject to change as and when the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and/or airlines update their policies.

We will continue to update this page as soon as there is further information from our airline partners or the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office
.


For customers who are due to fly to Sharm el Sheikh and are paying by our low deposit scheme:
If your flight is due to fly after the latest cancellation dates, at this moment (and until further communications from the FCO and/or airlines), your holiday is due to take place as planned. The payments, as agreed in your holiday payment schedule, will still need to be made. If you want to check the payment schedule, the details are available in either your Booking Confirmation email (sent to you shortly after you booked with us) or in your
Manage Your Booking
account. If the advice for travel to Sharm El Sheikh and your holiday is later cancelled, you will be due a refund and it will be processed as per the information below.

Please note that cancellations and/or refunds can only be issued once your outbound flight (e.g. from the UK to Sharm el Sheikh) and inbound flight (e.g. from Sharm el Sheikh to UK) have both been cancelled by the airline(s). If you are due to fly on different airlines, please refer to the individual airline cancellation policy and date.

If you are due a refund, we will send you an email with all the information you need to collect it from your
Manage Your Booking.
Please bear with us as we process these refunds. We're working through them as quickly as we can so that you can make alternative arrangements. We apologise for any disruption.

If you are unsure who you are flying with, you can check in your
Manage Your Booking
account. You'll need your Lead Passenger's surname and Order number(s) - starting with MYB, which will be on your original email confirmation.
