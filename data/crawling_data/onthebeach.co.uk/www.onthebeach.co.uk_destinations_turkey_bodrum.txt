Bodrum Weather

Bodrum is famous for its Mediterranean climate with long hot summers, pleasant spring and autumn months and mild winters.
The blistering sunshine throughout the summer months reaches highs of 30° C, however during May throughout to October Bodrum does benefit from the Meltemi wind, which offers a satisfying breeze on some of the hottest days and cools down the temperatures for a comfortable evening.
The spring and autumn months in Bodrum are popular for those wanting a bright and sunny holiday without it being uncomfortably hot. Temperatures during these months range from the low to mid 20’s, meaning these months are perfect for activities such as walking and hiking, taking advantage of the beautiful scenery and bright blue skies.
The winter months see rainfall and much cooler weather, with temperatures dropping to 10°C or below, so isn’t recommended as a winter sun destination.

Things To Do on Bodrum Holidays

Whether you are visiting Bodrum to relax and top up your tan or you are wanting to take advantage of the brilliant watersports or historical wonders, Bodrum is a perfect holiday destination for you. Take a look below at just some of the activities that Bodrum offers to ensure you have a fantastic holiday that you deserve.
If you want to sit back and relax then take a Blue Cruise along the Turkish coastline on a Turkish gulit to sail along the breathtaking coast of Bodrum and truly relax as you explore the many coves, take in the amazing views and even top up your tan as you sit on the deck. The trips usually take a few hours and are fantastic if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle. You can even take advantage of an extended route and visit a nearby Greek Island.

Culture

The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus is located in Bodrum and is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Built for the king Mausollos of Caria, who died 353 B.C. by his wife and sister Queen Artemisia, the castle was destroyed by an earthquake between AD 1000 and AD 1400 and rebuilt in 1494 by the Knights of St. John of Malta. Although much of the castle has been damaged, the remains along with sculptured murals of soldiers and animals are still a popular attraction.
Bodrum Amphitheatre was built during the reign of King Mausollos and is situated on a hillside overlooking the whole of Bodrum. Once housing 13,000, this is a fascinating visit and offers beautiful views over the castle and harbor.
The Castle of St Peter, a medieval redoubt built by crusaders which now hosts The Museum of Underwater Archaeology is a must if you are in Bodrum as it boasts amazing sea views, a Byzantine shipwreck hall and scary old dungeons to scare yourselves in! It is a great visit and is aimed at visitors of all ages.
You really know you're in Turkey when you are holidaying in Bodrum, with a bazaar every Thursday and Friday selling the finest food and fish freshly caught. There are other daily markets such as the textile market on Tuesdays and the fruit and cheese sale - you'll likely not even know the sheer variety of fruits there are until you come to this!
Antiques and exotic baubles are also ten-a-penny here, so you'll have more with which to remember your Bodrum holidays than just memories!

Adventure

Bodrum offers many exciting activities to keep you busy on your holiday. For something really energetic, try water-skiing or windsurfing on where the peninsula beaches are perfect. The waters around Bodrum are popular with divers and snorkelers and you will find many diving schools in the area if you want some expert help. More activities include river-rafting along the
Dalaman
river, jet skies and for something more relaxing but still exciting, parasailing.
If you want an adventure out of the water in Bodrum, you will find jeep safaris a fantastic way to see the spectacular views of the entire region. Horse riding, walking and trekking are also very popular ways of seeing what Bodrum and the surrounding areas have to offer.
