Read more about Laganas



Laganas is the largest resort on the island of Zante. It is the only 18-30 resort on the island and is certainly not the place to go for a quiet week. But if it's fun, beaches and partying you're after then you can't go far wrong.
With myriad restaurants, a choice of tavernas and bars and a smattering of top clubs, Laganas is the ideal destination for party-hungry people looking for a good time in the sun!
If there's one thing Laganas knows how to do it's nightlife! The resort is full of great bars and clubs and there really is something for everyone. Zero bar is one of the most popular bars on the resort and comes complete with fire-breathing and flare bottles! XParadiso throws the best beach parties around while Cocktails and Dreams is a themed bar based on the Tom Cruise movie Cocktail.
While Laganas rocks into the night, the nearby resorts of Kalamaki and Vassilikos are chilled out, offering a much more laid back and authentically Greek holiday experience.

Laganas Weather

Laganas has a Mediterranean climate offering hot summers and mild winters with copious amounts of sunshine throughout the year. The best time of year to visit Zante is between April and September when the sun is at it's brightest and the temperatures at their highest. Don't worry that it's going to be too hot and sticky during the summer months, cool breezes called Meltemia provide just enough light wind to cool you down.
If a tan isn't top of your list and you would rather avoid the crowds, head to Laganas outside the peak summer months. Late September and October are much more quiet and relaxed but still offer great weather.

Landscape

Laganas is in a fertile area which means much of the land is covered in lush greenery making for some stunning scenery. Of course, if you head to a Greek Island you're not necessarily looking for greenery, what you are looking for though is beaches! Luckily for you, you won't be disappointed. Laganas beach is beautiful 9km long sandy beach with clear blue waters, what more could you want?



Things To Do on Laganas Holidays

Laganas is known for being the fun-spot on Zante - and lets face it girls, what's more fun than shopping? The resort is a shoppers paradise. From cute markets where you can find unique goods and one of a kind crafts to souvenir shops and clothes stores were you can pick up designer clothes at great prices.
For many though, it is the stunning beach that makes Laganas their choice above others. Long and sandy, the beach is the perfect place to chill out after a night out!

Culture

Laganas was founded around the time of the Trojan War by Zakynthos, son of the King of Troy. It has a rich history that is still celebrated, despite the modernisation of the resort. To witness this it's best to time your visit with one of the local festivals including the Feast of the Virgin Mary on August 15th and December 17th, which marks the death of Agios Dionysios, the patron saint of Zakynthos.
