Landscape

The beach in Praia da Rocha is known for being one of the most beautiful in the Algarve. The mile-long stretch of sand and clear blue waters keeps tourists flocking throughout the year. Praia da Rochaâ€™s landscape is made even more stunning by its beautiful coastline, a stretch of jagged sandstone cliffs offering spectacular views of the area.



Things To Do on Praia Da Rocha Holidays

The main attraction in Praia da Rocha is the beachfront casino which hosts life shows throughout the year and offers great evening entertainment. Thereâ€™s also the opportunity to go horse riding or try a round of golf. Visitors holidays in Praia da Rocha should also visit the nearby town of
Portimao
which is famous for its great shopping facilities. Thereâ€™s a fantastic market and plenty of unique boutiques, perfect for a spot of clothes shopping.

Culture

The Algarve is very proud of its culture and this is shown throughout the year by the way it celebrates its many festivals. February is carnival time in the region and the streets are filled with colourful processions. During March the Easter processions begin culminating in the Easter celebrations in April with the celebration of the bloodless â€˜Carnationâ€™ Revolution.

Nightlife

There are also several good nightclubs and, being an established resort, many of the hotels in the area offer evening entertainment and live shows so youâ€™re never short of something to do.
Take an evening and head into nearby
Alvor

.
