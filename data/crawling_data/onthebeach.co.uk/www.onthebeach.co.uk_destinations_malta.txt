Read more about Malta



Malta is often referred to as the island of sunshine thanks to the terrific weather and climate, which has a typically Mediterranean flavour and boasts over 300 sunny days a year.
With over 6,000 years of civilisation, history oozes from Malta's every pore and if you love a bit of culture and heritage, the island is scattered with amazing archaeological artefacts and historical sites including St John’s Co-Cathedral.

However, there’s more to this beautiful island than its fascinating past. These days, Malta is the set for Hollywood blockbusters (Gladiator, Troy and Alexander were all filmed here) and it is also a hotspot for scuba diving, a place for great nightlife and home to some of the Mediterranean's best beaches such as the beautiful Mellieha Bay which is Malta’s longest beach.
Holidays in Malta are an outdoor enthusiast's paradise, with plenty of charming towns and villages to explore alongside its beautiful coastline and shimmering blue seas. Valetta, Malta’s UNESCO-listed capital city offers a lot of culture and is definitely worth as visit, especially for the Grand Harbour boat tour.

Malta’s Mediterranean culture creates a thriving cosmopolitan nightlife, from relaxed café culture to clubs and bars in which to dance away the night. The liveliest areas for partying are Paceville (in St Julians) and Bugibba, which are filled with indoor and outdoor clubs whilst Malta’s warm climate means that beach parties are also very popular during the hot summer nights.
Night owls looking to experience Malta under the stars should head to Café Del Mar in St Paul’s Bay, Bedouin Bar (summer only) at the Westin Dragonara Resort; BJs Live Music Club in Paceville, Malta’s only live Jazz venue and Hugo’s Terrace where Hed Kandi has taken up residency throughout the summer.

Dance the night away at Gianpula or Numero Uno, two of Malta’s largest open air night clubs and La Grotta in Xlendi, Gozo, one of the most beautiful open air clubs in the Mediterranean. For the best views, head to the contemporary and stylish Twenty Two. Situated on the top floor of the highest building in Malta, you’ll experience panoramic views of the Mediterranean Sea and local towns and cities.
If all that talk of clubbing sounds a bit too lively, picturesque St Julians, which is home to many Maltese fisherman, is peppered with bougainvillea-lined restaurants and cafes where you can enjoy a pleasant evening meal and then sip cocktails whilst listening to relaxing live entertainment.

Landscape

Most people come on Malta holidays for the magnificent beaches. Sun worshippers will be right at home on Golden Bay, Paradise Bay and St Pauls, just three of Malta's many beautiful beaches. So, if you're just looking to relax and top up your tan on holidays to Malta, or you prefer to indulge in more sporty adventures like scuba diving, water skiing, jet skiing or parascending, you'll have a vast array of beaches to choose from, ranging from red and golden sands and rocky inlets to blue lagoons!



Things To Do on Malta Holidays

No holiday in Malta would be complete without a visit to its capital, Valletta. Here, you'll find magnificent cathedrals, ancient fortifications, museums, historic churches and some of the finest restaurants on the island as well as plenty of shopping. It's also well worth a ferry or catamaran trip to visit its neighbouring islands of Gozo and Comino and you can even take in several Italian ports and visit the island of Sicily on a day trip.
Younger members of the family can go wild at 'Splash and Fun'. With its water slides and dinosaur park, this is a great day out if you're on a family holiday in Malta. And, for the experience of a lifetime, swim with the dolphins at the Mediterraneo Marine Park! As well as the dolphin show, you can also take in the fantastic sea lion and parrot shows, and there are many other species of animals in the park to observe.

Culture

Catholic festivals or saints' feast days are the most important dates on the Maltese calendar, where the celebrations are huge and you'll witness some amazing processions and fireworks displays. You'll also not want to return home from your Malta holidays before you've tasted fenkata, which is a Maltese celebratory dish consisting of rabbit which is marinated overnight in wine and bayleaf. For fish lovers, you must try lampuki in tomato and caper sauce and Maltese sausage and Gozo's famous goat's cheese are other delicacies to leave your mouth watering.
