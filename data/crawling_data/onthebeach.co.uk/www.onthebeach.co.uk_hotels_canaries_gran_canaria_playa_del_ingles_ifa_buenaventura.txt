Overview

Located just a short stroll from the spectacular Playa del Ingles beach, the colourful IFA Buenaventura is particularly popular with families thanks to its friendly atmosphere and great facilities. With an excellent All-inclusive programme on offer, this hotel is a real one-stop shop for a great value holiday - and if you fancy exploring further afield, there's tons of shops, bars and restaurants right down the street.

How far is the nearest beach?

This hotel is located about 550m from the beach.

Distance from Airport

Rooms

The hotel’s Standard Rooms are decorated in light pastel hues, and feature an en-suite bathroom, satellite TV, safe (local charge), hairdryer, telephone and a balcony or terrace. Five specially-adapted rooms are also available for guests with disabilities.

Food & Drink

At the main buffet restaurant, La Guitarra, there’s a varied international buffet to explore, along with an airy outdoor terrace for dining al fresco. Special diets such as diabetic and coeliac can be catered for upon request. Please note that a dress code applies for dinner; swimwear, t-shirts, flip-flops and shorts are not permitted, and gentlemen must wear trousers, shirts and formal shoes.

For lighter bites, there’s also a casual self-service restaurant called Picnic, along with two friendly pool bars. Drinks are available at Freddy’s Beer Bar, which is located on the main terrace, and at the modern Meeting Bar by reception.
