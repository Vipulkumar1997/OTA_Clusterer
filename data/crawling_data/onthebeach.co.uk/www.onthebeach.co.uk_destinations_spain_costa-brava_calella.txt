Landscape

The beaches are the resort's biggest pull for most people on Calella holidays. The three-kilometre seafront boasts a huge variety of activities and services including watersports, kids’ clubs and even a beach library! Platja Gran Calella is the largest of the three main beaches. If the seven bars, restaurant, and rafts anchored offshore are not enough, catch a water-taxi to a neighbouring resort, or stroll along the attractive gardens nearby.
Beyond the main beaches, you'll find charming, secluded rocky coves. The spotless main beaches have consistently received the European Blue Flag for water quality and cleanliness.



Things To Do on Calella Holidays

Explore the old town with its narrow streets, traditional bars and bodegas. The parish church of Santa Maria is beautiful, as is the 14th Century Casa dels Salvadors. The town’s museum charts local history from pre-Roman times, and, to the south-west, you can see the ruins of some old communications towers built in the mid-19th Century, and the old lighthouse.
Stroll through the lovely Dalmau Park, a peaceful spot in the heart of Calella, with Mediterranean pinewoods, fountains and play areas. Getting around couldn’t be easier – just jump on the tourist mini-train circling the town every half-hour in high season.
Further afield,
Barcelona
and all it has to offer are less than an hour away by the regular train service.

Culture

Colourful fiestas bring the streets to life, and are sure to be a high spot of your Calella holidays. In the summer, you can see the famous Sardana danced at the beachfront on Sunday evenings. Early June brings a big Sardana festival, and in mid-September, visit the La Minerva music festival, complete with paella contest and a parade of huge, beautifully sculpted papier mache figures. Other events include an October beer festival, and a February carnival.

Nightlife

Calella has dozens of late-night bars, making for a lively after-dark scene, with a host of Spanish-style fiestas, foam parties and hotel entertainment. For all-night partying, head for the south-west of the resort, where the clubs are. You can even grab a free limousine ride to travel between some of them. For tapas and traditional Catalan specialities, head for the old town.
Nearby
Malgrat de Mar
and
Blanes
offer a different atmosphere at night and are both worth a visit during your holidays to Calella.
