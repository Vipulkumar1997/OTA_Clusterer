Read more about Torremolinos



The original Costa del Sol holiday resort, Torremolinos has become one of the most well-developed and appealing destinations for those considering holidays to Spain. Raucously hedonistic, it does however remain the party capital of the Costa del Sol!
With one of the widest varieties of things to do and see, there's always something to tickle your fancy, whether its relaxing by the crystal-clear blue waters, exciting watersports or partying until the sun rises, Torremolinos holidays have it all. Just 5 miles from Malaga airport, itself just a two-hour flight from most UK airports, Torremolinos offers a wild, passionate slice of Spanish hospitality for the whole family.
Torremolinos was the first resort in the Costa del Sol to be developed for the tourist industry back in the early sixties, so if you've come looking to sample authentic Spain, you'll want to head out of town. However, the city takes on an entirely different atmosphere outside of the summer season, with the entire resort seeming more authentically Spanish during the autumn and winter months.
Even in summer, if you look hard enough, you can still find authentic Spanish tapas bars and all sorts of bohemian bazaars and boutiques offering a wide variety of traditional Spanish food and merchandise.
If you like your nightlife buzzing, you've come to the right place! Torremolinos is famous for its wild, hedonistic party culture, with many bars and clubs closing their doors when the sun rises. Every type of music is well catered for with great clubs offering live sets from famous DJs until the early hours that are guaranteed to keep you dancing!
If a night out partying is not what you want from your holidays then you could head into Malaga for the evening or perhaps visit the quieter town of Fuengirola.

Torremolinos Weather

Beautiful sunny days, and mild nights are what Torremolinos holidays are famed for. Typical summer temperatures can hit 30° Celsius or even higher, so bring plenty of light, airy clothes and extra sunscreen! Water temperatures are also very mild, in the low twenties, so paddling or swimming is particularly pleasant during the summer season when holidays in Torremolinos are most popular.
