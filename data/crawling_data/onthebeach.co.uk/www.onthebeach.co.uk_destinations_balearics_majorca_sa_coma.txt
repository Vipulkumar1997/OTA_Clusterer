Read more about Sa Coma



Holidays in Sa Coma are perfect if you are looking for plenty to do in a delightful modern resort. Situated on the east coast of Majorca, this is a family-friendly resort with a large choice of bars, restaurants and attractions.
Those looking for more lively
Majorca holidays
full of parties would be best heading to Magalluf as Sa Coma holidays, though there are some bar and restaurants, cater to couples and families looking for rest and relaxation under the sun.
The surrounding countryside and the discovery of ancient remains attract nature loving tourists. The 1km long sandy beach will appeal to those who want to relax or enjoy a number of watersports available. Those wanting to indulge in a little traditional culture when on holidays in Sa Coma, may want to head to the nearby port of Porto Cristo.
The nightlife in Sa Coma is not as lively as other places but there are a number of bars to choose from. If you fancy a night on the tiles, it would be better heading to nearby Cala Millor which has a number of discos.
Evening entertainment in Sa Coma is generally hotel based, which is great if you are on a budget, but there is nothing better than going out for a delicious meal at one of the number of restaurants available. There are a number of traditional dishes on offer but also fast food for those that do not want to try the local cuisine.

Sa Coma Weather

As you would expect with Sa Coma holidays, sun lovers will be in their element in July and August as temperatures reach up to and beyond 30° Celsius - sun cream is an essential at this time of year. If you like it a little cooler then you will love Majorca later in the year as the temperatures are in the low to mid 20's, with plenty sun and the occasional cloudy day.

Things To Do on Sa Coma Holidays

Golfing enthusiasts on holidays to Sa Coma will love the Golf Paradis which is a 54 hole mini golf complex. There is a choice of 3 very different 18 hole courses set in gardens with waterfalls, palm trees, lakes and windmills. For
families
with children, on the outskirts of Sa Coma there is an Auto Safari Zoo. Whether you want to go round in your own car or the zoo's mini train, that is your choice but beware the monkeys do get hungry! If you enjoy horse riding, the small riding stable in the resort will be very enjoyable. You are able to ride out to the Punta de n'Amer headland to take in the scenery, but this is very popular with tourists so booking early is essential.
Should you want a change of scenery on your holidays to Sa Coma, take a trip to the Caves of Drach and take in the sights of this underground wonderland. There is also an aquarium next door if the children want to look at the exotic fish from all over the world.

Culture

You can gain an insight into Majorca's exciting history by visiting the number of museums on offer and exploring the old towns. Over the years tourism has increased which has meant that the resorts have had to adapt by growing demand. Although the resorts have had to become more modern, there are some true Majorcan towns in the central parts of the island that are worth visiting.
The east coast has plenty of local markets and the nearest one to this resort is in Avenida las Palmeras, held every Wednesday. The first fiesta of the east coast takes place on the two days around 16 - 17th of January each year. It is held in Sant Llorenc des Cardassar and begins with lighting of small bonfires and traditional songs being sung. The patron saint's day fiesta doesnt fall until August 10 and is a week long event with sporting events and music.
