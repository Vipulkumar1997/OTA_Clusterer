Read more about Corralejo



Fuerteventura is renowned worldwide for providing visitors with a chance to enjoy peace and relaxation in a quiet, safe and warm location. On the northern tip of this beautiful island, Corralejo, the biggest tourist resort on Fuerteventura, is a seamless blend of old port and new low-rise resort, and attracts a mixed bag of holidaymakers from all over Europe. The old part of town, a tiny warren of narrow whitewashed alleyways behind the port, really comes to life in the evenings. But it is the gorgeous, broad white-sand beach, where kite surfers now catch the eye, which has secured Corralejo holidays as a popular destination.
Although many Canary Island Resorts are famous for clubbing, Fuerteventura is not one of them, and so offers a much more serene break more suited to families and couples than party-loving youngsters. That, of course, is not to say the island is without great nightlife. Your Corralejo hotel will provide you with entertainment, and along the seafront there is a hugely popular promenade. Home to fantastic restaurants and bars, you’ll be able to enjoy delicious meals in a hospitable and totally relaxed environment, making your cheap Corralejo holiday a truly unwinding experience!
For those who appreciate the charm and beauty of an unspoilt landscape, a Corralejo holiday will be an absolute dream. The town’s beaches are splendid, with golden sands, and the cove is even surrounded by jagged volcanic rock. As a fishing village, the town’s most prominent feature is the stunning harbour, which offers a picturesque location for an evening stroll. The town's architecture in general meanwhile is elegant and understated, as typical of the Spanish style, and so provides plenty of photo opportunities.

Corralejo Weather

Corralejo enjoys year-round sunshine and very little rainfall. Average daytime temperatures vary between 16°C at the start of the year and 25°C during the peak months of July and August.

If that sounds a bit too hot, or if you're visiting with younger kids who are more sensitive to the sun, try taking a Corralejo holiday outside of peak time - perhaps in October or February when the island still enjoys mild weather of around 23° Celsius, so a tan is still possible! The island also receives mild north-easterly winds all year round, so you’ll receive a welcome breeze whatever time you visit. Take particular care during peak season, though, as the breeze can disguise the strength of the sun.

Things To Do on Corralejo Holidays

A holiday in Carralejo will provide you with a wealth of activities, so be prepared for a busy break! The town's beaches have several miles of fine sand and blue waters, with sand dunes that have even been designated as nature reserves - a must for enthusiasts. You'll also be able to enjoy watersports, as well as fishing opportunities, and even a trip to the nearby volcanic island of Lobos. Because Fuerteventura is a relatively small island, other towns are within easy driving distance, which makes exploring other towns such as Caleta de Fuste both very easy and an absolute pleasure.

Culture

Like most of the Canary Islands, Fuerteventura enjoys an interesting past with a history of inhabitation stretching back to prehistoric times. Why not take a trip to the historic town of La Oliva, which was once the island’s capital? It is home to exquisite architecture, and features some of the most important historic monuments on the island.
A packed events calendar will ensure your holiday to Corralejo is definitely one to remember. In September the town of Betancuria hosts its annual Religious Pilgrimage, which is sure to provide a spectacle of parades and fireworks. Meanwhile in October the town of Antigua holds its Deep Sea Fishing Tournament- perfect if you’ve been getting some practice in at Corralejo’s harbour! In July, the capital of Fuerteventura, Puerto del Rosario, holds its Triathlon. With so many events to attend, it’s only a question of choosing what to attend next.

Families

Corralejo holidays are very child-friendly. Baku Water Park (Avenida Nuestra Señora del Carmen) features a fantastic variety of flumes and slides as well as a large swimming pool, and is a super day out for all the family. The beaches are also great for kids as they're very safe with shallow water and gently sloping sands.

Shopping

Love to shop? Corralejo's main shopping street is Avenida Nuestra Señora del Carmen. It has several modern indoor shopping malls
(centro commerciales)
selling a mix of standard resort fare, including clothes, perfumes and souvenirs. At the port end of the street you'll find several great fashion shops, and surf shops are everywhere! Around the port itself there are some lovely little boutiques selling ethnic and world products such as wooden carvings and gorgeous jewellery.

The island's famous market comes to Avenida Nuestra Señora del Carmen each Monday and Friday morning. You can pick up some beautifully made and inexpensive leatherwork, linens, pretty lace, ceramics and African goods. Don't forget to barter!

Relaxation

Beaches! Corralejo has several of them. The small and sandy Town Beach, near the port, is handy for keeping kids safely occupied while parents eat or shop. From here, a narrow sandy strip, Playa Galera, follows the bay for some 500 metres to the main beach, Grandes Playas. This is a gorgeous, wide, long, powder-soft white stretch of sand which reaches for over 7km. Flag Beach is
the
place for kite surfing and wind surfing. Nearby, on the other side of the coastal road, Parque Natural de las Dunas is home to acres of virgin white sand dunes.

Boats run daily to the little island of Los Lobos, a beautiful desert island. You can walk around it in just a couple of hours, enjoy a romantic meal in its one and only rustic restaurant and enjoy the panoramic views from the top of its "almost a mountain" mountain.

Because Fuerteventura is a relatively small island, other towns are within easy driving distance, which makes exploring other towns such as
Caleta de Fuste
very easy, not to mention an absolute pleasure.



Who goes to Corralejo?

Corralejo holidays appeal to families of all ages and couples, from all over Europe but particularly from Britain. The older area of town, the stunning undeveloped beaches and the water sports opportunities also attract more bohemian travellers, including many surfers who flock there to enjoy the great waves.
