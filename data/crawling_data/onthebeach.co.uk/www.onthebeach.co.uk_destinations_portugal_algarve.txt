Read more about Algarve



Imagine gorgeous beaches, quiet sandy coves, quaint cobbled villages and glorious hospitality, and you’ve summed up Portugal's prime holiday destination the Algarve. Recent reports in 2016 have shown that the Algarve is the cheapest holiday destination in Europe, with low prices for flights, hotels and food and drink making it the perfect holiday hotspot.
Cheap holidays in the Algarve are perfect for families, couples and groups of all shapes and sizes. Boasting golden sands including Falesia beach and Praia de Benagil, white-washed walls, bright blue skies and luscious greenery, the Algarve’s paint-by-numbers setting is not only rich in flora and fauna, but bursting with character too.

The breathtaking Ponta da Piedade is a group of rock formations along the Lagos coastline and promises a great day out as well as an insight into the geography of the resort. You’ll also find the magnificent lighthouse here and a selection of wild orchids in full bloom in the spring.

Largely untouched in the way of over-development, unlike many other popular holiday destinations, the Algarve has managed to steer clear of garish complexes and man-made resorts in favour of more traditional looking hotels and villas. From the riverside views at Tavira and vineyards at Lagoa, to the plentiful golf courses dotted up and down the coastline - including the championship course of Quinta da Logo - Algarve Holidays have more than enough to occupy your time, even if you’re not a sun-worshipper.

The perfect place to holiday when you need to cater for a variety of interests and inclinations, Algarve holidays are the ultimate all-rounder. Evening entertainment in the Algarve comes in all shapes and sizes, and you can spend your nights sampling local wines and dining on fresh fish, hedging your bets at Vilamoura’s famous casino, browsing the stalls at Loule market or dancing the night away, courtesy of Albufeira's vibrant bars and clubs.

Algarve Weather

If you’re a fan of tropical temperatures and sunshine from dawn ‘til dusk, Algarve holidays won’t disappoint. Temperatures in July and August remain at a heady height of 28degrees, and even in winter, average temperatures rarely fall below 15degrees - let alone reach the zero mark like they do in Britain. If you don’t fancy breaking into a sweat the moment you step outside, it’s best to visit between October and March where the odd spot of rain will help to cool you down, or set up camp near the mountains where the weather is more versatile, but generally cooler and wetter. Either way, you’ll find the constant sea breeze that rolls off the Atlantic is a welcome addition to the summer heat.

Things To Do on Algarve Holidays

Renowned for its golf courses (there are around thirty to choose from), if you want to improve your handicap, golf holidays in the Algarve will see you spoilt for choice. From Vilamoura’s Old Course, Tavira’s Colina Verde and Carvoeiro’s Gramacho Course, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to dabble in a full round or a game of pitch and putt. And when you’re ready to retire from your day on the green, there’s always the chance to sample some local wines or saunter through the sleepy coastal towns, where life continues to centre around the seafront. If, on the other hand, you consider yourself something of a daredevil, don’t be fooled into thinking activities here are always slow-paced. You can go off-road in a jeep adventure, take a high-speed water safari around the coastline, or divulge in a selection of water sports - whether it’s surfing, sailing or paragliding. Even the little ones will be in their element thanks to the spotless stretches of sand and numerous aqua parks, including Zoomarine Stare, where you can watch water mammals perform their magic every day of the week.

Culture

The Moorish influence is still present throughout the Algarve, in particular when it comes to the architecture where narrow streets and lace-patterned chimneys are the norm. But it's not just through structural artefacts that the locals like to express themselves as food (think freshly-caught fish, peri-peri chicken and super-sweet afters), and dance have their part to play too. In fact anyone holidaying on the Algarve should make it their mission to experience the ‘corridinho' - a traditional folk dance that stems back to the nineteenth century.

Characteristically laid back and tolerant, the Portuguese lifestyle is set at a completely different pace in comparison to the British guests that flock there, with family meals and regular church visits a must; but with a huge cafe culture and welcoming atmosphere, tourists usually slip into the carefree customs at ease. You won't find language barriers a problem either, with most Portuguese happy to switch between the local lingo and fluent English at any given time.

Covering 6% of Portugal, the Algarve has an incredibly diverse landscape with the coastline bordered by sky-high cliffs, the inland bursting with rich vegetation in the form of fig trees and orange groves, and the north filled in with their very own mountain range. To explore the entire region it's worth hiring a car or booking on a tailored tour when you first arrive.
