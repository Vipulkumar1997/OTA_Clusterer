Landscape

Ibiza Town or as the Catalans call 'Elvissa' is a city and municipality situated on the south-easterly cost of Ibiza, one of the largest of the Balearic islands.  Split into two main parts the Dalt Vila (the old town) built on a small mountain by the sea and the modern part Eixample.  Dalt Vila owing to its mountain setting has some sublime Mediterranean Sea views not to mention the romance and history within its narrow cobblestone streets.
The port and two of the most glamorous marinas in Europe along with the beautiful beaches nearby make a sensational setting to enjoy your Ibiza Town holiday.  A great way to see the city with all its elegance and romance is by the Marina Botafoch.  The exuberant yachts and gentle waters form a graceful foreground for a magnificent view of the Dalt Vila.



Things To Do on Ibiza Town Holidays

Ibiza Town holidays offer a world of opportunities.  If you are looking to relax, soak up the culture, enjoy adventure with the family or party till you drop Ibiza Town holidays have more than you could ever cram in to one holiday, you will find it hard not to keep going back.

Culture

Dalt Vilathe old town set within 16th century walls and through its steep narrow cobblestone streets is a historical treasure trove.  Gothic Catalan buildings overhang spacious courtyards and the magnificent views take in the architecture of the Santa Domingochurch in front of the panoramic Mediterranean horizon.
Visit the Museo Arqueologic by the cathedral for an inspiring look into Ibiza Town's rich history or take a guided audio tour of Dalt Vilato delve into the many different cultures and past settlements the city has witnessed.  Museo Puig des Molinshousing the world’s largest Carthaginian artefact collection set on one of the most important Carthaginian burial grounds, it is certainly not to be missed.
Ibiza Town from its first settlements 3000 years ago has been home to more than its fair share of different rulers.  Its original Carthaginian foundation can be seen in the burial grounds Puig des Molins in Ibiza Town and the world’s largest collection of Punic artefacts can be found here.

The island's rich history has also seen the Romans and their legacy best seen at the gates of Dalt Vila, followed by the Arabs who fortified the city walls leaving some of the watch towers that can still be seen today.  Ibiza Town was finally taken over by the Catalans in 1235 and the secret passage used to conquer the heavily fortified citadel can be seen in Dalt Vila.  The construction of the current day city walls in Ibiza Town was to stop the city from the invasion of pirate attacks in the 16th century.

Ibiza Town created by many historical influences continues in its melting pot of cultures today.  People of all races and countries love Ibiza Town holidays and its 'little world of contrasts', enjoying the cuisine, the nightlife and the history of the city.  Ibiza Town holidays are full of cultural options that you will never forget.

Families

Ibiza Town holidays are very popular for families.  The nearby town of Figueteras with its promenade on the beach and its large choice of sea front hotels is a perfect resort to entertain all ages.  Playa Den Bossa with the longest beach on the island is also a great base for families.  The nearby Agua Mar Water Park is a fun packed day out for the whole family with slides for young and old, bars, cafes and shady picnic areas you are sure to have a splashing time.
Due to the islands small size, varied landscape and good road network a full island tour is an experience you will never forget.  Book yourselves onto one of the road train tours whistling you round the island taking in San Antonio on the east coast and Portinatix in the north stopping at some quaint villages in between.  If you are lucky many of the tours stop at the hippy markets in Es Cana or Las Dallas where many unique bargains from across the globe can be found.

Couples

Romance is a part of Ibiza Town holidays.  The atmosphere wandering Dalt Vilawith its alluring narrow cobblestone streets, hearing the fiery tones of the local Catalan dialect cannot fail to invoke romance. Dine (or wine) your evening away in a candle lit medieval castle under the stars breathing in the fresh Mediterranean air.
Take a romantic cruise to the nearby island of Fomentera spending the day on the soft white sandy beaches by the tranquil turquoise sea, captivating yourselves in the immaculate landscapes.  For a truly enchanting Ibiza Town holiday charter your own yacht and let your private skipper sail you away to a seductive secret island and float off into the alluring Mediterranean dusk.

Adventure

Ibiza Town holidays are packed full of exciting adventure activities.  If the offer of Catamaran sailing, windsurfing, banana-boats, water ski, pedaloes and diving in nearby Playa Den Bossa doesn't float your boat, you can find adventurous inland opportunities from paint-balling to potholing.

The beautiful hilly, pine covered rural inland is a perfect backdrop for mountain biking or hiking and off road adrenaline junkies can fuel up on the options of motor cross or off road quad biking, karting is also a popular day out.  With the opportunity of hot air balloon riding or flying an ultra light aircraft Ibiza Town holidays are an adventure that never stops.
Ibiza Town is an elegant hub to go and explore the Island.  At 45 kilometres long and 25 kilometres wide no point on the island is more than an hour’s drive and renting a car you can see a vast array of culture, landscapes and horizons in a very short amount of time.  In Santa Eulalia you can take a stroll along the beautiful promenade or take in some quaint villages such as San Carlos with its delightful church and some old hippie hang out's such as Aitas Bar.

The varied landscape created by rugged cliffs form natural secluded beaches perfect for bathing and the coastal road from Agnes Blancas to Cala San Vicente has some breathtaking sea views.  If you’re looking for a bit more action the pine covered hilly countryside is an ideal and spectacular backdrop to accompany mountain bike riding or hiking, both very popular Ibiza Town holiday activities.

Shopping

Ibiza Town holidays are a shopaholics dream.  From night shopping in the old town (and the port in high season) to the not to be missed unique hippie boutiques, piercing studios and S&M shops of La Calle De La Virgen, the shopping options are unlimited.
The charming tree lined Plaza del Parque is an elegant area to shop and home to 'Natura' gift shop, selling clothes, candles, jewellery and many curious items made in developing countries you are sure not to be going home empty handed.  Extraordinary designer shops are aplenty and if service is what you’re after a personal service in 'Antic Batik' will leave you with a coordinated and truly individual outfit (shoes and bag to match!).
The hippie market in Es Cana is an essential part of an Ibiza Town holiday.  The original and biggest hippie market on the Island with items from the world over is popular for its individual and one off purchases.

Nightlife

Ibiza Town is home to some of the most legendary nightclubs and parties in the world.  From June to September the best DJ's and musicians on the planet flock to Ibiza Town bringing with them the biggest and most famous entourage you could imagine.  The bars at the Marina Botafochand Ibiza Nuevaare a hangout for the owners of the biggest and most extravagant yachts you will ever see on the waterfront just outside and is a luxurious setting to get you in the party mood.
For a distinctive start to the evening try Calle de la Virgen
,
this gay oriented street filled with hippie chic boutiques and interestingly individual bars is bustling until the small hours.  Don't worry if you just cannot get into the party mood, the club dancers and promoters run a nightly parade with stilt walkers, fire eaters and all out eccentrics that are sure to kill any notion of turning into a party pooper.
Ibiza Town is home to the original Ibizan club Pacha situated across the port and with nearby El Divino forms the central area for Ibiza Town's party scene.  For an extravagant entrance why not take a boat from the harbour straight into El Divino.  If you don't know when to stop the party never ends in Ibiza Town the famed club Space in Playa Den Bossa opens when everywhere else is closing, with one of the best lighting and sounds rigs in the world is a must for the clubbing die hard.

Relaxation

Ibiza Town holidays are great for relaxing.  Wander through the two elegant marinas, Marina Botafochand Ibiza Nueva,taking a peek at some of the most flamboyant and extraordinary yachts ever seen (and catch a glimpse of their extremely famous owners!).
Near to Ibiza Town in Playa Den Bossa is the largest beach on the island.  Soak up the sun on the soft sand or cool off in the crystal clear Mediterranean.  Stroll the palm lined promenade in nearby Figueretas taking in the artists, caricaturists and market stalls offering all kinds of handmade items.  Ibiza Town has some beautiful shady, tree lined streets like Plaza del Parque, an exceptional place to sit back and enjoy a drink watching the beautiful people walk by.
