Read more about Kos



The beautiful island of Kos is a Greek Island in the Dodecanese, near the coast of Turkey. The island boasts immaculate beaches and dazzling waters, which makes the island a popular destination for tourists who come back year after year on holidays to Greece. People who enjoy exploring their holiday destination can do no wrong with the island's archaeological heritage as Kos Town is surrounded by many monuments and ruins. The extensive coastline is stunning, particularly when the weather is at it's finest, which happens to be all year round in Kos.
The island is part of a chain of mountains offering spectacular views and vistas of the surrounding Ionian Islands. Not only that but the shores of the Kos Island are washed by the waters of the Carpathian sea with some 40km of beaches surrounding the island, Kardemena is particularly popular with it's stretch of sandy beach. Many beaches are secluded so taking a walk may lead you to find a gem which not many people flock to.
There are a number of bars in the area but not so many that they taint the originality of the island. Kardamena hosts a number of bars and nightclubs which are popular with young tourists, but there are also a few Greek tavernas and restaurants where you can have a quiet night with a few drinks. However, if you are looking for a more sedated night out then there are plenty of places to go and things to do. Take a stroll through the streets of Kos Town, down the beach front or go and get some of the local ice cream!

Kos Weather

The Island stays pretty warm all year round but in the summer it reaches a particular high of over 20 degrees and regularly reaches into the 30's. Sun cream is necessary as you will definitely be going home with a golden tan! If you plan on visiting before the summer months you will still find it to be fairly warm, making off season Kos holidays a great choice for those who want to beat the summer rush.

Things To Do on Kos Holidays

The main port, also called Kos, is the tourist and cultural centre where many of the best hotels, restaurants and a small number of nightclubs are situated. You can enjoy an evening meal where the food is locally-produced, so you will be treated to all manner of Kos delights.
If night's out partying are more you're thing then the small village of
Kardamena
should be your first stop as this is a popular resort for young tourists who flock here for the large number of bars and nightclubs. Other villages around the island are worth exploring to get a sense of the Greek culture. Kos' historical hightlights include the Plane tree of Hippocrates where the father of modern medicine, Hippocrates was thought to have taught.
Kos also hosts a number of fruit and vegetable markets in the Main square and local crafts in the Old town, although there are also a number of fashion boutiques in the modern shopping district if you fancy splashing some cash! So whether a quiet meal or a trip to Kos' surrounding villages takes you're fancy, there will be something to keep you occupied on holiday.

Culture

Most Greek Islands have a long history and Kos is no different. Along with it's Plane tree of Hippocrates, the island also has one of the only four cathedrals in the entire Dodecanese. The main religion practised is Greek Orthodoxy, but it also has a Roman Catholic church and a mosque. The synagogue, wiped out by the Nazis in World War II, has now been restored and is used to host many different events in the island's social calendar.
Farming is one of the most important occupations on the island with crops such as grapes, olives, tomatoes, lettuce and corn being grown. You can taste these delights if you visit a number of the restaurants and in particular a popular dish called Saganaki. It is not just crops that are produced, locally-produced red and white wines are available for testing in restaurants and at wineries throughout Kos. In August there is a Hypocratia festival celebrating the life of Hippocrates that features live music and athletics contests, certainly not to be missed!
