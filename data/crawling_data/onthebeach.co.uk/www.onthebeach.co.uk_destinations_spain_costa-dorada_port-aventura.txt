PortAventura World Weather

Nestled in the heart of the vibrant resort of
Salou
, Port Aventura enjoys the same dry, sunny climate that defines the Costa Dorada. Summer temperatures typically range from 28 to 32° Celsius May to August, so shorts and tee shirts all round – especially on the log flume!
Despite the water rides and air conditioning, the sun can be quite severe in the height of summer, especially when queuing for the most popular rides, so don’t forget plenty of sun lotion to stay safe on your Port Aventura holidays.

Things To Do on PortAventura World Holidays

Not only is PortAventura World home to the only eight-loop rollercoaster in the world, Dragon Kahn, there are literally hundreds of rides and attractions spread over the five world zones; the Far West, China, Mediterranean, Polynesia and Mexico, all offering their own regional flavour of excitement. From the Wild West cattle rampages of the Far West zone to the exotic Tutuki Splash log flume in Polynesia, the park offers enough entertainment and rides to keep the most energetic kids satisfied throughout your PortAventura World holidays!

Culture

In addition to the hundreds of rides and shows on offer, Port Aventura also puts on special seasonal shows for Christmas and Halloween, such as La Mina de Diablo – although an all-year round ride, a special horror walk was erected in 2006 to add a little spook to the queues for the rides! In addition to the seasonal flavour of some shows, the atmosphere of Port Aventura is very family-oriented, with a relaxed, easy going vibe throughout the whole park.

Nightlife

During peak season is when Port Avenutra comes alive. There is plenty to see and do inside the theme park with entertainment and activities. Some facilities are also open until midnight. Hotel El Paso guests can also enjoy lunch or dinner inside the theme park everyday which is included in their stay.
