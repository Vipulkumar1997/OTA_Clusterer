Side Weather

Side is blessed not just with a rich history, but also nature's kindness. The summers here are hot - well above 30° Celsius! Even if you plan on going on Side holidays in winter you'll find temperatures rarely go below 10° Celsius, so you can forget the cardigan and dig out the sunscreen. For the best tanning conditions, take you Side holidays between May and October for skies guaranteed to be blue!

Landscape

An aerial view of Side has you booking up right away - even for Turkey's Mediterranean Riviera, this landscape here is astonishing. The peninsula which houses the golden beaches is flanked on all sides by immense stretches of water as clear as sapphire, and the amphitheatre affords spectacular views.
For a quieter time on your holidays to Side, take a walk from the west beach round to the east side, which is infinitely calmer and conducive to sunset strolls, picnics or hunting for Iron Age artefacts or ancient coins!



Things To Do on Side Holidays

Be sure to check out Turkey's most famous ruins - the Aspendos Theatre, one of the world's best preserved Roman circuses, the second-century Temples to Apollo and Athena, and the sapphire blue waterfall at Manavgat. For a more tangible taste of history, check out Side Museum inside the Roman Baths, which houses statues and religious artefacts from antiquity. That's if you can tear yourself away from the light-sanded beaches, with accompanying watersports, shops and cruises that make Side holidays so much fun.

Culture

Culture-vultures will not be disappointed here - Side has managed to retain it's local identity, forged through millennia of Hellenistic, Roman and Persian invasions. Get to grips with local culture in surrounding villages at Selimiye and Turgutkoy, stopping to sample some local honey and almonds while taking in pastoral scenes, complete with goatherds and farms. Side's market opens on a Saturday - so get ready to haggle for some exotic carpets and baubles!

Nightlife

It's hard work lolling on one of the world's most beautiful beaches, watching the glorious sunsets for hours. So how about a meal to pep you up? Beautiful baked Pida bread and seafood are on the menu in the bakeries, or you can sample some freshly-caught swordfish out on the marina. At night, there are hundreds of places to go here, bars, clubs and tavernas, both by the sands and the town centre.
Side has a particular penchant for disco, so check out OXYD for some Saturday night fever! The Apollo and Lighthouse are the two best clubs for you to boogie the night away.
