See below a list of our most frequently asked questions. Here, you can see further information about online check-in, your booking documents, making a payment and more. If you don’t find the answer you’re looking for you can contact us through "My Messages"
on the "My Bookings" section of our website.




Financial Protection

Is my holiday protected?

You can rest assured knowing that your holiday is fully covered through our ATOL protection scheme.

But On the Beach go one step further. Whether you book your whole holiday, just accommodation or just flights through On the Beach, every part of your holiday is financially protected through our UK trust account, meaning we cannot access money paid
for a holiday until the date of travel.

We were really proud to be the first UK online travel agent to put this trust account system in place and we have been paying all our hotels and transfers in this way since 2011.

This means that in the unlikely event that if we or one of our suppliers experiences financial failure, customers won’t lose money paid for a holiday, hotel or flight abroad, and will not be stranded in a foreign country.

Click here to read more about how On the Beach holidays are protected




Holiday Inspiration




Where do you recommend I go on holiday this season?

On the Beach offer an extensive range of beach holidays – all of which can be found on our website. You can search to find a holiday that suits you by using the search form, or start browsing destinations
here.

You can also sign up to receive our emails to keep in touch with all of the latest deals to suit you, please enter your email address at the top of our homepage for us to keep you posted.

Or, you can visit our
blog
to keep up with our latest news and recommendations.





My Booking




When is my booking confirmed?

When you place an order on the On the Beach website, you will receive an ‘Order Request’ email, detailing your order summary. At this stage, your order has not been confirmed.

Our system will automatically try and book your order for you with the individual suppliers. If all the elements of your holiday are available at the price stated on our website, your holiday will be booked and you will receive your ‘Booking Confirmation’
email.

If for any reason our system cannot book your holiday, for example due to fluctuating flight prices or hotel availability changing at very short notice, your order will be set to pending.

At this point, we do not take any money. We call you back to discuss your options; giving you an option to either cancel the booking at no cost, pay the additional cost and confirm the order, or look for a suitable alternative with the help of our
advisors.

This happens on less than 5% of orders and our team are constantly working to minimise the effect this has on our customers.

You can read more about this here.

How do I find out about my booking

You can view your booking information from the comfort of your own home by clicking “My Bookings” at the top of our website. You can login by using your booking details: the email address and password you created at the time of booking.

If you haven’t yet done this, not to worry, you can do so by clicking on 'Create Account'. From here, you can enter the email address used at the time of booking and choose a password.

Once logged in you can do the following, without having to contact us directly:


Find and print your booking confirmation

Request a change to a booking

Update your contact details

Book transfers and extras

Make payments online


If you still need to contact us about your booking you can send us a message through "My Bookings" by clicking on "My Messages". From here, you can choose the category you need. We aim to respond to your message within 24 hours.

Where can I find my MYB number?

Your MYB reference number is sent to the email address you used at the time of booking your holiday. When you booked your holiday with us online or over the phone, you will have received an order request receipt containing your MYB reference number.

This will be displayed on the first page and at the top of the confirmation. It’s worthwhile keeping this number handy for any time you need to contact us so that we can look into your booking or query quickly and efficiently.

How can I get a copy of my booking documents?

A confirmation email will be sent to your email address as soon as your booking is confirmed. This will contain all of the booking information you need.

If you need to resend these documents, you can log into the "My Bookings" section on our website at any point.

What paperwork do I need to take?

It’s best to take your full booking confirmation with you on your holiday so that you are prepared should you need any of the information it contains during your stay. This is contained in the booking confirmation email that is sent to your email
address once you’ve made a booking with us.

If the airlines you are travelling with (outbound or inbound) require online check in, you will also be required to print off a hard copy of your boarding passes for your flights. Instructions on online check in can be found under the ‘Flight
Voucher’ section on your booking confirmation email.

How do I change my booking?

Although we can’t make changes for you over the phone, it’s simple to make changes to your booking online, through the “My Bookings” section of our website.

Depending on the change you wish to make, you will either be quoted online, or our amendments team will contact you with a quote within 48 hours, which can be found in the “My Bookings” section of our website.

Make sure you check your messages regularly so that we can process the request quickly and efficiently.

You can change the following through "My Bookings":

In-flight extras -
The price of these in-flight extras will be displayed to you before you confirm the change. Don’t forget that if you’re flying with two different airlines you will need to submit the price twice.

Changing a passenger or a name -
The price to change the name of a passenger on the booking will be shown to you before you process the request. Where this cost is the same, the request will be processed within 72 hours. If
the cost differs from those given by the suppliers, you will be informed by our amendments team before any changes are processed.

Changing travel dates -
You can request to do this online via “My Bookings”, under “request a change”. It’s worth noting that On the Beach can’t make amendments to flight bookings as these are non-refundable by the airline.
You can find more information about this on the “My Bookings” section of the website.

Changing your hotel -
There is usually a cost incurred by changing your hotel, which will be the new hotel price minus your current hotel price, plus the admin fee. You can view and confirm this information by pressing the
submit option to process your request. Make sure you are careful when entering your hotel and pricing information to reduce delays.

Cancelling passengers -
After you cancel a passenger from your holiday via “My Bookings”, we try to come back to you within 48 hours. However, there can sometimes be delays depending on the availability and prices of the providers.
If we are waiting for a response we will let you know via “My Messages”.

Adding passengers -
After you add a passenger onto your holiday via “My Bookings”, we try to come back to you within 48 hours. However, there can sometimes be delays depending on the availability and prices of the providers.

Adding a hotel to a flight-only booking -
If you wish to book accommodation to go with your already booked flights please visit the homepage or call our sales team on 0871 474 3000. You cannot add accommodation to a flight-only
booking, however, you can make a separate booking which will have its own MYB number.

**Prices and availability can vary depending on supplier costs. If, for any reason, the price for your request does change we will contact you before making any amendments to your booking.**

Do I need travel insurance

Whether you’re travelling long haul or are only hopping on a short flight to somewhere in Europe, we recommend that you always purchase adequate travel insurance at the time of booking your holiday. An emergency abroad can be extremely expensive
and securing travel insurance can help to reduce potential costs.

The policy you choose should suit the needs of those travelling with you and the nature of your holiday. Ideally, it should cover emergency medical cover and cancellation costs as a minimum.

How do I link my booking to another?

If you and your travel party have multiple bookings with On the Beach, you can now let us know. Log into the ‘My Bookings’ section on our website and select ‘Link My Booking’. Once you have entered the MYB(s) of the booking(s) you would like to link together, we will then send a request to the lead passenger of the MYB number(s) you have entered to confirm that they are happy for the bookings to be linked.
This will allow us to consider and make all parties aware of any updates or information relating to your linked bookings.

What is the charge to cancel my booking?

We don’t have standard cancellation charges as these can vary depending on the cancellation costs of our suppliers. If you do decide to cancel your holiday, you will be able to see a full breakdown of costs to cancel your holiday on screen before
you confirm the cancellation.

It is easy to make payments towards your On the Beach holiday. All you have to do is log on via the "My Bookings" section on our website and click on “Make a Payment”. From here you can enter the amount you wish to pay off. You can do this any time
between the time of booking and the date your full balance is due.

You can check the total cost of your holiday, a total of payments made on your booking and the date your full balance is due by logging in to the “My Bookings” section of our website.

How will I know when a payment will be taken?

Your payment dates will vary depending on how far in advance you have booked your holiday, however, you will have agreed the dates of your payments when confirming your booking.

To see your instalments and total payments made to date, simply log into the “My Bookings” section of our website. You can also make additional or overdue payments in your account.

You will be alerted via email once a payment has been collected. Payments will be taken automatically from the payment card you supplied at the time of booking, unless you have specified that it be taken from another card. Payments will not
be collected if you have paid in advance of your payment due date.

For any further questions relating to this email, please contact us via “My Messages” in your 'My Bookings' account or call us on 0371 474 3000 quoting your MYB Reference Number.

How do I check all the payments I have made on my holiday?

You can see the total amount you have paid of your holiday and the remaining balance on the “My Bookings” section of our website, however, you can’t see a breakdown of all separate payments made. We can send you a receipt of this via email
which you can request by calling 0871 474 3000.





Before Travelling




Will I have to submit Advanced Passenger Information when travelling to Europe?

You will need to submit your Advance Passenger Information before travelling if your airline requires online check in. For ticketless airlines this information will be taken from you at the airport on the day of your departure.

All the other information you need when travelling within Europe will be contained in your booking documents. You don’t need an e-visa or any additional information when travelling within Europe.

What destinations require me to buy a visa?

If you are travelling to an EC (European Community) country and have a valid UK Passport you will not require a visa. For all non-UK passport holders, you will need to contact the embassy of the country you are travelling to. These details can also
be found on the
FCO website
.

If you are travelling to Turkey, you will be required to purchase their entry visa via the
Turkish Government website
prior to travel. Further visa and passport information can be found on on the
FCO website
.

If you are travelling to Egypt or the USA, UK passport holders normally require a visa. Further visa and passport information can be found on the
FCO website
.

What can I take in my hand luggage?

For full information about luggage restrictions for UK airports,
visit gov.uk.

There are certain restrictions in place for taking liquids in hand luggage. Wherever possible, it is best to pack liquids in hold luggage, however, you can take liquids when in containers of 100ml or less. All electronic devices larger than mobile phones should be carried in hold luggage when travelling from Turkey, Egypt, Morocco or Tunisia.





Flights




My flight has changed… what do I do?

As airlines plan their flight schedules many months in advance, sometimes they have to make changes to their previously planned schedules.

If your flight times have changed, we will let you know by emailing you or sending you a message via “My Messages” on the "My Bookings" section of our website.

If your airline has directly contacted you about a change to your flight, we can help you with changes with your transfers and accommodation. All you have to do is contact us via 'My Messages' on the "My Bookings" section of our website.

When will I receive my flight tickets?

During my holiday




What do I do if I have a problem on holiday?

If you need assistance when on holiday, you can call our 24/7 in-resort support line. You can find the details for this on your booking confirmation email. If you have any issues you cannot resolve directly with the hotel, you will need to make us
aware as soon as possible or we will not be able to look into them after your holiday.

Between the hours of 7pm to 8am (UK time) the line is dedicated to emergencies. If the issue is not urgent, please call after 8am. During this time, you will be asked to leave a message with your MYB reference number and we will call you back as soon
as possible.





Complaints




How do I make a complaint?

During your holiday

We always wish for our customers to have a wonderful, relaxing time on their holiday. However, if you encounter an issue and would like to complain we recommend that you immediately inform a representative of the travel supplier, airline or hotel
reception staff,
whilst you are abroad.

If they are unable to resolve your issue to your satisfaction you must then contact our in-resort support team, using the details found on your booking confirmation. If you don’t follow this procedure there will be less opportunity to investigate
and rectify your complaint at a later date.

travel supplier, airline or hotel on your behalf to try and resolve your complaint.

When making a complaint, make sure to do so in writing - as per ABTA guidelines – including your MYB order reference number and any attachments you may have. Your complaint must be sent to
customercare@onthebeach.co.uk.

I have had no reply to my query - what do I do?

On the Beach Limited
















On the Beach act as an agent providing a web search interface between you and various third party suppliers of travel products (e.g. flight, hotel or transfer). For flights we act as your agent in processing your booking with the airline; we are not the airline’s agent. Each product you choose has its own price independent of other products booked at the same time and creates a separate contract between you and the supplier of that product.
