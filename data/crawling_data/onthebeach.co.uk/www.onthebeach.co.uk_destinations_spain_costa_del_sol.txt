Costa Del Sol Weather

Protected by hills and mountains, the Costa del Sol is shielded from any wind and rain other parts of Spain may experience, giving it a mild and sunny micro climate. Temperatures reach their peak typically around the summer months of July and August, often pushing past 30° Celsius.
However, it is during the out of season months of March all the way to October during which time the Costa del Sol comes into its own. Temperatures often remain in the late twenties, meaning you can top up your tan before the summer crowds arrive! And what's more, these months are often the best times to find cheap, last minute deals, as most holiday makers are still in work and school.

Things To Do on Costa Del Sol Holidays

The Costa del Sol is packed with things for the whole family to do. For many, the best and most authentic way to see the area is during a festival or carnival, such as the Fiesta de Los Reyes celebrated on the 5th January or the annual pre-Lent carnival. Such events show the locals at their finest, and often provide greatest insight into real Andalusian culture.
There are many museums and religious sites scattered throughout the province, and the visit to the birth place of famous Spanish painter Pablo Picasso always proves popular. The Costa del Sol is also perfect for the sportsman, having been labelled the winter golfer's haven with courses such as Valderrama, and its seaside location lending its hand perfectly to water sports and diving.

Culture

The Costa del Sol had benefited hugely from its beautifully mild climate, from the tourism it enjoys today right back to its primary settlements. The Phoenicians were the first to realise the potential in the Costa del Sol, and it was under their rule the city of
Malaga
was established. The area fell eventually and inevitably to Roman rule along with the rest of Spain. It was under their domination that this southern stretch of Spain enjoyed its first major spell of development - baths, roads and government buildings were all introduced and built by the Romans and many ruins are still visible today.
In the 5th century, Christianity became much more widespread across the region, and even managed to live alongside the Moorish rule which capitalised on the areas coastal location by using it as a trade centre. However, conversion to Christianity increased and it wasn't long before Arab rule had disintegrated completely. More recently, the Costa del Sol benefited tremendously along with the rest of Europe from the development of tourism in the 1950s, during which time celebrities such as Marlon Brando and Grace Kelly were known to frequent the area.
