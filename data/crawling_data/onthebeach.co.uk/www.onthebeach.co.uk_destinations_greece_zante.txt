Read more about Zante



Zakynthos, or Zante as it is commonly known by tourists is the third largest Greek Island and just over three hours flight from the UK. In other words, you can be on the beach and topping up your tan under the Mediterranean sun in no time! Zante is very popular with families seeking summer and winter sun. It is also popular with couples and groups which are attracted by the lively nightlife in the resort of Laganas.
The landscape in Zante is about as perfect as it gets, straight off a postcard. Sandy beaches with clear blue waters grace the east and south coats. The architecture, for the most part (and especially in Laganas) is in keeping with the rich heritage of Zante with sandstone buildings and old fashioned tavernas galore.
In general, the landscape is rocky and mountainous with plenty of trees and olive groves making for some truly picturesque scenery. Alongside it's stunning landscape Zante has what every girl is looking for, plenty of beaches! Agios Nicolaos is popular with tourists and is found just to the north of Vassilikos. Alikes, just 18 kilometres northwest of Zakynthos town, is ideal for water sports while Bouka, just north of Zakynthos, is largely un-spoilt and much quieter than the rest.
There's always the chance to party in Zante. Laganas is the most popular resort and is perfect for a great night out. Bad Boys is the most popular Hip Hop club on the island and offers panoramic views of the beach while La Bamba is the place to head to if you're up for a spot of karaoke. La Bamba is also a great place to take the kids and is well known for being family friendly.
If you're missing the UK then head to Mad Murphy's, a popular Irish bar with pool table and video screens. Cherry Bay Beach Club is a must for Baywatch fans. The club has a Baywatch theme and the bar staff all wear wetsuits while the DJ spins on his decks in a speedboat.

Things To Do on Zante Holidays

There is plenty to keep you entertained while on holidays in Zante. If you're an adrenaline junkie there is the chance to learn to dive. With the help of a qualified instructor you'll get the opportunity to dive beneath the sea and observe octopus, mule seals and logger head turtles in their natural habitat.
If you prefer to take it a bit easier, why not try a boat excursion to Shipwreck Beach - a beach only accessible by boat and famed for it's crystal blue waters and golden sands.

Culture

Zante was first mentioned in literature by Greek poet Homer is his work Odyssey. Homes claimed the island was first inhabited in 1500BC by the Zakynthos, son of King Dardanos of Troy, giving the island it's name.
It is believed King Arkeisios of Kefalonia conquered the island before Ulysses from Ithaca. Following the invasions a treaty was signed making Zante an independent democracy. This treaty lasted 600 years. In 1953 four earthquakes shook the island, leaving only three buildings standing on the whole island!
Zante has a rich Christian culture. It is believed Mary Magdalene visited the island in 34AD. Before the earthquakes of 1953 there were over 350 churches on the island. Despite the damage many of the churches were rebuilt and are still hugely popular with locals and tourists alike.
Zante enjoys several public holidays each year and all are celebrated in style. New Years Day coincides with the festival of Saint Basil. On this day cakes are sliced up and handed out and the person who finds the hidden cake is named the lucky person for the year. The 1st of May is Labour Day and citizens take to the streets to protest and party! Later, the 21st of May marks the Union of the Ionian Islands to Greece and the whole island is awash with colourful parades.
