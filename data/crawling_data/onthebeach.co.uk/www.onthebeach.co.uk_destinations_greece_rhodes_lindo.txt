Read more about Lindos



It's no wonder Rhodes attracts more visitors than any other Greek Island considering the wonderful locales it has to offer, and Lindos is no exception. Located on the east coast of the island around 45 kilometres from Rhodes Town, Lindos is a sunny and charming place that is home to many of Rhodes' most important ancient sights, which in turn ensures it is extremely popular.
Aside from its bay, which curves around in a horseshoe shape, visitors will be impressed by the photogenic nature of the town, which sits at the feet of the famous acropolis. You'll find clusters of antiquated homes perched on hills among scatters of various ruins in the town, which constantly draw visitors to stop and look. The nightlife is less busy than its east coast neighbour Faliraki, which might please families, but it has a character and history to rival anywhere, which is why it is classed as a UNESCO World Heritage Sight. With shady rooftop bars, a thriving beach and lots to see, Lindos is a great place for a holiday in the sun!

Lindos Weather

Visitors to Lindos are guaranteed to go home with a tan as the town receives plenty of sunshine all year round, with virtually no rainfall and little winds, so heat waves can be very hot indeed. Temperatures average about 30° Celsius from June to September, which are the most popular months to visit for many tourists. The evenings too are warm and pleasant, ideal for outdoor eating and strolls along the promenade.
The temperature in Lindos does though begin to get relatively warm around April, when it reaches around 18° Celsius. Around this time the town will be balmy and a lot cooler, which is good news if you're not planning to head out in the summer months, because you're still assured of good weather. It's also great if you're not too much of a sun lover, as the town is quite hilly to walk (especially up to the acropolis), so the cooler temperature will definitely help out!

Landscape

With such an amazing landscape, it's easy to see why tourists flock back in their thousands every year on holiday to Lindos. Because the town is pedestrianised you'll be able to stop and enjoy views constantly. When coming in to Lindos, the view of the ancient acropolis looming over the town below is an imposing sight that will stay with you forever. While the town itself is hilly and some may be tired at having to walk around all day, it does provide plenty of exercise, and the lack of cars will be a great bonus for those with children.
The winding streets are narrow and charming, with grape vines covering antiquated buildings to shield people from the sun. Traversing the town is a magnificent experience, with the sight of ruins alongside contemporary buildings forming a truly astonishing landscape. Outside of town the earth is rocky and parched, and even more difficult to walk. If you'd like to head outside of town it may be best to go in the evening when its cooler, and from where you'll be able to watch the sun set over the acropolis with a vast blue sea in the background - ideal for couples.



Things To Do on Lindos Holidays

As a World Heritage Sight, Lindos contains many spectacular archaeological ruins and beautiful views. However, the most popular attraction in the town is undoubtedly the acropolis, which is 300 steps high but fortunately you can get a donkey ride to the top though - well worth it if you have children. As you come up you'll view the ruins of medieval walls, while the acropolis itself features the Doric Temple of Athena Lindia and the Propylaea of the Sanctuary, which date back to around 300 BC and 4th Century BC respectively. Aside from the astounding sight of these ancient ruins, you'll be rewarded for walking up to the acropolis with views over the amazing blue sea.
The only way to get around town is walking as there are no cars in Lindos, but if your feet have had enough, the best place to relax will be Saint Pallas beach, which is a beautifully peaceful manmade beach that receives fewer tourists than the main beach. This beach is an infinitely more relaxed hidden treasure, with sun lounges for hire. As you lay back you'll be able to view the imposing St Pauls Chapel, where many weddings are traditionally held, which will provide a lovely glimpse into local culture.

Culture

With around 3000 years of history, Lindos is actually older than even the main city on Rhodes,
Rhodes Town
. While it'd be impossible to discuss all of it, this World Heritage Sight does possess a wonderful history, having been founded in 10th Century BC by King Tlepolemus. By the 8th Century the Dorian Hexapolis area enjoyed a reputation as a well-known trading centre, though the founding of Rhodes Town in 5th Century meant that it lost some of its importance. It still however continued to construct astonishing buildings, including the Greek Orthodox Church of Saint John, which was built in the 13th Century.
Though Lindos gives the impression of being a quiet and lazy village, its cultural offerings say quite the opposite. If you've seen enough of the various market stalls and bars, try visiting the Amphitheatre Nightclub, which is open until 6am. It's a hugely popular club with both visitors and locals alike, and it operates a traditional practice whereby guests watch the sun rise at 8am.
If you're visiting Lindos in June be sure to ask locals for details of the annual 'Rhodes Rocks! Festival', where acclaimed tribute acts of Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin will perform all the hits of these legendary bands - a must for rock music lovers!

Nightlife

Discos and hotels are more often located on the outskirts of Lindos, so if you're looking for centralised bars and entertainment it may be best to ask your hotel in Lindos to provide a taxi to the centre, where you'll find a range of great bars and a lively ambience.
One of Lindos' most charming characteristics is its presence of rooftop and terrace bars, which are a quiet and relaxed way to spend your evening. Try the Captain's House, which you'll find by walking past the Museum Bar and following the signs to the acropolis; it will be busy, but it is still a place where you can sit and people-watch in peace. Drinks and meals are usually always fairly reasonable too, with fabulous fish dishes a local speciality.
