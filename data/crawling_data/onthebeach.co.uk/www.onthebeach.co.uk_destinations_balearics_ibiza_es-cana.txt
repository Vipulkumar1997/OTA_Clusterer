Read more about Es Cana



Es Cana is a quiet, rustic town on the south shore of the island of Ibiza and boasts sandy white shores, and a beautiful view of the Mediterranean Sea. Part of the Balearic Island archipelago, Ibiza derives her name from an ancient word meaning 'island of pines'. Ibiza holidays are ideal for families looking for sun and fun, as well as for solo travellers and couples looking for all night clubbing!
Typical island life includes waking at noon, enjoying a traditional English breakfast at one of the many fine restaurants, shopping at the local shops and booths in the afternoon, and then dancing the night away; only to retire after viewing the gorgeous sunset which has inspired artists throughout the years.
The shores of Es Cana are kissed by the blue waters of the Mediterranean Sea. Peppered with fishing boats along the coast, the town still retains a rustic charm. Unlike nearby Cala Llonga, Es Cana maintains a strong Spanish atmosphere with a decidedly undiscovered feeling. Ideal for a quiet break away with your family, Es Cana is as peaceful and serene a location as you will ever find.
One of the smallest towns in Ibiza, Es Cana is home to the famous hippy market in the Club Arabi resort. Your holidays wouldn't be complete without a visit to the hippy market, held every Wednesday between May and October, which will transport you back to the 60's. Once home to the largest colony of hippies, the Es Cana hippy market is still overflowing with tourists from around the world who come to purchase the exquisite clothing, jewellery and trinkets.
The nightlife in Es Cana is relatively quiet when compared to the raucous club scene in San Antonio or Ibiza Town. Home to one of the largest selections of modern nightclubs in the world, Ibiza is popular among young people looking for a wild time. Just a short drive from Es Cana, you will find popular nightclubs whose doors open at dusk and stay open until dawn.
