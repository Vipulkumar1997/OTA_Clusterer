Santa Ponsa Weather

You can expect July and August to be busy with tourists on holidays in Santa Ponsa and enjoying the beach life. As you would expect with the
Balearics
in the summer, temperatures are usually around 30° Celsius making this the best time of year to build up a great tan.
Those that prefer it a lot cooler should head on holidays to Santa Ponsa in the early and later months when you get the added benefit of it being a lot quieter. Fortunately the weather stays mostly fair and sunny with occasional cloudy days.

Landscape

Head out onto the open seas on a boat trip and take in the stunning coastline or jump off the boat and take a dip in the warm Mediterranean. The main beach stretches out across the bay and is very popular with children, sun-worshipers and those wanting to have a go at windsurfing. Swimming in the bay is quite safe due to it not having very strong currents and the water is fairly shallow, being perfect for younger children.
Here's a handy tip - if you want to get away from the crowds head to the next bay round to find the smaller and less crowded beach located there.



Things To Do on Santa Ponsa Holidays

Western Park in Magalluf is ideal for anyone on holiday looking for fun, as it is a combination of both a water park and a wild west theme park. If you are after something a bit more exciting then head to Aqualand where there are a number of terrifying slides and flumes. Why not dry off by racing around the track near the Aqua Park in Magalluf. All these are suitable for children of all age ranges but are often closed in winter months, so make sure you check before you go. Golf lovers will be amazed at the amount of golf courses in the area, especially Santa Ponsa II which is known as being the most difficult courses in the Balearic Islands.
Being so near to
Palma Nova
, and Palma, means that you are able to experience everything that these resorts have to offer. For the shoppers there are plenty of designer and handcraft shops on offer and markets where you can pick up a brilliant range of
discount
crafts, leather goods and more.

Culture

Holidays to Santa Ponsa have changed dramatically over the past 40 years - it's hard to imagine that there was only 1 hotel about 40 years ago. Furthur into the past, King Jaime conquered the island and where he entered it has been remembered by the cross at the entrance of the marina.
You will find that Majorca has plenty of history to offer if you explore the island and see what is on offer. For a glimpse of the traditional Majorcan island life, head inland to some of the smaller unspoiled villages and soak up the chilled out atmosphere!
Rey en Jaume Fiesta (one of the biggest Fiestas in Mallorca) takes place in
Santa Ponsa
during the week leading up to the second Sunday in September. If you are lucky enough to be here when the festival is on you'll get to see some amazing colorful parades. There are also a number of street markets, such as the weekly market in nearby Andratx every Wednesday morning where you can pick up all sorts of traditional crafts.

Nightlife

There is a good selection of bars and late night venues on offer at this resort, particularly Irish bars which feature live music on a nightly basis. Those wanting a late night out will enjoy the discos on offer but if you dont plan on crawling in till dawn, Magalluf is definitely the place to head out to. Why not try a number of local or international dishes at one of the many sea view restaurants then get a taxi into Magalluf and dance the night away!



Book a Santa Ponsa Holiday now!

Santa Ponsa has changed a lot over the years and has now become a firm favourite with holiday makers, particularly young couples and young families. It is perfect if you want a relaxing holiday but also accommodates those wanting a more lively break.
