Read more about Magaluf



If you are looking for a lively atmosphere and plenty of nightlife then you will find that Magaluf holidays are right up your street! This famous resort has it all - beautiful beaches, incredible clubs and enough bars and restaurants to keep you entertained for your whole holiday. Expect a lot of families and 18-30's in the summer months, but it is possible to enjoy a more peaceful Magaluf holiday off season.
The resort is only 10 miles away from Palma so if you want to explore past the resort, the capital also has a lot to offer. Magaluf has it all; sun, sand and sea combine for Majorca holidays that cannot be forgotten!
Known as a never ending happy hour, Magaluf has a large amount of bars to keep you out until the early hours of the morning. There are many British pubs, cafes, cocktail bars, nightclubs and discos so you have plenty to chose from. And it doesn't matter what or when you want to eat - there are plenty of restaurants offering local and international cuisine. Other than Magaluf, there is great nightlife in Santa Ponsa and also El Arenal. Magaluf is also adjoined to Palma Nova which is perfect for a more laid back atmosphere.

Magaluf Weather

As expected in Majorca, the summer months are the best but are also the busiest. The temperatures usually reach their zenith above 30° Celsius, whereas temperatures in the autumn and winter months are typically half that. Bring suitable clothing in the winter, just in case there is some unexpected rainfall or a cloudy day. If you are going on holidays to Magalluf in July or August make sure you pack plenty of sun scream!

Landscape

There are a number of gorgeous sandy beaches to visit on holidays to Magaluf, each with plenty of sunbeds, umbrellas and a range of watersports to enjoy. If you want to head out on a glass bottom boat then you will have a great view of the stunning scenery. Those wanting to stay on dry land will love the amount of shops, bars and restaurants which are situated on the promenades, so why not have a drink and look out onto the fantastic beaches. Or take in the landscape by taking a swim to Black Lizard Island, named after the lizards who live there.



Things To Do on Magaluf Holidays


Families
with children and will love the many attractions on holidays in Magaluf, especially those young daredevils looking for thrills. Aqualand Magaluf is a giant waterpark on the edge of the resort with a number of exciting flumes and slides for older children and some tamer rides for the young ones. There is also a Lollipops childrens party venue in the centre and a kart track situated on the outskirts of Magaluf.
For the dads on Magaluf holidays, there is Golf Fantasia which is in nearby
Palma Nova
. A great mini golf course surrounded by waterfalls, caves and tropical gardens, which makes this perfect for all the family. Shoppers will want to head into
Palma
which is about 20 minutes away as there are plenty of shops and also a tourbus which takes you around the resort.

Culture

It was not until civil war in
Spain
before Majorca was claimed for Spain. The island was taken over by most of the nations surrounding the area and because of this saw several different language changes. For most of the island's history, Catalan has thrived except for the brief period when it was banned. The Catalan language persevered however and is the island's official language, along with Spanish.
The nearest weekly market is held in Andratx every Wednesday morning. If you want more designer shops and more range, you would be best off heading to Palma on the bus to explore what they have to offer.



Book a Magaluf Holiday now!

Magaluf holidays are perfect for young families or the 18-30's. Couples a little older will also enjoy holidays to Magaluf when it is a little quieter in the off peak months and with the weather staying fairly bright all year round.
