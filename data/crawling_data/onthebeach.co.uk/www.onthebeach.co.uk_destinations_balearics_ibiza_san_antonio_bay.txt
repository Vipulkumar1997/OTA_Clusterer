Read more about San Antonio Bay



Just south of San Antonio lies the sleepy hollow of San Antonio Bay. A welcome respite for party goers who need a quiet place to recuperate, San Antonio Bay holidays offer quiet relief from the wild atmosphere of nearby Sant Antonio. The beaches surrounding San Antonio Bay are popular among tourists on Ibiza holidays with their families, and are often filled with tourists throughout the entire summer.
Balearics holidays in general, and holidays to San Antonio Bay in particular, are all about letting your hair down for a week or two and enjoying life. Home to the island's maritime museum, San Antonio Bay caters to tourists from around the world with some of the finest hotels in Ibiza, and gourmet dining to suit every taste!
Though quieter than its neighbour, San Antonio, San Antonio Bay holidays have no shortage of clubs and bars to keep you entertained at night. Dance the night away at one of the many clubs, or enjoy a quiet drink at a seaside bar while the sun sets over the distant horizon. Either way, you'll not want to miss the opportunity to see the rising sun, which has provided inspiration to artists throughout the ages.
