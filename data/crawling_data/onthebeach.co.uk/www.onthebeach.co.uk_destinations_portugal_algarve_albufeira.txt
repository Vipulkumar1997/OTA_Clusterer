The nightlife in Albufeira is mostly geared towards a younger crowd. The Strip, situated near the Montechoro area, being especially popular. Linekers, Cafe Del Mar and La Bamba are among the most popular bars in the town, while Kiss is the number one nightclub. However, if bars and clubs are not your thing, there are also plenty of restaurants where you can share a romantic meal before taking a stroll along one of the many lovely beaches.

Fishing is a huge economy in the city of Albufeira; during the 19th Century the export of fish was the main income. Eating out is a big part of the Albufeiro culture, especially eating out at seafood restaurants. Popular local dishes include the Algarvean Cataplana and the delicious horse mackerel alimados.
Another local tradition is the monthly fare. Traders gather from all over the city in different allocated areas and offer everything from foods to crafts to clothes. The fares are also popular with tourist, mainly because of the friendly atmospheres. These are great places to pick up some reminders of your holidays in Albufeira.

Landscape

Albufeira has five main beaches: Praia da Gale,
Praia da Oura
, Fisherman’s Beach, Beach of Bryn and Marina e Bryn Beach, so there are plenty of places to relax and catch a tan. Aside from the gorgeous white sand and clear water beaches the landscape is awash with colour from the stunning architecture in the city. The Marina e Bryn area is especially colourful with its pink, blue and yellow buildings, which have earned it the nickname "Legoland"!



Things To Do on Albufeira Holidays

There’s plenty to see in Albufeira, including some fascinating monuments. The Torre Sineira, the bell tower, was built in 1869 as part of the Parish Church Edifice and is one of the city’s most popular monuments. The Igreja Matrix temple is another popular attraction. Built in the 18th century, it replaced a church which had been demolished by an earthquake in 1755. The Chapel of Our Lady on the Wayside dates back to the 18th Century, although the original church was built in the 16th century. It is also the church where the blessing of the sea takes place during the festival of Nossa Senhora da Orada in August every year - a great time to visit if you're a bit of a culture vulture.
However, most most people choose holidays to Albufeira for one thing and one thing only; relaxing. The prime attraction in this area are the many sandy beaches. Don't forget that there is no shortage of good golf courses around Albufeira; nearby
Balaia
has an excellent course and training available. So if you want to brush up on your putting this is the place to be!



Book a Albufeira Holiday now!

Don’t waste your time waiting for the weather to improve at home, it'll never happen! But there’s still time to catch some sun if you book a holiday in Albufeira today. Visit
On the Beach
