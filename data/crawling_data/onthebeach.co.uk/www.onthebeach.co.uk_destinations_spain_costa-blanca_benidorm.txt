Holidaying in Benidorm increases in popularity year after year due to the great nightlife on offer, perfect for families, groups and couples looking for a fun filled holiday. Another significant boost to the Benidorm tourism industry was brought about by the popularity of the hit self-titled TV series 'Benidorm'.

Benidorm Weather

Holidays in Benidorm are all about having fun in the sun! From summer temperatures hovering near 40° Celsius to generous January averages of around 13° Celsius, permanently clear skies mean you should pack your sunblock whenever you're coming, and hit those golden beaches!

Landscape

Benidorm's blue-flag beaches are world-class seafronts, and their golden sands are surprisingly clean, too.
Levante
, Poniente and Pal Mas Beaches are straddled with coves to explore, and a ten-minute boat ride from Pal Mas leads out to the Peacock Island nature reserve. The beauty of Benidorm's mountainous skyline can be fully appreciated here, or for sunset views of the coast, venture out to the rocky promontory that juts out into the Med, separating the beaches.



Things To Do on Benidorm Holidays

There's more to see and do on Benidorm holidays than practically anywhere else on Spain's White Coast, whether going out to water parks and theme parks such as Aqualandia and Terra Mitica, or day trips around the subterranean caverns at Canelobre and the crystal-clear Algar waterfalls, where you can even take a dip! From jeep safaris to the Wax Museum, you won't know where to start for things to do.

Culture

Holidays to Benidorm don't have to be all about all-night partying though. From the Three Kings Festival in January to Yuletide nativity plays, it'll be remarkable if you don't come across a fiesta here! Come in October for the biggest one, the crazy 'Moors and Christians' Fiesta, with mock battles staged in front of a huge, makeshift castle.
For an equally fun-filled experience, don't miss out on a visit to one of Benidorm's many markets such as the town centre's Outdoor Market on Wednesdays and Sundays.
