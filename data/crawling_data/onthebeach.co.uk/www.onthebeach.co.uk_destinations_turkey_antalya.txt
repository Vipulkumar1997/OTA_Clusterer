Read more about Antalya



The stunning city of Antalya, located in a bay on Turkey’s southern coast is an incredibly popular holiday destination to thousands of tourists each year! One of Turkey’s main resorts in the Mediterranean region, the city is loved by many for its palm lined streets, charming marina, delicious restaurants, excellent shopping, cosmopolitan nightlife and lots of historical attractions. Ideally set against the backdrop of the Taurus Mountains that rise dramatically 3000 metres above the city.
Known as ‘The Turkish Riviera’, Antalya offers a beautiful all year round climate and is the hottest region in Turkey. The beaches in Antalya are famed for their turquoise waters and beautiful fine white sands. Antalya's coastline is a place of contrasting beaches and secluded coves, sparkling seas and ancient harbours. Antalya is also home to many ancient ruins that date as far back as the 2nd Century Roman times and houses one of Turkey's top antiques collections in the Archaeological Museum.
For families, younger couples and groups, beyond the archaeological wonders, the Antalya area also has a wealth of outdoor activities and is host to numerous sporting events throughout the year, including international beach volleyball, triathlons and canoeing competitions.
Antalya is often referred to as the Turkish Riviera due to its beautiful sandy beaches and turquoise waters, which are perfect for sunbathing and watersports, especially as many of Turkey’s beaches have been awarded with a Blue Flag award.
Alanya has a great choice of gorgeous golden sandy beaches. One of the more secluded of these beaches has been named after Cleopatra as the city was given to her as a present from Anthony.
On the way to Lara Beach you can enjoy the beautiful scenery of Lower Düden Waterfalls cascading into the sea while Konyaalti Beach shows off amazing views of the Taurus Mountains!
The hotels, restaurants and bars in Antalya provide an entertaining nightlife. You will find hotels offering floor shows with belly dancers and fantastic live music, and you will find people in Antalya town partying until the early hours each night.
The resort of Alanya has a lively nightlife and comes alive at night with seafront bars and late-night discos. The Club Arma is a popular venue, situated in a cliff overlooking the sparkling marina; this is a unique night out and one not to be missed! You will find a fantastic choice of bars and restaurants along Side’s Beach, including Lighthouse, Apollo and Oxyd which are open-air clubs.
If you prefer quieter and more relaxing evenings, you will enjoy strolling along the charming harbours and pretty streets of the smaller holiday resorts in Antalya or dine in the luscious waterfront restaurants.

Whether you want a relaxing beach holiday or an educational historical sightseeing tour, you will find so much to do in Antalya, you will find it hard to pack it all into one holiday!

Aspendos

Olympus and the Fires of Chimaera
is where you can witness an unexplainable fire that erupts from holes in the Chimaera Mountain. It has mystified scientists and locals for thousands of years, and you are able to visit the site and discover the myths from over the years about what has caused the fire.

Perge
is one of the most important Greek and Roman towns in the region, ideally located approximately 30 minutes from Antalya. The site has many ruins including a theatre, Hellenistic and Roman Gates and a street with columns.

Aspendos
is one of the most important Roman theaters on earth. If you are lucky, you may see a classical music concert performing live, as they still allow performances.
Antalya has a deep history and this is shown in its many
beautiful mosques.
The Kesik Minaret (Broken Minaret) Mosque demonstrates Antalya’s long history to the full to the full, the Yivli Minareli Mosque is a perfect example of 13th-century Seljuk stone carving and the 16th-century Murat Pasha Mosque is definitely worth investigating.

Couples

For a truly romantic experience, you should head 14 km north-east of Antalya and find the Upper Duden Waterfall, where you can enjoy walking behind a cascading waterfall. Once you have seen this breathtaking scene, you can watch the Lower Duden Waterfall drop into the sea from Lara Beach. Take a picnic and this will make an incredible day trip for you and your partner!

Shopping

Shopping in Antalya is fantastic! You will find many shops from designer stores, souvenir shops, traditional markets and many more!
The narrow cobbled streets of
Kaleici in the old quarter
is one of the most popular spots to go shopping, where you will find lots of fantastic boutiques, craft and souvenir shops and jewellers, all with long opening hours so you can while away the time, browsing the stores.
For a more traditional shopping experience, you will enjoy the many
markets, roadside stalls and bazaars
. You will be offered many bargains by the shopkeepers and stall holders, however never except their first price! They expect you to haggle, so be cheeky and you could get some local produce such as leather goods, carpets and jewellery at a great price!
For a fantastic souvenir idea, buy the blue glass beads on offer in most gift shops and market stalls as Antalya’s legend state that these beads protects you from the evil eye!
