Read more about Dominican Republic



The Domincan Republic has long been a holiday destination popular with couples and families. There is something about this tropical Caribbean holiday island that just says luxury isn't there? But did you know you can get all that luxury for a very reasonable price? At On the Beach, we have some fantastic deals to the Dominican Republic whatever your board basis, so you could be surfing off Macao Beach or paddling in the calm, shallow, warm waters of Arena Gorda before you know it! And what a holiday it is! With beautiful weather, gorgeous beaches and plenty to see and do you'll wonder why you've never been on holidays to the Dominican Republic before!
Landscape
Of course the main attraction with any Dominican Republic holiday is the beaches. The coast is lined with fabulous beaches such as Punta Cana and Sousa. Further inland, the Dominican Republic is home to the Caribbean's highest peak, Pico Duarte at 3,098m (or 10,000 ft) gives an indication of the varying landscape of this eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which the Dominican Republic shares with Haiti on the western side.
Nightlife
Nightlife in the Dominican Republic is nothing short of electric. CrazyMoon is a popular venue for hip hop fans while Plaza Mambo's and Carwash are the perfect place to go to learn salsa or the traditional, passionate Merengue and there are always plenty of locals willing to show you the moves. Dancing is hugely popular on the island and most clubs have an instructor who will give fun and often impromptu lessons to anyone who fancies learning.
The Dominican Republic is also home to many traditional cafes and bars where you can sample local delights and pass the evening away outdoors with a cold drink in the beautiful evening sunshine.

Dominican Republic Weather

The Dominican Republic's weather is always hot, temperatures rarely drop below 25° Celsius. You'll never need a warm jumper but on occasion you may well need a raincoat! When the rainy season occurs depends on where you are. In the northern parts the months between October and April are the wettest while in the south you'll need your brolly between May and November
Of course there is another thing to watch out for, hurricanes. Hurricanes are most frequent during the tail end of the summer months and can occur every couple of years.

Landscape

Of course the main attraction with any Dominican Republic holiday is the beaches. The coast is lined with fabulous beach after fabulous beach, but the landscape is more than just beaches. With palm trees fringing most of the island and streams and hills adding to its beauty, the Dominican Republic landscape is considered one of the most beautiful in the Caribbean.



Things To Do on Dominican Republic Holidays

Having lots of activities to choose from is one of the most important aspect of choosing where to go on your next
holiday
. One of the main attractions with Dominican Republic holidays is the golf courses, many of which have
all inclusive
accommodation near by. There are more than 20 courses to choose from, all of them surrounded by picturesque scenery. If you're feeling energetic then why not try some kiteboarding or windsurfing, there's a first time for everything!
If you're in a more cultured mood, visit Altos de Chavon. This is a re-created 16th Century village overlooking the Chavon river and is home to the Regional Museum of Archaeology. Dominican Republic holidays offer more than just sun, sea and sand!

Culture

The Dominican Republic has a rich history and nowhere is this more evident than in the capital city of Santo Domingo where you'll witness many buildings from the time it was under Spanish rule in the 16th Century. The Alcazar de Colon palace attracts hundreds of visitors. It was build by Christopher Columbus in 1510 and is hugely popular with tourists while the National Pantheon, a 18th Century monastery and burial grounds for Spanish heroes is both a poignant and a beautiful sight.
A Dominican Republic holiday wouldn't be complete without a visit to the village of Jarabacoa. The picturesque village is a sign of how life in the Dominican Republic once was.
Finally for a real lesson in Dominican Republic history visit the Museum of History and Geography and the Museum of the Dominican Man both of which provide a detailed view of the traditional Dominican way of life.
Like most of the Caribbean islands the people of the Dominican Republic love a festival, which is a good thing because there are plenty of them! During June the Puerto Plata Cultural Festival takes place. The festival celebrates all aspects of Dominican Republic culture with exhibitions, parades, dancing and food. The whole island comes together to celebrate so it's a great time to visit.

Nightlife

The nightlife in the Dominican Republic is nothing short of electric. CrazyMoon is a popular venue for hip hop fans while Plaza Mambo's and Carwash are the perfect place to go to learn salsa or the Merengue and there are always plenty of locals willing to show you the moves. Dancing is hugely popular on the island and most clubs have an instructor who will give fun and often impromptu lessons to anyone who fancies learning.
The Dominican Republic is also home to many traditional cafes and bars where you can sample local delights and pass the evening away outdoors with a cold drink in the beautiful evening sunshine. One thing is for sure, with a holiday in the Dominican Republic you'll come home refreshed!
