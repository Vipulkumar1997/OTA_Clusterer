Read more about Santorini



The Greek Island of Santorini was created by an enormous volcanic eruption hundreds of thousands of year ago in 1450 BC, when the middle of the island fell into the sea, which left behind a steep crater known as a caldera. This crater now forms what we today know as Santorini, a popular holiday destination for couples and single travellers. The rim of the crater now forms stunning views over the deep blue Aegean Sea with whitewashed buildings and the iconic blue domes spread along the cliff tops. On the other side of Santorini the island slopes gently into the sea forming some of the best beaches on the island. Made up from red and black volcanic pebbles and sand, Perissa and Kamari beach are two of the most popular beaches amongst holidaymakers on the island.
There are dozens of great hotels in Santorini available here at On the Beach, with something to suit every price range, use our search gadget above to find your perfect holiday in breath-taking Santorini.

Santorini Weather

If the rain and cloud in the UK just don't do it for you, a holiday to Santorini is just what you need. Santorini's climate is nothing short of perfect. Summers are hot and dry and winters are mild. So if you're tired of bringing your scarf and gloves to work the Santorini climate may be just what you're looking for.
You can expect temperatures ranging from 20 - 30° Celsius and beyond from April through to late September, making this an ideal summer holiday spot. If you want to catch a last minute deal and avoid the crowds, early autumn is for you. Temperatures are still high, but the beaches are much less busy and the place has a really relaxed vibe.

Things To Do on Santorini Holidays

There is plenty to offer people on Santorini holidays and a lot of it is just down to a little help from mother nature. Santorini's main attraction is the volcano, which dominates the island. It's capital Fira along with the towns of Oia and Thirasis lie on the cliffs facing the caldera. There are plenty of tours of the volcano on offer and if you're into stunning landscapes then they're not to be missed.
Thirassis is a tiny island off the coast of Santorini and is perfect for people wanting to escape the whirlwind of every day life and chill out for a while. There are boat excursions on offer to both Thirassis and to the hot springs on Volcano Island.
But let's not forget what you're really looking for when you book a holiday to a Greek Island, and that's the beaches! Luckily, there are plenty to choose from in Santorini. The most popular are Perissa, Kamari, Monolithos and the Red Beach.
Perisa, a stunning black sand beach, is located just 15km southeast of Fira. Kamari is just 10km southeast of Fira and features a huge rock called Mesa Vouno which is lit up at night. Monolithos can by found next to Kamari and is a quieter beach for people wanting to escape the tourists. The most famous beach though is the Red Beach. Located near the ancient town of Alkatiri, the Red Beach is regarded by many as the most beautiful beach in Santorini.

Culture

Millennia before the first flights to Santorini touched down, this island was changing hands from one civilisation to another. It was first inhabited at around 3200BC when the Cretes settled here. Originally called Strogglli, the islands name was changed after 1500BC when the Volcano that stood at the centre of the island erupted.
A large part of the island was sunk and the Minoan palace of Knossos was destroyed. There are still plenty of historic sites to visit though. The Ancient city of Thira is one of them and has, at one point or another, been inhabited by Phoenicians, Doriens and Byzantines. The city is home to public baths, Archaic tombs and Agoras - ancient market places.
Santorini is home to several major archaeological sites. The Alkatiri is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Santorini. An ancient Minoan town, it was covered in a blanket of thick volcanic ash following the eruption that has meant the town has been perfectly preserved.

Nightlife

Of course after a long day of sun bathing you'll want to let your hair down with a cocktail or few! Fortunately there are enough clubs and bars in Fira to keep you entertained for the whole of your holiday. Franco and Tropical in Fira are favourites with tourists while Selene is the must-visit restaurant on the island.
If it's not a big night you're after then head to Oia. The ideal location for a romantic night out, Oia is well known as the most beautiful area on the island. There are plenty of restaurants and quiet bars as well as the most amazing sunset you're ever likely to see. Ambrosia and Nector is one of the most popular restaurants in the town and offers stunning views of the sea.
