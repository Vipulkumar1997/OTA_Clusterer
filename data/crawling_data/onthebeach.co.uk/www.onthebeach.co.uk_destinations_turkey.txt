Turkey Weather

Split into seven different regions,
Marmara, Blacksea Coast, Eastern Anatolian, Southeastern Anatolia, Central Anatolia, Mediterranean and Aegean.
Turkey’s climate is as diverse as its culture! Each region has a different climate depending on its location from the mountain ranges, seas and oceans.

Marmara, Aegean
and the
Mediterranean coasts
boast Mediterranean climates with long, hot and inviting summers and mild, wet winters. This is why resorts such as
Antayla
,
Alanya
,
Belek
,
Bodrum
and
Gumbet
are the more popular sunshine resorts with tourists.
The east of Turkey is mountainous and has a more European climate, with warm summers and cold, snowy winters.
Central Turkey has incredibly hot summers and all year round low rainfall with freezing cold winters. For example the mountainous regions of Malatya see temperatures change from 38ËšC in the summer to dramatically low temperatures of around minus 43ËšC.
For holidays in Turkey, be sure to double check the weather in the resort you’re heading to before you go, so that you pack the most suitable attire for your eastern jaunt!

Landscape

From isolated pockets to overpopulated cities, nature reserves to red clay river banks, volcanic sites to stretches of sand, Turkey’s landscape can’t be pigeonholed and will often differ from town to town. Make sure you always pack a pair of comfy shoes so you can explore your surroundings thoroughly to get the most out of your Turkey holiday!



Things To Do on Turkey Holidays

Whether you want a relaxing beach break, a good old shop in the spice markets and bustling bazaars, or a history fest, Turkey holidays attract tourists and sun-seekers from every walk of life.
Along the Aegean coastline, you can while away the days sunbathing on feather-soft sands or for something a tad more energetic, take a boat trip to one of the neighbouring Greek islands. With Kos just a short ride away, if you want to mix and match your destinations, this is the perfect way to indulge.
Most coastal resorts in Turkey offer boat trips and catamaran cruises so you can explore this Middle Eastern maze from the water, and as an added bonus, it means you get the opportunity to absorb the Turkish coastline’s natural good looks from afar. At
Kekova
, there’s even a trip that takes you to see a sunken Roman town that’s settled on the sea-bed – a winner with both history buffs and water babies.
If you are a fan of ancient discoveries, you won’t want to miss out on the
Lycian tombs at Myra
, the
ruined city of Ephesus
, and the crusader’s favourite,
St Peter’s Castle
, which divides Bodrum’s two bays.
Alternatively, if you’re more interested in pampering than times gone past, make sure you experience a
traditional Turkish bath
. Full of bubbles, suds and steam, you’ll leave feeling squeaky clean, super polished and ready to hit the town. Unleash your lively side at Side with its unbeatable bars and clubs, head to
Antalya
and experience the Mediterranean’s largest floating nightclub, or keep it traditional with some
belly-dancing in Bodrum
.

Culture

Mainly Muslim territory, Turkey is open to a variety of different religions owing to its cultural combinations, although if you do want to visit a traditional Turkish mosque it’s always best to wear modest attire and remove your shoes – women are also expected to cover their hair. Turkish will be spoken at most mosques but the majority of locals can speak English and German too.
As a result of Turkey’s close proximity to Greece, the food here is on a par with any of the meals you might experience on a Greek holiday. Mezes of stuffed peppers, vine leaves, kebabs, olives and feta cheese all play their part on the menu, alongside a smattering of aubergine dishes – the Turkish national vegetable. Those with a sweet tooth should look out for the different varieties of Baklava on offer, or if you prefer to end your meal with a strong drink, make sure you sample the local Turkish coffee or the alcoholic aniseed-flavoured Raki. You might want to pack some stretchy pants for your
holiday in Turkey
!

Nightlife

Unleash your lively side at Side with its unbeatable bars and clubs, head to
Antalya
and experience the Mediterranean's largest floating nightclub, or keep it traditional with some
belly-dancing in Bodrum
