Food & Drink

POOL BAR
The Pool Bar’s got ice cold beers, the BEST frozen daiquiris, cocktails and a diner menu of classic American and British dishes. You’ll find it by the Main Pool and you won’t need to lift a flip-flop to order – as they’ll come to you with table service. Open Daily.

TACOS AND TEQUILA CANTINA
Whether you’re on the hunt for a big fill or the hair of the dog, this is the perfect place to come – authentic Mexican cuisine, cocktails, tequila, beers and spirits. Find it by the Chill Out Pool and get yourself back in the game. Open Daily.

ZIGGY’S
Probably the first restaurant you’ll see because it’s right at the front of the Ibiza Rocks Hotel, is our Bowie-inspired pizzeria. Open from 1pm to 1am, it serves up out of this world pizza slices and cocktails.

You can eat in, take away or, as a guest of the hotel, Ziggy’s delivers to your room or will even bring a slice to your spot by the pool!

LOBBY BAR
If you’re looking for something a bit more wholesome then head to the reception area where the team at the Lobby Bar can ply you with smoothies, juices, coffees and snacks. You’ll feel the goodness coursing through your veins as you prepare for another legendary night. Open Daily.

Sports & Entertainment

The complex has two outdoor swimming pools, a Jacuzzi, three bars and two restaurants. There is also an Official Ibiza Rocks Merchandise Shop and a supermarket within the grounds of the hotel. The main pool will play host to some of the biggest events of the summer whilst the chill-out pool offers a more relaxed, tropical vibe to make sure that you are truly rested and recovered for the upcoming night.
