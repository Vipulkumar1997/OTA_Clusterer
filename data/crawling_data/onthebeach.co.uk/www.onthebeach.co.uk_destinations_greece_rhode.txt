Rhodes Weather

Those that enjoy the sunshine will not be disappointed as the island has high temperatures all through the year, particularly in the summer months. For those wanting a great tan, the best months to visit would be July and August as temperatures regularly reach the high 20's and beyond. You definitely will not need to bring jackets in these months as it definitely will be swim wear season.

Things To Do on Rhodes Holidays

The island has a great history represented in the museums situated in Rhodes town and the Old Town has been declared a World Heritage site. There are many historical sites on the island including the Temple of Apollo, the site where the Collossus of Rhodes once stood and the Palace of Grand Masters. Any of these sites make wonderful photos to look back on once your holiday to Rhodes is over.
If history is not your thing, Rhodes town is the best place to head if you fancy spending some money in the shops where local produce and the latest fashions are available to keep shopping lovers in their element! For those that want a more livily atmosphere, a visit to the popular resort of
Faliraki
is a must!

Culture

Rhodes has an interesting tapestry of history, too much to mention, that has left a diverse collection of fascinating historical sites to visit. The best way to see more of the local area would be to hire a bike as you have the opportunity to explore the area and take in it's history. Although the Colossus of Rhodes was destroyed in an earthquake in 224 BC, you can still visit the area where it stood in the harbour. The English bombs that fell on the city of Rhodes in 1944 destroyed many buildings but there are still many important historical sights that are definitely worth a visit.
If you are planning a holiday to Rhodes in late June you'll be able to enjoy the Summer Solstice, a flower festival at Mandraki Harbour in the New Town. At the end of July there is a festival of athletics at Aghios Soulas, which is a very popular day out for both locals and tourists. Assumption Day is traditionally in Mid-August and early September is home to the Fertility Pilgrimage by childless women. In later months, there is a classical music festival known as Music in Rhodes. As you can see, a holiday in Rhodes can be much more than just beaches and sun!
