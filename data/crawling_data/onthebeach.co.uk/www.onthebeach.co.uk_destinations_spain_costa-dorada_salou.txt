Salou Weather

Despite the number of sunny days that Salou basks in year round, the temperatures are not as intense as other destinations such as the
Costa del Sol
, with temperatures routinely ranging from between 20° Celsius and 26° Celsius from May until late August. The cooling breeze from the Mediterranean takes the edge off the worst of the humidity – perfect for working on that tan!

Landscape

Enjoying the golden sandy beaches that characterise the Costa Dorada, Salou also offers smaller, rocky coves with clear, shallow waters that make it extremely popular with families with small children. Whilst not as rocky and mountainous as nearby Tarragona, Salou is similarly hilly yet boasts a beautifully landscaped beachfront and gently sloping beaches.



Things To Do on Salou Holidays

One of the most popular attractions in the area is the Port Aventura theme park/waterpark. The park has six different thematic areas: the Mediterranean, the Far West, Mexico, China, Polynesia and Sesame Street Adventure, with a stunning 30 plus rides, 15 daily shows, 75 restaurants and 27 gift and handicraft shops. Salou also offers a mixture of the cultural and the contemporary, the exciting and the relaxing. The area offers some of the best watersports activities on the southern coast, with windsurfing, and banana boating proving popular with both children and adults. The area also offers more cultural attractions such as the Torre Vella watchtower museum and Salou’s Central park offering a chance to enjoy the rich, historical atmosphere at your own pace.

Culture

Salou enjoys a rich cultural atmosphere, and the many markets that take place in the summer offer a glimpse at more traditional Spanish life, with the Salou Monday street market and the Masai Catalana artisan’s market proving especially popular with locals and tourists alike.

Nightlife

Salou is one of the liveliest nightspots on the Costa Dorada, with a wide variety of bars, pubs and nightclubs to dance the night away. The flavour of the nightlife is equally diverse, with some pubs catering especially to British tourists, whilst others offer a decidedly more Mediterranean vibe. Don't forget that many of the hotels in Salou offer their own special blend of evening entertainment. Whatever gets your foot tapping, you’ll find it in Salou.
