Read more about Kefalonia



For people looking for dramatic scenery and beaches which spread out as far as the eye can see, you cannot go wrong with visiting the beautiful island, Kefalonia. The largest of the Ionian islands in Western Greece is home to 3 beautiful bays and a number of quaint secluded fishing villages. One of the most popular destinations for Greece holidays, the picturesque villages and wonderful beaches make this an island that is just waiting to be discovered!
Nightlife

This island is definitely not short of places to test the delicious foods on offer as there are plenty of restaurants to try the local foods. The most popular taverna is the Diana Taverna Argostoli but there are also other restaurants to try in the area, in fact many of the hotels in Kefalonia have their own top quality restaurants. If you just fancy a cup of coffee to take in the views there are cafes to spend the day watching the world go by. But if you fancy something a little stronger than coffee, why not check out the wineries of Kefalonia and have a sip or bottle if you prefer of the famous Robola wine which is native to the island.

Landscape

There are five harbours and ports to visit with Argostoli in the west being the largest port for local boats and ferries to Zante. The island also boasts long stretches of beaches and gorgeous turquoise seas which all offer something different depending on what you want from your holiday. Take Skala beach for example, water sports are available for those who fancy something daring or for those who just want to relax, why not head to one of the island's blue flag beaches. The island also has Mount Ainos, the tallest mountain on the island, and other smaller mountains which offer breathtaking scenery.

Kefalonia Weather

Like the other Greek Islands, the weather in Kefalonia is brilliant all year round. In the early and later months it is normally around the 20's but in the summer months it can be well over the 20's and up into the 30's. If you want Kefalonia holidays with the highest temperatures, July and August are definitely the month's worth visiting. Make sure you pack your sunglasses and your sun cream!

Things To Do on Kefalonia Holidays

There are many attractions to suit the needs of people on holidays to Kefalonia from museums to wine tasting and even doing your own movie location spotting! Thanks to the book 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' the island's profile was significantly raised, especially since the movie was shot on the island. Fans of the film are able to visit the places where they filmed, so if you want to visit these areas make a note of them before you fly over. If museum's interest you, visit the Marine Turtle Project group talks in lassi, Skala and Katelios throughout the summer or maybe the Folklore and Archeological museum in Argostoli.
Those who have an interest in photography will enjoy the amazing scenery on the island especially the stunning castles such as St. George's which looks fascinating on camera and the scenery from the castle itself is also truly spectacular. Kefalonia is also home to a number of monasteries, but remember if you want to visit these, it is considered disrespectful to wear clothes for the beach so make sure you cover up so you do not offend the locals!

Culture

Greek King Odysseus was rumoured to have lived on the island, something that has never been proved, but there are many theories as to if he did or did not. When visiting some towns and villages on the island look out for those that are built high on hilltops. This was to prevent attacks from raiding pirates that sailed the seas during the 1820s. Sorry ladies, but you will not be catching a glimpse of Johnny Depp!
Although the Greek culture is still ever present in Kefalonia, the island has been modernised due to tourism. Numbers have increased since Captain Corelli's Mandolin was filmed on the island but traditions are still in place like the markets. The best things to buy are locally-produced foods such as cheese and wines. The top markets at Argostoli's harbour-front market stock delicious foods that definitely need trying!



Book a Kefalonia Holiday now!

Kefalonia is one of those delightful idylls which is still mostly untainted by the effect of tourism. Although it has loads to offer, it is not as packed with tourists like some of the other Greek Islands. So if a quiet, relaxing holiday is more your thing make sure you book your holiday with On the Beach so you get the best offers. Using our system you can create your own customised holiday to Kefalonia by combining flights and hotels. Your break away in the sun is only a few minutes away!
