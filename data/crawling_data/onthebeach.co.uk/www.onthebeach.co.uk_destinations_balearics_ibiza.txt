Read more about Ibiza



Ibiza is famous for its vibrant, pulsating nightlife, especially in resorts such as San Antonio and Ibiza Town, which are home to some of Europe’s biggest and best super clubs such as Pacha, Space and Ushuaïa. Ibiza is also a fantastic option for a beach holiday with sandy beaches such as Cala Salada and Cala Xarraca.

If you want to be close to the party scene while also able to escape to a more relaxing spot, San Antonio Bay and Playa d’en Bossa are the ideal spots. San Antonio Bay is the neighbouring resort of San Antonio, allowing easy access to the busy town while also providing many bars and restaurants. Playa d’en Bossa is home to the longest beach on the island, providing chilled days and close proximity to the super clubs by night.

Away from the busier resorts, you can enjoy quieter retreats full of culture and tradition, unspoilt by the party scene. Ibiza is home to many museums allowing you to experience a more traditional side of Ibiza, or why not discover one of the hidden beaches, providing a beautiful place to watch the famous Ibiza sunset.
So what floats your boat - beaches or bars or both? Either way, a holiday to Ibiza can be as relaxing or as full-on and party fuelled as you could wish for.

Ibiza Weather

Ibiza enjoys a Mediterranean climate with long hot summers and mild winters. From June to September, the temperature ranges between 25°C to the low 30s and evening temperatures rarely fall below 20°C. Rainfall during this period is minimal.
The autumn months remain warm with temperatures reaching the mid 20s. The evenings in winter are cooler and see an increase in rainfall so it may be best to pack some warmer clothes. Ibiza winters are mild, with temperatures averaging at around 11°C.

Landscape

Surrounded by long stretches of golden beaches and rocky cliffs, Ibiza is best known for the beautiful pine forests, from which it derives its name. The very word, Ibiza, is taken directly from the island's original name, Ibshim, meaning 'island of pines'.
Dotted throughout the island are beautiful, historic churches and landmarks from a forgotten age. One of many purported places of Christopher Columbus's birth, there is even a monument known as 'The Egg' erected in his honour.



Things To Do on Ibiza Holidays

Depending on what you want to get from a holiday to Ibiza, you should consider whereabouts on the island you're going to stay. Mix it up with a few crazy nights out, relaxing days on the beach, cultural sightseeing trips, exciting water sports and discovering the breathtaking views of the island. Pack your holiday with lots of variety to ensure you come home feeling you have made the most of your holiday - and the island!

Culture

Ibiza is home to many museums so if you fancy a break away from the busy streets, take some much needed time to enjoy one of these popular activities.
The Archaeological Museum is a great source of resource if you are interested in the ancient history of Ibiza and neighbouring Formentera. The Museum of Contemporary Art is a small gallery boasting an excellent sample of permanent and touring contemporary art.
We would also recommend a visit to the Santa Maria Cathedral which includes a museum, chapels, a tall bell tower and a holy cross made from gold and silver over 600 years ago. The Can Marça Caves are a labyrinth of caverns which were once used for alcohol and tobacco smuggling and are over 100,000 years old. Today, you can take a tour around the caves to see them in all their natural glory.

Adventure

From tennis to horse riding in Talamanca and golf to mountain biking in Cala Llonga, you'll find it all here. Ibiza has several luxurious gyms should you want to keep in shape on holiday. The Mediterranean also offers great watersport opportunities including waterskiing and scuba diving.

Nightlife

Ibiza is one of the most popular destinations in Europe for people looking for a holiday with world class nightlife. Home to some of the biggest and best nightclubs in the world, the White Isle draws thousands of people each summer. The music here is unlike any you will find elsewhere; Ibiza has her own sound known as the Balearic Beat. Popular among musicians around the world, DJ's often come to Ibiza to introduce their new dance music tracks.
Ibiza town is where the "super clubs" are while San Antonio also has many popular clubs and bars. Santa Eulalia is more casual and attracts families and couples who want a busy resort without the heavy nightlife.

Relaxation

With nearly 60 beaches to choose from, many with sunbeds, watersports, beach side cafes and restaurants, Ibiza beaches are the best place to relax during the day. Santa Gertrudis is located in the centre of the island and is much quieter than the popular Ibiza resorts.

If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the busy Ibizan mainstays, then take a water taxi to some of the different coastal resorts where you will find some beautiful untouched towns and villages to relax in. Cala Llonga is a popular resort and is ideal if you are looking for a beautiful setting with idyllic views, away from Ibiza itself, yet still with facilities such as shops, bars and restaurants.

Ibiza is renowned for its amazing sunsets providing nightly shows of remarkable colour. Whichever part of the island you visit, the sunset will be the showstopper of the evening. The famous Cafe Mambo’s in San Antonio gathers large crowds of tourists with DJ’s playing providing the perfect lively setting to watch the show, or why not find one of the charming coves providing ultimate relaxation.
