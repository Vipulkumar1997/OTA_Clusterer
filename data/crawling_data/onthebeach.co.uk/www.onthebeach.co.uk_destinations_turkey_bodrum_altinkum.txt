Going on
holiday to Turkey
? Holidays to Altinkum, which translates as 'The Golden Sands', are amazing; this paradise of a beach overlooking the Aegean is perfect for those who want the best of both worlds: lots to do and see day and night, as well as a relaxing time in one of Turkey's quieter resorts.
The resort boasts a handful of glorious beaches for you to enjoy such as Main beach which offers calm and shallow waters perfect for a fun-filled afternoon with the family. Further along the coast, the smaller and quieter Third beach also boasts a beach side restaurant which offers a mix of local and international cuisine.

For those looking to explore Altinkum, the Temple of Apollo is a great place to start. Although the remains are not of the original structure which was ruined in an earthquake in the 15th century, people still travel long and far to witness these great ruins.

There are a number of festivals that take place in Altinkum, Didim Peace Festival being one of them. The annual event is celebrated to promote the friendship between Turkey and Greece and features a race from Apollo’s Temple to Altinkum plus boat races and much more. Didim market also takes place on a Saturday and features a host of locals selling their homemade goods.

Fancy an evening out on the town? Head down to Dolphin Square where you’ll find a mix of bars, restaurants and clubs to enjoy at your own pace. We definitely recommend a visit to Dolphin Bar where you are promised a good time.
With On the Beach, your Altinkum holiday is just a six hour flight away. All that’s left to do is choose the perfect hotel and pack...

Altinkum Weather

Altinkum holidays mean sun, and there is no shortage of that on Turkey's turquoise Aegean coast! Temperatures here regularly reach highs of 30° Celsius and above in summer, and the winters are very mild, though rainier and overcast at times.
The best time of year to visit on holidays to Altinkum would be in either spring, summer or early autumn when the temperatures are more manageable. This assures you great weather, avoiding the peak season and of course, some quality beach-time to top up that tan!

Landscape

Not for nothing is Altinkum called 'Golden Sands' - take a look round! The beach itself is split between a large bay creating an east and west side, both equally beautiful for watching the sunsets, and though the tourism is buzzing, Altinkum retains that ancient air of mystery and culture that makes it famous. Being next to the Aegean, there's also plenty of forestry and olive groves surrounding you, for a suitably exotic panorama.
Don't forget that the sights and sounds of
Kusadasi
are very close to Altimkum!



Things To Do on Altinkum Holidays

Altinkum, for all its relative tranquility, is nevertheless teeming with sights to see and places to go. Why not visit the archaic Temple of Apollo, a man-made, 3000 year-old stone hinterland that was once home to ancient oracles and houses statues that the Romans considered old! The ancient cities of Didyma and Ephesus nearby are crammed with ruins, giant pillars and even a great Medusa Head, which is an absolute must-see.

Culture

With 5,000 years of recorded history, you would expect Altinkum to have a fascinating culture - and it doesn't disappoint. From here, you can go on tours of the surrounding antiquities by bus via Bodrum, or travel further along to discover Priene's 2,500 year-old theatre and it's Byzantine Church. Enter the heart of Bodrum itself for a taste of local market life, who knows, you might end up buying something o-o-old!

Nightlife

But it's not simply ancient ruins you get here, there's pubs, bars and restaurants aplenty, and all serving the finest Turkish cuisine! Try Touch of Class on Saturdays for that traditional Turkish mix of mouth-watering salads and skewered meats, with belly-dancing and folk music for a backdrop!
If you want to party, then Altinkum holidays are for you! There's no shortage of lively, fun-filled bars such as CJ's and Funky Forest in which to watch staff dances and join in the revelry. For a late-night bite, pop down to the Soup Kitchen which is open through the wee hours.
