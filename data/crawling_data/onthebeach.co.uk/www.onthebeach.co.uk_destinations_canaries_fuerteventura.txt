Read more about Fuerteventura



Rolling dunes, rugged low-lying mountains and desert plains give Fuerteventura holidays their unique atmosphere, but it is their stunning beaches that are the most appealing aspect of this charming Canary Island, located just off the African coast.
The two main resorts in Fuerteventura are Corralejo at the northern tip, the largest and most bustling resort, and Morro Jable in the south, a slightly more sophisticated destination popular with surfers. There are numerous smaller resorts, and plenty of secluded sandy bays where you can get away from it all.

The main centre of the island's nightlife is Corralejo. Bars and discos take up much of the town's main strip at Centro Comercial Atlantico on Avenida General Franco; there are also British-style pubs and live music venues along the strip.

All the resorts around Fuerteventura have bars and discos, although the nightlife is likely to be a little more subdued than in Corralejo. Caleta de Fuste, has a choice of bars along the main street. The southern town of Morro Jable is the only real rival to Corralejo in terms of nightlife, with a cluster of pubs and disco bars in the Cosmo Centor Comercial along the beachfront.

Fuerteventura Weather

Fuerteventura enjoys a pleasant all year round climate with monthly average temperatures ranging from around 17° Celsius in January to 25° Celsius in August. The sirocco, or leveche in Spanish, is a seasonal wind that can bring sandstorms and raise temperatures considerably. With such a close proximity to the African coastline Fuerteventura is the driest of all Canary Islands, seeing little rain and remaining desert-like for most of the year so that you can spend plenty of time on the beach whenever you are on holiday in Fuerteventura.

Things To Do on Fuerteventura Holidays

Aside from the great beaches and beautiful scenery, Fuerteventura holidays offer lots of interesting attraction, so whether you are wanting total relaxation, watersport adventure or family fun, there will be plenty for you to do on your Fuerteventura holiday.

Culture

The months of February and March are carnival season in Fuerteventura with every town and village competing to out do each other with the extravagance of their parades. The main carnivals are held in Puerto del Rosario, Corralejo and Morra Jable; you should check with tourist information for exact dates of the carnival as these vary in each town. Puerto del Rosario hosts a big party on the first Sunday of October each year for the Fiesta de la Virgen del Rosario, the town's patron saint. Early each November kite flyers from around the world head to the annual Kite Festival at La Playa del Burro near Corralejo to take advantage of the strong trade winds that hit the island's north coast, which is something you definitely should check out if you are taking your holiday in Fuerteventura around the time. There're activities for everyone with a family Fuerteventura holiday, and the weekend finishes with a big firework display!

Families

Aside from the great beaches and beautiful scenery, Fuerteventura holidays offer lots of interesting attractions. In the south of the island is Oasis Park at La Lajita, near
Costa Calma
. Here you can see a huge variety of animal life including alligators, monkeys, giraffes, zebras and many birds. There is also a botanical garden through which you can enjoy a camel ride.
In Corralejo, on the island's north coast, is the Baku Water Park, newly opened with a wealth of water rides and facilities. There is also ten-pin bowling, crazy golf, a driving range and an Animal Experience section of the park with sharks, stingrays and sea lions.
In Puerto del Rosario you can visit the Casa Museo de Unamuno, a museum in the former house of the early twentieth-century philosopher Miguel de Unamuno. For a glimpse into Fuerteventura history you could head to the town of Betancuria, an attractive, sleepy place tucked into hills in the centre of the island. Here you will find the ruins of a monastery on the outskirts, and the 17th Century Iglesia de Santa Maria at the centre. The church has some interesting architecture, and at the nearby Museo de Arte Sacro you can view a collection of religious art.

Adventure

If you are looking for some adventure while on your Fuerteventura holiday then why not take a quad bike to see the beauty of the island as you drive throught the sand dunes, volcanic craters and green lush valleys.
Fuerteventura is renowned as the best surf destination in the Canaries and attracts many surfers of all levels, especially due to the large number of surf schools located in the resorts of Corralejo and Caleta. You will also find exciting watersports such as waterskiing and windsurfing at beaches in all the major resorts to add a little adventure into your day.
