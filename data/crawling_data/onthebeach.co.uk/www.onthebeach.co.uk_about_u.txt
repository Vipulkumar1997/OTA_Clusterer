We are On the Beach and we’re proud to be one of the UK’s leading online retailers of beach holidays. From humble beginnings in 2004 as a start-up business in a terraced house in Macclesfield, England, to our 2015 listing on the London Stock Exchange; we now send over one million happy customers away on their perfect beach holiday each year. You can find out more at
www.onthebeachgroupplc.com


More reasons to book with us...








Book with confidence

Our holidays are financially protected with our ATOL licence








Over 1.5 million

happy customers book with us every year








Pay in instalments

& spread the holiday cost up to two weeks before you fly








24/7 in-resort support

from our UK call centre





Relax you're ATOL Protected

We're proud to say that back in 2011 we were the first major online travel agent to create an ATOL approved trust, and in 2016 we'll financially protect over 1 million customers' holidays.

That means, when booked together, your flight, hotel and transfer are all
financially protected
.


Your money is protected - we cannot access it until your holiday is complete!

On the Beach pays customers’ cash into a UK trust account (flights are paid for upfront), so cannot access customer’s cash until the holiday is complete. Many UK travel businesses with ATOL protection DO NOT ACT IN THIS WAY – we were the first ever UK OTA to put this trust account system in place and we have been paying all our hotels and transfers in this way since 2011. Should anything happen to the business, you can be 100% sure you can access your money to pay for your holiday.


Spread the cost with low deposits and flexible payments

With a
low deposit
from as little as £50 per person, book today and pay the rest of your holiday in instalments and your final payment will be due just two weeks before you fly.


Build your perfect holiday

We're an online travel agent - we don't sell package holidays. Instead, we let you build your perfect getaway by letting you search thousands of cheap flights, hotels and transfer suppliers in one place, saving you money.


24/7 in-resort support

Sit back and relax in the knowledge that our in-resort support line is available 24/7.


Book with us and save money

We regularly survey our customers; who tell us that they make big savings when they book their holiday with On the Beach. You don't have to take our word for it though. We publish the highlights of our survey on our
save money
page.

On the Beach Limited
















On the Beach act as an agent providing a web search interface between you and various third party suppliers of travel products (e.g. flight, hotel or transfer). For flights we act as your agent in processing your booking with the airline; we are not the airline’s agent. Each product you choose has its own price independent of other products booked at the same time and creates a separate contract between you and the supplier of that product.
