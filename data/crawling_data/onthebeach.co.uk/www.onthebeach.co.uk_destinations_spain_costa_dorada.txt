Read more about Costa Dorada



Spain’s Costa Dorada lies along the southern coast of Catalonia, south of Barcelona. Comprised of around twenty towns and villages stretching over 120 miles, the Costa Dorada offers a wealth of options for people considering Spain holidays. A popular destination for tourists, holidays to Costa Dorada provide an ideal escape for both families and singles, whether you’re looking for a relaxing beach getaway or vibrant nightlife.
Spain remains a consistently popular destination for British tourists, and the Costa Dorada is a mere two-and-a-half hour flight from the UK. Whilst the area is comprised of many towns such as Tarragona, the area is one large resort, offering sumptuous dining at the many restaurants that line the beachfront, exciting nightclubs and bars and a multitude of sporting activities for the more active holidaymaker ranging from watersports in the many marinas along the coast, to rock climbing.
After dark offers a huge variety of restaurants, bars and clubs that line the beachfront. Whether you’re looking for regional Spanish bars with an exotic Mediterranean flavour or DJ’s spinning the latest funky house tracks and dancefloor fillers, the nightlife scene on the Costa Dorada is electric. Many of the hottest nightspots are within easy walking distance of several popular Costa Dorada hotels or a short taxi ride away, meaning you’re never far from an exciting night out.
Situated on the southern Catalonian coast, the Costa Dorada lies on some of the finest beaches in Spain. The area takes its name from the soft, golden sand of these wide beaches. Further inland, the region is famously mountainous, offering not only action adventure activities like rock climbing, but also breathtaking views of the shore and surrounding coastline and countryside. There are ten major marinas and several smaller harbours dotted along the coastline, many offering boat rides and sailing trips.

Costa Dorada Weather

Featuring soft, golden beaches on the Mediterranean and milder summer temperatures than destinations such as the
Costa del Sol
, the Costa Dorada makes luxuriating on the beach comfortable for those less comfortable in the heat. Temperatures typically range from 20° Celsius to 26° Celsius in the summer, with little rainfall – although short, refreshing showers are not uncommon. Shorts, tee shirts and sandals are definitely order of the day, especially for those lazy days by the beach.
The best time of year to visit the Costa Dorada is between May and August, with plenty of sunlight and deliciously cool breezes from the Mediterranean – bring your suntan lotion!

Things To Do on Costa Dorada Holidays

Costa Dorada holidays offer many exciting activities and attractions, the most prominent being Port Aventura, a vast theme park similar to Busch Gardens in
Florida
. Featuring water rides such as the Grand Canyon Rapids and the Sea Odyssey underwater adventure, Port Aventura is themed across five continental areas and remains one of the most popular attractions of the area.
For those looking for more relaxed activities, the Costa Dorada also offers a surprising variety of cultural treats, with several theatres and museums on offer. The Fortuny Theatre in Reus is steeped in history, having been built in 1882, and is widely considered to be one of the best theatres in Spain. The Archaeological Museum Tarragona, the oldest museum in Catalonia, houses exhibits from regional monuments such as the Circus Maximus and the Necropolis, and is well worth a visit to see the fascinating influence of Romanisation on the area.

Culture

The rich and varied Mediterranean culture of the Costa Dorada is evident wherever you look, from the classical architecture to the local foods. The area manages to blend modern and contemporary buildings with the traditional Mediterranean feel of the original Roman buildings, and the area is home to both the Benedictine monastery of Saint Mary of Montserrat and the 14th century Roman-Gothic cathedral, which contains the tomb of Joan d’Arago.
The area plays host to a variety of annual carnivals and festivals, including the Veteran Car Rally, the Fiesta Major, Corpus Christi and the Grape Harvest Festival, offering visitors a glimpse at a uniquely Spanish tradition. As for the food, in addition to more traditional Spanish fare such as paella, there are many local delicacies to sample, such as zarzuelas and butifarra sausage casserole, and the wines of the area are both good and inexpensive.
