Read more about Playa Blanca



Lanzarote remains one of the UK’s favourite holiday haunts in the Canary archipelago, one of the world’s favourite vacation spots. Just four hours' flight to Arrecife Airport will see you transported to an island paradise: great all-year-round weather, gorgeous beaches and lots to see and do! At the southernmost tip of Lanzarote’s tortoise-shaped island, the holiday resort of Playa Blanca was once little more than a quaint little fishing village. However, the insatiable demand for Lanzarote holidays over the last twenty years has resulted in the growth of Playa Blanca into the purpose built holiday resort it is today. The great thing about it, and what marks its light brown sands apart from other Lanzarote holiday resorts is the fact that it’s quite a recently developed resort, yet has retained much of its former charm as a small fishing village.
Two kilometres west of Playa Blanca, Playa Flamingo beach is an attractive golden sand beach. Playa Blanca's beach is also pleasant enough if you're staying in the town centre, and handy for the restaurants and shops that line the pretty promenade. A lovely new promenade leads east to the small sheltered beach of Playa Dorada, which is great for small children. Three kilometres west of the centre, past Playa Flamingo, you'll find Lanzarote's finest golden white coves, known collectively as the Papagayo Beaches.

If you fancy getting away from the beach for a while, plenty of boats at the port offer excursions to Corralejo on the neighbouring island of Fuerteventura, and the charming and undeveloped little islet of Los Lobos, just off Fuerteventura. There are also whale- and dolphin-watching trips available, which makes for a great day trip for the family. At Marina Rubicón there are opportunities for scuba diving in Lanzarote, sailing, tennis and even catamaran excursions.
Playa Blanca holidays excel mainly as a family resort, and there's none of the famed nightlife of Puerto del Carmen here, but there's an eclectic mix of bars and restaurants on the marina. The food is varied of course: from Chinese and English to local fare, and the bars are predominantly chic, with a glut of English and Irish venues. The young aren't without nightlife, though, with new nightclubs such as The Jungle, and generally late opening hours.

Playa Blanca Weather

Cheap Playa Blanca holidays are more or less a fixture for tourists the whole year round, thanks in no small part to the consistently warm Lanzarote temperatures - consistently hot, that is! Hot it may be, averaging around 18° Celsius in December and 26° Celsius by the summer, but sultry breezes, courtesy of the trade winds, mean you’re never flustered. Having said that, ensure you have your sun cream on at all times to protect you from the sun's rays.

Landscape

Holidays to Playa Blanca mean beaches, of course! The resort itself may be new, but that doesn’t preclude a great day on the light-brown sands of the beach, with a ridge of seaside shops and restaurants behind, and the azure Atlantic stretching out before you. Playa Blanca is especially gorgeous at night, where, by the harbour or the promenade, you can marvel at the sunset before taking in the distant lights of Fuerteventura glistening on the horizon.



Things To Do on Playa Blanca Holidays

Close to home, you have one of the most fabulous new harbours in the
Canaries
, the upmarket Rubicon Marina, stacked with upmarket shops, as well as touristy fare. Travel inland for the island's theme parks and water parks, including the voluminous Timanfaya National Park, and the volcanic caves of Los Verdes. Here at the south of the island, you're well positioned to travel to
Fuerteventura
, the nearest of the Canaries, just fifteen minutes away by boat.

Culture

Come to Lanzarote in Carnival Season, February to March, for some Hispanic revelry with dances, local music and food festivals, or in mid-June for the Corpus Christi holy festival. By 'holy', Canarians mean music and partying, but there are also some unique sights - carpets rolled out of sea salt, and giant processions through most of the island’s picturesque towns and villages.

Families

Playa Blanca holidays excel mainly as a family resort, as there’s none of the famed nightlife of Puerto del Carmen, but there’s an eclectic mix of bars and child friendly restaurants on the marina. The food is varied of course: from Chinese and English to local fare, and the bars are predominantly chic, with a glut of English and Irish hostelries. The young aren’t without nightlife, though, with new nightclubs such as The Jungle, and generally late opening hours. Travel inland for the island’s theme parks and water parks, including the voluminous Timanfaya National Park, and the volcanic caves of Los Verdes. Best of all, down at the port you can take a trip on the Marea Errota, a 19th-century wooden schooner replica. The kids will absolutely love dressing up as pirates, getting their faces painted and brandish muskets to sail the high seas en route to the glorious Papagayo Beaches! For more low key entertainment, most of the large hotels provide a children's entertainment team.



Who goes to Playa Blanca?

Playa Blanca is a favourite of British visitors, and is home to a good selection of shops and SPAR type supermarkets, with most stocking a wide selection of UK recognised branded goods, albeit at higher prices than you'd find in the UK. Playa Blanca is also popular with walkers thanks to the beautiful coastal path, which extends from the beaches of Papagayo Natural Park to Faro Park. The marina is popular with sailing enthusiasts and offers many boat trips around the island.
