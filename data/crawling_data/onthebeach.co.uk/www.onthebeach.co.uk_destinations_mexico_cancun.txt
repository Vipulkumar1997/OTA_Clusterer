Read more about Cancun



Holiday's in Mexico's number one tourist destination Cancun offer everything you could want in a holiday from fabulous weather, great attractions and plenty of culture and history. So what are you waiting for? We've got plenty of holidays to choose from suitable for families and couples and its not a secret that Cancun has some of the best all inclusive hotels in the world.
There is plenty to see and do in Cancun, not least for sports fans. If it's watersports you're after you can't go wrong with a holiday to Cancun. There are plenty of beaches and most are ideal for a spot of jet skiing or parasailing. There's also the chance to try out sailing, kayaking or windsurfing and qualified instructors are always on hand to teach you the ropes. Holidays in Cancun certainly are packed full of exciting things to do!
Other great days out include Aquaworld, Maya Ventura and the famed Wet n Wild waterpark. Isla Mujeres is also just a 20 minute trip by ferry from Cancun. The island is renowned for Playa Norte beach and the diving off Ganafon Marine Park in the north.
Take the 40 minute ferry from Playa del Carmen to Cozumel and snorkel the world's 2nd largest coral reef just off the west coast of Cozumel. The island is renowned as being one of the best dive sites in the world with a huge variety of terrain and underwater wildlife.
For a little lighter exercise why not try some golf? There are plenty of golf courses to play on your Cancun holidays and many of the resorts even offer golfing tuition so you can brush up on your swing while you're away. If you fancy a bit of retail therapy you won't be disappointed on holidays in Cancun as it is a duty free port. There are many unique boutiques selling everything from unusual crafts to one of a kind pieces of jewellery.
Mexico loves a party and that's easy to see from the fantastic array of nightclubs and bars on offer. If you like to dance you'll find plenty of places to strut you stuff from the Coco Bongo nightclub, which features flying acrobats, to the Bulldog cafe with it's own jacuzzi! But if dancing isn't your thing don't worry: there are also lots of great restaurants where you can enjoy a traditional Mexican feast and you can even indulge in a spot of comedy at one of the bars hosting stand-up nights.
If you are coming on holidays to Cancun make sure you visit Actun Chen situated just outside Cancun. Actun Chen is an ancient cave adorned with natural sculptures and is an absolute must for your Cancun holidays. Tour guides will take you on an underground tour where you'll witness it's natural beauty. To the south of Cancun you'll find many authentic villages, untouched by tourism and full of Mexican charm.
If you really want to witness Cancun's charm and culture you can't miss one of the many festivals that take place there. The month of April marks the anniversary of when Cancun was first founded and the whole city comes out to dance and celebrate. On Halloween Cancun celebrates All Soul's Day with candle-lit parades and flowers everywhere. As controversial as they are, bullfights are also part of the Cancun culture and every Wednesday at the Plaza de Toros many take place.

Cancun Weather

As you would expect in Mexico, one thing you can be sure of is heat. It is very rarely cold here and even in the tropical rainstorms you'll still be warm! The best weather for your holiday to Cancun is during the months of May and November when there's no shortage of tropical sunshine.
The heat can be too much for some people as temperatures but if you want to get it just right then try visiting Cancun on holidays during September. During this month the weather is hot but not to the point that it's unbearable and there's very little rainfall.
