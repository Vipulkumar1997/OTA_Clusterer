Read more about Crete



The perfect environment in which to unleash your inner Greek, every corner of Crete has a story to tell. Holidays in Crete offer something for everyone. The largest of the Greek islands, its size is more representative of a small country than a standalone island in the sea, yet its charismatic culture and hedonistic scenery provide the ideal backdrop to get up close and personal with the island’s historic tales and laid-back way of life, which is exactly what you'll experience on Crete holidays.
With sandy beaches that stretch as far as the eye can see, broken up by secret coves and olive groves, Crete’s pretty plateau lends itself flawlessly to family getaways and romantic retreats. The island is even home to Europe’s only palm-tree forest beach, Vai, so if you want to impress others with your world-wide knowledge of nature, look no further.
Aside from the panoramic views and warm climate, Crete holidays are also renowned for their party scene, with Malia and Hersonissos topping the charts thanks to their energetic nightlife. Elsewhere, expect customary waterparks, Greek tavernas and plenty of archaeological finds and frescos, all of which secure Crete’s place as the jewel in Greece’s crown.

Crete Weather

Sharing two climate zones with North Africa and the Mediterranean means the Greek island of Crete has a varied weather forecast. Humid for the most part, Crete holidays boast the mildest climate compared to anywhere else in Greece with temperatures during summer hovering around the high 20’s, yet the island isn’t adverse to soggy situations either, and in January when the weather is at its wettest, it’s not unheard of for the island to receive up to a fortnight of rain.
Along the coast and amongst the mountains tends to be cooler, as does the mid, western and northern areas of the island as these make up part of the Mediterranean climate, whilst the south and east of the island is more representative of the African atmosphere.

Landscape

Verging on gold star status, Crete's cuisine is top notch nosh. Health-bods will be more than happy tucking into fresh fish and Greek salads, complete with olives and feta; red-blooded meat eaters will love dining out on loukanika (Greek sausages) and moussaka, while those who want to immerse themselves in Greek culture can chow down on Meze, full of dolmades (vine leaves stuffed with rice), taramasalata and tzatziki, all washed down with some inexpensive Greek wine or a shot of the local tipple – Raki.
It’s not all drinking, eating and merriment though, as much of the Greek culture is centred around the Greek Orthodox church which still plays a huge part in the islanders’ lives. Religious festivals and celebrations are a regular occurrence too, but with most Cretans fluent in English, you won’t have to worry about missing them.
Divided up into sandy shores, lush meadows and rugged mountains, the island’s terrain is just as diverse as its heritage, and varies from each corner of the compass making it an idyllic destination for beach bods, activity seekers, history hunters and even geographical groupies.



Things To Do on Crete Holidays

Although Crete holidays place you on the largest of the Greek islands, there are plenty of smaller islands dotted around the main mass that are worth a visit too, most notably Spinalonga. A short boat ride away from the quiet, quaint town of Elounda, the nearby fortress island used to be a leper colony and in the past has been referred to as the Island of Tears; but don’t be put off by tales of love and tragedy because the Greek islands are nothing but beautiful. In fact, Santorini is Greece’s most photographed island while Dia is home to the extra special Kri-kri goats.
If you prefer to keep your feet firmly on the ground, Crete still has numerous offerings to choose from. History fans may want to make a beeline for the award-winning Knossos Museum and get drawn in by the remains of the Minoan Empire, while Greek mythologists may be more interested in a date with Lassithi Plateau, believed to be the birthplace of Zeus.

Nightlife

For the younger crowd, Elafonisi on the south west coast is heralded as the best beach on the island, while water parks and boat trips will appeal to a livelier bunch of holiday-makers. And if you want to carry the party from the early evening to the early hours, pinpoint Malia on your map - the clubbing capital of the island - followed closely by Hersonissos and Aghios Nikalos.
