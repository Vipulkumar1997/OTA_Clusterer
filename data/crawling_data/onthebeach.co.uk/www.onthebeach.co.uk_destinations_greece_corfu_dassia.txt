Read more about Dassia



Dassia is extremely popular with younger couples and groups of people because of it's lively atmosphere.The resort is situated on the east coast of Corfu only miles away from Corfu Town and offers spectacular views of the surrounding areas. Also being close to the lively resort of Ipsos, you can explore the area and find attractions which suit your needs. The long stretch of beach is perfect when the weather is at it's finest, which is usually in the summer months, but there are also plenty of bars and restaurants to keep you entertained.
In summer it is mainly sunny and dry so sun cream should definitely be top of your list. Winter has a fair amount of rainfall so if you want to top up your tan, the summer months are the time to go on
holiday to Corfu
. September and October temperatures are perfect for those that want a cooler holiday, but we do recommend you packing light jackets for the evenings. You can expect temperatures in the mid to high 20's in the months of June, July and August, perfect tanning conditions!
There are plenty of attractions to keep everyone entertained while on holiday in Dassia, ranging from bars and restaurants to beaches. Just an hour and a half away there is a architect designed golf course which has beautiful views and top class facilities for that will make even the most keen golfers feel at home. It also has a pony-trekking centre that offers a variety of trekking across the Corfu countryside for anyone who wants to give it a try. The exciting resort of Ipsos is just a ten minute walk away which has some great bars and clubs. The exclusive resort of Kommeno is just round the headland towards
Gouvia
and the famous 'Church Island' is worth a visit.
If you take some of the small inland roads from Dassia through olive groves you will discover more traditional, pretty Corfu villages. Those wanting some exercise, take an afternoon to walk on foot to the lovely tourist resort of Kommeno and Gouvia. For the adventure seekers, why not try the excellent watersport facilities that are on offer down at the beach, including scuba diving, paragliding and banana boating.
Dassia has a great nightlife and being twinned with Ipsos, you can find even more bars and restaurants to satisfy your needs. Those that want relaxing entertainment should stay in Dassia as there are a number of quiet bars and tavernas with a chilled out atmosphere. A couple of local bars offer Greek dancing and plate smashing for those who fancy experiencing something more traditional. If you love everything British you may want to visit the Shakes Bar, a famous haunt for party animals!
There is a long, narrow shingle beach caressed by the warm waters of the Mediterranean. It is backed by olive and pine trees, the scent filling the air. The shingle beach slopes gently which is perfect for those who love to swim and for those who want to relax, fortunately there are plenty of sunbeds available for those looking to top up their tans!
Dassia has everything for a holiday - beautiful beaches and a fun nightlife for those who love to stay up late. The resort is only a few miles away from other resorts in Corfu, so you are able to leave to explore other places with ease. On the Beach has great deals on flights and hotels - use our live booking system to create your own holiday now before you miss out on a great deal!
