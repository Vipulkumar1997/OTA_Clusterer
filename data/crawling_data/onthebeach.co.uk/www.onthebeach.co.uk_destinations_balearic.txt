Read more about Balearics



The Balearic Islands are set in the Mediterranean Sea, between Spain and the coast of North Africa. Whilst on holiday in the Balearic Islands you can take your pick from picture postcard sandy beaches with crystal clear waters, dramatic landscapes, clubbing in the hotspots of Ibiza and Majorca, historic cultural cities like Palma or shopping heaven in Ibiza Town.
If you're looking for a relaxing beach holiday in a secluded sun-kissed cove, the Balearics is the ideal destination. Wonderful beaches and a laid-back atmosphere ensure you'll enjoy a chilled out break. A number of hotels and resorts offer spa treatments and yoga retreats are available on all the islands. After a busy year, a holiday in the Balearics is the perfect way to recharge your batteries.
Ibiza
Located in the Mediterranean sea, the incredibly beautiful island of Ibiza offers spectacular beaches and wonderfully warm Mediterranean waters, a nightlife second to none with some of the largest nightclubs in the world, holidays in Ibiza are incredibly popular with those who wanting an exciting and vibrant holiday, where the fun never stops.
However, Ibiza isn't all about the parties! Away from the busy resorts you will find beautiful and peaceful retreats full of culture and tradition, unspoilt by the party scene. So whatever you want from your Ibiza holiday, you will definitely have a holiday of a lifetime on this spectacular island.
Majorca
Attracted by its sandy beaches, Spanish sun and buzzing nightlife, Majorca is one of the most popular holiday destinations for British holiday-makers. Partly down to its short and snappy flight-time and guaranteed warmer weather throughout summer, but also because of its suitability to serve all ages, tastes and budgets.
With popular holiday destinations in each of the island's four corners, take your pick from idyllic villages such as the picturesque Puerto De Soller nestled along the coastline or holiday hotspots including the infamous Magaluf. Even the capital has something different to offer. Steeped in rich history, Palma is a treasure-trove of tapas bars, boutiques and of course the notable Gothic Cathedral.
Menorca
Known by many as the Jewel of the Balearics, Menorca is an extremely popular holiday destination. Bathed in Mediterranean sunshine, Menorca holidays have fantastic attractions and top quality hotels that are very much geared towards the family and couples, making Menorca one of Europe's hotspots for family breaks.
There are lots of great activities to keep the whole family entertained on Menorca holidays, and the many watersports and varied nightlife available means there's something for the adults too! Menorca is rich in historical sites such as the navetas, ancient burial sites, the naveta of Es Tudons being the oldest building in Europe. Many who come on holidays to Menorca enjoy seeing the island by boat, with glass bottom boat tours proving very popular.

Balearics Weather

The Balearics enjoy 300 days of sunshine a year, and the Mediterranean climate promises hot summers, mild autumns and pleasant winters. Boasting average annual temperatures of 16-17°C, the Balearic Islands are popular with visitors all year round, however the summer months are always the busiest!
During the summer months of July and August, the Balearics enjoy up to 11 hours of sunshine each day with a beautiful average temperature of 29°C and rainfall extremely rare. The Spring and autumn months are still a great time to visit the Balearic Islands if you prefer a more comfortable low heat, but still gloriously sunny. The temperature during these months range from 22°C to 28°C and the cooler temperatures make activities away from the beach, such as golfing, walking and cycling ideal during these months.
Winter months in the Balearic Islands are bright and crisp, with the average temperature dropping to 15°C and the hours of sun dropping to only 5. The chance of rainfall does increase during October through to February, however the weather will be significantly better than what you will find in the UK, which is why the Balearics are still a popular holiday destination during these months.

Landscape

The Balearics have literally hundreds of beaches. In
Majorca
, take your pick from long sandy beaches in Alcudia or little bays like Cala Mesquida. At Puerto Pollensa the
Tramuntana Mountains
run down to the sea, creating a dramatic effect with exquisite views from the beach. Majorca's west coast is rugged, but there are spots for swimming and snorkelling. For stunning views, head for the mouth of the
Torrent de Pareis
which shapes
Sa Calobra
, with rock formations, a small beach and crystal clear waters to enjoy.

Ibiza
alone has more than 50 beaches.
Platja d'en Bossa
, a large idyllic sandy stretch south of
Eivissa
, with the
Aguamar waterpark
behind it, is popular with young clubbers and families alike. Other popular hotspots include
Cala de Boix,
framed by green hills, and boasting a superb view.

Menorca
too is an island of idyllic beaches, particularly along its south west coast. Expect clear waters and beautiful white sands in
Cala Blanca,
with fewer crowds. Peace and quiet is on the menu, and beaches are attractive, although smaller than on the other islands.



Things To Do on Balearics Holidays

You'll not only enjoy magnificent beaches, but also a wide range of cultural and entertainment activities. With water parks for the children, beautiful landscapes and historic sites to explore, you'll never be bored. If you love cities, Palma has blocks of contemporary art galleries, a Gothic cathedral and museums. There are restaurants, bars and clubs to suit all tastes, from quiet, local eateries to clubs where the partying only slows down at dawn. Whatever you want to do, you'll find it somewhere in the Balearics.

Culture

There are colourful fiestas across the Balearic Islands all year round. In Majorca and Menorca, the grape harvest festivals and processions of giant papier mache heads are a specialty. The main festival on Menorca is Sant Joan, in late June. The distinctive Menorcan horse opens this festival, with rider and whooping crowds.
Other fiestas across Menorca include those at the end of July in Es Mercadal, Fornells and Es Castell. In August things get pretty spicy almost every weekend. In September, Mare de Deu de Gracia in Mao hosts its fiesta. The fiestas are essentially an excuse to have a week long party.
Ibiza Town's old quarter is a historical gem perched on a rocky promontory, and Dalt Villa, the medieval part, has a Gothic cathedral and sprawling castle. Check out the area's Museu d'Art Contemporani in Dalt Vila, with its selection of avant garde paintings and sculptures. The Lady of the Snows Cathedral is one of Ibiza's most impressive buildings.
Menorca’s capital, Mahon has an old town, with small squares, cobbled streets and a natural harbour. At the Port of Mahon are the remains of the Castle of Sant Felip, and the La Mola fort. The Museu de Menorca on Placa des Monastir holds a selection of artefacts. Just north of Mahon is the Parc Natural de S'Albufera des Grau, an important wetlands reserve area, home to many birds and superb hiking territory.
Palma is crammed with contemporary art galleries, a Gothic cathedral, museums, excellent shopping, and plenty of public art scattered around.

Adventure

There's plenty to attract those looking for an "action-packed" holiday in the Balearics. For those interested in activities on and under the water, there's a wide variety of snorkelling & diving, sailing, kite & wind-surfing. Canyoning is also a popular, adrenaline-soaked activity if you're brave enough!
The rugged landscape and breathtaking hills attract both mountain and road bikers, with Majorca a key training camp for many of the professional cycling teams. The mountainous areas also attract climbers and extreme hikers.

Shopping

Each of the islands offer a different shopping experience, from top-end designers to local handicrafts. Popular buys include local wines, embroidery, hand painted ceramics, glassware, handmade shoes and costume jewellery. If you're looking for something special Majorca is famous for its pearls. There's something to suit all budgets and tastes to buy as a reminder of a fantastic Balearics holiday!

Nightlife

Whatever you're looking for in your ideal night out, the Balearics can cater for your every need, from mixing with the locals for a quiet meal to clubbing until dawn. Ibiza is home to some of the world's largest and most famous nightclubs and its club culture is famous in its own right, drawing people from all over the world. If you're staying in Ibiza Town, San Antonio or Playa d'en Bossa, you'll find it on your doorstep. Majorca too is home to great nightlife, ranging from sophistication in Palma to wild in Magaluf! Menorca by contrast is quiet with nightlife usually hotel-based, though Mahon and Ciutadella offer a wide range of nightspots.
