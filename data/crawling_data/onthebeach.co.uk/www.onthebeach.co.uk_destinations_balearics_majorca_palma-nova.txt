Palma Nova Weather

Summer months are the most popular for
Majorca holidays
due to the blue skies and sheer amount of sunshine. If you are coming to Palma Nova, you'll be going home with a lovely healthy bronzed tan!
If you want to visit in the cooler months you can still expect plenty of Mediterranean sunshine and temperatures around 20° Celsius but be aware that there may be a few rain showers.

Landscape

The gorgeous beaches at Palma Nova are perfect for families and younger children as they are very well kept and are very safe. There are plenty of things to do on the beaches, like watersports or glass bottom boats. You can even take in the glorious scenery by pulling up a chair and having a quiet drink, watching the day go by. The beaches sweep their way around the bay and gently slope into the aquamarine Mediterranean. There's a reason why this part of
Spain
is so popular!



Things To Do on Palma Nova Holidays

Golf Fantasia is popular with
families
on holidays in Palma Nova as it is a delightful mini golf course surrounded by waterfalls, caves and tropical gardens. Marineland, another popular family attraction, is just along the coast at Portals Nous. Here you will find performing dolphins, sealions and parrot shows which are entertaining for everyone. Aqualand Magaluf is perfect for anyone with its death-defying rides and excitement for those thrill seekers.

Palma
being only about 20 minutes away is ideal for those wanting to explore Majorca's culture and spen some money in the boutiques. There are plenty of shops, restaurants and bars so it's up to you whether you want to spend the day there or stay for a night out.

Culture

Majorca has a long running history but in recent years it has become a top tourist destination with people looking for
cheap holidays
in the Mediterranean sun. Even though there has been many purpose built resorts, the island has never lost it's originality and if you explore the island you will learn more about its fascinating history.
The nearest weekly market is at Andratx every Wednesday morning. There are special buses available from the resort if you want to hop on one to discover what this market has to offer. Make sure you try out some of the local cuisine at the restaurants on offer as there are some delicious meals available, all ranging in price.
