Being famously home to attractions such as Disney World and Universal Studios, Florida is all about fun in the sun. White sands, museums and a native population of alligators all make for a fun day out with the family, while there are also enough bars and nightclubs to keep you dancing all night long.

On the Beach Limited
















On the Beach act as an agent providing a web search interface between you and various third party suppliers of travel products (e.g. flight, hotel or transfer). For flights we act as your agent in processing your booking with the airline; we are not the airline’s agent. Each product you choose has its own price independent of other products booked at the same time and creates a separate contract between you and the supplier of that product.
