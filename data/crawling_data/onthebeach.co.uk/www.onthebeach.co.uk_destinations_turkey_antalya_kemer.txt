Kemer Weather

From summer temperatures of over 30° Celsius, to mild winters from 10 to 15° Celsius, prepare to tan during your Kemer holidays! The best time to visit Kemer is from early May to November, to be guaranteed those permanently clear blue skies and the sultry sea-breezes that stave off the humidity.
These temperatures are perfect for Kemer holidays on the beach, make sure you pack plenty of sun cream because you'll be needing it. A holiday in Kemer means you'll be going home with that healthy bronzed look!

Landscape

Even in the middle of Turkey's golden-sanded Riviera, Kemer stands out from other beaches for the unique way that the surrounding Taurus mountains meld seamlessly with the pine-covered landscape and beaches to form a stunning panorama. For sunset vistas that will have you reaching for your watercolours, scale the mountains by foot or jeep, or visit the unspoilt beauties of nearby Goynuk Canyon where you can even go for a swim in the clear spring waters.



Things To Do on Kemer Holidays

Being so close to Antalya, and well-connected by regular transport, that ancient city's mysteries are at your command here. You can visit Antalya Museum, Turkey's largest, with over 5,000 artefacts, artworks and sculptures. The classical tri-arched gate constructed by the Roman Emperor Hadrian likewise demands a look, as do the myriad ruins and statues that populate the city.
Keep an eye open also for the Yivli Minaret, the seven century old mosque tower which is the city's symbol and home to the Museum of Ethnography, where the relics of all Antalya's cultures are stored.

Culture

Kemer is well situated for exploring local life, the only problem is where to start! You could visit the marble temples protruding from the lush foliage of Olimpos, go on an excursion to the ancient city of Termessos, or experience the bustle and bartering of market life in Antalya. The village of Ulupinar provides you with the chance to sample local delicacies of trout, meat soups and salads.
If you don't want to travel much while on Kemer holidays, simply walk down the main street to visit the shops and haggle for silks at Kemer's own daily markets.

Nightlife

Quiet it may be, but that doesn't mean you'll be stuck for things to do at night on your holidays to Kemer. There are hundreds of bars, clubs and restaurants in Kemer, with everything from local folk music to cutting edge dance. Try the two Aura clubs for some upbeat dance, or one of the night-cafes for a more chilled atmosphere in which to watch the sun come up. Remember, you're also only fifteen minutes away from Antalya, with it's all-night clubs, twenty-four hour shops and a buzzing city vibe!
