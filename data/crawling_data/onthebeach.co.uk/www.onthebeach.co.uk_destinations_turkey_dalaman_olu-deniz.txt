Read more about Olu Deniz



Olu Deniz has everything you could want from holidays to Turkey: glorious beaches, breathtaking views, a vibrant nightlife and tons to see and do. You'd expect this from the most popular beach in Turkey, but Olu Deniz goes further, with it's sapphire shores constantly voted by tourists one of the world's most beautiful beaches.
One of the most famous and photographed spots in Olu Deniz is the Blue Lagoon. It's clear blue calm waters attract many sun worshipers and you might even be able to spot turtles swimming in the sea.

Olu Deniz is also one of the best and unrivalled sites in Europe for paragliding. Babadag also known as Father Mountain towers above Oludeniz and is the perfect launch spot for many sky sports enthusiasts. If its not your cup of tea, its amazing to watch as they slowly descent and land on the beach front.
There's nowhere else in Turkey with Olu Deniz's nightlife - from cocktail bars to music shacks, it's all here! World-famous DJs regularly play their latest offerings in clubs such as Crusoe's on the beach, and plenty of the cafes and eateries double as bars that open into the wee hours. For a bite, try Buzz on the beachfront for some grilled lamb washed down with some of the best shakes around!

Olu Deniz Weather

Olu Deniz has temperatures that make you green with envy: in the 30s° Celsius during summer and a respectable 10 to 15° Celsius even in December! For best tanning results, the skies are permanently clear from May till November, so leave your umbrella at home and rather than going green with envy, get bronzed up on holidays to Olu Deniz!

Landscape

When you see beach photographs in tourism pamphlets, chances are it's Olu Deniz - it's one of the world's most snapped beaches. The golden sands overlooking the pure waters are flanked by a beautiful blue lagoon on one side and sheltered by the pine-covered Babadag mountain. For some incredible views away from the beach itself, scale the mountain to reach the hilltop towns of Hisaronu and Ovacik, where you can sit amidst the forest and watch the sun's slow retreat. One thing is for certain; the photographs of your Olu Deniz holidays will be amazing!



Things To Do on Olu Deniz Holidays

There's so much to find on Olu Deniz holidays that you'll hardly have a chance to relax by that world-class beach: you can take a trip down the leafy Lycean Way to the Butterfly Valley to take in the colourful cascades of butterflies capering round the shoreline - a breathtaking sight. Feeling the heat? Then travel to the hidden gorge of Saklikent where huge geysers of cool water burst forth from the giant rocks.
For some culture, head to the ruins of the city of Lycia, complete with 3,000 year-old temples, or the museum at
Fethiye
, home to treasures from the Persian, Roman and even Iron Ages!

Culture

You're never far from local culture on holidays to Olu Deniz, with villages and seaside retreats proliferating around the light blue waters. Perhaps the best example of this is Kaya, the picturesque hamlet where farming families keep their horses and till the soil amid the ruins of ancient Greek homes. Visit the quiet town of Ovacik to sample rural delights such as kebabs and baked pide bread, with seafood fillings.
For a less rustic atmosphere, the local market at Hisaronu on Mondays is worth the bus-ride for the chance to barter away for hand-wrought carpets and satins.
