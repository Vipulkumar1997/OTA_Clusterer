Kusadasi Weather

The best time to visit Kusadasi is generally speaking between May and October to guarantee cloudless skies and constant sun. Summer temperatures here on the Aegean soar up to nearly 40° Celsius.
Winters, though wet on some days, still have a surprisingly clement warmth, between 10 and 15° Celsius on average. Tanning time!

Landscape

Kusadasi is home not only to outstanding ancient architecture, but also some of the most jaw-dropping vistas the Aegean can offer. The main City Beach is where most of the entertainment and watersports are, but just behind the Pigeon Island peninsula you'll find more secluded and beautiful beaches at Yilanciburnu and the 'Ladies Beach', secluded by pineland and overlooking the sapphire expanse of the Aegean.
At sunset, you should traverse at least some of the way to Selcuk, just for the gorgeous mountainside views it affords.



Things To Do on Kusadasi Holidays

The main attraction when you're here is the nearby ancient ruins of Ephesus. This archaeologist's dream is the most intact Roman City in the Mediterranean area, and arguably the prime tourist attraction in all of Turkey.
2,000 year old libraries and basilicas jostle for your attention alongside the remains of the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Don't forget the arched Gate of Augustus, truly a living relic of the once-mighty Roman Empire.

Culture

There are plenty of other ancient wonders here, not least the three cities of Priene, Miletus and Didyma. You can visit these cities on day trips from Kusadasi and explore a landscape littered with the remains of temples and columns. Visit the local tea houses here, or go across the man-made bridge to nearby Pigeon Island for some authentic Aegean seafood.
Kusadasi itself holds a Friday market with more exotic wares than you've ever seen - this is one of Turkey's biggest markets, so get ready to hone your haggling skills!

Nightlife

After a hard day's sunbathing or sightseeing, you can sample a few of the local drinks in numerous beach huts, clubs and bars here - all open late, with some forgetting to close! Inside the walls of Kaleici you'll find diverse bars playing anything from Turkish folk to funk, perfect for a good night on the tiles.
The two Bar Streets in the town centre are dotted with Turkish tavernas, Irish pubs and English-style bars that might as well be your local!



Book a Kusadasi Holiday now!

So why wait? Book now - you won't believe how easy it is! Kusadasi holidays offer you an unforgettable foray to a Turkish seaside haven with golden days and great nights, and On The Beach has unbelievable deals on flights and accommodation to get you here!
