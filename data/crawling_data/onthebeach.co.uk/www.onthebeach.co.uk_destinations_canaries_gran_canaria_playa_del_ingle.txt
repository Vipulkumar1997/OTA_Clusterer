Read more about Playa Del Ingles



Playa del Ingles holidays are all about days on the beach and nights on the town. In Gran Canaria's biggest and most famous resort, it's all about sun, sea and sangria.
The beach in Playa del Ingles melts into the famous
Maspalomas
sand dunes and runs for an amazing 3km. Dotted along the beach you’ll find a host of welcoming beach bars and restaurants that you can stop off and enjoy some local cuisine. If you’re wondering why the sand is so golden, it was transported from the Sahara Desert back in the 1960’s meaning the beach resort has a touch of this sandy paradise.
If you love dancing until the sun comes up, Playa del Ingles may just be the place for you. An ever-popular destination for the 18-30 and LGBT groups, there are numerous bars and nightclubs that are open until the early hours. Highlights include super-clubs Cream and Pacha as well as karaoke, discos and drag bars meaning that there is something for everyone.

Things To Do on Playa Del Ingles Holidays

First and foremost, there's the beach. 4km long, the fine white sands of Playa del Inglés join the equally gorgeous Playa de Maspalomas to form what is widely regarded as the most beautiful beach on the island. Watersports along this stretch of beach include parasailing, jet-skiing, waterskiing, and rides on speedboats and inflatables.
There are three great golf courses at Maspalomas. The long-established Campo de Golf de Maspalomas has hosted several international events and is surrounded by the famous Maspalomas sand dunes, which makes a round of golf here a really unique experience. Just outside Maspalomas, Salobre Golf is a new course, also boasting a superb setting among ravines and volcanic landscapes. Similarly, Meloneras Golf is new to the Gran Canaria golf world but is fast gaining a reputation as a fantastic course.
A camel trek is an absolutely fantastic way to see the magnificent Maspalomas sand dunes, particularly at sunset. Or for the thrill of a lifetime take a 20-minute flight over the Maspalomas dunes then sky dive (in tandem with an instructor!). Contact Skydive Gran Canaria (where the dunes begin).
Summer holidays in Playa del Ingles are a shopaholic's dream. From Playa del Ingles, it's a mere 25 minute drive to the capital, Las Palmas. Think boutiques and designer names, as well as all your high street favourites. Closer to home, Playa del Ingles is full of cheap and cheerful shops where you'll find all your holiday essentials. If it's a new pair of shades, a digital camera or some perfume you're after, head to the shopping centres Yumbo and the Kasbah (also the hottest nightspots in town).

Nightlife

As well as shops, Yumbo and the Kasbah are also bursting with restaurants, bars and clubs. If you're looking for Gran Canaria parties, travel to Playa del Ingles. We're talking neon lights, disco balls and happy hours. However, if you like your Gran Canaria holidays more low key, pull up a pew at one of the restaurants – this place is crammed full of them, from traditional tapas bars to all your favourite fast-food outlets.
For cheap holidays to sunnier shores, you can't go far wrong with Playa del Ingles. Whether you just want to flop on the beach or dance the night away, it ticks all the boxes - and then some.



Who goes to Playa Del Ingles?

The beaches in Playa del Ingles are a real cosmopolitan mix of German, French, Dutch, and Scandinavian tourists who arrive in droves, and with good reason! The beach at Playa del Ingles is not just for the English as the name would have it, but it is a world famous spectacle.
Playa del Ingles is popular with 18-30 age groups and the gay community, and the beach is very discreetly sectioned into family areas, nudist and gay sections so that everyone feels comfortable! Although very popular with younger crowds, it is possible to enjoy a family holiday here, as long as you know where to avoid and are staying in a family friendly hotel.
