Read more about Corfu



Corfu is the second largest and perhaps the most scenic of the Ionian Islands, Greece's 'emerald isle', with golden sands, green mountains and bright blue sea. Corfu holidays offer fantastic beach resorts, tranquil bays, traditional villages and many more attractions. Highlights include the charming Corfu Old Town, views from Mount Panokrator, and Palaiokastrista resort. There's something for everyone on holidays in Corfu, no matter what your age, taste or budget.
May to September is the most popular time for holidays to Greece, when the weather is hottest and ideal for the beaches and sea. Corfu is easily accessible from the UK, with many direct cheap flights to Corfu during summer. Good air and sea connections to the other Ionian Islands, and to the mainland, make Corfu a great base for exploring these enchanting and diverse lands. On the Beach has great offers on flights and accommodation in Corfu, making it easy for you to tailor-make your perfect Corfu holiday!
Corfu holidays offer an array of evening entertainment, from quiet restaurants to bars and nightclubs. Benitses has a busy nightlife, with bars and discos that stay open all night for young dancers. To the northwest of Corfu Town is the strip of Ethnikis Antistasis where you can find a number of fashionable bars and nightclubs.
Many tavernas offer 'Greek Nights', with food, drink and floor shows included in one price. The 'Taverna Tripa', located south of Corfu Town in the village of Kinopiastes, hosts enormous banquets accompanied by home made wine and Greek singing and dancing, an amazing culinary experience not to be missed!

Corfu Weather

Corfu enjoys a mild Mediterranean climate, but during the winter it can be surprisingly cold with wind and rain, and many hotels, restaurants, and some public transport close during these months. In April and May the temperatures rise, and the hillsides become covered with colourful wild flowers and greenery. Spring is a peaceful time before the crowds arrive, but it can be a touch chilly during the evening so bring a jumper.
Corfu's high season is from June to September when it gets really hot and some resorts get very busy. Temperatures soar to 40°C, but there's always the chance to cool off in the sea!

Landscape

Corfu boasts a stunning coastline with bustling beach resorts and peaceful coves. The southern resort of Benitses is very popular with young tourists and offers every water sport imaginable. Quieter spots can be found, such as Myrtiotissa, often described as the world's most beautiful beach. The Korision Lagoon is a stretch of water separated from the sea by rolling dunes and delightful shoreline, a haven for Corfu's natural wildlife.
The family-friendly resort of
Paleokastrita
offers water sports, activities and ancient buildings. Travellers are drawn to the coast at Sidari by its curious rock formations rising from the blue sea. Kassiopi Bay is one of the island's most popular holiday spots with a beach and quayside that remain unspoilt despite the number of visitors.
Corfu's inland landscape is dominated by Mount Pantokraktor. The mountain's green slopes rise steeply away from the sea to its peak, where a small monastery can be found. Travellers venturing this far will be rewarded with breathtaking views; on a clear day Albania and Italy can be seen.



Things To Do on Corfu Holidays

If you are planning holidays in Corfu you'll be delighted to know that there is something for everyone; from chilled out beaches to bustling shopping districts.
Corfu Town
, Kerkyra to the locals, is a captivating blend of European influences. Spend your Corfu holiday wandering through Venetian-style alleyways, drink coffee at a cafe in the Parisian-style Liston Arcade, or watch a match at the British-built cricket ground. The Palace of St Michael and St George was once home to Greek royalty, and today houses a museum. Other interesting sites in the town include the Municipal Art Gallery, Archaeological Museum and distinctive Agios Spyridon church.
In the south is the 13th Century Gardiki Castle, and fortresses from the same era can be explored at Angelokasrto and Palaiokastrista. A glimpse of traditional Greek life can be seen at the charming hill village of Vatos in the west. A great day trip destination is the historic Achellieon Palace and gardens. The Austrian Empress Elisabeth of Bavaria built the palace in the late 19th Century.
Naturally the sea and sand are big attractions: visitors can take boat trips to explore the crystal clear sea and dazzling coast, enjoy a multitude of water sports, or simply relax in the sun on the beaches of
Dassia
or
Perama
.

Culture

The island is steeped in history and often features in Greek Mythology. Corinthians colonised the island in the 8th Century BC, and during the Roman era it became established as a holiday destination. Corfu was then ruled by a succession of empires: Byzantine; Venetian; French; British during the 19th Century, and finally became part of Greece in 1864. The architectural mixture of Corfu Town is evidence of this colourful past. The island was occupied by Italy during WW2, but since peace returned became one of Europe's favourite holiday spots.
Corfu Town is home to traditional marching bands, Philarmonikes, who play regular weekend promenade performances during the summer, and during Holy Week. Over the Easter weekend bands lead processions through the town, culminating in the spectacular ritual of smashing large pots on the streets in anticipation of Jesus' return. The town's Venetian-style Ta Karnavalia during the February carnival season is a highlight, always ending with dancing and partying.
Throughout the summer most of Corfu's villages hold local festivals - paniyiris. The village of Loustri has an annual pie festival on September 1st, well worth visiting to sample the local food. Corfu's cuisine is influenced by its multicultural past, and visiting meat eaters should try sofrito (meat, garlic, vinegar and parsley), pastitsada (beef and macaroni in red sauce) and bourdeto (spicy fish casserole). Vegetarians are catered for with a range of speciality mezedes. You'll certainly never go hungry on holiday in Corfu!
