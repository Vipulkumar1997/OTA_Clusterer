Landscape

Marbella, thanks to the renewed enthusiasm for landscaping by controversial former mayor Jesus Gil, enjoys a particularly well-designed landscape, with gently sloping hills rolling lazily down towards the pristine beaches. Palm trees line many of the roads, and rolling mountains can be seen from many points in the city. The marina and the hundreds of luxury yachts moored there are a highlight of any holiday in Marbella!



Things To Do on Marbella Holidays

Marbella sits on sixteen miles of pristine coastline, with many exciting activities and watersports to while away the days. Perhaps one of the most charming areas of the city is the Avenida del Mar, offering a variety of tourist-friendly cuisine and bars without seeming overwhelming – authenticity is very much on the menu. There is also a wealth of cultural attractions and world-class shopping Marbella such as art galleries located around the bustling La Plaza de los Navajos.
For something a little more exciting, there are many theme parks in the area, including Camelot Park and Funny Beach, offering mini-motorbikes, trampolining and water skiing. Holdiays to Marbella are packed full of entertainment with something for everyone!

Culture

In spite of its glamorous image, Marbella retains a strong sense of Spanish authenticity in many of its cobbled backstreets and small family-owned bistros – one of which gently cures its Serrano ham with tobacco smoke! Art produced by local artists is available from several small galleries in the area, and traditional horse and carriage rides through the classy La Alameda Park.



Book a Marbella Holiday now!

Nowhere does glamour on the Costa del Sol like Marbella. A delightful combination of cosmopolitan and tradition, Marbella holidays offer an alternative to the typical perception of Spain by offering local charm in a luxurious setting.
On the Beach has amazing offers on flights and accommodation, so book now to sample a taste of the high life in the glitz and glamour of stunning Marbella!
