Read more about Alcudia



If you're after the perfect family holiday in the Balearics, Alcudia could be the answer. Situated on the north coast of Majorca, 62km north of the capital Palma, Alcudia is a firm favourite with holidaymakers who are not looking for a loud resort. As well as the resort being perfect for those with families, flights to Majorca are are around 2 hours, so the kids won't be bored on the plane for long!
Calm, protected beaches, like the long expanse of sand at Playa de Muro, are perfect for splashing and sandcastle building, whilst historical ruins and quaint markets will suit those wanting to explore the area.

Who goes to Alcudia?

Families, mainly. But it's great for couples, too. Alcudia and Playa de Muro are very family-oriented, but it is not as if there are not plenty of attractions for different kinds of groups and ages. For example, in the Bellevue area you'll find music bars and clubs for a younger crowd. It's not Magaluf, but it still has plenty going for it.

Alcudia Weather

No need for warm clothes on holidays in Alcudia! In the summer you can expect hot, dry weather with temperatures regularly reaching 30Ã‚Â° Celsius and above. The delightful sea breeze will keep hot days from becoming unpleasant so that when you are relaxing on the beach all you need is sun cream and a cool drink and you're good to go.
If you're not too fond of the sun, you would be best visiting Alcudia in the winter months as it is quite mild. However, you should be aware that Majorca does experience some irregular rainfall in the winter period.

Landscape

Boasting one of the longest beaches in Majorca, Alcudia's bay makes this a perfect resort for families because of its fine, clean sand. The surrounding landscape is really impressive, with magnificent mountains which hiking enthusiasts will love to explore and beach bound visitors can enjoy as a beautiful backdrop. The beautiful Sa Talaia d'Alcudia offers impressive views of the bay.



Things To Do on Alcudia Holidays

Those wanting to explore the local culture while on holiday in Alcudia may want to start off by visiting the old town of Alcudia, to look at the impressive city walls and gain insight to this old culture. There is a 2 hour guided walking tour available for those that want to fully appreciate the old town. One of Alcudia's main attractions is the port area and to the west of the island you will find Porte D'Alcudia which is the old fishing village at the end of the beach. Why not pull up a chair at one of the seaside restaurants and try one of the delicious daily catches.

Shop-a-holic's on Alcudia holidays will enjoy the number of shops and boutiques available but the market held on Tuesday and Sunday mornings is definitely worth a visit. For the kids, Alcudia Hidropark will make an enjoyable day out with a number of slides and flumes and also a large wave pool. After they have dried off, they can participate in some karting or maybe slow down on a number of boat trips available. There are also many excusions available if you want to head out of Alcudia itself.

Boasting one of the longest beaches in Majorca, Alcudia's bay makes this a perfect resort with families because of it's fine, clean sand. There are plenty of cafes around the beach if you need a cool down or for those wanting a more active holiday, there are a number of water sports available. If that is not enough, why not climb Sa Talaia d'Alcudia which gives you impressive views of the bay.

Culture

Alcudia has an impressive history as it was the Phoenicians and Greeks who first settled here but then it was the Romans who made it the capital in the 2nd Century. The old town emphasises this history with stunning scenery which is far away from the modern aspects of the resort. Tourism has of course been highly influential but the resort has managed to keep it's authencity even though it is a popular tourist destination.

There are many festival days which take place over the year in Alcudia and nearby Puerto Pollensa so check to see what is on before you go if you want to indulge in the local culture. If you are coming on holidays to Alcudia in July you can enjoy the Fest de Sant Jaume, where Caixers go through the streets on horseback wearing traditional costumes.
August sees the festival of Chinese lanterns where the youngest in the town go through the streets singing old Majorcan songs whilst carrying the lanterns.

Nightlife

There are a number of bars and restaurants on offer but this resort is mainly for those wanting a quiet and relaxing holiday in Alcudia. Have a meal at one of the finest restaurants serving local cuisine whilst watching the sun go down by the port or head to one of the fast food restaurants, then have a dance at a local disco.
Evening entertainment is mainly hotel based but there are a number of bars and nightclubs for those not wanting to go to bed early. There is something for everyone in Alcudia, although if it is a night of clubbing that you want then you should head to Magalluf or Santa Ponsa where the parties start late and last through the night!

Relaxation

A big part of Alcudia is the beaches. Alcudia's main beach is one of the finest on the island, and certainly the longest, stretching for 9 - 10 kilometres from the marina in Puerto Alcudia to Playa de Muro and Ca'n Picafort. If all you're interested in is lounging on the beach in the sun, Alcudia is for you. As well as the main beach, there are a dozen other fabulous stretches of sand to recline on and soak up the sun. Most hotels have swimming pools, too, if lounging by the pool with a cocktail is more your thing. Shopaholics will love the shops and boutiques, and the market held on Tuesday and Sunday mornings is definitely worth a visit. For the kids, Alcudia Hidropark will make an enjoyable day out with a number of slides and flumes and even a large wave pool. After they have dried off, they can participate in some go-karting or maybe cool down on a number of boat trips available. There are also many excursions available if you want to head out of Alcudia itself.
