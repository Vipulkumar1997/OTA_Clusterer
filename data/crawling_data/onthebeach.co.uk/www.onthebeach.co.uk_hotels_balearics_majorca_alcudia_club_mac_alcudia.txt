Overview

Hotels Jupiter, Saturno and Marte are part of the Club Mac Complex, which is situated in a quiet district of Alcudia, on the northern coast of Majorca. Surrounded by lovely gardens, the complex lies roughly one and half kilometres from Alcudia Beach and is located on a hill between two picturesque bays, allowing guests to admire the landscape and wonderful views from any part of the complex. Waterpark access is now included in all bookings to the Club Mac.

The hotel is located 1.5km from the beach.

Distance from Airport

The hotel is located 65km from Palma Airport.

Rooms

Guest rooms are comfortably furnished and come well equipped with great amenities and features, including a private bathroom and delightful balcony. Available are two queen-size beds which are shared by occupants, or queen beds and bunk beds (on request) for children. Facilities include a TV, air conditioning, a private bathroom with bath or shower, a private balcony or terrace and a safety deposit box.

Food & Drink

Foodies will love the rich and varied buffets on offer at Jupiter, Saturno and Marte.

Sports & Entertainment

This hotel is an ideal choice for families thanks to the countless activities and facilities on site and in the surrounding area, including a stunning beach just 1km away and seven swimming pools for adults and children. We wouldn't recommend this hotel to couples or young singles as it is aimed mainly at families.

The Club Mac Complex additionally offers a leisure lake, as well as a Children's Village, kids club, and three childrenâ€™s pools for younger guests. Water sports, a regular courtesy bus service to the beach, a sports area, a five -a-side football pitch, a tennis court, table tennis, volleyball, mini golf, keep-fit classes and pool tables are also on-site (at a local charge).
