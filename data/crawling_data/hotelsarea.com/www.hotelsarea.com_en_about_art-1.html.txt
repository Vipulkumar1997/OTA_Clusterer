The HotelsArea.com booking network serves online bookings to thousands of establishments worldwide and over 750,000 visitors every month.

Our range of bookable accommodation goes from cheap hostels to luxury hotels, from apartments to campsites, and we have dedicated web sites for each and every category of accommodation we're selling. If you own or manage a hotel, a hostel, a guest house, etc., all you need to do to join this network and start receiving bookings for your structure is to fill in a simple form you can find by clicking on the button at the bottom of the page.

Our staff will contact you and instruct you on the simple procedures required to enter your Back Office interface,  insert the rooms you want to allocate with us, the prices for each bed and availability, and insert detailed information fields about your structure including pictures, facilities and more.

Once this information has been entered, your establishment will be featured on our site, plus over 200 affiliate sites and you will start receiving bookings from new customers from all over the world. All you will need to do then is to regularly check your e-mail account and wait for the arrival of your newly acquired customers!!
