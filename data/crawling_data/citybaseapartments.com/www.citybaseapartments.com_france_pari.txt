Serviced Apartments in Paris



Experience what life is like in one of the most romantic cities in the world and live like a native Parisian in one of our Paris city apartments. Fall in love with all that a serviced apartment has to offer and stay in specially selected locations throughout the city.
You don’t have to stay in a five star hotel to indulge in this beautiful city. Choose your own private apartment instead and enjoy the freedom of home cooked meals and home-like privacy. Staying in an apartment in Paris can allow you a unique opportunity for a completely private, romantic dinner for two or if you’re travelling solo you can choose to eat in the comfort of your own kitchen, without having to request a table for one in France’s city of love.
New to Serviced Apartments?
Serviced Apartments are an ideal mid-way point between hotels and longer contractual rentals. So if you’re only in the city for one or two nights, you can still enjoy all of the benefits of an apartment as somebody stopping for a few months. Each apartment comes fully furnished and with a well equipped kitchen and choice of bedrooms. Unlike staying in a hotel, where you may be confined to just the one room, with an apartment you get extra living space, to relax or entertain.
As well as offering more space, serviced apartments also have the same benefits of maid and linen services like a hotel. Concierge service and 24 hr receptions are also available in some apartments.
