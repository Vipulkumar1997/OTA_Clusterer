Staying for a while

“We live permanently in Abu Dhabi but frequently travel back to the 
                                UK for the summer, Christmas and school holidays. Calling on the 
                                hospitality of friends and family is great, but always carries 
                                the worry of overstaying our welcome, so apartments are a 
                                perfect option for us to arrive en masse and just make ourselves 
                                at home for a few weeks.”
