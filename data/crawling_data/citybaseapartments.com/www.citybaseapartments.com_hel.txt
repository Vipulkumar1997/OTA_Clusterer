How we can help







showing questions for:
Accommodation ratings and facilities







question:
Stay with confidence: The Association of Serviced Apartment Providers (ASAP) Quality Assessment



Answer:

The ASAP Quality Accreditation programme, which was first
launched in 2014, is the leading global quality assessment, reporting,
recognition and accreditation system for the serviced apartment, corporate housing
and executive suites sectors of the hospitality industry.

The ASAP seal of approval confirms that the serviced
apartment operator in question has been 'quality accredited' by the ASAP and,
as such, meets all the core compliance of legal, health & safety
requirements and good standard necessary for an accreditation.






question:
What can I expect in my apartment?



Answer:

One of the great things about our collection of apartments is the huge range of choice on offer.
Apartments vary in size, facilities and quality; from great value family studios, through to deluxe penthouses.
Generally, all apartments have a kitchen. In the case of smaller properties and studios, this is referred to as a kitchenette, as it is not fully equipped, but will still have the necessary facilities to prepare meals.
All of our apartments have living areas, either with separate bedrooms or self-contained in a studio.
Maid service varies in frequency, from daily to weekly, and includes a bed linen and towel change along with other housekeeping duties.
Many apartments have a reception or concierge for your convenience and security, but some are unmanned and will offer a meet and greet or key collection service, so it feels more like living in an apartment building rather than a hotel.
There is something to suit everyone - and every budget. Why not browse our website or give us a call, tell us what you're after and we’ll find some great options for you.






question:
What does your apartment rating mean?



Answer:

Citybase awards each apartment a rating score of between 3 and 5 stars to reflect the amenities, facilities and services available at that particular property.
We have outlined below the basis of these ratings to show what you might typically expect at each level.
Each apartment's webpage includes a full list of the specific facilities and services they offer, but if you have any queries about what's in your apartment, call us on +44 (0)20 8090 8080
***
Three star apartments offer a good basic standard of accommodation. Sometimes, they will include a kitchenette rather than a full kitchen and there may be no reception. Maid service is generally provided weekly - perfect if you are seeking privacy, peace and quiet.
These properties are often in very convenient locations, offer great value for money and are ideal for travellers on a budget or in groups.
****
A four star apartment offers a broader range of services, including reception and concierge support (during advertised hours), maid service ( twice weekly) and a linen change (weekly).
The apartments have a wider range of amenities such as full kitchens, access to laundry facilities (either within the apartment or in a central laundry room) and more entertainment options than a three star apartment.
These apartments balance luxury and economy to provide a standard which is ideal for both business and leisure guests.
*****
The best apartments available, with the greatest range of facilities and services.
They usually boast a 24hour reception/concierge, maid service at least 5 times per week, linen change twice or more per week, and dry cleaning/laundry services.
Five star apartments usually include full kitchens with dishwashers, laundry facilities (or a complimentary laundry service), queen or king sized beds, en-suite bathrooms with complimentary bathroom products, internet access and a larger range of entertainment options. For instance, you may have televisions in the bedrooms as well as the living area, and the building itself might have communal facilities, such as a gym, a spa or a garden.






question:
What is a serviced apartment?



Answer:

A serviced apartment is a self-contained apartment that typically includes a living area, bedroom, bathroom and kitchen. The apartments are 'serviced' because they are managed, maintained and cleaned for you, in a similar way to a hotel room.
Apartments can be booked quickly and easily, just as you'd book a hotel.






question:
Why should I book an apartment instead of a hotel?



Answer:

There are many benefits to staying in a serviced apartment over a hotel - more space, better value, freedom to prepare meals and a more homely and comfortable environment. Our 'Why Book a Serviced Apartment' page gives more details on the many benefits. Alternatively, you can also talk to one of our specialists on +44 (0)1524 544 244 who are always happy to talk about apartments.






question:
Why should I choose a Citybase apartment?



Answer:

One of the best things about choosing a Citybase apartment is the huge range we can offer - from great value budget options to luxury pads for special occasions, and everything in between.
Before a property is added to the Citybase portfolio, each individual set of apartments and the operator has to undergo a thorough review process from our Partner Relationships team.
All of the apartments we provide must have their ownbathroom and kitchen or kitchenette facilities. It must also be 'serviced', which means regular cleaning and linen changes.
We do not receive a fee from operators to join our portfolio, and if we feel they aren’t reliable or meeting our high standards of service, then we will not work with them.
We also think it's really important to be able to personally recommend our apartments.
We live and breathe apartments and can source and offer apartments from the largest portfolio in the world. Wherever possible, we visit, view, assess and grade every property we offer to our customers..
Our people stay in them. A lot.
So, when you ask us a question, we aren't just looking at a screen; chances are someone in our team has visited or stayed there.
With us, you always know what you're booking and, unlike other online booking agents, we are at the end of the phone, should you need any assistance.

question:
How do I amend / cancel my reservation?



Answer:

Like many hotels, all the apartments featured on the website have a cancellation policy.
This can be seen on the apartment's detail page by clicking the question mark next to the rate type once you have enquired about particular dates, and also on the booking confirmation email that we send to you.

question:
How do I pay for the booking?

Most of our apartments can be booked in exactly the same way as a hotel room. When you book, we will take payment from your credit card to secure the booking. You can give us your  details over the phone, online (through our website), or via the payment link we send.
If you decide to cancel your booking, that’s fine, just let us know and you’ll receive your money back.

question:
What happens when I arrive at the apartment?



Answer:

Depending on when and how you plan to check in, different apartments have different check-in procedures.
Manned reception: most apartments have a manned reception desk, like a hotel, where you can pick up your key. Many of these are 24-hour, perfect if you are arriving late in the evening or very early.
Meet-and-greet service: In some cases, the apartment will arrange to provide entry, show you in and answer any questions on arrival. You will need to tell the property when you are checking in so they can meet and greet you.
Private access: some apartments have a system where you'll be given an entry code to get into the building or a safe in which you'll find the keys to your apartment. This is a perfect solution for guests seeking complete privacy.
Contact us to discuss the options available.






question:
What is VAT?



Answer:

VAT stands for Value Added Tax, which is currently 20%,and
applicable to all stays of up to 28 days.
Citybase Apartments rates all include VAT, unless otherwise
stated. This means that the rate you see on the website is the total price for
the apartment - no other taxes will be added to your bill.

If you have a budget in mind, let us know, and we will do
our best to meet it.






question:
When will my credit card be charged?



Answer:

This depends upon the particular apartment and the rate that you have chosen to book. You can find this information within the page of each apartment by clicking on the question mark next to the rate type once you have entered your dates. But if you have any questions, please get in touch and we can help you navigate the whole process.
