Perfect Accommodation for Getting Away











Why Are Serviced Apartments Perfect for Getting Away?

Whether it’s a planned renovation, or an unforeseen event such as 
                                    fire or flooding, sometimes you have no choice but to move away 
                                    from home for an extended period of time. A serviced apartment 
                                    is the ideal temporary accommodation solution that allows you 
                                    to live like you would at home.

Temporary accommodation for a family of four

“While our house was being renovated after a flood, 
                                it was uninhabitable for four months and the disruption to building work 
                                caused more delays. No-one would let us a house on a short or rolling lease, 
                                and we were faced with living in a hotel room with two young children. 
                                Citybase found us a perfect two bedroom apartment within our insurers’ 
                                budget and everything was taken care of.”
