Serviced Apartments in Edinburgh



About our Serviced Apartments in Edinburgh
A beautiful city, Edinburgh deserves to be experienced to the full, so why not stay in a serviced apartment from Citybase Apartments? As the capital city of Scotland, Edinburgh is steeped in history and brimming with culture. Experience the buzz for yourself in your very own Edinburgh apartment.
Our collection of apartments in Edinburgh boast excellent central locations, close to the many attractions and sights that the city has to offer. With apartments along the stretch of the Royal Mile, many more out towards New Town in the west of the city, and some even reaching out toward the coast to the East, we've got all sides of the city covered.
Enjoy a unique perspective on the city with a fully serviced apartment to call your own and act as your own city base. Convenient as a hotel, but with the added touches and extra comfort of home.
New to serviced apartments?
Born from a need to provide more space and a home from home feel to guests than what a hotel could provide, serviced apartments have become vastly popular in recent years. They are particularly useful for families and business travellers, who need more than being cramped in one room, and enjoy the handiness of a cleaning or linen service. Apartments can be suitably more comfortable for longer stays but are also available for short trips. Your own kitchen facilities allows you the freedom to cook and eat what you want, meaning you don't have to rely on a hotel restaurant.
