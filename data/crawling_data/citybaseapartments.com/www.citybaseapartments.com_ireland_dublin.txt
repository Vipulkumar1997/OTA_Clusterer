Serviced Apartments in Dublin



Dublin’s famous warm welcome extends further in the form of serviced apartments, located and ready to welcome you to destinations all over the city. We have picked a great selection of apartments in Dublin based on their quality interiors, ideal city centre locations and excellent self-catering facilities.
If you’re visiting to sample some of Dublin’s vibrant nightlife, choose a serviced apartment so that you can come and go as you please, and cook your own ‘day after the night before’ big breakfast at whatever time you choose to resurface.
Alternatively, if you’re visiting to enjoy Dublin’s many popular attractions and famous sights with the family, enjoy a hearty home cooked dinner after a long day, and curl up on the sofas as a family and recount the day’s best bits. Pack the kids off to bed and enjoy relaxing adult time in your own separate room.
New to Serviced Apartments?
Hotels or city centre B&Bs may seem like an obvious choice when booking your accommodation in Dublin, but have you considered serviced apartments as a spacious alternative? Like hotels, serviced apartments offer a place to sleep in the city. But they also offer so much more – in a serviced apartment you can cook your own meals in your own fully-equipped kitchen, relax in a separate living area or lounge, and larger groups can enjoy added privacy with separate bedrooms, some even with en-suite facilities.
Like hotels, serviced apartments also benefit from regular maid and linen services, and many have their own reception and concierge.
