Serviced Apartments in London



Make the most of your visit to London with more space, more freedom and more choice from your London accommodation. We’ve handpicked the very best range of serviced apartments in the city, so you can live your way, enjoy your trip at your own pace and experience local life in London.
Multicultural, vibrant, diverse and dynamic, London has a lot to offer its visitors and there is no better way to enjoy it than living like a local.
Taste the world at one of London’s many international restaurants or find a new favourite cocktail in one of its hidden bars. Shop the local markets or spoil yourself with high-street and designer fashion. Visit world-famous sights and soak up some culture visiting London’s theatres, art galleries, museums and historical sights. Take a stroll in one of the eight Royal Parks and watch the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace. There is something for everyone in London.
Why should I visit London?
When it comes to travelling and tourism, London needs no introduction. After all, it’s one of the most visited cities in the world. Its icons – black taxi cabs, red post boxes, double-decker buses, red telephone boxes and the Queen’s Guard soldiers – are known around the globe.
With great transport links from the whole of the UK and Europe, and serviced by five major airports as well as major motorways, getting to the British capital couldn’t be easier. And once you are here, the choice of restaurants, sights to see and things to do is just incredible.
Getting around the city is also extremely easy thanks to the London Underground and an amazing system of buses, trains, walking routes and black cabs.
Major attractions & sightseeing
Where do we start? There are just so many. Snap a picture in front of Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Make a wish in one of the fountains in Trafalgar Square. Sing along to one of London’s musicals. Explore another world at the London Aquarium or the Science Museum London. Taste another culture in London’s Chinatown. Learn about the Great Fire of London and the city’s history at the Museum of London or the London Dungeon. Take a selfie with a celebrity at Madame Tussauds. And of course, no trip to London would be complete without a little taste of Royalty at Buckingham Palace or one of the Royal residences dotted around the city.
There is just so much to do in London, you will be spoiled for choice.
When should I visit London?
London is beautiful all year round, transforming and reinventing itself with every season. From stunning romantic gardens and hanging flower baskets in spring to the dramatic shower of gold and red leaves in the autumn. From pop-up and rooftop bars in the summer to Christmas markets and comforting menus in the winter.
The truth is that it doesn’t really matter when you visit London. There will always be something amazing to see and do.
Places to eat in London
Whether you’re are a vegan or meat eater, like earthy street food or love experimenting with new cuisines, you will find a place to please your taste buds in London.
But if international restaurants, gastro pubs and artisan food aren’t enough, don’t worry. You can dine inside transparent igloos, or at the top of the Shard with exquisite panoramic views of the city or inside a rain forest, all right here in the city. You can even have a tech meal with interactive or 3D tables or dine in complete darkness! Whatever you want to taste, you will find it in London.
And if you are staying a while, international guests will not be homesick. London also benefits from a wealth of international supermarkets and speciality grocery stores, so you can get a taste of home, even when you are miles away.
New to serviced apartments?
What makes a serviced apartment so great? Space. With serviced apartments you get all the great things about a hotel: unbeatable locations & high quality accommodation. But with the added benefit of a separate living area and a fully equipped kitchen or kitchenette. You can enjoy your own meals at times convenient to you, and separate living and dining areas mean you can comfortably relax or entertain in. Perfect for families, groups and couples travelling together or if you are staying for an extended period of time.
