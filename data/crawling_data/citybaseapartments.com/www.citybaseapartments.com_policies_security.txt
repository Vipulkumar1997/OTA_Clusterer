Security Policy

At Citybase Apartments we take our responsibilities very seriously and make the confidentiality of your data our
       highest priority. So, in order to protect and safeguard the private information you provide we implement secure
       systems, procedures and protocols to restrict access to your information and keep your details safe.

Our booking forms are hosted on a secure server from where your booking and card details are sent to us using
       industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology.

The padlock on the booking form and the change of the URL from
http://
to
https://
ensure the page is secure and your data is being sent to the correct location securely.

When you submit your card details the information is encrypted (scrambled) so that it can only be read by the
       secure
       server, making the transaction as secure as possible.

If you are still unsure about our security policy or have any questions please call us on
       +44 (0)20 8090 8080 or
       email us at
stay@citybaseapartments.com
