Whether you’re looking for hostels in Barcelona near the city centre or by one of the city’s beaches, we’ve got loads to choose from. The September Festes de la Mercè runs for a couple of days in the build-up to Sept 24th (the Catholic feast day of Our Lady of Mercy) and is filled with parades, human towers and papier mache giant figures - plus a dance called the Sardana. It's a wild ride, don't miss it! Be sure to book your accommodation near main street La Rambla to get in on the action. Just think; if you book your Barcelona youth hostel today, tomorrow you could be sunning yourself on Barceloneta Beach, wandering round the Barrio Gothic or picnicking in Park Guell. You can spend some time in Barcelona before or the Benicassim festival in July and get some extra suntan time, too!
