About Hostel the Globe Center

Hotel The Globe is located close to the Red Light District and overlooks two of the most famous historic canals in “de Wallen”, the oldest part of the Amsterdam city. It is only 3 minute walk from Centraal Station, and less than 10 minutes walk from all of the major tourist attraction points, such as Dam Square, Flower Market, Shopping Streets, Rembrandt Square, Red Light District, and various Coffee Shops in the Centrum area. However, the Globe enjoys its quiet and easy neighborhood while it is situated some distance away from the major tourist traffic.

The hotel has 20 clean and pleasant private rooms, and each has its own en-suite bathroom and shower room. It has triple, quadruple, and up to 8 beds group en-suite available. Besides, we have the largest collection of shared dorms here in Amsterdam. We have dorms from 4 persons up to 10 persons!! Linens are available on all beds, but free towels (with limited numbers) are distributed upon request at reception. We also have free wireless connection available in the lobby area.

For group booking with more than 20 persons,we will have to charge total amount of the first night's accommodation.

The Globe is also best known for its sports bar, which is the biggest in the Red Light District and is open up to 3 o'clock in the morning (or 5 am in the weekend,only for hotel guest)!! You can view all major sport events (like the Premier League, European League, Super Bowl, N.F.L., N.B.A., & etc.) on 9 TV’s and 2 big screens. There are also two pool tables and one darts board for any exciting moments. In the bar, not only English or American breakfast is served, but also delicious lunch or dinner for you to order.  Hostel guests get a 20% discount on the food menu upon presentation of the hostel entre card. Also, there are Happy Hours running Sunday to Thursday in the bar - you and your friends can enjoy our offer of buying one Heineken draft and getting another one free during these happy hours!

Amsterdam is such a great place to have fun!! So, on behalf of our friendly staff, we hope to welcome you at our hotel!! We will do our best to make your stay a unique and pleasant one!
