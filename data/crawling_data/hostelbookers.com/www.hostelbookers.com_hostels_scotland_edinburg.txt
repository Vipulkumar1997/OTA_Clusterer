Be sure to book your cheap Edinburgh accommodation early for The Edinburgh Fringe Festival, also known as the world’s largest arts festival. Crowds from around the world flock to the city for The Fringe in August, but other fun summer events like the International Film Festival, the Art Festival and the Jazz & Blues Festival take place from June onwards. Book worms won’t want to miss the Edinburgh International Book Festival in August with over 700 world-class writers and thinkers taking part in more than 800 events. But this fun and friendly city is worth a visit all year round with attractions such as the Edinburgh Castle, Princes Street and the spectacular views of the city from Arthur's Seat.
