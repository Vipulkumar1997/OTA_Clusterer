New York City comes alive in the summer months, with plenty to see and do around all five boroughs. Visitors can save their precious pennies in June with free events like the Coney Island Mermaid Parade (the largest art parade in the world) and the Museum Mile Festival, when ten of NYC’s finest institutions along Fifth Avenue open their doors for an evening extravaganza. If that’s not enough culture for you, then book a cheap hostel near Central Park in July for Shakespeare in the Park or the Philharmonic’s free summer outdoor concert series. New York City boasts some of the finest restaurants in the world, so make sure you’ve booked your New York accommodation early for Restaurant Week in July.
