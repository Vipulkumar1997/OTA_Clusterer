Looking for a Sydney backpacker’s hostel? Film lovers should check out the 60th Sydney Film Festival in June to catch some of the greatest features, documentaries, short films, and animations from across Australia and around the world. In August sports fans can participate in The Sun-Herald City2Surf run or book cheap accommodation near the ANZ Stadium to cheer on from the sides at the Bledisloe Cup when the Qantas Wallabies take on world champions New Zealand. But if you’d rather just sit back and relax, then book a hostel near one of Sydney’s legendary beaches, like Bondi Beach, to catch some waves and enjoy the sun.
