About Clink78

Clink78 combines a 200 year history with cool interior design and modern facilities, all in the heart of King’s Cross. Stay in a former courthouse where Charles Dickens worked and The Clash stood trial.

The hostel is equipped with a good range of facilities including a modern self-catering kitchen, a fun bar, a games area, an internet room, a TV lounge, and a TravelSHOP where guests can buy tickets for London attractions and a laundry room.

The Clink78 reception is manned 24/7 by friendly multi-lingual staff, with night security
from 9pm. There’s no curfew, but guests need their key card to gain access to the
hostel and your room.

Clink78 offers a mixture of private rooms and dorms, many of which have en suite bathrooms.

Freebies bed linen, a luggage room, a london walking tour, a London map and free Wi-Fi in communal areas. The

ClashBAR (open from 7pm until late every night) brings guests 7-nights-a-week of entertainment. It's great value and the perfect place to meet people, sample cool cocktails, play games and dance the night away.

PLEASE NOTE: If you wish to cancel or amend your reservation and avoid full charges for your booking, please ensure you notify us by email as soon as possible and at least 48 hours prior 14.30 of your arrival date notice. Passed this time, I am afraid full charges will incur.

Towels are included in private rooms and are available at a small cost for others.
