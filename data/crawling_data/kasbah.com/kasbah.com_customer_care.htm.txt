Making a Reservation





How do I reserve my room?
Our reservation process is very simple. Select or enter the desired city, enter the dates of arrival and departure, and enter the number of guests. Click the
Search Available Hotels
(for only hotels which have vacancies),
Search for Vacation Rentals
or the
Browse All Hotels
(all hotels in a city regardless of vacancy) button. You could also search by a specific hotel name within a city.

A list of hotels or vacation rentals will appear on the screen. For more information, click the name of the property or the
Info
link.

After room types and rates are returned to your screen, you will be able to choose the rate you desire by reading the room information in the center of the screen, then clicking on the
Book It
button on the right side of the screen.

After you have selected your desired room type, you will be taken to a "Secure Reservation Request" form. Then you will need to review the "Reservation Information" and fill in the blanks on the "Guest Information" section. Be sure your name and email address are spelled correctly.

After you fill out all of the needed information, press the "Submit Reservation" button.
If further correspondence is necessary prior to confirming the reservation, a Customer Care agent will reply back to you with an email within 24 hours.


Top

Is it safe to use my credit card?
Yes. We take this matter very seriously. To ensure your security, Interactive Affiliate Network utilizes a secure commerce server, which encrypts the credit card number and encodes it into a non-usable form.
Top

What credit card types are accepted for guarantee/deposit?
The card types accepted for guarantee/deposit will be listed in the Info section of the hotel description.
Top

My credit card number is correct, but the hotel is not accepting it. Why?
There are a few possibilities:

Your card type is not accepted at the hotel.

The card expiration date precedes the reservation date.

You have reached your credit limit.

There is a computer error.


Top

Can I specify where I would like my room located (preferred floor, next to pool, etc.)?
If special requests are accepted by the lodging, a section will appear on the Reservation Form to insert such requests and submit them to the hotel. The hotel staff will do their best to accommodate special requests. We cannot guarantee that your requests will be granted because they are subject to availability.
Top

Is the room rate per person or per night?
All rates are for double occupancy per room, and are quoted on a nightly basis unless otherwise specified. SOME RATES MAY REQUIRE SPECIAL IDENTIFICATION. Taxes and fees not included unless otherwise specified in the detailed Rate Rules. Extra people, children, roll-away beds and incidentals may be subject to additional charges
Top




I should receive a discounted rate. How do I get this?
The rates displayed are the only rates available to this site for making reservations. These rates may include government, corporate, or senior discounts. You may need special documentation at check-in to confirm you are qualified to receive that rate. Please do not expect to receive such a rate at check-in without the proper identification even if you have selected to book it online.



Top





Is there a waiting list for sold out hotels?

In certain instances, Interactive Affiliate Network can make reservations at sold out properties. Often lodgings identified as "Special Internet Rates" are providing sold out availability. If you want to be placed on a waiting list, you will need to contact the lodging directly.



Top






Confirming a Reservation




What happens when I make a reservation?
Reservation requests will result in a new screen showing an Itinerary Number, which should be kept and used with any future correspondence with Interactive Affiliate Network. You may also be quoted a Confirmation Number. Additionally, all reservations will be followed up within 2 to 4 hours with an email using the same Itinerary Number and, if available, a Confirmation Number.
Top

How long will it take Interactive Affiliate Network to respond to my reservation request?
All reservation requests will result in a new screen showing an Itinerary Number, which should be kept and used with any future correspondence with Interactive Affiliate Network. Additionally, all reservations will be followed up with an email within 2 to 4 hours using the same Itinerary Number with the status of your reservation.
Top

When will my reservation be at the hotel?


Special Internet Rates Rates:
Your name will not appear at the hotel until 72 hours before your arrival date. Rest assured, the room is booked; however, the hotel just does not know that you will be the person staying in it.

"Additional Rates":
It takes a minimum of 24 hours before your reservation details reach the lodging's computer system. Rest assured, the room is booked; however, the hotel simply has not entered your details into their system yet.


Top

Once I have made my reservation, will I receive any written confirmation from the hotel?
No. The email confirmation you receive from Interactive Affiliate Network is all you will need. It displays your Interactive Affiliate Network Itinerary Number, the hotel information, the rate, confirmation number, and the hotel's cancellation policy.

Canceling a Reservation







What is the cancellation policy on my reservation?
When you are completing the Secure Lodging Reservation Form, the Cancellation Policy will be provided in
red
or there will be a link to read the cancellation policy. You can also view the property information page to find the cancellation policy. These policies will vary from lodging to lodging, so you must read each one carefully. In general, the standard increments are that you must cancel the room(s) by 4 or 6 PM on the arrival date, or 24, 48, or 72 hours prior to your specified arrival; however, these are just general guidelines and the specific policy of the property will prevail. If you cancel before the deadline, generally you will not be charged a penalty. Canceling after the stated period will result in a cancellation penalty fee.  Some reservations are non-refundable and cannot be cancelled after booking.

Reservations of "Special Internet Rates" will apply a cancellation fee regardless of the timeframe of cancellation. If the cancellation is outside of the time allotted, you may be charged for one night's stay including tax recovery charges and service fees. Please read the specific cancellation policy provided for each property on the site and in any emails regarding your reservation.



Top




How do I cancel a reservation?
Use the "
View/Cancel Reservation
" link provided on the home page.

Miscellaneous





What is a Vacation Rental?
A vacation rental is any suite-type lodging that has self-catering facilities (wet bar, refrigerator, microwave, etc.) Most vacation rentals have separate bedrooms, fully equipped kitchens, one or more bathrooms, washer and dryer, and sometimes a balcony or patio. Towels and linens are provided. Daily maid service and other hotel conveniences are usually available.
Unlike hotels with per person pricing, there is a set price for an entire vacation rental with a maximum number of persons allowed. Most one-bedroom units sleep a maximum of four using a sleeper/sofa in the living room. Most two-bedroom vacation rentals sleep a maximum of six, and most three-bedroom vacation rentals sleep up to eight.
Please carefully read the vacation rental descriptions to learn the specifics of what is provided and how many people are allowed.
Top

Where do I pick up my vacation rental keys?
The email you receive confirming your reservation for a Vacation rental will provide details as to where and when you should pick up the keys to your rental unit.
Top




What type of customer service is offered?
After submitting your reservation request, you will be provided with an email address to use to make inquires about your request. Our qualified and friendly agents are available 24-hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year (including holidays) to answer your questions. All you have to do is ask.


Top

I'm looking for a hotel in Los Angeles. Can you help me?
Our reservation agents are unable to do individual searches for clients due to our high volume of reservations. Please use the
Hotel Search Form
to identify availability and rates at over 47,000 hotels around the world.
Top

Is there a hotel shuttle service to/from the airport?
Many hotels offer shuttle service to and from the airport. This may be listed on the Lodging Information page. If it is offered, there may be a charge by the hotel for this service. Vacation rentals often do not have this type of service.
Top

Is parking available? Free parking? Long-term parking?
Most hotels and vacation rentals offer free parking to their guests, although some may charge. Long-term parking is offered at the discretion of the property (often in conjunction with park and fly rates). This may be listed on the Lodging Information page.
Top

What if there will be more than two adults in the room?
Most hotels allow additional guests to stay in the rooms at a charge (usually between $5.00-$20.00 per person). Some hotels and most vacation rentals have a limit on how many people can stay in a room. This may be listed on the Lodging Information page.
Top

Our children will be with us... do they stay free?
Usually children under 12 years of age stay for free in their parent's room using the existing bedding. The age requirement differs depending on the specific hotel's policy. This may be listed on the Hotel Lodging page.
Top

Are rollaway beds/cribs available?
Most hotels and some vacation rentals offer rollaway beds and cribs (typically at a charge- $5.00-$20.00 each). Some may have restrictions on what room types will allow rollaway beds. This may be listed on the Lodging Information page. If special requests are accepted, a section will appear on the Reservation Form to insert such requests and submit them to the hotel or vacation rental.
Top

What are the directions to the hotel?
The location information of the hotel is sometimes listed on the Lodging Information page. This can identify the distance from the hotel to certain landmarks or the airport. Vacation rental reservations will have directions included in the confirmation email.
Top

Is breakfast included?
Many hotels offer free breakfast. Often this is a continental breakfast or sometimes just coffee and donuts. It would be very rare for a Vacation rental to provide breakfast. If included, it should be listed on the Lodging Information page.
Top

What is the Interactive Affiliate Network Refund Policy?
Interactive Affiliate Network strives to provide the best service possible and will work on behalf of our clients to rectify any regrettable circumstances pertaining to your reservation. However, Interactive Affiliate Network acts only as an independent agent to secure services of an air carrier, car rental supplier, hotel, vacation rentals, or other travel related supplier. Therefore, we have no control over personnel, equipment, or operations of these suppliers and shall not be held liable for any inconvenience, personal injury, property damage, or other loss incurred as a result of any wrongful acts, omissions, or default on the part of the suppliers. All grievances must be reported with any and all supporting documentation to Interactive Affiliate Network within 60 days of the mailing of the first credit card statement showing any discrepancies for billing and payment issues or within 60 days after the completion of travel services provided.
Top

Do hotels have minimum age requirements?
Please be aware that some hotels may have minimum age restrictions or requirements when reserving a room. For example, some hotels with casinos may require you to be 21 years of age to check into a room. Please inquire with a Customer Care Agent or with the hotel directly.
