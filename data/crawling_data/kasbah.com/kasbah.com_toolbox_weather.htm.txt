Sports Weather
- Home field weather for your favorite Major League Teams. No information here for lovers of javelin catching, marsh snorkelling or other popular sports.





Marine Weather
- Had Captain Edward J Smith taken a look at Marine Weather.com on the 14th of April 1912 the recent blockbuster film "Titanic" may never have been made. This site is essential viewing for" those who go down to the sea in ships", or anything else for that matter. This is a great site just to paddle around in. Loads of information on everything to do with global marine weather. Also a useful tide times and currents section.





Aviation weather
- If you are responsible for flying flight UA 136 on Friday please read through this site very carefully as you will have me behind the cockpit door. Before I checked out this site I had only really considered the weather at ground level. Well if you think its bad down here take a look around Aviation Weather.com, theres some pretty scary stuff going on up there.This is an amazingly comprehensive site providing information on winds aloft, mountain wave, aviation icing maps and whole lot of other stuff I don't understand.





Agricultural Weather
- When should you dress a pig in thermals, or get out the Bermuda shorts for Daisy the cow?. Agricultural Weather.com will tell you when, and whole lot of slightly more intelligent facts, if you are one of those horny handed sons of toil responsible for stocking the nations larder. A very useful and information packed site.





Canadian Weather
- It can get very cold in Canada. This site will tell you the places to avoid. Tough luck if you live there. Lots of links to warmer places.





National Hurricane Service
- maintains a continuous watch on tropical cyclones over the Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and the Eastern Pacific from 15 May through November 30. The Center prepares and distributes hurricane watches and warnings for the general public, and also prepares and distributes marine and military advisories for other users. A good site to get the lastest news on hurricanes.





Web Weather View
- It is not the purpose of this site to give unpaid glowing reviews about commercial products. But we couldn't resist this one. This for the hopeless weather fanatic, the kind of person who won't venture into the backyard without taking a weather check. Web Weather View is a neat piece of software that will give the user real time information on whats going on outside the backdoor. Check it out.





TV Station Weather
- Just that. A complete listing of all US TV Weather departments. Many have a range of useful local features not found on national sites.





Weather Cams
- If your boss is in Chicago and you are in sunny Florida, you can now gloat at the rain falling in the windy city, or the sun shining, or the snow falling, or if you can't see anything at all, the fog. This is a great site detailing hundreds of weather cams all over North America.





Current conditions around the globe
- Brought to you by USA Today, this is a great quick reference site for weather around the globe. Just click on the globe for a local forecast.





WeatherNet
- For those of you who cannot get enough weather, check out this site. Links to just about every weather site on the web.
