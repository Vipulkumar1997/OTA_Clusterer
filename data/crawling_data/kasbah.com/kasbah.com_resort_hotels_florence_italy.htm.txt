Facilities:
146, Room Service, Handicapped Rooms/Facilities, Restaurant and No Smoking Rooms/Facilities.

Points of Interest:
Include - FLORENCE OLD CITY centre - We suggest you take a walk in the centre to explore some of the other ancient, prestigious buildings constructed at the end of the 1400s near the most important architects from the Renaissance. Palazzo Strozzi, on the corner of the square with the same name and Via Tornabuoni, is another example of austerity and defined near traditional rustication, today the position of important exhibitions. The close by Palazzo Rucellai gently renounces rustication and has plenty of mullioned windows. To immerse oneself in the ambience of everyday life in historic Florence you have to go to Piazza de Davanzati. You can find the fourteenth-century namesake building here which hosts the Museum of The Old Florentine House, with authentic benches and tapestries, ceramics and objects of everyday life from medieval Florence. To locate the Renaissance museum in Via de Benci, go to no. 6 where Horne Museum is located, one of the most striking buildings from the 1400s. In 1911 the English architect and historian Herbert Percy Horne bought the building and used it to host his collection of Renaissance Florentine works of art. He created an ambience of a Florentine building from the 1500s which still exists today. If you prefer more traditional itineraries, remember that Hotel Il Guelfo Bianco is in the middle of the city, nearby the most famous tourist sites and monuments, in 5 minutes near foot you can easily reach Piazza San Giovanni, the Duomo and the baptistery, the Gallerie dell Accademia and the San Marco Museum and much more.
