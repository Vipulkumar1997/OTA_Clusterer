Your Privacy & Security with Kasbah -
History & Partners Listings
By Internet standards Kasbah has been around a long time. Online since 1997 Kasbah has become a globally trusted and respected source of world travel and destination information. The people who run Kasbah are true travel professionals who between them have visited over 150 countries worldwide.
During 2002, by expanding our founding criteria of unbiased, independent and quality content Kasbah moved into the online travel reservation market by forming alliances and partnerships with some of the world’s largest and most reliable travel providers.
Here at Kasbah we recognise that it is difficult, if not impossible, trying to be all things to all people. However, by forging strong relationships with the companies we deal with, we are able to offer our visitors exclusive products at the lowest possible prices.
Each company we deal with must meet, and strictly adhere to
our
codes of practise.

These are:


Your Privacy at all times.

Secure, encrypted online booking procedure.

To only provide available products at the time of booking.

To have access to a Call Centre or Help Line. (Opening times vary; see individual products below for details.)

Never to sell or distribute your email address or other details to a third party.

To respond to any queries you may have within a reasonable period of time, usually within 24 hours.


If you experience any contravention of the above Code of Practise please contact us using this form.

Kasbah Security and Privacy Policy.


We would not expect our partners to adhere to our Code of Practice without having a strict privacy policy ourselves! We have the utmost respect for your privacy and security. We never divulge any information in any of our partners fully encrypted database accounts to anyone without your consent, which we would not ask you for anyway. An encrypted, secure booking engine guarantees a safe and smooth transaction.
