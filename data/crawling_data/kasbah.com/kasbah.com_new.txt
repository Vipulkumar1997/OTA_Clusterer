Aid and Humanitarian Assistance to Iraq

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Special Iraq Section
The ICRC has been working in Iraq since the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war in 1980. Since the conflict of 1991 it has focused on trying to help resolve protection issues concerning prisoners of war and, in recent years, on relieving the devastating effects of war on the civilian population, which has faced a growing struggle for survival. In northern Iraq, the ICRC has continued its activities related to the consequences of the conflict between Kurdish groups.

Network for Good
When war breaks out, there's another front line to consider: the front line of humanitarian organizations and agencies, who are the first to receive refugees and others who fear for their safety in time of war. As the war continues in Iraq, these organizations are on the scene, ready to provide aid, shelter and food for civilians caught in the crossfire.
Essential reading for anyone with or without a conscience.

Against the War

The Atlantic Online

Iraq Sanctions. Humanitarian Implications and Options for the Future
A paper published by UN Security Council outlining all the major implications of the war in Iraq. The Security Council is the United Nations' most powerful body. It has "primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security." Five powerful countries sit as "permanent members" along with ten other member states, elected for two-year terms. Since 1990, the Council has dramatically increased its activity and it now meets in nearly continuous session. It dispatches military operations, imposes economic sanctions, mandates arms inspections, deploys human rights and election monitors and more. The materials available here provide analysis and documents about the Council and the sharp debate about Council reform, as well as information about the NGO Working Group on the Security Council.
