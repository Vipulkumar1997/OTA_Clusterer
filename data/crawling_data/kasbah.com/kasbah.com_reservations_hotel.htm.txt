London - It’s definitely got a tale to tell, having survived fire, flood, riot, disease and war. London is a place oozing with history but also attracts visitors because of its great entertainment value.
With masses of shopping opportunities by day and great West End theatre shows and nightclubs by night, it's a city that exhilarates, stimulates and excites, in equal measures.
From Piccadilly Circus to Soho to Trafalgar Square, the broad-based mix of rich and poor, from the stock market trader to the street beggar, somehow all hangs together.
The city is so vast, visitors will need to take that underground train to see the sights, however, a ride on a red double-decker bus, the most quintessential experience of all, will provide visitors with those never-ending memories.

Thailand - With its beautiful temples, natural landscape, fine cuisine, kindness and generosity throughout, what more could a visitor ask for? Thailand is the total package for people who are interested in culture, history and stunning scenery.
Thailand offers a distinct contrast of delights from the lush limestone islands of the Andaman Sea and striking mountain range of Mae Hong Son, to the pounding rhythms of the nightclubs of Bangkok. Whatever the attraction of the new modern Thailand though, visitors will always see the old Thai culture wherever they turn, with religion and monarchy being the foundation of Thai culture, which seep through into everyday life, such as the prevalence of Buddhist temples throughout the country.
When it comes to cuisine, Thailand has it, with aromatic and spicy food, always seasoned with plenty of garlic and chillies, lemon grass, limejuice and fresh coriander. Visitors will also find the ever-present rice, noodles and soup arriving with most meals and many a variety of condiments and dips to taste, savour and enjoy.

Bangkok - A lively, pulsating and energetic city. Thailand’s capital city of Bangkok is located in South East Asia and is as glamorous as New York City, with its glitzy temples, gaudy bazaars, bizarre nightlife and extravagant shopping potential.
Modern development flourishes throughout Bangkok, with its skyscrapers, office towers, top class hotels and of course shopping arcades, which serve out Eastern delights such as gemstones and silks. Restaurants are also very popular with many spicy specials and other worldwide dishes to entice the tourists and when nighttime falls, the range of dazzling dance venues varies from disco diva to traditional Thai.
Throughout all this madness though, the cultural side of Bangkok still carries on, with the capital’s Temple of the Emerald Buddha, Grand Palace, Temple of the Dawn and many other significant shrines, poking their heads out amongst the mod cons of today’s Bangkok.
