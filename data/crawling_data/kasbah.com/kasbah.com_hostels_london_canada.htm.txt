Winter things to do are great too! There are festivals that run every weekend in London that represent a wide range of cultural and other intresting things to do. From Ribfest to three day Rock Concerts London is a super destination for someone looking to have a good time and see true Canadian lifestyle at its finest. We as well have a brand new large arena for sporting events and big name musical concerts about a ten minute walk from our facility. Our hostel is centrally situated and very close to the rail and Bus stations. A short walk to downtown London, its museums and of course the fantastic restaurant and entertainment district. London is very close to beach / seaes on the Great Lakes, the awe inspiring Niagara Falls and the USA border cro ing of Detroit. There is a river that runs through our town (yes, The Thames!!) it's great for a day of canoeing in the summer and skating in the winter. There are numerous large parks in the town and there is even a snow boarding park right in the town that is easy to get to and a very popular place in winter. In the summer this park is a mountain bike enthusiast playground. Come and visit London and stay with us. Our prices are great and you will not be disappointed. When you get here 'ask for a discount- Why not?'..
