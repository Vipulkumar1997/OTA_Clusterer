London Airfare Travel Tips


Travel on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday traditionally costs less. If your travel plans are flexible, consider these days.

Buy your London ticket as far in advance as possible. Fares are often lower when purchased 7, 14 or 21 days in advance.

Stay over a Saturday night. Many airlines have made this a requirement for reduced fares.

Book travel during holidays, or other peak periods, as early as possible. With Orbitz you can book up to 11 months in advance.

Using airports outside your originating and destination cities, may require a longer drive, but the money you save could make it worthwhile.
