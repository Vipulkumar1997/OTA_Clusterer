featured destinations - Las Vegas and Paris




Las Vegas - A large metropolis containing over one million people… Las Vegas, famous for its gambling and high profile casinos and themed resorts, are all located on or near the world famous Las Vegas Strip i.e. Las Vegas Boulevard South.
Perhaps the key to the city's unparalleled success is that Las Vegas is always devising new concepts, which attract visitors, year after year, which in turn creates more hotel complexes, to accommodate the expanding influx of tourists.
Las Vegas is never the same, there is always something new for visitors to see or do. Though sometimes sordid and over the top, Vegas never fails to fascinate and bemuse and even for an observer who may be repelled by the abundance of glitter, Las Vegas is a travel destination that should be experienced.

Las Vegas Hotels








Paris - The zenith of architectural beauty, with a population of over eleven million, Paris is the second biggest city in Europe.
A compact city, due to it being built before the automobile era and everything having to be within walking distance, though the suburbs have stretched as much as New York city.

Even though many places are close by, with so many people living in and visiting the Parisian streets all year round, due to its balanced climate, most folk take the Metro or subway to get around. First time visitors though, could take a guided tour, to help them get where they’re going in the shortest time possible.
One of the main attractions to Paris though, besides its beauty, art and history, is its shopping experience. Just by walking down the Champs Elysees into elegant stores such as Chaussures Heyraud creates as much excitement as a tour round the Louvre or dinner at an exclusive five-star restaurant.
