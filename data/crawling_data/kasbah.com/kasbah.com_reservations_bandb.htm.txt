Useful hints and tips for the first time B&B; visitor
This guide is intended only to give a brief and general overview of the pleasures of B and B stays. Firstly lets explode some myths!

1.
You generally won't need to stand in line to get to the bathroom. The majority of Bed and Breakfast rooms are now en-suite.

2.
You don't need to be in your room by 10 pm. Most B&B;'s will give you a key so you can enjoy your evening out and return at your convenience.

3.
You don't have to take breakfast with strangers. Many Band B's will provide you with a tray breakfast in your room. But that's not really the spirit of Bed and Breakfast; on the whole you will most likely find your self sharing the breakfast room with like-minded folks. Many a long-term friendship has been forged over an extended Bed and Breakfast stay breakfast!!

Some of our favourite bed and breakfast destinations


Florida
- there is so much more to Florida, than Disney World! The landscape is like no-where else on Earth, with enough wildlife and natural attractions to get even the slightly outdoorsy type out for some fresh Florida air! The bed and breakfast accommodation you are mostly likely to find in Florida will be small family run b&b;'s, most of which you will find in the outstandingly beautiful areas of
Kissimmee
,
Key West
and the lovely old city of
St. Augustine
.


Louisiana
- part of the deep south, where the creole cajun spices of New Orleans meet the old historic southern plantations and the swampy depths of the Bayou. Louisiana is a unique place where old world Spanish, French and African heritage is strongly preserved especially prominent in
New Orleans
!

Vermont
- is a quiet place where people come to rejuvenate the essence of life that makes life fun. Vermont likes being different, cars stop for pedestrians on the crosswalk, and strangers wave to each other in the street. Vermont is not just a place - its a mindset!

California
- the golden state, stretches from the Mexican border in the south for nearly 900 miles (1400km) north along side the Pacific Ocean. Calfornia has a great diversity in its landscape and scenery, and a number of well known cities, including
San Diego
,
San Francisco
and
Los Angeles
. Between these major cities lie the many beautiful coastal towns of
Santa Barbara
,
Monterey
and the breathetaking coastline known as the Big Sur. We have a wide range of bed and breakfast accommodation in both the popular and the quiter parts of California ranging from cheap inns to luxury bed and breakfast within private grounds.
