Where else can you hurl darts in an Irish pub and then try your skill on a Neapolitan bocce court right down the street? Are there other places where you can sway to a reggae beat on your way to hear a German opera? Or go from a room full of Dutch Old Master paintings to one filled with cutting-edge fashion? And where else in the world can you lunch on Japanese sushi and enjoy hearty Brazilian feijoada for dinner?.
