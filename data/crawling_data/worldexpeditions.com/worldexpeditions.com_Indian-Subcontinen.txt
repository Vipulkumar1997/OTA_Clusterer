Ancient, fascinating and shamelessly photogenic, the Indian subcontinent is an exciting region blessed with cultural riches, exotic wildlife and vast and varied landscapes.
Explore ancient citadels, temples and palaces, watch the faithful pray on the banks of the River Ganges, and lose yourself in the sensory overload of India’s bustling market bazaars. See the sun rise over the Taj Mahal, explore the flamboyant architecture of the coloured cities of Rajasthan, or take a houseboat trip down the palm-fringed backwaters of Kerala.
Head to the teardrop-shaped island of Sri Lanka for white-sand beaches, lush highlands and a deeply spiritual culture. Visit the sacred city of Kandy, explore ancient palaces, monasteries and Buddhist cave-temples, cycle through scenic tea plantations and relax among the coconut palms on endless tropical beaches.
Or cruise out into the azure waters of the Maldives—a glorious chain of small islands and reefs stretched out into the Indian Ocean like a string of pearls. Sail between the remote atolls of this spectacular archipelago, snorkeling through crystal clear waters, exploring deserted beaches and landing on a new beautiful island each night.
Join us as we explore the highlights and hidden gems of India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives!

Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
World Expeditions is committed to responsible travel and true sustainability. Over decades we’ve honed our responsible travel philosophy and the initiatives we have in place on the subcontinent and beyond to ensure we minimise our impact and leave behind positive impressions. When you book one of our adventures you’re supporting a program that is committed to safety and sustainability.
World Firsts
We proudly pioneered the first ever cycling and camel trek adventures in India (1978), as well as a sailing trip down the Ganges River. We’ve developed trails that had never before been used commercially, including a traverse from Kashmir to Ladakh through Zanskar (1983), and we were also one of the first companies to offer cycling adventures around Sri Lanka.
Innovative Active Itineraries
Our range of adventures reflects the diversity of the Indian subcontinent, its contrasting landscapes, artistic treasures and the vibrant cultures of its people. From exploring the romantic palaces and temples of the Golden Triangle to trekking the hidden valleys of Ladakh, from boarding a traditional Dhoni and sailing around the atolls of the Maldives to cycling along the Sri Lankan coast—be inspired by our diverse range of Indian subcontinent adventures.
Great Value, Highly Inclusive
Quality services at the best prices make our adventures great value for money. Our trip costs cover valuable inclusions like local crew who’ll go the extra yard to enhance your experience, all meals while trekking or sailing, private transport and drivers on touring journeys, porters who’ll transport your luggage, park entry fees and internal flights, enabling you to budget for your adventure well in advance. We hand pick well-located, character filled hotels so you can get the most out of your experience.
Create Your Own Adventure
With World Expeditions, your adventure can take any form you desire. We love to use our 40 years of experience arranging adventures on the subcontinent to create outstanding custom itineraries just for you. Whether it’s for individuals, couples, families or special interest groups, we know the region and can help you get the most out of your experience.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel
The countries of India, Maldives and Sri Lanka present some of the world's poorest living conditions. According to the United Nations' 2010 Human Development Report "environmental degradation intensifies inequality through adverse impacts on already disadvantaged people and inequalities in human development amplify environmental degradation". World Expeditions chooses to make a difference by putting in place initiatives that reduce our impact and give back to the places and people we encounter. To minimise our impact on the natural environment we practice the '7 Principals of Leave No Trace', in addition to supporting local economies by employing local guides and crew. Our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct and Child Welfare Code of Conduct ensure the well-being of animals and children encountered on our adventures.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are generally centrally located, atmospheric, and reliable and where we have seen a good track record with traveller satisfaction over many years.
Lodges
In national parks it is often the case that we stay in wildlife lodges situated in or near the park. They are not luxury lodges but they do provide comfortable rooms and common areas that are clean and well maintained.
House boats
In Kashmir you will enjoy the exquisite carved timber houseboats that are mobilised along the edge of the lake with mountain views all around featuring twin rooms with attached bathrooms and a communal lounge/dining area. In Kerala, while a little more basic, a local houseboat offering twin rooms with attached bathrooms is a great way to cruise the backwaters around Cochin.
Dhoni
In the Maldives we travel on board a traditional Dhoni, which is a motorised sailing vessel. We use several different types (depending on group size and time of travel) with an average of 10 travellers per departure, each equipped with private twin cabins, shared bathrooms, a galley and sun deck.
Camping
While trekking you will enjoy our fully supported camping. In scenic wilderness settings we erect two person quality tents with good ventilation as well as a dining tent where you’ll enjoy great camp food prepared by our crew. We take care of all the logistics leaving you to relax at the end of the day. Our camps also feature a sit toilet in a tent. We keep our impact on the environment to a minimum, taking out everything we take in. Our local crew are always there to make your camping experience comfortable.
Homestays
On some of our itineraries you will experience a homestay. This is where a local family will open their home providing a wonderful insight into local culture, cuisine and lifestyle. Expect simple but clean lodgings with shared bathrooms.

Leaders in the field
Wangchuk Samshu
Since 1985 Wangchuk has managed our operations in India and has a real knack for developing programs centred on discovery of the regions using active travel as the vehicle. This philosophy is reflected in our trekking, cycling and camel riding holidays in northern India. Wangchuk, who himself lives and breathes adventure, ensures that our itineraries are at the cutting edge of tourism development.
Greg Lee
There’s nothing Greg enjoys more than setting out in search of adventure. This passion shines through in the breadth of unique adventures reflected in the fantastic line-up of trips on offer. Greg is drawn to the beauty of the region's scenery, fascinating history, varied cultures and most of all, its people.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
