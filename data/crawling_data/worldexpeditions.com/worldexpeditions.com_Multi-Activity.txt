If your idea of the perfect holiday is one that challenges your mind and body each day, and is jam-packed with adventures, activities and exhilaration, then perhaps a multi-activity adventure is in order!
If you can’t choose whether you want to trek, cycle, paddle, raft or kayak through a country, why not do some or all of them? Our multi-activity adventures include two or more activities that allow you to truly get off the tourist track using a variety of means, whether it’s by boot, bike or boat! After all, there's no better place to discover the great outdoors than getting up close and personal with the elements!
If you like the flexibility of travelling in the most active way possible, a multi-activity adventure is one the most fulfilling ways to travel. You could see yourself paddling along coastlines, cycling through quiet back country or trekking in the hills, with rewards of spectacular scenery, remote interactions with untouched villages, unique experiences and memories to last a lifetime.
Designed for all levels of adventure, on these trips we provide all of the equipment you need. Each is crafted to make sure you get the most out of the destination; taking advantage of the unique and stunning scenery on offer in your chosen destination by purposefully featuring several different activities and environments... all you need to do is make sure your adventurous spirit can keep up!

Why travel with us
World Expeditions has over 40 years of experience operating authentic and unique adventure holidays with a genuine focus on the paths less travelled. We’ve meticulously crafted our cycling itineraries to give you an insight that just isn’t possible with any other means of travel – putting you in the driver’s seat and delivering a truly authentic travel experience. While our expert guides help you to discover hidden markets and restaurants in the towns you pass through, you will be accommodated in a superb range of hotels, homestays and lodges, all chosen for their ambience and location. Bike hire is included in your tour cost for the majority of our adventures, and all bikes are sized and fitted to suit you. Additionally, most of the World Expeditions cycling holidays are fully supported with back up vehicles and a bike mechanic, giving you total peace of mind.
World Expeditions has over 40 years of experience in operating authentic and unique adventure holidays with a genuine focus on the paths less travelled. Trekking is a hugely rewarding experience where you can gain access to places where there are no roads, experience unspoilt wilderness and isolated villages and get up close to the highest peaks on Earth. While our experienced and passionate local staff are trained in wilderness first aid and supported with hearty meals, protective clothing and insurance, our trekking solutions responsibly manage waste and ensure we are not depleting natural resources. By not outsourcing our treks to third parties we are able to maintain the highest standards of safety, hygiene and value, all the while supporting innovation and responsible travel practices that protect the incredible natural environments we travel through.

1
Discovery & Cruising
These are our least demanding trips. These journeys of discovery and cruises involve little or no extended activity. The itinerary may take place in remote areas (with basic facilities) and may involve long travel days on various types of transport. Sightseeing may be conducted on foot and all participants should be capable of carrying their own luggage from vehicle to hotel rooms. These adventures do not go above 2500m and rarely involve camping.
2
Adventure Touring
These adventure tours sometimes involve travel at high altitude (rarely exceeding 4000m, except on certain trips in Tibet, Peru and India) and may visit remote areas of the world where facilities are often basic. Many of these trips sometimes involve some camping or basic lodging. These adventure tours will often involve long journeys and rough roads. Sightseeing and optional day walks are often included and these days may involve up to 5 hours of physical activity.
3
Intoductory
Up to 5 or 6 hours of physical activity a day at a slow but steady pace.
4
Introductory to Moderate

1
Discovery & Cruising

To enjoy these adventures we suggest you have a reasonable level of fitness and health, a moderately active lifestyle and a positive attitude.
Suggested preparation: Two or three times a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour or more, for at least 3 months prior to departure.
3
Intoductory
Our introductory trips are not ‘easy’ trips and you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 30 minutes of aerobic type exercise three times a week, starting at least two to three months before departure. This can include swimming, jogging, hard walking or cycling. For treks, hill or stair walking with a 5-7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week. For a cycling adventure, road cycling twice a week for three months prior to departure is advised.
4
Introductory to Moderate
On these adventures you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45 minutes of aerobic type exercise three times a week, from a minimum of three months period to your departure. This can include swimming, jogging, hard walking or cycling - good cardiovascular exercise. For treks, hill or stair walking with a 7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week. For a cycling adventure, road cycling twice a week for three months prior to departure is advised.
5
Moderate
These adventures require a good level of fitness and health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45-60 minutes of aerobic type exercise, three to four times a week. Hill walking with a pack in variable weather conditions, kayaking or road cycling is also recommended depending upon the activity you plan to undertake.



6
Moderate to Challenging
These adventures require a good level of fitness and excellent health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend one hour of aerobic type exercise, four times a week. Hill walking with a pack in variable weather conditions, kayaking or road cycling is also recommended depending upon the activity you plan to undertake.
7
Challenging
On these challenging adventures, you will need an excellent level of fitness.
Suggested preparation: We recommend one hour of aerobic exercise, four times a week – such as jogging, hard walking, cycling or paddling. Solid preparation is essential in the months leading up to your departure. For trekking, hill walking with a 7kg pack is a must. On the weekends mix in a relatively demanding bushwalk relatively steep ascents and descents. For cycling, regular biking for one to four hours at a time, with as many hills as possible, will help prepare you for your trip.
Inclusions & Equipment
The exact inclusions and equipment for each of our adventures is listed once you've found the trip you want. Our trips are generally more inclusive than others in the market place in line with our philosophy of minimising 'extra payments' displayed outside of the main trip price as well as out of pocket expenses once you reach your destination.
