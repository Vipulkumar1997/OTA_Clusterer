Pristine and sparsely populated, with vibrant cities, diverse cultures and landscapes of staggering beauty, Canada is an outstanding travel destination. A seemingly boundless realm of snowcapped peaks and imposing glaciers, unspoilt forests, labyrinthine coastlines and isolated islands, this is truly nature’s playground. Carved through this epic wilderness are some of the world’s most challenging and inspiring trails, drawing nature lovers to experience the magic of the Canadian landscape for themselves.
Follow the trail of the Klondike Gold Rush along the Yukon River and over the Chilkoot Pass, trek or heli-hike the remote trails of the Canadian Rockies and Columbia Mountains or take on the veritable adult playground that is the West Coast Trail, considered one of the world's top ten treks.
Traverse sections of the Trans Canada Trail on foot or by bike, try your hand at glacier trekking on the Wapta Icefields of Yoho National Park or experience a true Canadian winter as you snowshoe, cross-country ski and dogsled through a striking winter wilderness, using a cosy log cabin as your base.
View whales, icebergs and dramatic coastline while hiking in Newfoundland, cycle through the rust-coloured landscapes of Prince Edward Island, made famous by Anne of Greene Gables, sample the best in local food and wine and immerse yourself in the unique cultures, traditions and histories of Canada’s diverse communities.
There’s so much on offer here that the hardest part will be deciding on an itinerary. Take a look at our unique journeys and start planning your great Canadian adventure today!

Why travel with us
Innovative itineraries
Even when visiting major parks, we venture into areas away from major tourist sites, often accessing secluded vantage points by foot, bike or boat. Our vast selection of itineraries draws upon some of the country's most inspiring landscapes, incredible networks of trails and stunning national parks, showcasing communities along the way.
Expert guides
Each guided adventure is led by exceptional leaders whose local knowledge, professionalism and passion for the outdoors ensure an enriched experience. On remote, guided hikes, our leaders are certified in wilderness first-aid and have the backcountry know-how that only comes from experience and a deep understanding of their natural environment.
Self guided options
Each self guided itinerary has been tried and tested with every detail accounted for, enabling you to explore independently. We'll provide bicycles, accommodation, luggage transfers, route notes, maps and emergency assistance so that all you need to do is spend the day travelling at your own pace.
Great value
Quality services at the best prices make our adventures great value for money. Having essential items like internal transfers, experienced guides, national park fees, most meals, sightseeing and entry fees included in the trip cost allows you to better budget for your big adventure.
Committed to responsible travel
We are committed to giving back to the charitable organisations that protect, develop and maintain our trails. Included in the cost of many of our Canadian tour packages is a monetary donation to support these efforts.
World firsts
We proudly pioneered the first commercial fully supported trek of the Fundy Footpath and the first supported backpacking trip on the Chilkoot Trail, using support crew to help reduce the load. Additionally, our itineraries have been featured in many publications including the New York Times, Explore Magazine, Outpost Magazine, Great Walks Magazine, Traveller, Canadian Geographic and the Great Canadian Bucketlist.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Sustainable development
We partner with a range of specialised operators across Canada that have been chosen based on a number of criteria, including their commitment to operating sustainable and responsible travel experiences. All of our partners have well-defined sustainability plans to address minimal impact on the natural environment, preservation of native cultures and traditions and the protection of wildlife.
Animal welfare focus
Our comprehensive Animal Welfare Code of Conduct seeks to protect vulnerable animals and inform travellers about issues surrounding animal welfare.
Support of local charities
We are committed to the preservation of Canadian Trails and make annual donations to The Trans Canada Trail, The Bruce Trail Conservancy and The East Coast Trail Association.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels and lodges
We use well-appointed, clean and comfortable hotels and lodges chosen for their proximity to local parks and attactions. Rooms are based on double occupancy and may include en suite facilities.
Camping
Campsites are chosen for their spectacular locations. All group camping equipment including two person tents, stoves and fuel are provided and all meals are prepared by our crew.
Bed & breakfasts
Selected for their desirable locations and local charm, B&Bs and guesthouses offer tasty meals, comfortable rooms, and warm, friendly welcomes at the end of each day.
Mountain huts
On backcountry trails, mountaineering routes, and glacier traverses, we stay in remote mountain huts with basic facilities. While the huts may be simple, they offer a truly authentic experience.

Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want.

Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Electricity
Electricity in Canada is 110 Volts, at 60 hertz. The most common pin type is A. (2 flat prong).
Visas
Starting March 15, 2016, most travellers entering Canada will need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visitor visa. The following nationalities will require an eTA for visiting or transiting by air (but not a visa):
Australian
New Zealand
United Kingdom
Applying for an eTA is a simple online process that takes just a few minutes. Please visit http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/eta-start.asp. You will need your passport, a credit card, and an email address. It costs CA$7 to get an eTA and it will be valid for up to five years. Government advises passengers planning to visit the nation should apply for an eTA before purchasing a ticket to enter the country, as applicants may be found to be in-admissible and refused entry due to fraud or a criminal history. *U.S. citizens do not need an eTA or a visa, providing you don’t have a criminal record. However, proper identification must be presented at the border. Should you have a criminal record please contact the Canadian Embassy or nearest Consulate General.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
