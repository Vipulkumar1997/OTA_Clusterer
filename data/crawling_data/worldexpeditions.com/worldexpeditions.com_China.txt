There are few destinations as remarkable, as overwhelming, or as thoroughly exciting as China. As the most populated country on Earth, and one of the largest, with one of the world's oldest and richest civilisations, China is a country of staggering depth and variety. Take a deep breath and dive in!
Of course, you can't miss the awe-inspiring Great Wall - but consider enhancing your visit by combining a trek along the Wall with rural camping or a local village homestay. And that's just the beginning - filled with UNESCO World Heritage sites, you can scarcely move without encountering yet another iconic Chinese landmark, cultural treasure or spectacular natural feature.
Marvel at the imposing palatial buildings of Beijing's Forbidden City; explore the tranquil lakes and imperial gardens of the Summer Palace; and witness the surreal sculpted warriors of the Terracotta Army.
Hike through the spectacular Tiger Leaping Gorge; traverse the Chinese section of the ancient Silk Road; visit the mist-enshrouded granite peaks of Huangshan and cruise through the Yangtze River's breathtaking Three Gorges.
Pummel your senses in the super-modern, non-stop party metropolis of Shanghai; watch Shaolin monks performing ancient martial arts; experience China's rich ancient culture and eat your way around this food-lovers paradise, sampling each of China's eight regional culinary traditions.
Whether your interest is nature, cities, history or culture; cycling, hiking, cruising or touring - China has it all, and our range of unique itineraries are tailored to get you deep into the heart of this extraordinary destination.

Why travel with us
World firsts
In 1978, we proudly developed the first cycling itinerary for international groups through China. Our knowledge of the various routes, terrains and logistics are second to none, ensuring your experience is a smooth and memorable one.
Authentic experiences
Our range of China adventures allow you to interact with the culture under your own steam - a rewarding experience that provides realistic insight into local cultures and geographic diversity. From hiking along 'untamed' sections of the Great Wall to discovering China at handelbar level, our trips are the perfect balance of active and cultural touring.
Ultimate value
With nearly 30 itineraries to choose from, our competitively priced adventures offer options for every type of traveller. While some itineraries include internal flights, cycling trips feature bike hire and a support vehicle. We aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, accommodation, transfers, gear hire and excursions, allowing you to enjoy a hassle free experience.
Experienced local guides
The knowledge and expertise demonstrated by our local leaders in China reflect their years of experience in the field. Whether they are taking you to hidden hutongs to sample the renowned Chinese cuisine or guiding you along the best cycling routes, the passion they have for their country will shine through each day.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Child safe tourism
We ask travellers to avoid giving money or sweets to children as it encourages begging instead of attending school. As an alternative, we suggest supporting local charities working to alleviate problems associated with poverty in China.
Local employment
Employing local people in our offices and in the field ensures that wages remain with the people who are custodians of the places and cultures we visit. Additionally, there is no one better to educate travellers about the landscape and culture than a local person.
Leave No Trace
We operate our itineraries following the principles of Leave No Trace ensuring that we take out all waste that we bring in.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, pleasant and reliable.
Inns
We use quality inns that offer you a truly authentic experience.
Camping
Enjoy our fully supported camping in quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Homestays
Stay with a local family as they open their home to you and gain a wonderful insight into the local culture.

Leaders in the field
Bin Yan
Bin Yan was born in the far west of China in Urumqi Xinjiang, and graduated from Xinjiang University. He has worked as a guide since 2002 and is arguably one of the most experienced Silk Road guides in the business. He is very devoted to his work and his jokes always evoke peals of laughter from his travel companions.
Stony Xiao
Stony has been a favourite cycle guide for World Expeditions since 2001. In his spare time he explores the most remote corners of China, often helping to pave the way for new adventures, making him an authority who is often published in China Travel magazines. Stony's great knowledge of religion and culture, and his sense of fun, make him well liked by our travellers.
Su Zhi Wei
Our association with 'Mr Su' goes back more than two decades when we jointly pioneered the first commercial cycling trips in Southern China. Defying all the odds, Mr Su's vision of providing active, off the beaten track experiences for our travellers to China has been a marvellous accomplishment in a tightly regulated industry. Our adventures in China continue to thrive as a result.
Vincent Zhu
Vincent is a native of Guangdong and a graduate of Guangdong University in Foreign Studies. Vincent's expertise is in cycle tourism and he has led many bike trips all over China in the last decade. He is an inspirational guide who has also spent time cycling in the Himalaya. You are in good hands when out on the trails with Vincent.
Cathy Liu Cathy
Cathy grew up in Yunnan Province, China, and was drawn from an early age to cycling. Her easy going nature and passion for Yunnan's myriad of peoples and cultures make her a favourite with locals and fellow travellers alike. After 10 years as one of China's most experienced cycling leaders showing off her extensive knowledge of back roads, she remains happiest when on a bike!
Frank Guo
Frank was born in the year of the dragon, hence, in Chinese his nickname is 'dragon'. A qualified lawyer, Frank evolved his career realising that he had a great interest in history, photography, overseas and domestic adventure travel. Frank is also a master of traditional Chinese massage which he learned from his father.
Laura Kirk
Originally from the United Kingdom, Laura brings a wealth of travel experience to the World Expeditions team having explored over 60 countries to date. Her adventures have included setting up community projects in Myanmar, studying Mandarin in China, trekking in Nepal, spending time in a remote Bedouin camp in Jordan and chasing the Big 5 through Tanzania. With a particular passion for all things Asia, Laura loves to share the best of this region with others.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

Weather
China experiences a rather broad temperature range throughout the year. In late summer, early autumn trips (August to September) expect warm to hot days with temperatures up to 25-30°C (78-87F) and a slight chance of rain.
During October the days are mild and dry, from 15-20°C (60-69F), and nights are cooler. In late October there is increasingly a cooler (but not cold) westerly wind, which lowers temperatures, particularly at night. The days, however, remain mild.
Guangdong and Guangxi Provinces, where we cycle, is China's most southerly province and experiences a rather broad temperature range throughout the year. On summer trips (Jun to Sep) expect hot, humid days with temperatures up to 33°C (91F) and a small chance of some rain - although daytime temperatures in the hills further north in Guangdong Province should be milder. During October, the days are mild, from 15-26°C (60-79F) and nights are cooler. Some rain is also possible at this time.
On winter trips (Nov-Feb) there will be quite cool days of 12-15°C (54-60F) and cold nights - upon occasion night temperatures can fall to below freezing in the north of Guangdong.
In Beijing the winter (Nov-Feb) temperatures can drop below -10°C (2-3 F) and you will need thermal underwear, a heavy coat, hat, gloves, etc. There may be snow in the capital during December and January - don't be put off as it can be a plus, there are many less tourists and the city looks spectacular clothed in white!
In summer the days may be hot, up to 30°C (86 F) but it is more likely to be quite pleasant. Rain can occur at any time but is more likely in spring, March-May. We suggest you pack a waterproof jacket with hood for all departures.
Time in China
The whole of China (including Tibet) is +8 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Chinese language is comprised of many different dialects, which some would argue are different languages, because although they share a common writing system, spoken variations of Chinese are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.
Modern Standard Chinese (aka Mandarin, Beijing dialect) is the primary and official language of China. In addition, Mongolian is official in Inner Mongolia, Uighur and Kyrgyz are official in Xinjiang, Zhuang is official in Guangxi; Yue (Cantonese) is official in Guangdong and Tibetan is official in Tibet
Different ‘dialects’ include Yue (Cantonese), Wu (Shanghainese), Minbei (Fuzhou), Minnan (Hokkien-Taiwanese), Xiang, Gan and Hakka dialects.
Most people involved in tourism or business, as well as many students, will speak a good deal of English, however any attempts to speak basic Chinese will be warmly received by the people you meet.
Currency
Renminbi (aka Yuan)
EUR / AUD / US dollars are easily changed in China.
Credit cards and ATM are available in most large cities and hotels, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
International Dialing Code
+86
Electricity
Electricity in China is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. Plugs vary, often from town to town, and can be 3 pronged angled, 2 flat pins or 2 narrow round pins. Plug types  are A, C & I.
Visas
Visas are required for passport holders from the following countries:-
•	Australia
•	New Zealand
•	Canada
•	United States
•	United Kingdom
Details of obtaining visas are provided in your confirmation kit. If you are travelling to China via any other Asian countries please check visa requirements with your reservations consultant.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
