A magical way to explore the Maldives is on a traditional 'dhoni' cruise
Beautiful underwater scenes













xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
In the azure waters of the Indian Ocean, southwest of the Indian subcontinent, sits the Maldives - a glorious chain of more than a thousand small islands, reefs and sandbanks, stretched out like a string of pearls.
With its languid pace, unique culture and outrageous natural beauty, this is a world apart from mainland India and as exotic a tropical island destination as you'll find anywhere on Earth.
Swim and snorkel through crystal clear waters, atop coral reefs teeming with colourful sea life; and relax on the powdery white-sands of some of the world's most perfect beaches.
Discover uninhabited islands; feast on incredible seafood, caught fresh each day; and engage with Maldivian culture as you meet famously friendly locals in small island settlements.
Join us as we cruise between the remote atolls of this spectacular archipelago aboard a traditional dhoni sailboat, exploring deserted beaches and dropping anchor off a new beautiful island each night.

Health & Safety
Weather
The Maldives has a tropical climate and as such there is relatively little change in the overall temperature throughout the year.
Weather is generally warm and humid.
The islands are subject to a double monsoon. The south west monsoon occurs from May to November and the north east monsoon prevails from December to April.
The north east monsoon does not attract the same degree of cloud over or rainfall as the south west monsoon, and the occasional afternoon shower will not detract from your enjoyment of the islands.
Severe monsoon storms are very rare.
Throughout the year daytime temperatures are around the mid 20’s degrees Celsius. Night temperatures are pleasantly warm, although sea breezes can be quite cool.
The hottest month is April and the coldest is December.
Time in Maldives
Maldives is +5 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Dhivehi (official), English
Currency
Maldivian Rufiyaa
The US dollar is the most commonly used foreign currency
We recommend that you bring US dollars (in cash) as it is readily accepted over other currencies.
Credit cards are accepted at many of the beach resorts however it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
Please note that only USD will be accepted while on board Dhoni cruises.
International Dialing Code
+960
Electricity
Electricity in Maldives is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The pin type varies but is most commonly types C, D and G. We recommend taking a universal adapter.
Visas
Australian, British, Canadian, United States and New Zealand passport holders can obtain a free 30 day visa upon arrival in the Maldives provided that you:
*possess a valid passport
*possess a return air ticket
*have proof of sufficient funds (designated as US$50 per day)
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
