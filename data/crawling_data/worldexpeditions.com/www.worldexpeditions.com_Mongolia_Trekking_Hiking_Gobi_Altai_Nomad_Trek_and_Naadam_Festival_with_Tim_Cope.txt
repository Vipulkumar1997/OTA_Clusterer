Trip highlights
Travel with author and adventurer Tim Cope and Mongolian guide Gansukh Baatarsuren on a new exploratory-style journey of the rarely visited Gobi-Altai Mountains in western Mongolia.
Trek (or horse ride, optional) for seven days together with herdsmen of an Oirat tribe along their traditional summer migration trails.
Experience life removed from the mechanical age with the group’s own camel caravan and horses (there are no mechanical means of transport during the trek).
Learn first hand the special story of the Oirat Mongolian people and their connection to the Gobi Altai Mountains, and more broadly the history, and cultural diversity of Western Mongolia.
See the renowned festival of Naadam close up and far from the crowds of Ulaanbaatar.
Camp on the steppe among remote nomad communities in landscapes ranging from desert plains, to rich green summer pastures and snow.
Join adventurer/author Tim Cope, and Mongolian guide Gansukh Baatarsuren, for an exploratory trek through the rarely visited Gobi Altai Mountains of Western Mongolia. Trekking from the desert floor through high summer pastures to sacred ice clad peaks at nearly 4000m, supported by herdsmen with their camels and horses, the journey is both an immersion in the ancient nomadic heritage and the diverse landscapes of the Gobi Altai.
The journey coincides with the summer migration period as the nomads themselves move from desert to mountains.
Accompanied nomad herders and their horses and camels, we will embark on a 7-8 day trek along ancient migratory trails that will see us take in high ridges, passes, and summer pasturelands awash with the wildflowers of early summer and potentially glimpsing wildlife including ibex, marmot, and wolf.  Camp will regularly be made in the vicinity of nomad families. Central to both our journey and the life of the nomads we travel amongst is the ‘Eternal Ice’ mountain to which the nomad men make a pilgrimage every year. The trek will culminate with an optional trek to 3880m, and a traverse to the desert plains on the southern edge of the range.
Having been introduced to the realities of nomad life we will travel to Chandman village for Naadam festival - the national celebration of the three traditional ‘manly sports’ of wrestling, horse racing and archery.The journey will be completed with a visit to Eagle Hunters in the Kazakh province of Bayan Olgiy. Horse riding is an option to complement hiking or instead of hiking.

|
Collapse all
Day 1
Arrive in Ulaanbaatar
You will be met at Ulaanbaatar airport and transferred to the group hotel. Following an orientation tour in the city including a visit to the national museum, and a traditional Mongolian concert, we will meet in the evening for a group dinner and briefing.
Meals:
D
Day 2
Fly to Western Mongolia and drive to Oirat nomad community
Today we fly to the west of Mongolia followed by a three-hour car journey to a small village community of Oirat nomads. We will camp in tents in a wide valley in the shadow of the Gobi Altai. 
The Oirat Mongol tribes of Western Mongolia have their own unique history. They formed their own empire (known as the Zhungar Empire) in the wake of the Mongol Empre collapse. When, in turn, the Zhungar Empire collapsed the Oirats travelled west to the Caspian Sea, before returning to Asia in the 18th century due to Russian oppression. Today the Oirats have their own unique identity and in the Gobi Altai Mountains many of them carry on an ancient way of life using camels for migration.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 3
Full day trek ascending along the 'Never Frozen' valley
After an early start we will drive for one hour to the beginning of the trailhead in the Gobi Altai. Starting at 1800 metres, we will begin our trek with a steep ascent along a dry gully before emerging at a traditional Ovoo – a sacred rock cairn that marks the entry to the mountains and the summer pastures for nomads. Beyond the Ovoo we will skirt around the shores of a lake before entering the first of several gorges in the Never Frozen River valley. Strangely, what begins as a reasonably dry creek bed will become a substantial alpine stream in coming days as we ascend higher into the mountains.  We will camp in the high pastures of a tributary.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 4
Full day trek along high ridge overlooking desert and mountains, following salt trail
Today will be a full and demanding trekking day (weather allowing) to a high ridge that overlooks the desert and mountains to the south. The highest point will be a peak at 3206 metres. In the distance we may be able to see saltpans that are an important resource for nomads. After lunch we will descend from a high pass along a route used by nomads to travel down to collect salt for their animals. Camp will be made in an alpine pasture at 2200 metres. For those not feeling up to the ridge walk there will be the option to travel with the camel caravan up the valley to camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 5
Full day trek along the 'Never Frozen' valley and camp in high summer pastures of nomads
Starting early we will wind our way up the Never Frozen river valley and travel around a spectacular gorge that is usually still choked with snow and ice in the early summer. Following a migratory trail it will soon become clear that this gorge (said to frequented by snow leopards) is the gateway to a high summer camp of nomads. If we are fortunate we may witness families in the midst of migration or setting up their summer abodes. We will travel to the far upper reaches of the river valley and camp among the wildflowers of early summer at around 2800 metres.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 6
Contingency day
Today is built in as a contingency in the case of bad weather, or plane delays. Otherwise we can use this as a day to either rest in the vicinity of camp or do a day walk to the perimeter of the so called ‘Shilin Ovoo’ nomad pastures that drop away abruptly over 1000 metres to the desert floor below. There will also be the opportunity to visit nomad families and witness their daily rituals of herding and milking.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 7
Full day trek past Red Stupa mountain to Cave Mountain pass (3490m)
Starting early, today will be perhaps the most spectacular of trekking days as we wind our way up a steep gully in the shadow of the rocky cliffs and pinnacles of ‘Red Stupa’ mountain. An hour or two into the walk we will come across the sacred ‘Vansimbro’ flowers that are only found at altitude on the remote and inaccessible slopes of the Altai. Our aim will be to trek to the Cave Mountain pass (3490m) with the option of climbing to peaks of 3880 metres that overlook the desert and mountains to the north and south. Weather providing we will also have a clear view of the glacier on ‘Eternal Ice’ peak. We will descend into a steep sided gorge that is used as a summer place for nomads and make camp. For those not feeling up to the high climb to Cave Mountain pass there is a gentler option that traverses Red Stupa mountain. Gentler still is the route with our camel caravan to camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 8
Half day trek ascending to sacred 'Green Lake' (3000m)
No need to leave early today - it will be a moderately difficult half day trek up a valley to the sacred ‘Green Lake’ (3000m). Camp will be made near the shores of the lake and in the shadow of the northern flanks of Eternal Ice Mountain.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
Rest day at Green Lake
Camping for two nights at the Green Lake will give you the opportunity to have time to yourself as you please. Relax by the waters, read a book, climb to a peak, visit local nomad families, or in bad weather simply rest up in your sleeping bag and enjoy food and drink served to you in bed. Tim and Gansukh will be able to accompany you on side excursions and make suggestions.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 10
Full day traverse around sacred 'Eternal Ice' mountain, trek concludes
Today will be a spectacular day of trekking around the western perimeter of the Eternal Ice glacier to the ‘White Rock’ high pass at 3500 metres. A traditional ovoo (cairn) here is adorned with gifts to the gods including wild Argali sheep and ibex horns and skulls. From the pass the view opens up to the plains and distant mountains to the south. The second half of the day will be a descent as we make our way into a southern river valley (home to nomads in the summer) for our final camp. In the evening there will be a special farewell ceremony and feast for our nomad companions. Approx distance: 17km. Gradual descent for most of day, steep descent to camp into gorge.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 11
Visit petroglyph site and drive to Chandman village
After transferring our gear to the cars, we will descend on foot to the desert plains before climbing aboard and driving for most of the day. After a possible visit to petroglyphs we will make the four hour drive to the village of Chandman village – the renowned home of throat singing where we will be witnessing Naadam festivities.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 12
Naadam Festival – horse racing
Naadam is the most important public holiday for all Mongolians. It is the festival of what is known as the ‘three manly sports’ of wrestling, archery, and horse racing. The national televised Naadam in the stadiums of Ulaanbaatar is internationally renowned, but lesser known is that Naadam is celebrated in nomad communities and provincial capitals around the country. For nomads it is as much an opportunity to socialise as it is about the sport and many will travel days by horseback to participate. On the first day we will witness horse racing. Jockeys must be 12 years of age or younger, and it is perhaps the most prestigious of the sports. The symbiosis between horse and man, and the skills of nomads who begin riding before they can walk, will be on display.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 13
Naadam Festival - wrestling
The unique sport of Mongolian wrestling will be on display for our second day of Naadam. Wrestling is held in high esteem in Mongolia, second only to horse racing. After the round-robin style wrestling event is finished we will have the opportunity to watch the award ceremonies when horses and their jockeys are offered fermented horse milk and the horses are praised by traditional song. We will camp in the steppe.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 14
Drive to Olgiy
We enter the Kazakh province of Bayan Olgiy – the westernmost province of Mongolia and home to the most rugged and mountainous region of the country. Tsaast Uuul with its giant dome glacier towers over the steppe is the centre of life for Kazakh nomads of the Altantsögts community. Here we will camp with a Kazakh Eagle hunter who may be able to show us is Golden Eagle. Hunting with Eagles itself takes place in the late autumn after the first snows have fallen.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 15
Visit Eagle Hunter, concert and traditional feast
From Tsaast Uul mountain we will drive to the Kazakh provincial capital of Olgiy – a town that, with its mud brick homes and yurts still has the ambience of traditional Central Asia. The afternoon will be free for visiting the museum, the lively market, and shopping. In the evening we will have a special Kazakh meal and have the privilege of a private concert by local Kazakh artists. The dinner will also be farewell for our Mongolian staff before flying back to Ulaanbaatar. We will be spending the night in a yurt camp where there are  showers and power available.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 16
Fly to Ulaanbaatar
We will enjoy one last breakfast in the west of Mongolia before we catch a flight to Ulaanbaatar. The afternoon is free to enjoy at your leisure.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 17
Day in Ulaanbaatar or contingency
This day a contingency day intentionally built into the trip to allow for uncontrollable changes to the itinerary such as the ever changing schedule of the domestic flights. Assuming we are in Ulaanbaatar, the day will be free to to relax in one of the capitals sidewalk cafes, do some last minute shopping, or visit other sights such as the Winter Palace of Bogd Khaan. This evening we will enjoy our farewell dinner with the group and reflect together one last time on the adventure we have shared.
Meals:
B,D
Day 18
Trip concludes in Ulaanbaatar
Trip concludes following breakfast. Transfers will be organised to take you to the airport.
