Walk or sail the spectacular Amalfi Coast and explore nearby Pompeii, Mount Vesuvius and the island of Capri; or cycle the scenic back roads to Venice and see the famous canal city as few ever do, on an exciting bike or barge trip.
Discover the cuisine, culture and idyllic rolling landscapes of Tuscany by foot or by bike; or head south to Sicily to hike the volcanoes of Mount Etna and Stromboli and explore the islands of the Aeolian archipelago.

Why travel with us
Explore our unrivalled range of active trips in Italy
From the peaks of the Dolomites to Puglia and the vineyards of Tuscany to the canals of Venice, we offer more dedicated walking and cycling trips in Italy than anyone else.
Making Italy affordable
Trips only include what you need like accommodation, meals, bikes on cycle trips, luggage transfers, maps and route directions on self guided trips and an experienced local guide for group trips, as well as the peace of mind that comes with complete backup and support.
See Italy at your own pace
On self guided trips you can expect to receive up-to-date and well researched route notes and maps, seamless luggage transfers and competitive pricing on all essential services. Many self guided trips also have daily departure dates, allowing you to enjoy the convenience and flexibility a self guided trip offers.
Enjoy flexibility and choices
Cycling or walking, 2 star or 4 star, small groups or self guided, land or sea - we can help you explore Europe exactly the way you want.
Travel with experienced mountain guides
Our guided walks in the mountain regions of Italy are led by bilingual, experienced professionals who know the region well. Every guide is first-aid trained and carry appropriate communication devices with them in case of an emergency.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Support of local businesses
Whenever possible, we offer hospitality in family run accommodation, purchase food in local markets and dine in small restaurants.
Employment of local guides
We respect and abide by the working standards required by the Italian law, operating with a strategy that involves employees in our decision making process and allowing them to enjoy a profit share arrangement.
Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics. In the mountains of the Pyrenees and Mont Blanc our local partners reduce the amount of packaging taken on tour and ensure all waste is carried out from refuges that do not have road access to help dispose of it properly.
Supporting local
In the regions that we travel tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by only working with local family run hotels and suppliers so your money supports the community that hosts you.
Paddock to Plate
The paddock to plate across Europe is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Agriturismi
Typically found in Italy, these 'farm stay' style accommodations are found on independently owned working farms. You can expect fantastic local flavours at meal time from your hosts.
Hotels
Often family run, these charming hotels range from 2 to 4 stars and provide access to local living thanks to your hosts. The hospitality is generous and their local knowledge is invaluable. Where possible, we choose locations that add to your experience.
Barges
Think of it as your floating hotel, where each day you experience a different sunrise and sunset location and you unpack only once. Berths range from two lower or bunk bed style but can be upgraded to larger berths with double beds. The bar and dining area is always a popular hangout at the end of each day's activity. The crew includes an onboard cook.
Apartments
Self contained with basic cooking facilities, studio apartments cater for up to two people, with the option to upgrade to larger apartments with bedrooms if you have more in your party.
Refuges or gite hostels
Used mainly on mountain walks, these convivial places add to the atmosphere of your journey through the mountains. Dorms may sleep up to 40 people and the beds are often bunk beds. Linen and blankets are provided and bathrooms are shared. Private rooms may be available, although private gite rooms still use shared bathrooms.

Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Electricity
Electricity in Italy is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas not required for citizens of Australia, Canada, USA and New Zealand for up to 90 days in a period of 180 days for all Schengen countries (see www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/ for countries part of the Schengen). Please ensure your passport is stamped on arrival in the Schengen area. For all other nationalities and for longer stays in countries covered by the Schengen Agreement (Australian New Zealand, Canadian and US passport holders), please contact the relevant embassy. Stays of longer than 90 days in the Schengen area require a long stay visa for the country you are spending most time in. However long stay visas are unlikely to be issued unless there is a valid reason (eg. studying in country). Unfortunately we cannot assist in obtaining visas for long stays due to individual country visa requirements.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
