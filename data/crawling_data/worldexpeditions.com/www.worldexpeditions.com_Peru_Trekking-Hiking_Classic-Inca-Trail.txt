Inca Trail Trip highlights
Trek the famous Inca Trail to Machu Picchu with 3 hearty meals a day on trek prepared by our cooks
Take in the splendour of Cusco with its plazas, markets and cultural wonders
Acclimatise to the altitude whilst strolling through the alleyways and temple ruins of Ollantaytambo before your Inca Trail trek
Experience Machu Picchu in the early morning light
Enjoy the memorable and scenic tourist train from Machu Picchu
The Inca Trail is a superb introduction to trekking in the Andes and the classic hike along the historic Inca Trail to Machu Picchu is considered by many to be one of the great short treks of the world. Importantly, our trek spends ample time in Cusco and the Sacred Valley whilst acclimatising to the altitude before heading out onto the Inca Trail. We ascend the jungle trails and cloud forest to appreciate the panorama of Andean peaks that would have inspired the Inca people as we make our way to Machu Picchu. Words cannot describe the exhilaration of the first sighting of the enigmatic ruins of Machu Picchu. Rather than heading back to Cusco we spend a night in Aguas Calientes, and this vitally gives us the opportunity to visit the majestic ruins at its best, early the following morning.

Introductory
Introductory adventures are designed with the first time trekker in mind. They are challenging enough to make it a real adventure holiday, however the daily physical exercise is around six to eight hours and altitudes generally less than 4,200m. Introductory adventures are not necessarily easy. There will be some long steep ascents and some rough ground to cover.  Remember trekking rarely involves flat terrain. 
Two to three months prior to departure you should spend thirty minutes to one hour exercising, three or four times per week eg. Hard walking, jogging or cycling. To prepare for a walking holiday we recommend you take every opportunity to walk up and down stairs and/or hills, for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness.  Please remember the fitter you are the more you will enjoy your holiday.

Day 1
Arrive in Lima
You will be met at the airport and transferred to the hotel where you are free to rest in the hotel or just wander around Miraflores, the area of Lima where our hotel is located. Some of Lima’s best galleries and shops and restaurants are located in this area. Founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535, Lima is the oldest capital in South America, with a superb combination of Spanish Colonial and 19th century European architecture. If you have time to visit a museum we would recommend the Museo de La Nacion or the Larco Herrera Museum.
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Fly to Cusco - afternoon at leisure
On arrival in Cusco you’ll be met by your guide and transferred from Cusco airport to our hotel located in the historic centre for a short initial briefing and then a few hours of rest, essential to initiate successful acclimatisation before your walk along the Inca Trail. In the evening you’ll have a longer briefing to discuss aspects of the itinerary and in particular the trek.
Meals:
B
Day 3
After breakfast we take a tour of the city and nearby ruins
Every alleyway we enter or corner we turn brings another surprise or enigma in the form of the superbly constructed Inca walls or the more architecturally extravagant colonial churches and palaces. The city, once capital of the extensive Inca Empire, has seen many changes since Francisco Pizarro's men took the city with such apparent ease in November 1533. We also take a short drive to visit the monolithic walls of Sacsayhuaman, spectacularly set above the city. In the afternoon you may have time to explore some of the central parts of the city and a chance to look at some of the great varieties of local craft work on sale in open air stalls and shops.
Meals:
B
Day 4
Drive and walk down into the Sacred Valley of the Incas.
We leave Cusco and head to the Chinchero Plateau to explore Chinchero, an important town in Inca times. The most striking remnant of this period is the massive stone wall in the main plaza which has ten trapezoidal niches.  There are beautiful views overlooking the Sacred Valley of the Incas, with the Cordillera Vilcabamba and the snow-capped peak of Salkantay dominating the western horizon. Chinchero is believed to be the mythical birthplace of the rainbow. Visit the salt mines of Maras. This village is a salt-producing center that dates back all the way to pre-Inca times. There are over 3000 salt pools all carved into the mountain side. Discover Moray's mysterious concentric circular terraces which, according to some scholars, would be an agricultural research center. When the tour is over, we will end up in the Sacred Valley near a good restaurant where we can savour dishes made with locally grown produce. After a leisurely lunch we head for our hotel in the valley. The rest of the day is free to relax and enjoy beauty of this famous valley.
Meals:
B
Day 5
Second day in the Sacred Valley of the Incas
Another day in this beautiful place. The valley actually follows the course of the famous Urubamba River, one of the main tributaries of the Amazon River. During our time in the here we visit some of the enthralling citadels, fortresses and temple ruins that are found along the valley including the site at Ollantaytambo. The village itself is a fascinating mixture of Inca and Colonial architecture. If the weather is good and we have time we can enjoy some short walks in the valley - a good way to prepare for the trek ahead. The evening is spent preparing for the Inca Trail at our hotel.
Meals:
B
Day 6
Inca Trail trek commences
You will be picked up early from your hotel in the Sacred Valley for the drive to Chilca or Piscacucho where we start our first day of trekking.  At this point we meet our trekking guide plus our cooks, porters and camp staff before setting off on this famous ‘Royal Highway of the Incas’, built more than 500 years ago. The first day involves approximately five to six hours of walking. During the first few hours of walking we follow the course of the famous Urubamba River before stopping to admire the archaeological site of Patallacta 2750m (9,020ft) – an ancient Inca city built on a series of terraces below the trail. From here we continue to follow the narrow valley of the Cusichaca River to camp at one of two sites near the village of Huayllabamba – this means we actually avoid the very crowded camp sites within the village used by most of the trekkers on the Inca Trail. Camp.
*Important: Please be aware that, because of the Peruvian authorities' new rules on the Inca Trail, there may be changes in the actual trek itinerary and the campsites we use.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 7
Trek towards first pass
Next morning we continue up this narrow valley on the left bank of the river - whose source is one of the great glaciers of Mt Salcantay. We then start a relatively steep climb up this classic trail towards the first pass – Warmihuañusca 4,200m (13,700ft). After a rest at the pass and time to take in the spectacular views we descend steeply into the Pacamayo Valley where we spend our second night on the Inca Trail. Camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 8
Trek over second and third pass to Wiñay Wayna
Today is the longest day of the trek. After breakfast in our campsite in the verdant Pacamayo Valley we start ascending towards the small but impressively set ruins at Runkuraqay and on to Cochapata set just below the second pass at 3,900m (12,800ft). From here we walk the short distance to the pass and then descend past a mysterious small green lake to the large ruins of Sayacmarca and on to the last pass at 3,800m (12,450ft) which is more like a low ridge-line than a true pass. From here we get a great view down into the forested gorge of the Urubamba River set more than 1700 metres below us. A short hike from here takes us over the Phuyupatamarca Pass at 3,700m (12,140ft), aptly named the ‘City in the Clouds’. We walk down along an incredibly well preserved section of the Inca Trail with great white granite slab walls and staircases all impressively set in high jungle to our final campsite at Wiñay Wayna, 2,679m (8,790ft).
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
Final day of trek to Machu Picchu, guided tour of Machu Picchu, to Aguas Calientes
After breakfast we walk the last few kilometres to finally reach Inti Punku (The Gateway to the Sun) awe-inspiringly set above the ‘lost city’ of Machu Picchu 2,400m (7,900ft). Your first view of the ruins really does take your breath away! We will enjoy a guided tour of the sanctuary followed by time to explore this fascinating site at your own pace (with the accompaniment of the guide). We return by bus down to Aguas Calientes for lunch (at your own expense) and check in to our hotel. Time for a well deserved soak in the nearby hot springs (optional). We say farewell to our trekking guide and some of the Inca Trail trekkers returning to Cusco this afternoon. Overnight: El Mapi hotel. 
*Important: Peruvian authorities have  implemented entry restrictions to protect Machu Picchu from the impact of its immense popularity. As of 1st July 2017 there are three time slots in which patrons can enter Machu Picchu for a maximum of four hours and must follow one of three predetermined routes. Additionally, all visitors much be accompanied by a guide at all times. These changes have been made to improve the visitor experience and in an effort to deal with overcrowding. World Expeditions endeavour to ensure you get the most of your Machu Picchu experience regardless of these restrictions.
Meals:
B
Day 10
Explore Machu Picchu and return to Cusco
This morning we drive up to the ruins in time for the opening and savour the views and the atmosphere as the light changes as the sun rises. We have another guided tour visiting the sites that you may have missed yesterday. After the official tour ends, you will have more time in the company of the guide to continue exploring this incredible site. In the afternoon or early evening we depart from Machu Picchu for the train ride back to Ollantaytambo where we transfer to our vehicle for the drive back to Cusco. Overnight in Cusco – hotel. NB - depending on train schedules, we may arrive into Cusco very late at night.
OPTIONAL HUAYNA PICCHU CLIMB OR MACHU PICCHU MOUNTAIN CLIMB - For the more adventurous, you can purchase an additional Huayna Picchu or Machu Picchu Mountain permit (ask us for costs), and forego the guided tour of Machu Picchu which is non-refundable and non-transferable. Please be aware that this is NOT a guided climb, and it takes minimum 2.5 hours (45 mins up & 45 mins down and some time at the top). Both climbs are very steep (including many small and narrow steps) and can be slippery and are quite very exposed with vertiginous drops. Before purchasing the permit on your behalf (non-refundable and non-transferable), we require any passengers to sign a waiver form. Note - there are limited Huayna Picchu permits and they sell out fast.
