xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Exotic, ancient, mystical, colourful, challenging - Morocco is an intoxicating country that has long attracted writers, poets, artists and dreamers; convincing countless visitors to stay for good.
The narrow labyrinthine streets and walled medinas of ancient imperial cities; the overwhelming bustle of colourful markets; the undulating sand dunes and palm-fringed oases of the Sahara; dramatic peaks and remote kasbahs of the Atlas Mountains; the whitewashed, wind-battered ramparts of Essaouira; the mosques, the beaches, the camels, the Roman ruins, the piles of vibrant spices and Berber carpets - Morocco is a sensory overload in the best possible way.
Lose yourself in narrow backstreets; shop for gorgeous textiles and leatherwork in ancient souks; and explore mosques, museums and medinas in the imperial cities of Marrakech and Fes.
Marvel at the stunning mountain town of Chefchaouen with its distinctive blue-washed homes; and sample delicious seafood in the charming white-washed fishing town of Essaouira.
Cycle the High and Anti Atlas Mountains, traversing the exhilarating mountain passes and picturesque valleys of North Africa's highest mountains; and enjoy warm hospitality as you trek through remote Berber villages and climb to the summit of Morocco's highest peak, Mount Toubkal.
Explore the stark beauty of the Sahara Desert by camel and camp among the sand dunes in a Berber camp set beneath a thousand stars; and explore the legendary kasbahs, alleys and fortresses of Ait Benhaddou - Morocco's best-preserved earthen city, immortalised in iconic scenes from Indiana Jones and Game of Thrones.
Whichever itinerary you choose, you won't regret a visit to this endlessly fascinating and outrageously photogenic country.

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in Morocco. When you book one of our adventures you are supporting sustainability in the region's natural environments, local communities and cultures.
Authentic experiences
Our Morocco program caters to every interest with activities including an exhilarating ascent of Mount Toubkal, exploring exotic souqs and historic cities, indulging in Moroccan cuisine and discovering the fascinating Berber culture. Our adventures are designed to show you the authentic side of Morocco, with even the most experience traveller finding inspiration within our range of itineraries.
Ultimate value
All of our Morocco tours feature comfortable accommodation, private vehicles, helpful crews and intriguing touring options. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the trip cost such as most meals, transfers, entry and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
Our exceptional guides have a passion for the mountains and are enthusastic about sharing their extensive knowledge of Morocco's imperial history and cultural gems with you, ensuring your visit is the trip of a lifetime.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Minimal environmental impact
On our treks we avoid polluting water by camping away from wells and springs. Additionally guides encourage travellers to preserve water in sensitive places, which entails using wet wipes instead of washing in the desert. We do not make camp fires in areas with limited wood resources, and group litter is carried out from the camp. When cooking, kitchen staff use gas instead of fire wood. .
Animal welfare focus
We advocate for cruelty free animal encounters and adhere to our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct. Our guides, cooks and muleteers are trained to follow good practice in relation to the use of mules and camels, they have the power to add extra mules or camels when required.
Support of local communities
All of our suppliers are local businesses from the mule and camel handlers to vendors for fresh food products. We rotate through small local businesses to spread the revenue derived from tourism, and encourage travellers to purchase their goods from the same.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Riads
Riads are traditional houses usually with an internal courtyard, garden or water feature that reflect the Moroccan culture and feel like a soothing oasis after a day of exploring.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Desert camps
These permanent safari camps in the desert use traditional Berber tents and decor, with the added ambience of being under a thousand stars.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Homestays
Gain wonderful insight into the local culture during a homestay, a style of accommodation where a local family opens their home to you.

Leaders in the field
Youssef Elouali Kaissar
Youssef is a Berber from the High Atlas Mountains. He studied at Marrakesh University before completing his mountain guide qualification in 1994. While his love for the mountains is unmistaken, Youssef is also highly regarded for his extensive knowledge of the imperial history of Morocco. The union of the two also makes Youssef an ideal guide to develop new treks and tours for our travellers.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

Weather
Major factors influencing Morocco’s climate are its mountain ranges, desert and coastline.
Morocco’s prevailing climate is strongly influenced by elevation, with the Rif and High Atlas Mountains experiencing significantly higher precipitation and creating a noticeable rain shadow effect. Snow is common at elevations above 2,000 m (6,500 ft).
South of the Anti-Atlas Mountains, semiarid conditions give way to the true desert conditions of the Sahara. A hot, dry and dusty wind called the Chergui (or Sharqi) blows across the Sahara each year in late spring or summer, sweeping over the mountains and penetrating the lowlands and even coastal cities. Similar to the Sirocco wind that blows across the Sahara and over northeastern Africa and southern Europe, the powerful Chergui dramatically increases temperatures and can cause extensive damage to crops.
Coastal and northern Morocco experiences a typical Mediterranean climate of hot dry summers and wet mild winters. Rainfall is low, and gradually decreases moving north to south, although torrential downpours occasionally cause damaging flooding. Coastal breezes from the Mediterranean and Atlantic oceans effects temperatures in the coastal lowlands, resulting in noticeably cooler summers and warmer winters than further inland.
In Marrakech, average daily temperatures range from a minimum of 5.2°C (41°F) to a maximum of 17.4°C (63°F) in January, to a minimum of 20.1°C (68°F) to a maximum of 37.9°C (100°F) in July.
In Casablanca, average daily temperatures range from a minimum of 7.2°C (45°F) to a maximum of 17.1°C (63°F) in January, to a minimum of 20.1°C (68°F) to a maximum of 26.2°C (79°F) in July.
If you are visiting Morocco in December and January it is important to bring warm clothes, and be prepared for a variety of temperatures. Also, not all hotels and restaurants have heating and you’ll often find it’s colder inside than outside.
On Mt Toubkal, the weather is unpredictable, however is likely to be very cold and windy. It is important that you are prepared.
Time in Morocco
Morocco observes UTC/GMT
Language
Morocco’s major languages are Arabic (official), Tamazight (official) and French
Arabic is the major national language and is spoken by two-thirds of the population. Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is based on the classical 7th-century Arabic used in the Quran (Islam’s holy text), and is the formal language used in academia, religious texts, official government documents, in newspapers and in television news; but is very rarely used in spoken or informal contexts. Moroccan Arabic (known as Darija) is the colloquial language used in everyday speech, in arts and advertising, on social media and in other non-formal communications
Tamazight, the major language of the Amazigh (Berber) people, became an official language of Morocco in 2011 and is spoken by around one-third of the population. Tachelhit, Tarifit and various other Berber languages and dialects are also spoken. Hassaniya Arabic, which originated with the Beni Hassan Bedouin tribe, is spoken in Morocco’s extreme south, where it has almost completely replaced Tamazight and other Berber languages
Modern Standard Arabic and Tamazight are taught nationally in schools, as is French. French is an important secondary language and is used in legal proceedings, commerce, diplomacy and government settings. An estimated 20,000 in the north speak Spanish, and English is increasingly used as an alternative foreign language
Currency
Moroccan Dirham
EURO is the most widely accepted currency, although USD is also accepted.
Credit cards can be used in the major centres such as Casablanca, Fes and Marrakesh.
ATM machines are common in major centres and it is no problem obtaining money from these.
International Dialing Code
+212
Electricity
Electricity in Morocco is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas are exempt for passport holders from the following countries:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
