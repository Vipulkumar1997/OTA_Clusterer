Situated just below the equator in the eastern sector of the South Pacific, Papua New Guinea is a stunning archipelago of more than 600 islands, rich with history, diverse and colourful cultures, stunning landscapes and abundant flora and fauna.
Cruise the spectacular azure waters of the Louisiade Archipelago and visit a paradise of tropical islands, lagoons and barrier reefs while immersing yourself in Papua New Guinean history and culture.
Or tackle the historic Kokoda Track, following in the heroic footsteps of history as you walk across the geographical heart of Papua New Guinea. You'll learn the fascinating WWII history of the region from your expert historian guide as you trek through dense lowland rainforest and remote highlands, staying in secluded jungle camps and experiencing traditional village life and vibrant local cultures.
We take ten days to cover the iconic 96 km trail, allowing plenty of time to embrace local history and culture and to acclimatise to local conditions. By the time we complete the final stages from the highlands into the township of Kokoda, you'll be moved by a tremendous sense of accomplishment at having finished this challenging historical journey.
Join us as we traverse this beautiful country, discovering its cultural, environmental and historical treasures.

Leaders in the field
Shane Goodwin
Shane has completed over 20 expeditions as head guide and has led numerous tours within PNG on a regular basis. Shane is a qualified and licensed outdoor recreation guide under the Australian National Training framework and has had extensive experience in leading treks along the Kokoda Track and ascending Mt Wilhelm where he loves to see our travellers reach their goals safely. After trekking Kokoda for the first time he fell in love with the Kokoda Track and its people. Shane has a keen military history interest spending many hours studying the battles which took place on the Kokoda Track. His relationship with the villagers is noted by our clients and some of this may be attributed to his ability to speak Tok Pisin (pidgin English) which is widely spoken in PNG. Shane has a strong relationship with the local villagers who enjoy working with him; many have family members who work as porters and guides in his local crew.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it.

Health & Safety
Weather
Papua New Guinea has a climate which can best be described as tropical.  The coastal plains average temperature is around 28°C, the inland and mountain areas average around 26°C, and the higher mountain regions, 23°C. The area's relative humidity is quite high and generally speaking the dry season extends from June to September, and the rainy season is December to mid March.
Time in Papua New Guinea
Papua New Guinea is +10 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Tok Pisin (official), English (official), Hiri Motu (official), plus 836 indigenous languages
Currency
Papua New Guinean Kina
It is strongly recommended to convert your money to local currency (the Kina) at Port Moresby Airport. There is a money change office in the baggage collection area, before customs.
Money can be changed outside of PNG if you request it far enough in advance but rates are often lower than at Port Morseby Airport.  As a last resort, money can be changed in Port Moresby itself but it is a time consuming and sometimes frustrating process. Money changing is extremely difficult in Popondetta or Buna and should not be relied upon.
Credit cards are next to useless in PNG. Accommodation in Port Moresby will usually accept Visa and Mastercard for payment (with large merchant fees) however they will not supply cash.
There are a few ATMs in Port Moresby only that will accept overseas cards (usually takes a journey by vehicle to find them) and there are NONE in Popondetta or Buna.
You can withdraw money from the ATM in the Ela Beach Hotel in Port Moresby; check with your bank for fees and charges.
International Dialing Code
+675
Electricity
Electricity in Papua New Guinea is 240 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is I. (Aust - 3 flat prong).
Visas
Visas are required for passport holders from the following countries for a stay of up to 60 days:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
Australian passport holders only can now secure a 30 day, free tourist visa on arrival at Port Moresby International Airport and other designated international airports in Papua New Guinea.
Details of obtaining visas are provided in your confirmation kit. All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
