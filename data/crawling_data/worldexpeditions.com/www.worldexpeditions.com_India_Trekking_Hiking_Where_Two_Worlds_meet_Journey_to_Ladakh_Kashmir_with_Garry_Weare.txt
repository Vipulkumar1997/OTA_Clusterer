To determine the grade of a particular adventure we consider a number of factors. These include the condition of the walking terrain, the altitude, the number of pass crossings and the length of the trek. 
The Journey to Kashmir & Ladakh with Garry Weare is graded introductory to moderate. In order to complete a moderate trek we advise that you undertake regular exercise – swimming, cycling, jogging, three or four times a week for at least three months prior to your departure.

Day 1
Join Delhi
On arrival in Delhi you will be met by a World Expeditions representative and transferred to your hotel. The remainder of the day is free to explore Delhi and sightseeing tours can be arranged. Due to the differing times of arrivals of group members, a group meeting will not be held until the following morning.  Note: As an alternative to arriving in Delhi on a late night flight, you may wish to consider arriving the day before the trip commences. Please talk to your World Expeditions reservations consultant or your travel agent for pre-tour accommodation options.
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Fly Leh
We board early morning flight from Delhi to Leh (3505m) where you will be rewarded with spectacular views across the Great Himalaya and Zanskar ranges. On arrival in Leh it is essential to rest and start the all-important process of acclimatization (and also catch up with some sleep after the very early morning start). Our schedule today will be flexible and depend on how everyone is adjusting to the altitude. In the afternoon we will have the opportunity to climb to the Victory Fort (above the Palace) built in the 15th century to commemorate Ladakh’s independence from the invading armies from Baltistan and Kashmir. From the Palace we can also appreciate the alleyways that comprise the old town of Leh, located to the east of the main bazaar and appreciate the wonderful panoramic view back over the Indus Valley to the south. You’re sure to fall in love with Ladakh from this great vantage point!
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 3
In Leh
Today we have a full day sightseeing some of the outlying forts and monasteries in the Indus Valley. We include a visit to Shey Palace – the capital of upper Ladakh - until the Royal family moved to Leh in the 17th century. We also visit the nearby Tikse Monastery perched on the summit of a sugarloaf mountain overlooking the Indus Valley. Tikse was founded in the 14th century after the Dalai Lama sent monks to Ladakh and the outlying regions of West Tibet. The monastery is situated in a commanding position in the Indus Valley with the monk’s chambers spreading down the hillside below the main Assembly Hall. Note the presence here of the new multi - denominational chapel that was completed a decade ago. It was built with the assistance of tourist funds and is proof of the continuing vitality of Buddhism in Ladakh. In the evening we can either wander up to Shanti Stupa for a magnificent sunset or relax around our hotel in the comfortable grounds.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 4
In Leh
We drive to Stok Palace and undertake walks in the gorges above the village which afford an ideal introduction to the trek we are undertaking the following day. Returning to Leh we have an opportunity to meet with representatives of the local Snow Leopard Conservancy as well as the medical staff and organisers of the Australian Himalayan Foundation amchi program supporting the traditional medical practices in remote regions of Ladakh.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 5
Commence trek to Rumbak Village (drive approx. 1 hr, walk approx. 3 hrs)
From Leh we drive to Zinchen (3380m), a small settlement to the south of the Indus Valley. After our packhorses are loaded we head up a spectacular gorge to our campsite (3850m) below the village of Rumbak.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 6
At Rumbak Village
An opportunity to acclimatise. We undertake day walks to Rumbak village and up a side valley leading to the base of the Stok La that affords spectacular views of the Trans Himalaya.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 7
Trek to base of Ganda La (Walk 3 hours, 8km)
A short day following a trail that winds up past the solitary house at Yurutse to our camp (4350m) at the base of the approach to the Ganda La. From camp there are impressive views of Stok Kangri. That afternoon we undertake a more challenging walk that heads way above the scree slopes to a magnificent viewpoint affording views back down to the Indus Valley and across to the high peaks that form the Stok Kangri range.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 8
Cross Ganda La to Shogdo village via Ganda La (walk approx. 6 hrs)
Above our camp we gain views of the snow-capped Stok Range. After gradually ascending a series of switchbacks we make the final gradual ascent to the Ganda La (4950m). From the pass there are views south across the endless folds of the Zanskar Range and the snow capped summits of the main Himalaya Range before completing the gradual descent to the village of Shingo (4150m).
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
Trek to Chilling village (Walk 4/5hrs), transfer to Alchi Monastery (Walk 5 hours, 14km, Drive 2 hours)
Below Shogdo the trail enters a narrow gorge where willow, poplar and rose bushes provide a natural canopy alongside the river course. The Skiu monastery (3435m) marks the confluence of the stream coming from Shogdo and the Markha Valley. From Skiu we head down to the pulley bridge over the Zanskar river to the village of Chilling. After saying goodbye to our crew we drive to Alchi monastery alongside a secluded stretch of the Indus River. Alchi is famous for its collection of Kashmiri influenced Buddhist art, dating from the period prior to the establishment of Buddhism in Tibet. It is a marvelous presentation of Buddhist iconography and will add to your appreciation of the rich and diverse religious history of Ladakh.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 10
Transfer to Lamayuru (Drive 3 to 4 hours)
Drive to Lamayuru and transfer to our comfortable hotel, which is located at the monastery. Lamayuru monastery is set in a commanding location high above the Indus River. The 10th century monastery is one of the largest and oldest in this region of Ladakh and includes a cave inside the main Assembly Hall that is said to be where the Buddhist sage Naropa meditated.
Meals:
B,L,D

We return to Leh, rest of the day free for local sightseeing and shopping

Meals:
B,L,D
Day 13-16
Explore Srinagar
Over the next four days in and around Srinagar (the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir), we explore the lakes and waterways, Moghul gardens, mosques, ancient sites and distinctive wooden architecture of the merchant houses that once lined the Jhelum River. We’ll also see remnants of
Kashmir’s pre-Islamic Buddhist and Hindu past. We have a rich array of places to visit and artisans to meet. These include visits to the Shalimar and Nishat Moghul gardens and lunch at nearby dhabas. We’ll walk through the old city, past merchant houses along the Jhelum River, visiting Shah Hamadan and Jama Masqid mosques on the way. You’ll meet great characters like Sadiq Wani (aka Suffering Moses) - generations of his family have commissioned art and handicrafts and run the best papier-mache showroom in the city. We’ll visit the Government Arts Emporium (located in the former Residency) before wandering along the Bund to the Sri Pratap Singh Museum. We’ll spend a full day visiting Dara Village, set amongst walnut and apple orchards, and situated beyond ancient Buddhist architectural remains at Harvan. We’ll meet beekeepers, visit the home of artisans who spend months embroidering Kashmiri shawls for wealthy patrons, and makers of copperware. We walk up hill to a picnic spot by the river before visiting the Gujjar shepherds and observing their traditional way of life.
A very early morning start will take us by shikara to the floating vegetable markets. Gliding along the backwaters before first light has a magic of its own as dawn breaks over the lake. We return via a local honey producers’ home situated on the banks of the backwaters, then head home to the houseboats for a shower and breakfast. Mid morning we set off again to visit Pari Mahal “Palace of the Fairies”. From this vantage point there are stunning views of Dal Lake and the snow capped ridges of the Pir Panjal range. Afternoon arrangements are free and could include a walk to nearby Hazrabal or a lazy few hours watching the world float by from the intricately carved cedar verandah at the back of the houseboat.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 17-18
Lalit Hotel, Srinagar
On the way to the Lalit Palace Hotel we’ll visit traditional shawl weavers as well as papier macheartisans, in their homes. These skilled artisans have been following family craft traditions forgenerations.
