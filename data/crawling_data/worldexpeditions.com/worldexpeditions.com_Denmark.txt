Denmark is well known for its cutting edge design, stylish locals and gorgeous capital city, but perhaps lesser-known to foreigners is Denmark’s natural beauty. With its idyllic scenery, gentle terrain and serious bike culture, this is one country perfectly suited to a cycling holiday. Join one of our exciting Berlin to Copenhagen by Bike self-guided departures and get a taste of beautiful Denmark, at your own pace.
After exploring Berlin and rural northern Germany at handlebar level, you’ll board a ferry bound for the southern islands of the Danish archipelago, starting with the island of Falster, where you’ll cycle north through pretty scenes of forests, canals and beaches to the medieval town of Nykøbing.
Continuing along coastal trails to the heritage town of Stubbekøbing, you’ll board a ferry once more and continue island-hopping, exploring the picturesque fishing villages of Bogø island and the thatched houses, gothic churches and striking steep chalk cliffs of Møn island.
Cycle past scenic coastal stretches, charming cottages and country houses as you make your way towards your final destination—the beautiful capital of Copenhagen. With its photogenic cityscape of storybook architecture and cobblestoned streets filled with chic shopping, Danish design stores, museums, monuments and some of the world’s best bars and restaurants; it won’t take you long to fall in love with this incredible small city.
Take a look at our exciting Berlin to Copenhagen by Bike itinerary and start planning your Danish adventure!

Denmark highlights

Copenhagen
You won't feel out of place on two wheels in this vibrant and cosmopolitan city.
Island of Falster
Dikes, small forests and pristine beaches; one of Denmark's most beautiful landscapes.
Island of Mon
From impressive white cliffs to medieval gothic churches, this remarkable island is packed with highlights.








xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Why travel with us
Making Denmark affordable
Our Denmark trips only include what you need like accommodation, meals, bikes on cycle trips, luggage transfers, maps and route directions on self guided trips and an experienced local guide for group trips, as well as the peace of mind that comes with complete backup and support.
Explore Denmark at your own pace
On self guided trips you can expect to receive up-to-date and well researched route notes and maps, seamless luggage transfers and competitive pricing on all essential services. Many self guided trips also have daily departure dates, allowing you to enjoy the convenience and flexibility a self guided trip offers.
Enjoy flexibility and choices
Cycling or walking, 2 star or 4 star, small groups or self guided, land or sea - we can help you explore Europe exactly the way you want.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics. In the mountains of the Pyrenees and Mont Blanc our local partners reduce the amount of packaging taken on tour and ensure all waste is carried out from refuges that do not have road access to help dispose of it properly.
Supporting local
In the regions that we travel tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by only working with local family run hotels and suppliers so your money supports the community that hosts you.
Paddock to Plate
The paddock to plate across Europe is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
Often family run, these charming hotels range from 2 to 4 stars and provide access to local living thanks to your hosts. The hospitality is generous and their local knowledge is invaluable. Where possible, we choose locations that add to your experience.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Electricity
Electricity in Denmark is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas not required for citizens of Australia, Canada, USA and New Zealand for up to 90 days in a period of 180 days for all Schengen countries (see www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/ for countries part of the Schengen). Please ensure your passport is stamped on arrival in the Schengen area. For all other nationalities and for longer stays in countries covered by the Schengen Agreement (Australian New Zealand, Canadian and US passport holders), please contact the relevant embassy. Stays of longer than 90 days in the Schengen area require a long stay visa for the country you are spending most time in. However long stay visas are unlikely to be issued unless there is a valid reason (eg. studying in country). Unfortunately we cannot assist in obtaining visas for long stays due to individual country visa requirements.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
