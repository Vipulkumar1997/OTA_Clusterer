The Svalbard archipelago—also known as Spitsbergen—is a remote Arctic wilderness dotted with dramatic landforms and abundant wildlife. Located just 650 miles from the North Pole, this is one of the last true European wilderness areas, where you can expect to train your camera lens on impressive jagged peaks, colossal glaciers, deep fjords and vast ice plateaus. It’s also one of the best places to position yourself to catch a glimpse of the elusive Aurora Borealis or see Polar Bear in their natural habitat.
It’s here that the world’s northernmost settlement can be found in Longyearbyen, the bustling starting point for your Arctic adventure. Join us as we cruise the stunning northern reaches of Iceland, Greenland and Norway and watch the rugged coastlines of Svalbard reveal a breathtaking landscape rich with diverse wildlife.
Explore the waters around Svalbard, home to ringed and bearded seals, walrus and beluga whales, and head ashore to discover reindeer, Arctic foxes and large flocks of migratory birds. Spot polar bears at play, trek across tundra, and explore the otherworldly beauty of the European Arctic by zodiac and sea kayak.
Take a look at our unique Arctic itineraries and be one of the lucky few to experience the serene beauty of this remarkable environment.

European Arctic highlights

Search for Polar Bear
Any trip to the Arctic region inspires the imagination with the hope of seeing Polar Bear in the wild. With a population of over 3000 bears, Spitsbergen certainly provides travellers with some of the best possibilities to make this dream a reality.
Chase the Aurora Borealis
The 'Aurora Borealis' or 'Northern Lights' as it is also known is one the world's greatest natural phenonimums. Join one of our voyages which are timed to give travellers the best chance to witness this spectacular explosion of light.
See the Arctic flowers bloom
During the warmer summer months the tundra in the European Arctic explodes in a mass of colour and life. Hundreds of wildflowers cover the ground and the mosses and lichens erupt into brilliant shades of reds, greens and yellows.
Wildlife watching
Spend your days wildlife watching! Opportunities abound to see Walrus, Seals, Arctic Fox and numerous species of migratory birds.
Explore East Greenland
Very few travellers walk amongst the majestic scenery which can be found along Greenland's remote east coast. Join us as we zodiac cruise and hike this magnificent region.
Kayak in Scoresby Sund
Scoresby Sund is one of Greenland's largest fjords. This spectacular inlet provides a perfect backdrop for kayaking the numerous waterways which traverse it.
Experience Inuit culture
The Inuit community at Ittoqqortoormiit is one of the remotest places on earth. Frozen in for more than nine months a year, tourism is a relatively new industry for the locals. Traditional music, arts and crafts are just a few of the experiences on offer here.








xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
The Polar Regions are pristine natural environments. Preserving them for future generations is not just important, but essential. We are associate members of The International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators and founding members of The Association of Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operators.
Exploratory Voyages, not Cruises
We use vessels that carry no more than 132 passengers, giving us access to areas that are unavailable to the larger cruise ships. We focus on spending time ashore to enjoy the spontaneity of wildlife encounters, hearing from experts in research stations and observing sculptured ice formations from our zodiacs. No two trips are the same.
Widest Choice of Voyages
We have a diverse selection of voyages and departures to choose from. Don’t want to travel the Drake Passage in both directions? Take one of our voyages that fly to King George Island. Sit amongst a million king penguins on South Georgia or search for polar bears in North Spitsbergen.
Expert Guides, Lecturers and Crew
Our people are the best in the business—passionate individuals who have dedicated decades to polar exploration and tourism. From our Russian captains and crew to our expert naturalists and lecturers, their combined knowledge will truly enhance your polar experience.
Real Interaction with the Polar Regions
With us you can fully savour the spectacular landscapes of the Polar Regions by getting active. Cross South Georgia on foot, camp out on the ice for a night or try your hand at a range of activities including kayaking, diving or snow shoeing on one of our base camp voyages.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Environmental conservation
When visiting continents rich in wildlife and home to fragile and pristine environments, such as those found in the Polar regions, the importance of travelling responsibility is extreme if we are to preserve them for future generations. We are an Associate B2 Member of the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators, operating within the parameters of the Antarctic Treaty System. In the Arctic, we abide by the guidelines set by the Association of Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operators.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Comfortable expedition cruising vessels
Our vessels are specifically designed with expedition cruising in mind. Cabins range from quadruple berths right through to spacious suites, accommodating all budgets and tastes. Most cabins have private bathrooms; however some share a bathroom between a small number of other cabins. Public areas include dining quarters, lecture theatres, a bar and a library and some of our ships also have spas and gymnasiums aboard.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Expedition Staff
Our polar expedition leaders and crew are specialists in wilderness environments with years of experience in the field. Your Expedition Leader will be highly skilled in communication and decision making, along with wilderness first aid and safety. It will be their job to ensure the expedition runs smoothly and that as many of our itinerary objectives are met whilst ensuring all participants safety and wellbeing. Your tour leader will be assisted by an expedition team, which may include a variety of polar specialists including geologists, ornithologists, marine biologists, naturalists and historians. There is also a resident medical officer on board each voyage. During the trip all of the team will impart their knowledge of the environments, as well as acting as zodiac drivers, lecturer’s, dinner companions and all round great travel buddies!










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Health & Safety
Weather
Summer in Spitsbergen is from June to September and the temperature is surprisingly mild. The midnight sun brings 24 hour daylight, and temperatures generally range from –10 to +15 degrees Celsius. Precipitation is unlikely. Day time temperatures in Greenland throughout summer range from 10 – 18 degrees celsius in the south, and between 5 – 10 degrees celsius in the north. Fog is common around all coasts, especially in the far south, but it frequently lifts before noon, or doesn’t roll in until late afternoon.
Time in European Arctic
Svalbard is +2 hours ahead of GMT/UTC
Language
Norwegian
Currency
In Svalbard the official currency is Danish Kroner.  Payment of incidental expenses aboard most ships can be paid for with US dollars cash, Euro or with Visa and Mastercards.
International Dialing Code
+47
Electricity
We recommend taking a universal adapter.
Visas
Svalbard is not part of the Schengen area. Norwegian authorities do not require a visa for visiting Svalbard, but as most transport links connect Svalbard with Norway, foreigners with visa requirements to Norway/the Schengen area will need a valid visa to travel through the Schengen area.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
