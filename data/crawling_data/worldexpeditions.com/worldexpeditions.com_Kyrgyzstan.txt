xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
With spectacular landscapes, untouched and unspoiled by crowds, Kyrgyzstan is superbly suited to outdoor adventuring. Dominated by rugged mountains, this gorgeous country is also blessed with fertile valleys, impossibly-blue lakes and rolling grasslands dotted with traditional yurt encampments where ancient cultures persist.
After exploring the museums and monuments of Bishkek, you'll want to get straight out into Kyrgyzstan's wild landscapes. Explore the lonely high-altitude beauty of Lake Son-Kul and Lake Issyk-Kul; then head to the stunning "Celestial Mountains" of Tian Shan to trek through lush valleys, alpine meadows and over mountain passes, with huge skies overhead and snowcapped peaks in the distance.
Tackle a unique mountain biking adventure that will see you cycling along glacier-fed rivers and over rolling grasslands carpeted in wildflowers, enjoying rocky jeep track ascents, adrenalin-pumping downhill sprints and two days of unforgettable heli-biking in the lush Karkara Valley, camping at Karkara Base Camp. Out in this rugged wilderness, the only traffic you?re likely to encounter will be the occasional horseman or nomadic shepherd moving their herds to higher pastures.
Combine a trek to the base of Peak Lenin (7,134 m / 23,406 ft) with a cultural tour of the ancient Silk Road cities of Uzbekistan on our unique Peak Lenin Base Camp itinerary; or for the adventurous climber, consider a challenging expedition to summit Peak Lenin under the guidance of expert mountaineer Simon Yates.
Whichever itinerary you choose, you won't regret a visit to this little-visited gem of Central Asia!

We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
