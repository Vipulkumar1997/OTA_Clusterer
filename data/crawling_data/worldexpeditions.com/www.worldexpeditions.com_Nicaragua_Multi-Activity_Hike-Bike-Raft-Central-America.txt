Day 1
Arrival in Nicaragua – Transfer to Granada
On arrival a representative will meet you in Managua to take you to your hotel in Granada, 45 minutes away.
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Granada – Masaya Volcano Hike
We head up to the Masaya Volcano for a peak into the throat of this active volcano. Visitors are only permitted to be close to the edge of the volcano for a few minutes as the gases can be quite toxic. Just above the crater another dormant volcano within the same caldera, offers great hiking with great views of Lake Masaya below. Then back to Granada for lunch and a free afternoon to explore Nicaragua's famed colonial city.
Meals:
B
Day 3
Mombacho Volcano Zip Lining – Isla Ometepe
Our journey south through the last 3 countries of Central America begins today. The first stop is Mombacho Volcano for some adrenaline - zip lining through the forest, then visit a coffee plantation. We continue south to San Jorge to the ferry across Isla Ometepe, an hour on the fresh water lake. Ometepe is one of the world’s largest islands on a freshwater lake and home to two massive volcanoes - Conception and Madreas. End the day with a swim in refreshing natural springs of Ojo de Agua.
Meals:
B,L
Day 4
Isla Ometepe – San Juan del Sur Beach
On the way back to the ferry we make a stop at a small local museum that features an impressive collection of Nicaraguan money. The exhibit tells the history of Nicaragua through its money beginning with chocolate beans until the current printed and minted money. Less than an hour away, after crossing the ferry, we reach San Juan del Sur Beach on the Pacific. The rest of the afternoon is free to enjoy the beach and maybe even do a bit of body surfing. The town is quite lively so you will get some local flavor.
Meals:
B
Day 5
Border crossing into Costa Rica – Bike along Lake Arenal
Back on the road for our first border crossing entering Costa Rica, the second country of our journey. Like all border crossings in Latin America it may take a couple of hours, so relax and prepare to have your passport checked several times. As we cross into Costa Rica the scenery begins to change when we start climbing into the mountains towards the active Arenal Volcano. Lunch is in the town of Nuevo Arenal on the banks of lake Arenal, and a walk around town. Now for one of the nicest mountain bike rides in Costa Rica, along Lake Arenal, past the volcano and down to the town of La Fortuna (35 kms in length with some fun, hilly sections, culminating with a great downhill ride into town). Good news - the next 2 nights are at the same hotel in La Fortuna.
Meals:
B
Day 6
Arenal Volcano – Free day for optional activities
This is a free day to do whatever you want and the La Fortuna area is the perfect place to continue with the Multi Sport theme. The Arenal Volcano area has some of the most incredible zip lining and canyoning tours in the world. Horseback riding, ATVing, sea kayaking on Lake Arenal, dip into the Fortuna Waterfalls natural swim hole, or canyoning --that's a combination of ropes, harnesses, and waterfalls. The best way to finish up the day is a soak in some natural hot springs at the base of the volcano. La Fortuna also has an impressive variety of restaurants.
Meals:
B
Day 7
Orosi Valley – Bike to Turrialba
Continuing south we head for San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica. A quick drive through the city explains a lot about Costa Rica's dynamic economy, based on a well educated middle class. Then it's off to the coffee producing Orosi Valley. We unload the bikes again and begin a 50 km ride heading east through the Orosi and Reventazón Valleys. passing through coffee and sugarcane plantations and several small typically Costa Rican towns and villages. The final challenge is a hard climb up to a rustic mountain lodge offering some amazing views of the town of Turrialba and the valley below.
Meals:
B,L
Day 8
Pacuare River – Whitewater Rafting day 1
Let's go Rafting! The Put-in is a half hour drive away so no need to rush this morning. Our two-day whitewater rafting adventure begins upon our arrival at the Pacuare River. We will run a total of 27 kilometers of Class III-IV rapids exploring the magnificent river valley. This afternoon we arrive at our comfortable riverside camp, “El Nido del Tigre.” Nestled between the sounds of the rainforest and the hum of the river, take time to explore the lush environment first hand, looking out for toucans overhead or simply relaxing in a hammock to the sounds of the river
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
Pacuare River – Whitewater Rafting day 2
Today the Pacuare takes us through virgin rainforest, cascading waterfalls and river carved canyons. We maneuver through the exhilarating rapids and point out the intricacies of the rainforest at the river’s edge. Along the way we take time out to do some hiking to spectacular waterfalls and have lunch on the shore. We take-out in the heart of banana plantation country at Finca Pacuarito, where we shower and then drive to Cahuita on the Caribbean Coast.
Meals:
B,L
Day 10
Caribbean coast – Free day in Cahuita to visit National Park
Free time to enjoy the Caribbean Coast. Cahuita has a relaxed atmosphere with a mix of Latino, Afro-Caribbean and Bribri indigenous cultures. Locals usually speak their own language called Patois (pronounced “patua”) which is a mix of Afro-Caribbean English, Spanish and French. Cuhuita is a lively place for tourists to have a fun and relaxing experience. This area offers a lot of attractions and activities. Optional activities include: scuba diving, snorkeling, and a visit to Cahuita National Park or the Kekoldi Indian Reserve & waterfalls.
Meals:
B
Day 11
Border crossing to Panama – Transfer to Santa Catalina
Today is a long drive to Santa Catalina but broken up nicely with several stops along the way. The first stop is at the border where we spend an hour or so doing the typical border paper work. Once in Panama, we continue along the Caribbean coast, then turn inland and head up and over the continental divide to the Pacific side of the country. The views from the top are spectacular. Along the way we stop at a local swimming hole for a dip in a river followed by lunch. We arrive at Santa Catalina mid afternoon in time for a few hours on the beach and a chance to enjoy the sunset.
Meals:
B,L
Day 12
Santa Catalina Beach – Sea kayaking on the Pacific
For our second visit to the Pacific, this time in Panama, you can choose from some surfing on the beach break in front of the town or a paddle, on sea kayaks, across the bay to Santa Catalina island. Both are a blast and are a great way to spend a few hours being active. Santa Catalina is also a great place to relax and enjoy the laid back small beach town atmosphere.
Meals:
B
Day 13
Beach time – Transfer to Panama City
The morning is free to enjoy the beach and then after lunch we press on to Panama City. We are staying in the center of the city so you can head out for dinner and the buoyant nightlife of this modern Latin city.
Meals:
B
Day 14
Panama City – Free day to explore the city
A full day to explore Panama City. A visit to the Canal is a must and the best place is at the Miraflores Visitors Center at the Miraflores Locks, 20 minutes from downtown Panama City. The Center features a museum with interactive exhibits and a short film on the building of the Canal. An outside terrace gives you close-up views of ships transiting through the locks. Then a stroll through Casco Viejo, the Spanish colonial sector built in 1671 -- more than 340 years ago -- is a must-do. Casco Viejo showcases Panama's Spanish Colonial and Canal-Era history. A vibrant, colorful neighborhood, it's recently undergone a renaissance- restored hotels and restaurants in handsomely restored buildings are side by side with crumbling old buildings. One last chance for dinner with the group brings this journey to an end.
Meals:
B
Day 15
Departure from Panama City
After breakfast will take you to the Panama City airport for your return flight home.
