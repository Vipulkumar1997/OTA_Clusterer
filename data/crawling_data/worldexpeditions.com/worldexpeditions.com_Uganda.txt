Uganda was once described by Winston Churchill as the "Pearl of Africa", and with good reason. Blessed with volcanic mountains, lush valleys and vast lakes, abundant wildlife and a leafy, cosmopolitan capital, Uganda packs a lot into a relatively small country.
Despite its challenging political past, the resilient spirit of its people and the wealth of its natural treasures has seen Uganda rise above, offering travellers a safe and rewarding destination.
Trek through the dense montane forests of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home to half the world's mountain gorilla population; and search Kibale Forest for more than a dozen primate species, including the elusive chimpanzee.
Enjoy a game drive in Queen Elizabeth National Park, home to elephants, lions, leopards, hippos and more; observe rhinos in the wild on a walk through Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary; and spot majestic African wildlife on a cruise to the foot of Murchison Falls, where the Nile River squeezes through a narrow gorge and plunges spectacularly over the rift valley wall.
Or for the adventurous mountaineer, challenge yourself to a trek through tropical rainforest, alpine valleys and glacial landscapes in the remote Rwenzori Mountains ("Mountains of the Moon"), culminating in a demanding ascent of Margherita Peak (5,109 m / 16,762 ft), Africa's third highest mountain.
Take a look at our unique itineraries and start planning your unforgettable Ugandan adventure!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of our Uganda programs. Our adventures provide a true wilderness experience by viewing wildlife in their natural habitat and supporting the protection of diverse environments, rare and endangered species and local communities.
Authentic experiences
Our Uganda program is varied and unique; designed to give you a glimpse of the country's geographic and cultural diversity. From summiting Margherita Peak in the renowned Rwenzori Mountains and trekking in search of Mountain Gorillas to spotting tree-climbing lions in Queen Elizabeth National Park and embarking on a game walk, even the most sophisticated traveller will find inspiration within our range of itineraries.
Ultimate value
Featuring comfortable safari accommodation and wilderness camps, private vehicles, enthusastic camping crews and porters and fascinating touring options, our Uganda adventures offer great value for money. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, transfers, excursions, game drives, permits and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
From our expert driver-guides to the national park rangers and local trackers, all of our staff work tirelessly to ensure an awe-inspiring and unforgettable experience. While our exceptional mountain guides and camping crew encouage you to challenge yourself in the Rwenzoris, our enthusiastic leaders are keen to share their extensive knowledge on the history, culture and natural wonders of their country.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Animal welfare focus
Our wildlife viewing drives do not travel off the path, ensuring that wildlife are given the required space. We support anti-poaching efforts in partnership with the Uganda Conservation Foundation.
Cultural preservation
We include unique cultural experiences on our itineraries, such as visiting local homes for traditional meals and bark cloth making projects. Our guides have a vast knowledge about native cultures and traditions that they are eager to share with travellers.
Support of local communities
While our office and field staff are local Ugandans, we aim to use locally owned accommodations.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Permanent safari camps
Like a tented hotel room, this is the perfect way to experience the African wilderness. We use 3 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Safari lodges
In game parks, national parks and rural locations we use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area. Some may have extra facilities such as a swimming pool or private balcony.

Leaders in the field
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it.

Where to Go & Weather
Time

Dialing Code
Electricity
Visas
Health & Safety
Weather
Although close to the equator, Uganda’s mostly tropical climate is not uniform across the country due to its varying topography.
Southern Uganda is wettest with the Rwenzori Mountains (in the south west) receiving heavy rainfall all year. Entebbe and Kampala have a wet season from March to June and again in November/December.
Kampala and Entebbe tend to be quite humid, being situated on the shore of Lake Victoria. Temperatures range from about 25-30°C during the day to 14-16°C at night but can feel quite a bit warmer due to the humidity. In the mountains, you can expect much cooler temperatures.
PLEASE NOTE: we suggest you pack a waterproof jacket with a hood at all times of the year.
Time in Uganda
Uganda is +3 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
English (official), Swahili (official), Luganda, various Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan languages, Arabic
Currency
Ugandan Shilling
US dollars cash are by far the easiest foreign currency to exchange in East Africa. It can either be changed to USh or used directly (but often at a lower rate).
We recommend you only take USD notes from 2006 or newer. Older or torn notes are not accepted in Uganda.
There are only a few ATM machines in major cities that are connected internationally and reliability is not guaranteed.
Credit cards are of very little use in Uganda outside of Kampala and Entebbe. Expect high merchant fees.
International Dialing Code
+256
Electricity
Electricity in Uganda is 240 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is G (UK – 3 prong).
Visas
Visas for Uganda are required for passport holders from the following countries:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United Kingdom
United States
Uganda Immigration have implemented the use of Electronic Visas from 01 July 2016.
All visitors who require an entry visa and do not yet have one, must apply through the online application system prior to arrival.
You are required to upload clear copies of current passport page, Yellow fever certificate and Passport photo.
On completion of the online application you will receive a barcoded email notification. Print out this email and bring it with you to Uganda. Upon arrival at any border (entry point) you must present the barcoded email.
The immigration officer will scan the barcode, take your finger prints and photo and ask for the USD$50 cash payment for the visa. (Please note, Uganda only accepts USD bills dated 2006 or newer and in excellent condition).
A visa sticker will be printed with your photo and placed in your passport.
Online applications must be made through the visa immigration website on https://visas.immigration.go.ug <http://live.trackalytic.com/servlet/link/106034/686934/92779421/3549928>
It is possible to apply for an East Africa Tourist Visa (EATV) which allows applicants wishing to travel to the East African Community (EAC) countries of Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda to obtain one visa to cover all three countries. The visa allows for multiple entry within the EAC region within the validity period of 90 days. The holder shall also be allowed to move out of the EAC region to other countries and return without having to pay for another visa. This will only be applicable in the period of 90 days. Applicants must apply for the visa through the Embassy of the country they will be entering first and will be obliged to enter only through that country.
You should also check if you require visas for neighbouring countries through which you may need to transit on your way to Uganda (eg. Tanzania).
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
