The United States is a destination that needs no introduction - its breathtaking landscapes, dynamic cities, iconic landmarks and rich culture have cemented it as a rite of passage for roadtrippers, adventurers and luxury travellers alike. With such a staggering breadth of different environments and experiences on offer across the 50 states, the hardest part of your trip will be deciding on an itinerary!
Get off the tourist trails and explore the hidden treasures of Hawaii- postcard-perfect beaches, majestic waterfalls, giant craters and lava-spewing volcanoes; or  venture north to the unspoiled, uncrowded wilderness of Alaska to hike, raft and kayak through pristine landscapes of overwhelming beauty and grandeur.
Challenge yourself to a backpacking adventure along sections of the iconic Pacific Crest Trail, traversing the valleys, rivers and peaks of one of the world's most incredible long-distance hiking trails; or explore the dramatic cliff-faces and striking rocky landscapes of the national parks of the West - Yosemite, Zion, Bryce Canyon and Death Valley.
Or immerse yourself in the raw and rugged beauty of Arizona with a multi-day adventure out into the Grand Canyon, hiking remote trails and camping among the life changing landscapes of one of Earth's most spectacular landforms.
Whichever itinerary you choose, you won't regret an active adventure into the epic wilderness of the US!

Leaders in the field
Bryan Caenepeel
Bryan first visited Alaska in 2005. The roots grew deep and six years later he still calls Anchorage home. Guiding has been his passion since he arrived and he has led some 4,000 travellers through the state. Mountains and the adventure within them have always inspired Bryan. On any given day you can find him enjoying his 'backyard' seeking out powder stashes in the backcountry, casting a fly into pristine glacial streams, or just capturing the beauty through the lens of his camera.
Keri May
Originally from Ottawa, Canada, Keri's passion for adventure was first ignited when she took a summer job in the Rocky Mountains. In 2007 - fifteen years, many residences, and over thirty countries later - she found herself back in Ottawa helping World Expeditions clients with their own travel. In 2013, Keri hit the trails again to create unique itineraries for our new Great Canadian Trails division and is now responsible for the operations and development for our growing suite of Canadian and American products.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Essential information
Where to Go & Weather
Time
Language
Currency
Dialing Code
Electricity
Visas
Health & Safety
Weather
Please be prepared for a wide range of temperatures.
You may be travelling through areas with wide differences in climates.
Remember that Western USA experiences a wide range of temperatures, depending not only on season and location but also on altitude.
Western USA is as far south as southern Europe, experiencing strong sunshine. Make sure you protect yourself against the strong sun.  At altitude, and in spring and autumn, morning temperatures are often brisk or cold, warming up fast after the strong sun rises. Therefore we recommend a layering system for clothing, so you can adapt to the temperature changes without problems.
As in most deserts, it is the sun that determines the temperatures, making night time temperatures much colder than daytime temps. Summer (June – early September) temperatures are always hot.  However even at altitude, like in Yosemite, Bryce and Grand Canyon, temperatures can be cold at night and in the morning. In the Rocky Mountains, Sierra Nevada and Wyoming a cold front could be experienced even in the summer, lowering temperatures significantly.
When visiting these areas be prepared for inclement weather even in the generally warm summer season.
Time in United States
Throughout the US various time zones are adhered to:
Eastern Time is -5 hours behind UTC/GMT
Central Time is –6 hours behind UTC/GMT
Mountain Time is –7 hours behind UTC/GMT
Pacific Time is –8 hours behind UTC/GMT
Alaska Time Zone is –9 hours behind UTC/GMT
Hawaii-Aleutian Time is –10 hours behind UTC/GMT
Language
English, Spanish, Indo-European languages, Asian and Pacific island languages
Currency
US Dollar
ATM's and credit cards are widely available/accepted.
International Dialing Code
+1
Electricity
Electricity in The United States is 120 Volts, at 60 hertz. The most common pin type is A. (2 flat prong).
Visas
All travellers will require a valid passport to enter the United States and your passport should still be valid for 6 months after you return from your trip. If you are travelling on more than one passport, please use the same passport for the entire trip. The following information also applies to visitors entering the USA under the Visa Waiver Program (including Australians, New Zealanders, and British):
From 1 April 2016, all travellers wishing to enter the US under the VWP will need to hold a passport with the following criteria:
If your passport was issued before October 26, 2005, it must be ‘machine readable’ (with 2 lines of letters, numbers and <<< at the bottom)
If your passport was issued between October 26, 2005 and October 25, 2006, it must be machine readable and include a digital photo
If your passport was issued on or after October 26, 2006, it must be an e-passport with a digital photo and an integrated chip (with this internationally recognised symbol <http://www.dhs.gov/e-passports>  on the front cover).
It is your responsibility to ensure you have the correct passport and that there are sufficient blank pages for any visas required and for entry/departure stamps.
Many travellers to the United States (including Australians, New Zealanders and British) entering the country require a prearranged, approved Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA). This is obtained electronically for passport holders from countries eligible for the Visa Waiver Program. The authorization must be in hand upon entry to the USA and can be obtained at the following official website https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov for a fee of US$14, payable by credit or debit card. It is very important to make payments through the official website. Visa Waiver travellers who have not obtained approval through ESTA should expect to be denied boarding on any air carrier bound for the United States.
From 21 January 2016 most people who have travelled to Iran, Iraq, Sudan, or Syria since March 2011, or are dual nationals of these countries, will no longer qualify for entry under the Visa Waiver Program and existing ESTAs could be revoked. You will instead need to apply for a visa from the nearest US Embassy or Consulate. Certain exemptions apply on a case-by-case basis. Bottom line:  If in doubt, please contact the nearest US Embassy or Consulate.
Please consult your reservation consultant/travel agent if you have any questions regarding your eligibility for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) or the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).
All other passport holders should check with the relevant consul.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
