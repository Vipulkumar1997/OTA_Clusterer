Isolated, uncrowded and strikingly beautiful—the Russian Far East is just about as remote and rewarding as travel destinations come. Sparsely populated but teeming with wildlife, this is a vast expanse of pristine wilderness and dramatic landscapes.
Encompassing the Russian High Arctic, the Kamchatka Peninsula and a lengthy chain of volcanic islands that forms part of Russia’s ‘Ring of Fire’, the Russian Far East is superbly suited to expedition cruising.
Join us as we cruise north to visit the World Heritage listed Wrangel and Herald Islands—known as the as the Polar Bear ‘maternity ward’ and one the final frontiers of Arctic wilderness. Cruise south along the Kamchatka Peninsula, discovering a wild volcanic coastline of rugged landforms and exploring the Kuril & Commander Islands via thrilling zodiac, kayak and hiking excursions.
Experience the hospitality and generosity of the Chukchi people who have long called the harsh Arctic tundra home, and spend your days spotting abundant wildlife including the Kamchatka Brown Bear, Arctic and Red Fox, reindeer, whales, walrus, sea lions and a plenitude of marine birds.
Take a look at our unique Arctic itineraries and be one of the few travellers to discover the striking landforms, unique cultures and rich wildlife of the Russian Far East!

Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
The Polar Regions are pristine natural environments. Preserving them for future generations is not just important, but essential. We are associate members of The International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators and founding members of The Association of Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operators.
Exploratory Voyages, not Cruises
We use vessels that carry no more than 132 passengers, giving us access to areas that are unavailable to the larger cruise ships. We focus on spending time ashore to enjoy the spontaneity of wildlife encounters, hearing from experts in research stations and observing sculptured ice formations from our zodiacs. No two trips are the same.
Widest Choice of Voyages
We have a diverse selection of voyages and departures to choose from. Don’t want to travel the Drake Passage in both directions? Take one of our voyages that fly to King George Island. Sit amongst a million king penguins on South Georgia or search for polar bears in North Spitsbergen.
Expert Guides, Lecturers and Crew
Our people are the best in the business—passionate individuals who have dedicated decades to polar exploration and tourism. From our Russian captains and crew to our expert naturalists and lecturers, their combined knowledge will truly enhance your polar experience.
Real Interaction with the Polar Regions
With us you can fully savour the spectacular landscapes of the Polar Regions by getting active. Cross South Georgia on foot, camp out on the ice for a night or try your hand at a range of activities including kayaking, diving or snow shoeing on one of our base camp voyages.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Environmental conservation
When visiting continents rich in wildlife and home to fragile and pristine environments, such as those found in the Polar regions, the importance of travelling responsibility is extreme if we are to preserve them for future generations. We are an Associate B2 Member of the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators, operating within the parameters of the Antarctic Treaty System. In the Arctic, we abide by the guidelines set by the Association of Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operators.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Comfortable expedition cruising vessels
Our vessels are specifically designed with expedition cruising in mind. Cabins range from quadruple berths right through to spacious suites, accommodating all budgets and tastes. Most cabins have private bathrooms; however some share a bathroom between a small number of other cabins. Public areas include dining quarters, lecture theatres, a bar and a library and some of our ships also have spas and gymnasiums aboard.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Expedition Staff
Our polar expedition leaders and crew are specialists in wilderness environments with years of experience in the field. Your Expedition Leader will be highly skilled in communication and decision making, along with wilderness first aid and safety. It will be their job to ensure the expedition runs smoothly and that as many of our itinerary objectives are met whilst ensuring all participants safety and wellbeing. Your tour leader will be assisted by an expedition team, which may include a variety of polar specialists including geologists, ornithologists, marine biologists, naturalists and historians. There is also a resident medical officer on board each voyage. During the trip all of the team will impart their knowledge of the environments, as well as acting as zodiac drivers, lecturer’s, dinner companions and all round great travel buddies!

Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch!

Where to Go
Search for Polar Bear on Wrangel island
Meet the native Chukchi people
Cruise Russia's Ring of Fire
Keep an eye out for Kamchatka Brown Bear
Look for the playful Sea Otter
Walk amongst active volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula
Weather
The climate in Kamchatka is notable for long cold winters, short summers and large amounts of rain. The southern tip of Kamchatka Peninsula has the most markedly maritime climate with few extremes. Summers here are cool with many rainy and foggy days. Moving northwards and inland, the climate becomes more and more continental due to the natural mountain barriers and the effect of the vast Asian continental landmass. These factors shorten summers and make winters longer. Summer temperatures rarely rise above 20º C. The climate of the Kuril Islands is a moderately cold monsoon one. The warmest month is August with averages from 10°C in the north and 17°C in the south. Heavy fog is a feature of the summer months, due to the differential in the sea temperatures between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean. In the Russian Arctic, Wrangel Island has a polar climate. The region is blanketed by dry and cold Arctic air masses for most of the year. Warmer and more humid air can reach the island from the south-east during summer. Dry and heated air from Siberia comes to the island periodically. Average summer temperatures range from 1º C to around 7º C.
Time in Russian Far East
Anadyr & Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy are +12 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Russian
Currency
Russian Ruble. Payment of incidental expenses aboard most ships can be paid for with US dollars cash or with Visa and Mastercards.
International Dialing Code
+7 - Russia
Electricity
We recommend taking a universal adapter for the ship. Electricity in Russia is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
All nationalities will require tourist visas for Russia and the method of obtaining visas will vary according to your nationality and point of application.  Please liaise with your World Expeditions office (in conjunction with your travel agent if you are booked with them) as to the correct procedure to avoid problems.
The requirements for the current Russian visa are that they must be obtained in advance through the nominated consulate or embassy nearest you.  There are consulates and embassies in UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and USA.  Specifics of the visa requirements will be advised to you by your booking agent, but typically will include a completed signed application form, passport size photo, letter of invitation-(will be arranged by World Expeditions) and a fee, which will vary according to your nationality.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
