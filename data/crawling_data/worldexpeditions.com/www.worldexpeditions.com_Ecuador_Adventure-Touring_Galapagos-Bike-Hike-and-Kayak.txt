Snorkel and swim with wildlife
Cycle to El Garrapatero Beach and undertake great walks, many are very gentle
Travel through a pristine environment
This multi activity trip is the chance to mix it up on an exciting adventure in the Galapagos Islands. Famous for its exceptional and fearless wildlife, the ancient landscape and rare inhabitants of the Galapagos Islands give visitors a unique view of the natural world. Enjoy the views cycling to El Garrapatero Beach and snorkelling on San Cristobal. Discover Sierra Negra Volcano on a hike to the second largest volcanic crater in the world. Although the islands are volcanic and largely bare of vegetation, they have different geological features that make them dramatic and strangely beautiful. Whether snorkelling with sea lions, searching for giant tortoises or watching the mating dance of the Blue Footed Booby, the Galapagos offers a truly amazing spectacle.

Introductory
This trip is graded as discovery and cruising. Although there is no commitment to extended walking on this journey we nonetheless want to keep the ‘accent on the active’. We therefore advise that any physical training you complete before undertaking the trip will be to good effect. Although the day walks are gentle, the fitter you are the more this will enhance your experience.

Cycle from Altair to El Garrapatero and kayaking
In the morning we hop on our bikes and begin our 8km ride to El Garrapatero Beach. This is a great opportunity to observe the change in vegetation from the lush midlands to the arid low lands. Once we arrive at the beach, we will walk along a path that brings us to El Garrapatero beach. This is fantastic beach for swimming, relaxing and observing flora and fauna. After a short interpretation walk we get on our kayaks and go for a kayak around the bay. Enjoy a box lunch before walking back up the trailhead where a vehicle will wait to take us back to the hotel. There will be a short break in which you can enjoy the hotel pool, take a nap, or read a book.

Fish we may possible catch include wahoo, jacks, mahi mahi and tuna. If we are lucky with the fishing, our guide and crew will prepare a rare treat for you, fresh sashimi and a barbeque made right on the boat. After some snorkeling and lunch we will head to Playa Escondida, located on the coast of Santa Cruz. This is a beautiful beach surrounded by red mangroves and also has crystal clear water, an excellent place to snorkel. Overnight: Galapagos Altair Lodge. Activities: Snorkeling, swimming and fishing

Upon arrival in Isabela, you will be picked up from the dock and taken to your hotel for checkin. In the afternoon you will visit Tintoreras Island. This island is a unique and fragile environment formed of A’A lava and home to an abundance of wildlife. Your visit begins with a short boat ride to Tintoreras. It is an easy, one-hour walk on a sandy path, observing marine iguanas, sea birds, sea lions and white tipped reef sharks resting in a shallow crevice, which you will view from the land. There will be a boat ride looking for penguins, birds and other marine life. Your snorkeling adventure will be determined by the tide. Your captain and guide will take you to either La Calera or Loberia Chica. Some of the marine creatures to be observed are marine turtles, rays and colorful reef fish, starfish, and look for octopus!

You can visit San Cristobal’s Interpretation Center where you will get to see an in-depth explanation of the history of the Galapagos and where it is now in terms of conservation and what is being done to protect the islands. There are also many trails surrounding the center where you can walk through native forests and visit secluded beaches full of underwater life. The town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno is situated next to a very active sea lion colony with hundreds of resident sea lions. At night there is hardly any space left on the beach in front of the town and it is quite a spectacle to watch. Overnight: Playa Mann Hote (or similar hotel).

This is a complete tour full of land visits, snorkeling and even some fishing! Our first stop takes us to Rosa Blanca famous for its many picturesque beaches. This is also a good place to drop the lines and try to catch some fish. Many turtles, sharks and rays frequent this place so we will have a good chance to see something while snorkeling.Our second stop is Punta Pitt. Here we will view many bird species from the boat as we slowly cruise by. This is one of the only two locations in the entire Galapagos Islands where you can see all three species of boobies cohabiting the same place. You will also see two different types of frigate birds nesting here. Moving on, we head to Sardin Bay where we will get another chance to jump in the water to see some amazing sea life. This area is known for its many sea turtles and rays roaming the crystal clear waters. You may even get a chance to swim with some playful sea lions!We now disembark at Punta Pucuna for a 45 min hike with amazing views of Cerro Brujo and Kicker Rock from a distance. We get back on the boat and head towards Cerro Brujo for a short scenic ride around the rock. Finally, we head out to the famous Kicker Rock, also known as ‘The Sleeping Lion’ (Leon Dormido). Kicker Rock is a rock formation located off the coast of the Island San Cristobal. It is a magnificent small islet in the middle of the sea, standing up to 500 feet from the ocean, it has the form of a gigantic sleeping lion, hence the name ‘El León Dormido’. The rocks are the remainders of a vertical conformation of rock and are a favorite place for diverse species of marine birds. Here, you will snorkel in the channel of Kicker Rock for an hour. At first the depth reaches 35 meters and decreases to 12 meters at the end of the canal. The wildlife that you can observe includes black tip reef sharks, white tip reef sharks, Galapagos sharks, hammerhead sharks, eagle rays, marine turtles and sea lions. At the end of the tour, the boat will drop you off at the main dock. From there you can walk back to the hotel (about 10 min walk, or a transfer can be arranged if needed.)
