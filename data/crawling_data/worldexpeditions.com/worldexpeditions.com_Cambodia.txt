Cambodia is a true gem of Indochina - an intriguing land of jungles, rice paddies and great rivers, blessed with iconic temples, ancient culture and the joyful spirit of the Khmer people that rises above the country's challenging history.
This is a destination where you can really choose your own adventure, from touring cities and cultural sites in comfort to hiking, biking and paddling your way through stunning backcountry and rural communities.
No trip to Cambodia would be complete without a visit to Siem Reap, with plenty of time to explore the glorious temples, terraces and pagodas of Angkor - the most stunning legacy of the Khmer Empire.
Explore history and culture in the intriguing capital of Phnom Penh, where you can lose yourself among the colour and bustle of busy market streets, enjoy world-class cuisine or retreat into serene palaces, pagodas and temple-monasteries.
Kayak among the floating villages of the Tonlé Sap, cruise down the mighty Mekong or snorkel along the white sand beaches of Sihanoukville. Unwind in the charming French colonial river towns of Kampot and Battambang, or cycle through scattered Khmer villages and fertile farmlands, exploring Cambodia's scenic beauty and cultural treasures at handlebar level.
Whatever your interest or fitness level, we have a host of exciting itineraries tailored to give you an unforgettable Cambodian adventure.

Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
We specialise in showcasing Cambodia through active itineraries that allow you to explore under your own steam. From discovering Angkor Wat and the ancient Khmer Empire at handlebar level to kayaking through the floating villages on Tonle Sap, our adventures provide an incredible and realisitic perspective of life in this part of the world.
Ultimate value
Our Cambodian adventures are great value for money, allowing you to simply focus on enjoying the experience with an added bonus of support vehicles during activites and a cycle mechanic. We aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, activity equipment, drinking water and snacks, accommodation and transfers.
Experienced local guides
We only employ expert bilingual Cambodian guides who are eager to share their lives and culture with you. Their warmth and genuine appreciation of your visit to their homeland will leave you with a sense of new friendships and make your experience memorable.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Support of local communities
We employ staff from local communities and provide them with training, good wages and insurance benefits under the labor law. We also use locally run accommodation and encourage travellers to shop and dine at locally operated stalls and establishments.
Carbon travel minimisation
Our itineraries are designed to minimise the amount of carbon produced, opting for bikes, city walks, cyclos and electric cars as first options.
Child safe tourism
We protect vulnerable children by adhering to our comprehensive Child Welfare Code of Conduct and seek to educate travellers about the issues surrounding such abuses.
Animal welfare focus
We advocate against the practice of riding on the back of an elephant as part of a tourism experience and as such, we do not include elephant rides in any of our Cambodia itineraries. In the interest of public safety and animal welfare we also discourage travellers from partaking in such activities outside of our trips.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, pleasant and reliable.
Lodges
Our lodges provide comfortable accommodation that is well maintained and with good facilities.

Where to Go
Siem Reap & the Temples of Angkor: One of the world’s most magnificent sights, the temples of Angkor are Cambodia’s biggest draw cards. Choose from Angkor Wat, the world’s largest religious building; Bayon, one of the world’s weirdest, with its immense stone faces; or Ta Prohm, where nature runs amok. Buzzing Siem Reap, with a superb selection of restaurants and bars, is the base for temple exploration. Beyond lie floating villages on the Tonle Sap Lake and adrenaline-fuelled activities like quad biking and microlighting.
Phnom Penh: The Cambodian capital is a chaotic yet charming city that has thrown off the shadows of the past to embrace a brighter future. Boasting one of the most beautiful riverfronts in the region, Phnom Penh is in the midst of a boom, with hip hotels, designer restaurants and funky bars ready to welcome urban explorers. Experience emotional extremes at the inspiring National Museum and the depressing Tuol Sleng prison, showcasing the best and worst of Cambodian history.
Sihanoukville: Despite a reputation for backpacker hedonism, Sihanoukville’s real appeal lies in its beaches. On nearby islands like Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem, resorts are creating a laid-back beach-bungalow vibe. On the mainland, it’s only 5 km from Sihanoukville’s grittier central beach, Occheutal, to Otres Beach, still mellow and sublime despite the long-looming threat of development.
Mondulkiri: Eventually the endless rice fields and sugar palms that characterise the Cambodian landscape give way to rolling hills. Mondulkiri in the wild east, home to the hardy Bunong people, who still practise animism and ancestor worship. Elephants are used here, but better than riding them is visiting them at the Elephant Valley Project, where you can experience ‘walking with the herd’. Add thunderous waterfalls, jungle treks and black-shanked douc spotting to the mix and you have the right recipe for adventure.
Kampot & Kep: These South Coast retreats form a perfect one-two punch for those looking to get beyond the beaches of Sihanoukville. In laid-back Kampot, take in the wonderful colonial architecture, explore the pretty river by paddleboard or kayak, and day-trip to wild Bokor National Park. Sleepier Kep offers its famous Crab Market, hiking in Kep National Park and hidden resorts to escape from it all. Crumbling half-century-old villas in both towns offer glimpses of a time when these were prime destinations for Phnom Penh’s privileged few.
Battambang: This is the real Cambodia, far from the jet-set destinations of Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. Unfurling along the banks of the Sangker River, Battambang is one of the country’s best-preserved colonial-era towns. Streets of French shophouses host everything from fair-trade cafes to bike excursions. Beyond the town lie the Cambodian countryside and a cluster of ancient temples.
Weather
Cambodia has a tropical monsoon climate with three distinct seasons:
A rainy/monsoon season from May to October, a cool dry season from November to February, and a hot dry season from March to April.
Average daily temperatures vary little from month to month, but April is the hottest month of the year, with average daily temperatures in Phnom Penh ranging from min 25°C (77°F) to max 35°C (95°F).
The temperature is generally hot, although there are transitional periods, with the best time to visit being between November and January, before it gets extremely hot.
The mean temperature between November and January is approximately 28 degrees, and between February and June 33 degrees, although humidity is high.
Time in Cambodia
Cambodia is +7 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Khmer is the official language of Cambodia, spoken by 96.3% of all citizens (as of 2008). French, once the language of government in Indochina, is still spoken by many older Cambodians. French is also the language of instruction in some schools and universities that are funded by the government of France. Cambodian French, a remnant of the country's colonial past, is a dialect found in Cambodia and is sometimes used in government, particularly in court. Small numbers speak Vietnamese and dialects of Chinese.
Currency
Cambodian riel (KHR) which is subdivided into 10 kak and 100 sen; frequently used notes are 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 riels; coins are available in 50, 100, 200 and 500 riels.
US dollars are universally accepted and act as a dual currency.
International Dialing Code
+855
Electricity
Electricity in Cambodia is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The pin types used are A, C and G.
Visas
Most passport holders, including Australians, British, Canadians, Americans and New Zealanders require a visa for Cambodia.
A passport with a validity of at least 6 months remaining is required.
You can obtain an e-visa prior to your arrival. However, please note that these can only be processed at Siem Reap and Phnom Penh International Airports, Cham Yeam, Poi Pet and Bavet.  To lodge your application go to: www.evisa.gov.kh
A single entry tourist visa is valid for a stay of up to 30 days and costs USD$36. These can easily be obtained upon arrival at all border crossings, all you require is your passport and two passport sized photos.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
