Trip highlights
Tracking Mountain Gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park
Tracking chimpanzees in their natural habitat
Travel by boat cruise in the Kazinga Channel
Search for tree-climbing lions and other wildlife in the Queen Elizabeth National Park
Perfectly crafted for animal lovers with hikes into the natural habitats of the Mountain Gorilla and chimpanzees of Uganda, as well as a wide variety of other wildlife species, the highlights in this superb itinerary are numerous. Tracking the mountain gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park is an unequalled jungle trek experience culminating in the thrill of standing within metres of a family, often including the imposing male silverback. Uganda is also known for its colourful culture, lush forests, beautiful lakes and some of the best bird watching in Africa with over 1000 different species. We will enjoy game viewing in the scenic savannah plains of Queen Elizabeth National Park famous for its tree-climbing lions, and cruise along the tropical Kazinga Channel teeming with vast numbers of hippos and endemic birdlife. This trip showcases the diverse ecosystems of Uganda where East meets West, and is the perfect addition to any Africa itinerary.

Adventure Touring
These adventure tours visit remote areas of the world where facilities are often basic.  These adventure tours will often involve long journeys and rough roads. Sightseeing and optional day walks are often included and these days may involve up to 5 hours of physical activity. To enjoy these adventures we suggest you are reasonably fit, healthy, have a moderately active lifestyle and have a positive attitude. The fitter you are for your trip, the more of a holiday it will be. The gorilla tracking will sometimes be quite strenuous and will involve following trails beaten through the forests. These trails are often wet, steep and slippery. 
* Suggested preparation: Two or three times a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour or more, for at least 3 months prior to departure.
