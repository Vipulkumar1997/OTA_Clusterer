Mountain trails accessible only in winter
Snowshoeing along frozen mountain lakes
Ice Walking in Johnston Canyon
Icefields Parkway without the summer crowds
Oscar-winning mountain backdrops
The mountains and forests of the Canadian Rockies, blanketed in snow, are some of the most impressive natural landscapes on Earth. Lacking the crowds of summer, the winter world is magnificent in its quiet solitude and the best way to experience thesis on snowshoes. We explore the world-famous Icefields Parkway without the mass of summer drivers - a very special experience - and strop on ice cleats to enjoy 'ice walking' within beautiful Johnston Canyon. On snowshoes, we can get to places that would be impossible to access in summer, including the backcountry of Kananaskis (where much of the movie 'The Revenant' was filmed), across alpine lakes, and off-the-beaten-path in Lake Louise. Our expert guides will have you snowshoeing confidently following a short introduction to winter walking techniques. At night, return to comfortable lodges, warm up by the fire, and soak in the hot tub.

Snowshoeing is winter's equivalent to hiking - Anyone who is in good physical condition can do it, but the adjusted way of walking to accommodate a bigger footprint can take a little getting used to and will leave you a little more tired at the end of the day. Most of our walks are relatively flat  with distances ranging from 5 to 10km,  but you will be outside in winter conditions for 4-5 hours per day. On some days there will be opportunities to opt out of the walk. No previous snowshoeing experience required.

Day 1
Calgary to Canmore

Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Snowshoe Kananaskis Country (Approx 10km/350m elevation gain)
Your guide will meet you at the hotel for breakfast and from there, we make our way to Kananaskis country - an area made famous as the backdrop of the Oscar-winning film, "The Revenant". Our likely destination is Chester Lake - one of the most serene and beautiful snowshoe routes in Canada's Rockies with great views of the Kananaskis Range Mountains. From the lake, it is possible to wander along and over to the 'Elephant Rocks' and to visit another small side valley. The dramatic landscape and reliable annual snow-cover make this a great introduction to snowshoeing in the region. We return to our comfortable inn in Canmore for the night.
Meals:
B,L
Day 3
Johnston Canyon and Lake Louise (5-10km/100-200m elevation gain)
We head towards world-famous Lake Louise today. Enroute, we will explore Johnston Canyon. The canyon is a very popular winter hike with an incredible display of frozen waterfalls and ice pillars that is not to be missed. Once we arrive at Lake Louise, we will put on our snowshoes to cross the Lake and admire the Victoria Glacier or hike up towards the Plain of Six Glaciers. Overnight Lake Louise
