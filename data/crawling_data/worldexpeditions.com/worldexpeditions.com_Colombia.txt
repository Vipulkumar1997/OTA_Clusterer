Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
Travelling under your own steam is one of the most rewarding ways to discover a destination and our adventures allow you to do just that. Embark on some of the continent's most iconic trekking, climb the 1200 steps to reach the Lost City of Teyuna and soak up the spectacular jungle scenery that the varied terrain offers as you gain a realistic perspective of Colombia's cultural and geographic diversity.
Ultimate value
Our trips offer exceptional value for money featuring good quality, centrally located hotels and private transportation. We aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, entrance and permit fees, excursions and transfers.
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of our travel in Colombia. When you book one of our adventures you're supporting true sustainability in the protection of local communities, natural environments and wildlife.
Experienced local guides
Our professional and passionate local guides are what make your experience special as they take you off the beaten track and into the heart of Colombian culture. Their extensive knowledge and willingness to share it with you will leave you impressed as they reveal a genuine insight into their homeland.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Support of local economies
We employ Colombian tour guides throughout our program, and use guides specifically from the region for excursions so they can showcase their territory. For example, on our Lost City Trek we employ indigenous guides from the Wiwa community.
Cultural preservation
We work alongside local communities to learn more about the richness of their culture and traditions so we can interweave such experiences into our itineraries, aiming for genuine encounters that bring benefit to the local community.
Employee welfare focus
Our employees receive a fixed-term contract and a stable fixed salary. We select porters to employ on our treks from a local partner based on the fair wage they are paid and safe working conditions they adhere to.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Lodges
Our lodges provide comfortable accommodation that is well maintained and with good facilities.
Inns/guesthouses
We use quality inns that have been handpicked for their charm. They are not luxury inns however we ensure they offer you a truly authentic experience.

Leaders in the field
Andreas Holland
Andreas has always made our South America programs special. He has lived in South America for over 30 years, much of this time in Peru. His special knowledge of the mountains and passion for supporting local communities is evident in our program in Peru and Bolivia. Each year Andreas travels to different parts of the world to impart his vast knowledge, so stay tuned, he may be in your city soon!
Simon Yates
Simon has been at the very forefront of mountaineering for almost two decades with first ascents in the Andes, Himalaya and Karakoram. Best known as the climbing partner to Joe Simpson in Touching the Void, Simon has developed a strong reputation as an engaging expedition leader.
Sarah Higgins
Sarah joined World Expeditions in 2006 and became operations manager in 2010. South America is her second home and she has enjoyed many adventures in its beautiful landscapes. Her travels include 'across the circle' into Antarctica, among many others. When Sarah is not planning itineraries you'll find her out on the 'rock' and in the Australian bush with her avid interest in rock climbing and bushwalking.
Greg Lee
There's nothing Greg enjoys more than setting out in search of adventure in Latin America. This passion shines through in the breadth of unique adventures reflected in the fantastic line-up of trips on offer. Greg is drawn to the beauty of this region's scenery, fascinating history, varied cultures and most of all, its people.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
