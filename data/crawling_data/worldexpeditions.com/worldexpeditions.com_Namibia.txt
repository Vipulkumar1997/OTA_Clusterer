Namibia is an incredible destination that offers dramatic landscapes, stunning wildlife, diverse cultures and seemingly endless space to move around in. With its lonely deserts and spectacular sand dunes, rugged mountains and fertile valleys, immense canyons and windswept coastline, Namibia is without question one of the most photogenic places on Earth.
See the unforgettable red sand dunes of Sossusvlei, where you can hike to the top of Dune 45 to catch one of the world's most photographed sunrises over the breathtaking landscapes of the Namib Desert.
Get close to Africa's iconic wildlife with a game drive through the magnificent Etosha National Park and meet the cheetahs being rehabilitated through the Africat conservation program.
Hike through dramatic scenery in the vast Fish River Canyon, cycle through the rugged valleys and dry river courses of the Aus Mountains and engage with local culture and custom by visiting traditional tribal villages.
Visit the eerie sandblown ghost town of Kolmanskop, explore German colonial architecture in the charming town of Lüderitz, and see one of the world's largest collections of Stone Age artworks at Twyfelfontein.
Then head for the stark beauty of the Skeleton Coast, where you can marvel at the famous Walvis Bay flamingos, see the world's largest seal colony at Cape Cross and feast on seafood in Swakopmund. Whatever you do, just don't leave your camera at home!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of our Namibia programs. Our adventures provide a true wilderness experience by viewing wildlife in their natural habitat and supporting the protection of diverse environments, endangered species and local communities.
Authentic experiences
Namibia is a vast country with wide open spaces and long driving distances, which is why we have carefully designed our itineraries around the best wilderness areas and the most scenic landscapes. From watching the sunrise over the Sossusvlei sand dunes to spotting wildlife in Etosha and discovering the multitude of cultures and customs, our adventures allow you to experience this diverse country in its most beautiful form.
Ultimate value
Our range of Namibia adventures offer phenomenal value for money by providing top quality service, atmospheric accommodation and private vehicles. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, transfers, game drives, excursions and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
Our expert guides are the real key to our success. From spotting wildlife to sharing their extensive knowledge, our passionate and attentive guides take pride in going the extra mile to make your Namibia experience unforgettable.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Guide training
Guides receive annual training on their responsibilities in relation to environmental, social, cultural and economic sustainability.
Animal welfare focus
We adhere to our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct in Namibia. We strongly discourage contact with lions through lion cub petting and walking with lion activities, as well as elephant back rides.
Traveller education
Upon arrival, our group briefing educations travellers on appropriate behaviours when interacting with local indigenous people, specifically in regards to dress code, photographic protocol and donations.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Safari lodges
In game parks, national parks and rural locations we use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area. Some may have extra facilities such as a swimming pool or private balcony.
Permanent safari camps
Like a tented hotel room, this is the perfect way to experience the African wilderness. We use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Chalets/guesthouses
We use quality 2 to 3 star chalets or guesthouses. They can be rustic; however we ensure that they provide a comfortable and friendly experience.

Leaders in the field
George Griffiths
George first started working as a guide in Namibia in 2006 and soon became a very much loved guide. His bright and friendly personality plus his years of experience make George a sought after guide, and his ability to speak many of the local languages opens up doors when you travel with him.
Kembo Sithole
Starting life as a bank teller in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, Kembo saw the light and began his safari career in Hwange National Park in 1998. Since then he has grown to become one of our most popular Southern African guides. He has vast knowledge of fauna and flora and this with his excellent manner with people ensures he brings that something extra to our guests' safari experience.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Weather
Namibia can be thought of in three broad physiographic zones: the Namib Desert in the west, the central plateau, and the Kalahari Desert in the east.
The country’s climate can be thought of in three broad seasons: the long rains (January to April), the dry season (May to September) and the short rains (October to December).
Given the large amount of desert area, the country’s climate is, understandably, mostly hot and dry, with sparse and erratic rainfall. In some areas, daytime temperatures can soar to above 40°C (104°F) in summer and plummet below freezing in winter.
Rainfall is highest in the northeast, in the fertile Caprivi Strip and Okavango River regions, with the balance of the country receiving unreliable rainfalls and prolonged droughts.
The Kalahari Desert and the central plateau both experience wide diurnal temperature ranges, with daily swings of 30°C (50°F) in summer and 10° C (20°F). Central Namibia’s rainy season runs from January until mid-April, with the rainy season being a little longer in the north and shorter in the more arid south.
The drier months of June to October are the best months for wildlife viewing in national parks and game reserves, as animals are attracted en masse to water sources.
The Namib coastal desert is different to the remainder of the country in that it almost never rains, is often blanketed in coastal fogs, and is only ever really hot in winter when the east wind blows.
Time in Namibia
Namibia is +2 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Afrikaans, German and English were Namibia’s three official languages during the apartheid years, but since independence the government has made English the sole official language. However, English is the primary home language of only around 3% of the population.
The most widely spoken languages are Ovambo (aka Oshiwambo, spoken by the majority of the total population); Khoekhoe (aka Nama); Afrikaans; Kwangali (aka RuKwangali); Herero (aka Otjiherero). Various indigenous Bantu and Khoisan languages are also spoken by minorities. Khoisan languages include 'clicks' which usually pose significant linguistic difficulties to English-speaking visitors. Khoekhoe (aka Nama) is one of the most widely spoken Khoisan languages, with a quarter of a million speakers in Namibia
Of the white minority, more than 60% speak Afrikaans as their primary language, with 32% speaking German as their first language
Many Namibians speak two or more indigenous languages and at least a little of two of the three European languages (English, German and Afrikaans)
Where as many black South Africans see Afrikaans negatively as ‘the language of apartheid’, Namibians see the language as an essential and useful means of communication, stemming back to the high number of marriages between Afrikaner and black Namibian couples.  Today, Afrikaans is the closest thing to Namibia’s national lingua franca
Currency
Dollar (divided into cents)
The Namibian Dollar is tied permanently 1-1 to the South African Rand (SAR). SAR notes and coins are legal tender in Namibia.
Credit cards can be used in Windhoek but should not be relied upon as your only form of cash.
International Dialing Code
+264
Electricity
Electricity in Namibia is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin types are D (3 pin round) and M.
Visas
Visas for Namibia are not required for passport holders from the following countries for a stay of up to 90 days:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United Kingdom
United States
However you must hold a valid return/onward ticket.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
