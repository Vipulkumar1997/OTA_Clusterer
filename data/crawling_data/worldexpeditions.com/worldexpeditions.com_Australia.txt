Blessed with wide-open spaces and dramatic wilderness, vibrant modern cities, dynamic arts traditions and a rich multicultural society, Australia is an extraordinary destination. It may be a long way to come for most of the world’s inhabitants, but once you’re here, it’s easy to get around, easy to make friends and easy to fall in love with the unique landscapes and culture of Australia.
From sunburnt outback and forest-clad mountains to tropical rainforest, meandering rivers, deserted beaches and cosmopolitan cities, there’s such a staggering variety of landscapes and experiences on offer here that your biggest challenge will be narrowing down an itinerary.
Hike, bike or kayak among the raw, majestic beauty of the Australian environment; trek the stunning Larapinta Trail or the Overland Track; surf and snorkel spectacular beaches and dive technicolour coral reefs. Explore unique flora, fauna and landscapes; indulge in local wines and produce; and connect with Australia’s ancient indigenous cultural traditions.
Head to Sydney for convict history, Australia's oldest pubs and dazzling views of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House; soak up culture, coffee and street art in Melbourne's vibrant laneways; and tour Tasmania's stunning wilderness, slow-food trails and the unmissable Museum of Old and New Art.
Tour vibrant cities and cultural highlights, unwind in unspoiled nature, or challenge yourself with a host of high-energy activities. No matter which style of Australian adventure you desire, World Expeditions can get you deep into the heart of this remarkable continent.

Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
Our range of activte itineraries covers some of the most dramatic and inspiring landscapes across Australia. From hikes in the rugged Red Centre and lush forest escapes to cycling in Tasmania and rafting the Franklin River, our adventures allow you to discover the pristine wilderness under your own steam.
World firsts
We proudly pioneered guided experiences on the world famous Overland Track, the Larapinta Trail and the Franklin River, making our knowledge and experience in the region second to none.
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in Australia. When you book one of our adventures you're supporting true sustainability in the protection of local communities, natural environments and wildlife.
Ultimate value
Our Australian adventures offer exceptional value for money incorporating as many inclusions as possible in every tour such as meals, transport, entrance fees and permits.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Eco-campsites
We have built four semi-permanent campsites along the Larapinta Trail in Central Australia, in conjunction with the traditional landowners and Northern Territory Parks, allowing us to minimise our environmental footprint while benefiting the local communities.
Ecotourism certification
Many of the itineraries offered by Tasmanian Expeditions and Australian Walking Holidays have achieved Ecotourism Certification at the ECO IV level. The ECO Certification Program is a world first and has been developed to address the need to identify genuine nature and ecotourism operators.
Indigenous tourism
We are continually pioneering experiences with Aboriginal communities to empower them to develop cultural tourism as a means of income. Indigenous tourism educates travellers by giving them unique insights into the Aboriginal culture, which in turn fosters understanding and tolerance.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Cabins
Stay in quality cabins outside of cities that are well maintained with good facilities. These properties may be basic, however we ensure they offer you a truly authentic experience.
Semi-permanent wilderness camps
Exclusive to our travellers, the camps feature hot showers, twin share tents with raised beds, sit down toilets, a communcal tent with lounges and a campfire for warmth. Designed to minimise impact on the environment, the camps boast a sleek architectural design and magnificent views of the landscape and night sky.
Camping
Enjoy quality camping with twin share tents or a swag under the stars. Some camps are inside National Parks featuring good toilet facilities, often on raised timber platforms with rainwater tanks and composting toilets.
Boats
Spend your nights at sea in well-equipped, twin share cabins. Depending on the vessel, ablutions are either shared or ensuite.
Huts
The style of private hut accommodation varies by destination, offering twin or multi-share rooms with shared ablutions.

Leaders in the field
Holly Van de Beek
Holly-Mae grew up in Melbourne on the Mornington Peninsular and has been with World Expeditions for several years. She loves being out in the bush, being totally self sufficient and able to live out of what's in her pack that she carries on her back every day. Although she has been guiding for a few years, she is constantly surprised and in awe of the beauty and power of nature.
Oscar Bedford
Oscar grew up in northwest Tasmania in a remote area on a 60 acre bush block and spent his childhood years exploring the bush. Oscar has travelled to many places around the world including Cambodia, Thailand, Norway, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. Despite his travels, Oscar thinks nothing beats being back on the remote and unique Franklin River and feels privileged to work on it.
Nicole Mulcahy
Nicole is a Kiwi who has fallen in love with guiding bush walks in Australia. After studying outdoor education she has guided sea kayaking, bush walking and cycling trips in both New Zealand and Australia. While her favourite Australian bush walk is Bungle Bungles, her favourite part about guiding is that it gives her the opportunity to share with people what these amazing places have to offer and enhance their understanding and experiences.
Kirke Ranson
Kirke is our Australia Operations Coordinator, overseeing all aspects of our team and smoothness of operations. He grew up in New Zealand and studied Outdoor Recreation, working in various outdoor educations outfits around Australia and tourism operations overseas. Adventure, travel and outdoors are what get him out of bed in the morning and his spare time is spent on the trail with his bike or snowboarding.

Weather
The large continent of Australia experiences a diverse range of climates. While the vast majority of the expansive interior is consistently arid or semi-arid, the coastal regions—where most of the population is found—experience a variety of climate conditions ranging from tropical, subtropical, temperate to alpine.
Precipitation is low and unreliable over the bulk of the interior, with many inland regions facing prolonged droughts. The northern regions of the country are subject to the northerly monsoons, bringing heavy rains to coastal Queensland in the summer months.
Although temperatures vary greatly throughout the country, the hottest months are December-February (summer) and the coldest are June-August (winter). Many parts of the Northern Territory and northern Queensland experience little monthly variance in temperature, with mild or warm conditions year-round. In contrast, the other states and territories experience marked seasons, especially in regions of higher elevation in New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Tasmania.
Some high parts of the southern states experience snowfall and alpine conditions, but Australia is the only continent with no glaciers.
