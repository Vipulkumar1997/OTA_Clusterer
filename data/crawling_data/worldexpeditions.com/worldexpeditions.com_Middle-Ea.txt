There are few corners of the world blessed with history and culture as rich and remarkable as the Middle East. Fans of ancient history, art and architecture, poetry and spirituality will be deeply moved by the region’s cultural riches, and nature lovers will fall for an unlikely mix of snow-clad mountains, lush oases and striking desert sands.
Explore the archaeological treasures and dreamlike landscapes of Jordan, casting your eyes over vast sunbaked sand dunes, cool palm-fringed wadis and hidden cities carved from stone. Experience the stark beauty of Wadi Rum at sunset, and be mesmerised by the ancient rock city of Petra, one of the world's great archaeological wonders.
Head to Iran, a true cradle of civilisation, for an overwhelming bounty of World Heritage Listed sites, vibrant cultures and the gripping history of the Persian Empires. Marvel at the spectacular Islamic architecture of ancient cities, explore exquisite palaces, mosques and monuments, and hunt for colourful carpets in historic Silk Road bazaars.
Or discover the rich history and dramatic landscapes of Oman, as you admire photogenic walled cities, markets and mosques, and explore dramatic canyons, striking sand dunes and wild coastlines.
Join us as we explore incredible Jordan, Iran and Oman!

Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
Responsible Travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in the Middle East. When you book one of our adventures you’re supporting true sustainability in the protection of the local communities and natural environments of the region.
Innovative Itineraries
The Middle East is an area brimming with epic adventures. It’s a region rich with ancient history, cultural treasures and warm and welcoming people. With World Expeditions you can enjoy rich Bedouin culture while hiking in Jordan’s striking Wadi Rum, cruise Oman’s Musandam region or discover Iran’s extensive history, all with the experienced crew and quality inclusions that travellers are accustomed to.
Great Value, Highly Inclusive
All of our Middle Eastern journeys are supported by well-maintained private vehicles, which means we can be flexible with our start times and stop off points. Carefully selected quality hotels, fascinating city tours, internal flights and most meals are all included to make your trip as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.
Experienced local guides
Our guides in the field are the real keys to our success, making your experiences exceptional. We have always held the view that local experienced guides are able to provide a much more authentic experience for our travellers. By training and empowering local people we are able to provide positive employment opportunities that enable expert locals to share their knowledge and love of their homeland with you.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel
World Expeditions operates adventures in the Middle Eastern countries of Iran, Oman and Jordan. The assorted experiences across these three countries include ancient UNESCO World Heritage sites, expansive volcanic mountain ranges, fascinating desert cultures, modern bustling cities and market places all with a strong thread of faith and religion. To minimise our impact on the natural environment we practice the '7 Principals of Leave No Trace', in addition to supporting local economies by employing guides and support staff from local communities. Our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct and Child Welfare Code of Conduct ensure the well-being of animals and children encountered on our adventures.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in 3-4 star properties that are generally centrally located, atmospheric and reliable and that have a proven record of high-level traveller satisfaction. In smaller towns, hotels may be simpler and the best available. Very occasionally, hotels may have shared bathroom facilities.
Bedouin camps
Found in desert regions in North Africa and Middle East, these are permanent safari camps using traditional Bedouin tents and decor. Bathroom facilities may be basic as water is scarce in the desert. Power is limited to specific hours of the day and is usually by generator when available. Kerosene lanterns or candles provide night time lighting, adding to the ambience.
Camping
Camping refers to any accommodation using mobile tents, ranging from large dome tents to small trekking tents. The local camp crew erect the tents or, on a limited participation safari, guests are expected to assist with this process. Group camping equipment (dining tent, kitchen tent, toilet tent) is supplied. Bathroom facilities are shared, and on rare occasions, bush toileting may be required.

Leaders in the field
Ibrahim Al Wahsh
Ibrahim has over 10 years experience in leading hiking, cultural, bird watching and biblical groups throughout Jordan and enjoys sharing his country with visitors. Holding a degree in English Literature and Languages he speaks fluent English, French and Arabic. His enthusiastic and friendly nature in addition to his excellent knowledge ensures that your trip is a memorable experience.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus’ travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the ‘Big 5’ in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana’s Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar’s beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus’ usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don’t be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
