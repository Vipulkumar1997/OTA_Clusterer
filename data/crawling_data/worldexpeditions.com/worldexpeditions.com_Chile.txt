Leaders in the field
Andreas Holland
Andreas has always made our South America programs special. He has lived in South America for over 30 years, much of this time in Peru. His special knowledge of the mountains and passion for supporting local communities is evident in our program in Peru and Bolivia. Each year Andreas travels to different parts of the world to impart his vast knowledge, so stay tuned, he may be in your city soon!
Simon Yates
Simon has been at the very forefront of mountaineering for almost two decades with first ascents in the Andes, Himalaya and Karakoram. Best known as the climbing partner to Joe Simpson in Touching the Void, Simon has developed a strong reputation as an engaging expedition leader.
Sarah Higgins
Sarah joined World Expeditions in 2006 and became operations manager in 2010. South America is her second home and she has enjoyed many adventures in its beautiful landscapes. Her travels include 'across the circle' into Antarctica, among many others. When Sarah is not planning itineraries you'll find her out on the 'rock' and in the Australian bush with her avid interest in rock climbing and bushwalking.
Greg Lee
There's nothing Greg enjoys more than setting out in search of adventure in Latin America. This passion shines through in the breadth of unique adventures reflected in the fantastic line-up of trips on offer. Greg is drawn to the beauty of this region's scenery, fascinating history, varied cultures and most of all, its people.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

Where to Go
Hike among the spectacular mountains, forests, glaciers, lakes and rolling Pampas in magical Patagonia
Explore the mountains, valleys, salt flats and geysers of northern Chile’s dramatic Atacama Desert
Soak up culture, history, architecture and entertainment in Chile’s capital and oldest city, Santiago

Visit the mysterious Easter Island, the most isolated inhabited place on Earth, and home to the intriguing monumental sculptures of the early Rapa Nui people
Weather
With the exception of tropical humidity, Chile’s extreme latitudinal span means that the country encompasses nearly all climates. The Andes Mountains, the Pacific and South Pacific Oceans, and the cold Humboldt Current from Peru are all major influences on Chile’s climatic patterns.
Most of northern Chile is desert; the central parts of the country, where the bulk of the country’s population and larger cities are found (including the capital of Santiago), are temperate, humid and suitable for cultivation, similar to the Mediterranean; and southern Chile is a beautiful but largely inhospitable region subject to cold, wet and windy conditions. Temperatures drop and precipitation rises fairly consistently as you move from the dry extreme north towards the humid extreme south.
Moderate daytime temperatures, cold nighttime temperatures and a lack of rain or permanent vegetation typify the arid northern desert. Even along the coast, humidity generally develops only to coastal fogs (garúa) rather than rain.
Central Chile is blessed with temperate Mediterranean conditions, making it a very productive agricultural region for growing grapes, fruits, grains and vegetables. Winters are cool and humid, bringing rains from May to August (especially the wettest months of June and July); spring months see southwesterly winds and clear skies; and summer and autumn months are warm and dry.
Southern Chile is subject to the influence of cyclonic depressions, permanent westerlies and the polar front, causing lower temperatures and abnormally high rainfall. Intense storms and squalls are frequent around Cape Horn.
Average monthly temperatures in the Santiago area range from around 19.5°C (67°F) in the summer (Jan-Feb) to around 7.5°C (45.5°F) in the winter (Jun-Jul).
Time in Chile
Chile is -4 hours behind UTC/GMT time
Language
Spanish (99.5% - official); English (10.2%); indigenous languages (1% - includes Mapudungun, Aymara, Quechua, Rapa Nui); other
Currency
Peso
US dollars are easily changed.
It is not recommended to exchange money with the street 'money changers'.
It is advisable to carry cards which can be used in Automatic Teller Machines. (Cirrus or one of the other international monetary networks attached to the card). Keep cash in lower denominations such as $10 and $20
Travellers cheques and credit cards are not always accepted; it is advisable to check with your leader that the rate offered by the hotel is reasonable.
International Dialing Code
+56
Electricity
Electricity in Chile is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas are not required for passport holders from the following countries visiting Chile however some nationalities are required to pay a “reciprocity fee” in USD cash on arrival if entering via Santiago International Airport, for short term tourism purposes.
Australia: fee of approx US$95
New Zealand: no fee applicable
Canada: fee of approx US$131
United States: fee of approx US$131
United Kingdom: no fee applicable
For all other nationalities and longer stays please contact the relevant embassy.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
