Retrace famous sea crossings, practice your photography on dramatic scenery and majestic wildlife, or take the plunge with a kayak, snorkel or dive experience like no other.
Cruise the stunning northern reaches of Iceland, Greenland and Norway and watch the rugged coastlines of the Svalbard Archipelago reveal a breathtaking landscape rich with diverse wildlife.
Spot polar bears at play, trek across tundra, and explore the Arctic by zodiac and sea kayak. Experience a land of colossal glaciers, imposing mountains and vast ice plateaus, and position yourself to witness the spellbinding magic of the Aurora Borealis.

xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
The Polar Regions are pristine natural environments. Preserving them for future generations is not just important, but essential. We are associate members of The International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators and founding members of The Association of Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operators.
Exploratory Voyages, not Cruises
We use vessels that carry no more than 132 passengers, giving us access to areas that are unavailable to the larger cruise ships. We focus on spending time ashore to enjoy the spontaneity of wildlife encounters, hearing from experts in research stations and observing sculptured ice formations from our zodiacs. No two trips are the same.
Widest Choice of Voyages
We have a diverse selection of voyages and departures to choose from. Don’t want to travel the Drake Passage in both directions? Take one of our voyages that fly to King George Island. Sit amongst a million king penguins on South Georgia or search for polar bears in North Spitsbergen.
Expert Guides, Lecturers and Crew
Our people are the best in the business—passionate individuals who have dedicated decades to polar exploration and tourism. From our Russian captains and crew to our expert naturalists and lecturers, their combined knowledge will truly enhance your polar experience.
Real Interaction with the Polar Regions
With us you can fully savour the spectacular landscapes of the Polar Regions by getting active. Cross South Georgia on foot, camp out on the ice for a night or try your hand at a range of activities including kayaking, diving or snow shoeing on one of our base camp voyages.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel
When visiting continents rich in wildlife and home to fragile and pristine environments, such as those found in the Polar regions, the importance of travelling responsibility is extreme if we are to preserve them for future generations. We are an Associate B2 Member of the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators, operating within the parameters of the Antarctic Treaty System. In the Arctic, we abide by the guidelines set by the Association of Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operators.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Comfortable expedition cruising vessels
Our vessels are specifically designed with expedition cruising in mind. Cabins range from quadruple berths right through to spacious suites, accommodating all budgets and tastes. Most cabins have private bathrooms; however some share a bathroom between a small number of other cabins. Public areas include dining quarters, lecture theatres, a bar and a library and some of our ships also have spas and gymnasiums aboard.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Expedition staff
Our expedition teams are highly skilled professionals with years of experience in remote wilderness environments. Your expedition leader along with the accompanying staff will ensure you get the most out of your experience by sharing their wealth of knowledge. Geologists, naturalists, ornithologists, historians, botanists and archaeologists are frequently found aboard our polar cruises!










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
