Wander markets, monuments and museums in the capital, Tashkent

Weather
Uzbekistan has an extreme continental climate.
It is generally warmest in the south and coldest in the north.
Temperatures in December average -8°C in the north and 0°C in the south. However, extreme fluctuations can take temperatures as low as -35°C.
During the summer months, temperatures can climb to 45°C and above.
Humidity is low.
In recent years Uzbekistan has been notably affected by general global warming and the specific effects of the drying-out of the Aral Sea. This has turned snowy cold winters to mild ones with less precipitation.
The best time to visit is during the spring and autumn, with September being the absolute optimum month.
Time in Uzbekistan
Uzbekistan is +5 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Uzbek (official) 74.3%, Russian 14.2%, Tajik 4.4%, other languages 7.1%
Uzbekistan’s official and primary language, Uzbek, belongs to the southeastern or Chagatai branch of the Turkic language family. The Uzbeks were the least Russified of the Turkic peoples formerly part of the Soviet Union, and virtually all still use Uzbek as their primary language.
Following independence from the Soviet Union, Uzbek replaced Russian as the language of education. Russian language skills among Uzbeks have declined greatly since independence, but in a region that is very multilingual, Russian is still the lingua franca of Central Asia.
Basic English is spoken by some students, government officials and by those who work in hotels and other tourism industries.
Currency
Uzbekistani Som
USD is the best currency to carry in Uzbekistan.
We recommend you bring US Dollars cash only dated no earlier than 2006 (the newer the better) in varying denominations as your main source of money. ALL notes should be in excellent condition.  They should not be torn or have any writing on them.  If in doubt ask your bank to supply alternatives.
Credit cards and ATM’s are not as widely accepted in Uzbekistan so it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
International Dialing Code
+998
Electricity
Electricity in Uzbekistan is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas are required for Uzbekistan for passport holders from the following countries:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
Currently if you do not have an embassy in your home country your visa is obtained on arrival. We will issue you with a visa authorization letter & number which will be used on arrival in Uzbekistan. In order to arrange your Visa on Arrival (VOA) please provide copies of airline tickets, a scanned copy of your passport and completed Visa Support Form (provided by us).
On arrival you will need to have the US$ cash available. The cost of this visa also changes regularly, however it should be around US$70.
Clients travelling from the following countries carrying the relevant passports must obtain their visa at the Uzbekistan Embassy in their home country - Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States
You should carry spare passport photos to obtain visas on arrival (approx 2 photos).
It is very important that upon arrival in Uzbekistan you fill in a customs declaration form in duplicate and retain one form in your passport for your departure from Tashkent.
All other nationalities please check with your reservations consultant.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
