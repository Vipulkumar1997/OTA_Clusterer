Japan is a fascinating land of contrasts: ancient and hyper modern, traditional and high-tech, peaceful and exhausting. Intriguing history, energetic cities, dazzling natural beauty, ancient cultural traditions and a gracious, humble people make this a remarkable destination worthy of your next adventure.
Pummel your senses with world-class food, shopping and people watching in non-stop, neon Tokyo; then hop on a bullet train to stunning Kyoto, where you can stroll among sublime gardens, temples and traditional architecture. Picnic under a pastel canopy of sakura (cherry blossoms) in bloom, and visit the famous Geisha district to learn the intricacies of traditional Japanese culture.
Explore ancient temples, imperial palaces and historic sites; experience Japanese hospitality in a comfortable ryokan (family inn); and soak your cares away in an onsen (hot spring) or sento (bath house).
For those who desire a more active Japanese adventure, you can join a trek along ancient pilgrimage trails; challenge yourself with a climb to the summit of majestic Mount Fuji; or take one of our superb cycle journeys and explore Japan's scenic backroads at handlebar level.
Whether you want to stick to Japan's fabulous cities and cultural icons or venture off the beaten track and explore the country by foot, bike or kayak, our unique itineraries can help you combine the best of Japan's contrasts into one adventure of a lifetime.

Why travel with us
Ultimate value
Our adventures offer phenomenal value for money featuring top quality service and handpicked, atmospheric accommodations. We aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, high speed rail transportation, site entry fees and gear hire, allowing you to focus on the memorable journey without hassles.
Multi-activity itineraries
From hiking the Komodo pilgrimage trails to cycling the back roads of Hokkaido and kayaking the Izu Peninsula, our Japan itineraries satisfy adventure seekers and cultural enthusiasts alike. Incorporating the 'must see' sights and authentic experiences, our adventures travel down the paths less travelled to discover the intriguing culture Japan is renowned for.
Authentic accommodation
Japan offers incredibly atmospheric and unique accommodation - an element that we integrate into our adventures. Our itineraries include variations to the standard hotels such as traditional ryokans, complete with futons and tatami mats, or monasteries that allow you to capture the true essense of Japan.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Carbon travel minimisation
Our itineraries are designed to minimise the amount of carbon produced, using the most efficient transport with the least carbon impact, which is often Japan's great rail network.
Plastic reduction
We use reusable chopsticks and cloth shopping bags on our itineraries to reduce single use plastics.
Support of local economies
We use small, locally owned accommodation to support the economy and to encourage communities to preserve their traditions.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Ryokans
Traditional ryokans offer a taste of Japanese culture, sleeping on futon bedding laid out on tatami mat floors.
Inns
We use quality inns typically situated in natural environments. They are not luxury inns however we ensure they offer you a truly authentic experience.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Minshuku
Similar to a ryokan with the use of futon bedding arrangements, a minshuku is usually a boutique, family run operation where you will feel like you have been welcomed into their home.

Weather
Japan’s climatic conditions vary considerably from north to south, owing to the mountainous spine than runs through the islands and the archipelago’s deep latitudinal span. Main moderating influences on Japan’s weather are its mountains, surrounding oceans, proximity to the Asian mainland and the effects of monsoons, in which alternating wet/dry periods are caused by the seasonal reversal of prevailing winds.
Japan’s prevailing summer and winter conditions are the result of interactions between two huge air masses: the moist tropical air mass coming off the Pacific Ocean and the cold continental polar air mass coming mainly from Siberia.
The summer monsoon (April to early September) brings rains and warmer temperatures, often causing cyclones, typhoons and storms in later summer. The winter monsoon (late September to early March) brings cold air that picks up moisture in the Sea of Japan, depositing rain and heavy snow along Japan’s western side and bringing cold, dry winds to the eastern side.
Japan is wettest in the early summer and driest in the winter, with the exception being the Sea of Japan coast, which receives heavy snowfall in winter. East Asia experiences a summer rainy season commonly called the “plum rains”, or baiu in Japanese, bringing hot, humid weather, typhoons and torrential rain during June and July.
Japan has some of the world’s best and heaviest snowfall, and is naturally a haven for skiers and snowboarders. The main island of Honshu receives snow in many parts, but it is the northern-most island of Hokkaido that is world-renowned for heavy powder snow during its ski season of December to March.
As a general rule, the coldest month is January, and the warmest month is August. The transitional seasons of autumn and spring are generally shorter, and temperatures are generally lower, in the north compared to the south.
In Tokyo, average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of 2.5°C (36.5°F) to a maximum of 9.9°C (50°F) in January; to a minimum of 24.5°C (76.1°F) to a maximum of 31.1°C (88°F) in August.
In Sapporo, average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of -7°C (°F) to a maximum of -0.6°C (°F) in January; to a minimum of 19.1°C (°F) to a maximum of 26.4°C (°F) in August.
Time in Japan
Japan is +9 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Japanese is the official national language, spoken as the primary language by almost all of the population. Many different regional dialects exist, however, Standard Japanese (as spoken in Tokyo) is understood nationwide and is the language used for news broadcasting
Written Japanese uses a combination of kanji (Chinese pictogram characters denoting specific words/concepts) and kana (Japanese phonetic characters denoting specific syllables, which form words when grouped together). The Latin/Roman alphabet is also used sometimes to spell Japanese phonetically (called romaji) for those who cannot read written Japanese
Most public and private schools require students to take courses in both Japanese and English, however, few Japanese are able to speak English at a high international standard due to a lack of rigorous English language training, the inherent shyness that is part of Japanese culture, and the difficulty for native Japanese speakers in pronouncing English words, due to the far greater number of different phonemes (syllable sounds) in English compared to Japanese
Currency
The unit of currency is the Yen
It is strongly recommended that you buy Yen prior to departure as the rate in your home country is likely to be more favourable than in Japan.
Japan is still very much a cash-only society.
Credit cards are not widely accepted outside of expensive shops and restaurants, and there are surprisingly few opportunities to change money.
Our inns will not have cashing facilities, and currency other than Japanese Yen will not be accepted.
Visits to ATM machines will be scheduled in Tokyo and again near the tour’s end. There will be an opportunity for one bank visit around the tour mid-point, which may be the only opportunity to cash travellers cheques.
International Dialing Code
+81
Electricity
Electricity in Japan is 100 Volts, at 50/60 hertz. The most common pin type is A. (2 flat prong).
Visas
The following passport holders can travel to Japan for up to 3 months without a visa:
Australia
New Zealand
USA
UK (6 months)
Canadian
If you are travelling on any other type of passport we would request that you contact us, or your travel agent, to check the visa requirements.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
