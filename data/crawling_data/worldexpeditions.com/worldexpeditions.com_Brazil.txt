With its extraordinary landscapes, abundant wildlife, extravagant festivals and energetic cities throbbing with culture and rhythm, Brazil is an incredible all-in-one destination that's hard to beat. Occupying the bulk of South America, this is an exciting, expansive country begging to be explored.
Head to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's thrilling heartland of culture, cuisine and football, and fall in love with its incredible art and architecture, lively music and impossibly photogenic location fringed with jungle-clad mountains and sparkling beaches. It won't take you long to see why Rio is revered as one of the world's most exhilarating cities!
Explore the beautiful colonial city of Salvador and see why this former capital is renowned for its Afro-Brazilian culture and candy-coloured architecture; relax on the gorgeous beaches of the Marau Peninsula; or snorkel the hidden caves and azure waters of the Rio de Prata, arguably Brazil's finest ecotourism destination.
Grab your camera and visit the thundering Iguaçu Falls, one of the world's largest and most spectacular waterfalls; explore striking table-top mountains in the 'Lost World' of Chapada Diamantina; or take an unforgettable safari through the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, discovering a rich ecosystem that's home to caimans, capybaras, jaguars and more.
There's so much to see and do here that the hardest part of your trip will be narrowing down an itinerary. Take a look at our range of unique adventures and start planning your Brazilian trip of a lifetime!

Andreas Holland

His special knowledge of the mountains and passion for supporting local communities is evident in our program in Peru and Bolivia. Each year Andreas travels to different parts of the world to impart his vast knowledge, so stay tuned, he may be in your city soon!
Daniel de Granville
Daniel was born in Brazil and has spent the past 18 years around the Pantanal Wetlands, where he works as a nature photographer, teaches in qualification courses and leads special interest eco tours. Being very patient and detail-oriented, Daniel likes to lead trips with peculiar objectives such as photographing jaguars in the wild or diving with anacondas and pink-river dolphins.
Simon Yates
Simon has been at the very forefront of mountaineering for almost two decades with first ascents in the Andes, Himalaya and Karakoram. Best known as the climbing partner to Joe Simpson in Touching the Void, Simon has developed a strong reputation as an engaging expedition leader.
Sarah Higgins
Sarah joined World Expeditions in 2006 and became operations manager in 2010. South America is her second home and she has enjoyed many adventures in its beautiful landscapes. Her travels include 'across the circle' into Antarctica, among many others. When Sarah is not planning itineraries you'll find her out on the 'rock' and in the Australian bush with her avid interest in rock climbing and bushwalking.
Greg Lee
There's nothing Greg enjoys more than setting out in search of adventure in Latin America. This passion shines through in the breadth of unique adventures reflected in the fantastic line-up of trips on offer. Greg is drawn to the beauty of this region's scenery, fascinating history, varied cultures and most of all, its people.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience.

He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

Health & Safety
Weather
Brazil's weather is quite diverse as there are five different climatic regions: equatorial, tropical, semi-arid, highland tropical and subtropical. Cities such as Sao Paulo and Brasilia, on the plateau, have a mild climate with temperatures averaging 19°C.
Rio de Janeiro, Recife, Natal and Salvador on the coast have warmer climates balanced by the Trade Winds. Rio, for example, has an average temperature of around 26°C, which will climb to over 38°C during the summer months, between December and February.
In the southern Brazilian cities of Porto Alegre and Curitiba, the subtropical climate is similar to parts of the US and Europe, with frosts occurring in the winter months, between July and August, when temperatures can fall below freezing. Summers are hot, however.
Despite the popular image of the Amazon as a region of blistering heat, temperatures rarely rise above 32°C, and days are generally warm, wet and humid. The region has two seasons: a rainy season (November to May) and not-so-rainy season (June to October)

Visas

Australian, Canadian and USA citizens will require a Brazilian visa, which must be obtained prior to arrival. Ask your reservations consultant for details.
For all other nationalities and longer stays please contact the relevant embassy.
Please note if you are flying to or from Brazil via other destinations visas may also be required. Please check with your reservations consultant or travel agent for further details.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
