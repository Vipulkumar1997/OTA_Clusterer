Trip highlights
Cycle among the limestone karsts in the Viñales Valley
Sightsee in the World Heritage sites of vibrant Havana & colonial Trinidad
Explore Cuba’s countryside by bike
Visit Che Guevara’s Mausoleum in Santa Clara
Relax on the stunning Caribbean coast
Cuba is a Caribbean gem that is ideally suited to cycle touring and our local guides lose little time in introducing us to their favourite haunts and hideaways in a country with such contrast. After exploring the cobbled squares and narrow alleyways of the music filled capital Havana, we set off to explore the lesser known regions of Cuba at handlebar level. We pedal into the rural heartland, averaging 50 to 60 km each day through an ever changing landscape. From misty valleys to open woodland, to the caves and crags that characterise the Vinales Valley and the equally impressive coastline, Cuba has it all. Our final days are spent in the beautifully preserved town of Trinidad, with its colonial Spanish architecture together with excellent walking in the rugged Topes de Collantes forest region. As a fine finale we return to Havana via Santa Clara, the city that is forever associated with the name Che Guevara.

Introductory to Moderate
The Cuba by Bike trip is graded introductory to moderate as the cycling days will certainly be quite demanding. 
*Suggested preparation: Two to three months prior to departure you should spend thirty minutes to one hour exercising, three or five times per week eg. Hard walking, jogging or cycling.  To prepare for a walking holiday we recommend you take every opportunity to walk up and down stairs and/or hills, for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness.  Please remember the fitter you are the more you will enjoy your holiday.

Continue through Vedado passing by the Hotel Nacional de Cuba down to the Capitolio via Centro Habana.

Meals:
B,L,D
Day 4
Cycling in the Viñales Valley
Depart for the Viñales Valley (18 km) in the Sierra de los Organos- one of the prettiest natural areas in Cuba and the country’s oldest geological formation. The mogotes, (eroded limestone mountains) are the main attraction and date back 160 million years. Throughout the Viñales valley there are small villages, mostly self-sufficient farming communities and traders, plus a vast cave network. Exploring this friendly and somewhat sleepy area by bike is ideal, giving us plenty of time to witness the farming techniques and to enjoy the warm hospitality of the local people, as well as exploring caves and the generally beautiful scenes at a leisurely pace. The cycling is moderately graded with some small hills. After a traditional lunch at Palenque de los Cimarrones Restaurant we’ll continue on to our evening accommodation. Overnight: Viñales valley homestay (Casa Particular)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 5
In the Viñales Valley
After an early breakfast we’ll cycle 18 kms to the impressive Santo Tomas Cave after which we’ll head to the historic village of El Moncada were the first revolutionary militia was formed in honour of the local hero Leandro Malagones. Viñales town, a village of 4000 inhabitants that was founded in 1607 will be next on the agenda, before lunch at Mural de la Prehistoria Restaurant.

Meals:
B,L,D
Day 6
Boat to Cayo Levisa, continue to Soroa
This morning we travel by bus to Palma Rubia before taking the 10am boat to Cayo Levisa (50mins). The island of Cayo Levisa is a small coral key off the north side of Pinar del Río and is part of the Archipiélago de los Colorados in the Gulf of Mexico. It is best known for its white coral beaches, thick mangroves, abundant seabirds and seas rich in red snapper, sea bass, lobster and marlin. Here the group has an opportunity to swim, snorkel, play beach volleyball and enjoy other beach related activities. Lunch at Villa Cayo Levisa. We return to the mainland in the late afternoon (approx 5.30pm) and continue on by bus on to Soroa.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 7
Cycle in Soroa
Morning cycling in & around Soroa - the closest mountain resort area to the capital, known as the rainbow of Cuba. Here we will visit the Salto de Soroa, a waterfall in the Arroyo Manantiales, where it is novel to swim at the foot of the falls. Horseback riding along forest trails is another option. We take a packed lunch for our long transfer (4 hours approx) to Playa Larga, where we’ll stay the night.  Playa Larga is on the Bay of Pigs, scene to the 1961 CIA backed invasion of Cuba. The hotel is set on the beach in a small rural village so expect basic accommodation in a wonderful setting. This evening we’ll enjoy a seafood dinner in a local Paladar. Overnight: Playa Larga hotel
Note: There is such high demand for travel to Cuba that hotel rooms are selling out months in advance. In some instances it may be necessary to use a Casa Particular (Homestay).
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 8
To Cienfuegos, Bay of Pigs  45km cycle to Caleta Buena
This morning we set off by bike from our hotel and enjoy and easy ride along the Bay of Pigs coastal road, the Caribbean sea glistening to the right and very little traffic. We reach Playa Giron and there’s the chance to visit the small museum dedicated to the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. From there it’s a short ride to our lunch stop. We’ll enjoy lunch at Caleta Buena, a huge flooded tectonic fault, or cenote, where you can swim in crystal waters.   Buffet style lunch is served here and you can also rent snorkeling equipment and pedalos. Continue to Cienfuegos to discover the charm of the old city with its grand structures surrounding the central square. We’ll spend the night in Cienfuegos and enjoy dinner in our hotel tonight. Overnight: Hotel Jagua 
Note: There is such high demand for travel to Cuba that hotel rooms are selling out months in advance. In some instances it may be necessary to use a Casa Particular (Homestay).
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
Cienfuegos to Trinidad (50km ride)
Setting off from Cienfuegos we cycle past mango groves and then through pasture land along the nippy hills towards the Escambray mountains. The first part of today’s ride is challenging but you’re rewarded with spectacular view all the way. After 50km ( and plenty of undulations! ) we stop for a country lunch in Hacienda La Vega. From here it’s  about a 20-minute drive to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Trinidad. Facing the Caribbean Sea, Trinidad is a metropolis of beautifully preserved colonial architecture. Much of the city’s fortune came about through the sugar boom that saw great wealth translate into elegant mansions, which till this day form the nucleus of the city. Trinidad is best explored on foot, along cobble stone streets that wind to open market places where old churches contrast with the culture of outdoor café entertainment. Like Havana, Trinidad is a great place to listen to some of the live music for which Cuba is world renowned. Another appealing feature is the artistic flare of the town, and as you wander you’ll see merchants crafting their wares such as weaving, pottery, musical instruments, flower decorations, painting and the like. After check in to our casas, we’ll have an orientation tour to explore this wonderful city. Here we will spend two nights. Overnight: Trinidad homestay (Casa Particular)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 10
Day trip to Topes de Collantes
After an early start we drive up the steep windy hillsides to Topes de Collantes (850m) in the Guamuhaya Mountain Massif. Depending on conditions, we’ll take a 4WD to our trek start point ( Guanayara ) and undertake a 2-3 hour walk in the morning. Our walk through beautiful forest encounters waterfalls, birds, Butterfly Lilies, Royal Palms & Giant Reeds that are over 100 years old. A further highlight of the walk is the visit to isolated rural communities. The final stage of the walk winds up to Rocio Falls and the Venado (deer) pool, where the brave can take a dip in the fresh springs. Lunch will be at the La Gallega Restaurant that specializes in Creole food. We return to our vehicle and descend the steep mountainsides back to Trinidad and our hotel. The remainder of the evening is at leisure. Overnight: Trinidad homestay (Casa Particular)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 11
Trinidad – Santa Clara – Havana
After breakfast we set off early and drive to Santa Clara, a city founded in 1689 by settlers who fled the coast fearing the ongoing pirate insurgencies. Today Santa Clara is an important university town but best known for the historic events that surround the great revolutionist Che Guevara. Che led the rebels in the battle of Santa Clara, a decisive victory over Batista’s army that resulted in the triumph of the revolution. In the centre of town, the statue of Che Guevara stands in front of the provincial PCC, the Communist Party of Cuba building. After lunch we return to Havana and enjoy a farewell dinner at the Bodeguita del Medio. Overnight: Memories Miramar or similar.
