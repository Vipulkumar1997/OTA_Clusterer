Ancient human cultures, abundant flora and iconic wildlife traversing sweeping landscapes - when you envisage these epic scenes of Africa, you're most likely picturing Kenya.
From sunbaked deserts and perfect beaches to fertile highlands, rugged mountains and endless grassy savannas, Kenya is blessed with a huge variety of landscapes, upon which roams a staggering diversity of wildlife. It's here that you have the chance to see Africa's iconic 'Big 5' game animals up close and in their natural environments.
Witness the awe-inspiring sight of the great annual migration, as millions of wildebeest and other animals make their yearly northward journey from Tanzania's Serengeti to the greener pastures of Kenya's Masai Mara. Here in the Mara you can access extraordinary scenery, experience the culture of the Masai people and camp out under the stars for an unforgettable wilderness experience.
Raft the white-water rapids of Sagana, cycle through the spectacular Hells' Gate National Park or challenge yourself with an exhilarating summit of snowcapped Mt Kenya, Africa's second-highest peak. Watch iconic wildlife roam the savannas at sunset, and train your lens on impossibly photogenic scenes.
Explore art, architecture and history on the tropical island of Lamu, the world's greatest living example of Swahili culture, and enjoy Nairobi's museums and markets, where you can shop for vibrant baskets, beaded jewellery and the iconic red blankets of the Masai.
With all of its environmental and cultural treasures, this is a destination begging to be explored. Check out our range of unique itineraries and start planning your Kenya adventure!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in Kenya. Our adventures provide a true wilderness experience by viewing wildlife in their natural habitat and supporting the conservation of endangered wildlife, diverse environments and local communities.
Authentic experiences
From the best wilderness areas to the most rewarding trekking destinations, our Kenya journeys allow you to experience local culture up close and personal. Witness the great migration herds in the Masai Mara, climb Mount Kenya or enjoy an African sunset on a camping safari - there's an adventure for every interest and fitness level.
Ultimate value
With a focus on quality safari accommodation and enthusiastic camping crews, our Kenya are great value for money. We aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the trip cost such as most meals, transfers, game drives, excursions, permits and national park fees. .
Experienced local guides
Our excellent staff are what make your experience special. From spotting wildlife to cooking up a feast on the campfire, our guides are passionate about sharing the wonders of their country to ensure your Kenya dreams are made a reality.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Deforestation alleviation
We have a long-standing policy of camping rather than using hotels. Many hotels in Kenya do not follow true sustainability practices and it is common for them to use firewood cut from World Heritage areas to provide energy for tourists. When we do stay in lodges, we ensure that they adhere to our strict responsible tourism guidelines.
Support of local economies
Our trips avoid tourist shops and commercial villages, encouraging travelers to purchase handicrafts direct from artisans.
Responsible safaris
We employ local guides who report all injured, snared or ill wildlife spotted to the local rangers. Additionally, they utilise various safari routes to ensure that the tourist footprint is lessened.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Safari lodges
In game parks, national parks and rural locations we use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area. Some may have extra facilities such as a swimming pool or private balcony.
Permanent safari camps
Like a tented hotel room, this is the perfect way to experience the African wilderness. We use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Mountain huts
Some treks feature camping in a communal dormitory with basic shared facilities.

Leaders in the field
John Sempele
John, a Masai born in the region between Aberdare and Mount Kenya, is a popular safari guide best known for guiding on foot safaris in remote and beautiful corners of Kenya. His favourite is the climb on Mount Kenya with its lobelia strewn valleys. He has led many traditional safaris and has the innate ability - from a childhood in the bush - to read animals movements, a good skill when on foot!
Jackson Odhiambo
Jackson is from a small village on the shores of Lake Victoria, Western Kenya. He has always admired East Africa's environment and wildlife. Following in his uncle's footsteps, he has put his passion to good use. Jackson became a driver and guide more than a decade ago and has clocked more than 500,000kms. He is a member of the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association.
Clive Dougherty
Growing up in the Kenyan bush has inspired Clive to seek out East Africa's greatest adventures. From the summit of Mt Kenya and the Ruwenzori Mountains to the plains of the Masai Mara, his rapport with fellow Africans and local knowledge ensure that our trips in East Africa offer an exceptional insight into the cultures, wildlife and environments of the region.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

Weather
Kenya's climate varies from fertile west to arid interior to tropical coastline, but as a general rule, the country is usually warm by day and cool by night. Kenya has three climatic seasons: the 'short rains' (October - November), the 'long rains' (March - May) and the dry season outside of these months. Downpours generally occur in the late afternoons, with the earlier part of the day usually being warm and sunny.
Temperatures plummet near the summit of Mt Kenya, where it is possible to experience temperatures as low as -20°C (-4°F), with rain, cold and high-altitude conditions all commonplace as you ascend.
Nairobi and the highlands can get cold (especially in the evenings) during July - August. Daily temperatures in Nairobi vary from about 11–23°C (52-73°F) in July to 13–28°C (55-82°F) in February.
January and February sees hot and dry weather and a high concentration of wildlife, and as such crowds and accommodation rates swell during these months. Things are quieter and cheaper during the long rains (March - May); June - October sees favourable dry conditions and the annual wildebeest migrations; with October - November bringing the short rains and some good travel deals again.
The Lake Victoria area receives good annual rainfalls making it a fertile basin of high agricultural value. The floor of the Rift Valley is generally dry, however the fertile soils and reliable rainfalls of the Mau Escarpment in the valley's highlands make this region important to Kenya's agricultural production.
The arid and semiarid areas of northern, northeastern and southern Kenya experience extremely variable precipitation and high temperatures, hampering agricultural activity.
The Kenyan coast is marked by year-round high temperatures (exceeding 27°C / 80°F) and humidity, and only the southern coast receives reliable enough rainfall to support thriving agricultural activity.
Time in Kenya
Kenya is +3 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
English (official); Swahili (official); numerous indigenous languages. English is the primary official language of commerce in Kenya, and is more widely spoken here than in neighbouring Tanzania. However, Swahili is the lingua franca of Kenya and attempting a few greetings and phrases will earn you lots of smiles!
Currency
Kenyan Shilling (divided into cents)
USD is the most widely accepted currency.
Credit cards can be used in Nairobi but should not be relied upon as your only form of cash.
International Dialing Code
+254
Electricity
Electricity in Kenya is 240 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is G (UK – 3 prong).
Visas
Visas are required for passport holders from the following countries:
Australia
New Zealand
Canada

Please note: Travellers who go to countries other than Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, will need to obtain a new visa to re-enter Kenya or should apply for a multiple entry visa in their home country prior to travel.

Transit Visa (TV) valid for three days – USD$20
(Note - all eVisa applications attract a USD$1 service charge).
It is possible to apply for an East Africa Tourist Visa (EATV) which allows applicants wishing to travel to the East African Community (EAC) countries of Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda to obtain one visa to cover all three countries. The visa allows for multiple entry within the EAC region within the validity period of 90 days. The holder shall also be allowed to move out of the EAC region to other countries and return without having to pay for another visa. This will only be applicable in the period of 90 days. Applicants must apply for the visa through the Embassy of the country they will be entering first and will be obliged to enter only through that country. If entering first via Kenya, the East Africa Tourist Visa (which covers Kenya, Rwanda & Uganda) is available on application at the Kenya High Commission and costs USD$100/AUD$140.
INTRODUCTION OF e-VISA SERVICES

Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
