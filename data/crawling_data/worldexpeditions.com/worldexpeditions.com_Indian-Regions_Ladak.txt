Ladakh highlights

Marvel at Lamayuru Monastery
One of the great destinations of the Himalaya, Lamayuru is a testament to the devout practice of Buddhism in Ladakh.
Experience Leh, gateway to the jewel of Ladakh
Situated at a cultural crossroads, Leh is a fascinating city where you can explore hilltop forts and shop for handicrafts from throughout the region.
Summit Stok Kangri
Climbing in Ladakh isn't complete without summiting Stok Kangri, a classic 6000 metre Himalayan climb.
Freewheel down high roads
Cycling in Ladakh is on the bucket list of every adventure cyclist, and freewheeling down from the world's highest roads is an unforgettable experience.

Why travel with us
Unmatched experience
We have been organising treks, climbs and tours in Ladakh for many years, making our firsthand knowledge of the region second to none. From a classic trek through the Markha Valley to a rugged traverse of the high passes of Zanskar and an epic cycle across the spine of the Himalaya, we continue to push the envelope by innovating new programs that suit every age and interest.
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of every program we offer. World Expeditions has pioneered many sustainable tourism initiatives, and in Ladakh, we pay close attention to minimum impact camping practices. When you book one of our adventures you're supporting a program that is committed to safety and sustainability.
Ultimate value
Quality services at excellent prices make our adventures great value for money. While we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as all meals while trekking and a dedicated local crew who will go the extra yard to ensure you have the experience of a lifetime, our high level of support allows you to relax and focus on the incredible journey ahead of you.
Unique mountaineering excursions
The Himalayan region of Ladakh is the perfect location to start your mountaineering career. The mountains here enable climbing above 6000m in a compact period, allowing you to experience the thrill of the high mountains, gain expedition experience and develop your mountaineering skills under the watchful eye of the best guides in Ladakh.

Responsible travel

Cultural sensitivity
Positive interactions are achieved when the traveller is aware of the cultural sensitivities of the community they are visiting. Our guides are always ready to inform travellers about the correct etiquette, including matters of appropriate clothing and actions when entering a temple.
Support of local economies
We ensure that the landowners whose fields we use for camping are paid fairly for the use of their land and we encourage travellers to shop at handicraft shops within the small villages we pass through.
Animal welfare focus
We adhere to our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct in Ladakh. We engage the services of reputable and registered horsemen and yak contractors, insisting that all animals are in good health before carrying loads and that the loads are appropriate for the animal.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Wilderness camping
Enjoy fully supported camping in remote locations with our outstanding crew of sherpas, porters and kitchen staff. While the campsite locations have been handpicked for their location, our commitment to responsible travel ensures our footprint is kept to a minimum.
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated good quality properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.

Time in Ladakh
India is +5 and a half hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Hindi (41%); Bengali (8.1%); Telugu (7.2%); Marathi (7%); Tamil (5.9%); Urdu (5%); Gujarati (4.5%); Kannada (3.7%); Malayalam (3.2%); Oriya (3.2%); Punjabi (2.8%); Assamese (1.3%); Maithili (1.2%); Other (5.9%), including Kashmiri, Sindhi and Sanskrit
As befitting a nation of such ethnic diversity, India is home to huge linguistic diversity. Most Indians are multilingual and many people speak a great number of different languages
Hindi is India’s most widely spoken and official language, and the primary language of 41% of the population. Along with Hindi are another 22 different official/recognised languages, plus hundreds of other major and minor languages and regional variations/dialects
English is an “associate official language” and India’s most common lingua franca, and is widely spoken in business, law, politics, education and tourism. Hindustani is India’s second most common lingua franca, but is considered technically to be a variation/combination of Hindi/Urdu languages, rather than an official language itself
Currency
Indian Rupee
We recommend that you bring US dollars (in cash or travellers cheques) as it is readily accepted over other currencies in India.
Credit cards and ATM are available in most large cities and hotels, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely. Always keep a watch when your card is being processed and please note that you will be surcharged for the use of your card.
Traveller’s cheques may be changed (for a fee) at many hotels. Make sure that you bring some small denominations and keep a separate record of your cheque numbers, to assist with quick replacement should you lose them.
Electricity
Electricity in India is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas are required to enter India and visitors from some countries including Australia and New Zealand can obtain an online visa, the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) prior to arrival.
For stays of less than 30 days, travellers can apply for an ETA online (US$60) at the official website https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/tvoa.html, no less than five days and no more than 30 days before the date of travel.
At present other nationalities including the UK and Canada and those clients regardless of nationality visiting Sikkim and other restricted areas must have an Indian visa stamp in their passport prior to arrival in India.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
