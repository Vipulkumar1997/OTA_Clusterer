Turkey is an incredibly diverse country with so much to offer: ancient ruins and magnificent architecture, dazzling natural beauty, world-class cuisine, one of the world's greatest cities and a unique culture combining European, Asian and Middle Eastern influences. It's also safe, affordable and remarkably family friendly.
Head to Istanbul, truly one of the world's greatest cities, for breathtaking mosques, bustling bazaars and intriguing history. Admire the magnificent architecture of the Blue Mosque and Aya Sofya, head to a hammam for a relaxing soak and scrub, savour Turkish cuisine and culture in a local meyhane, and bargain for exquisite carpets, textiles and leatherwork in the famous Grand Bazaar.
Visit Gallipoli's moving war memorials and monuments, marvel at the ancient Greco-Roman ruins of Ephesus and head to Konya to watch the Whirling Dervishes perform their hypnotic prayer-dance.
Sail along Turkey's spectacular coast, bathe in Pamukkale's turquoise terraced hot springs and take a hot-air balloon over Cappadocia's surreal Fairy Chimneys. Lace up your boots and hike stunning mountains and coastal trails, tackle a summit of Turkey's highest peak, Mt Ararat, or simply unwind on endless perfect beaches.
No matter your interests or fitness level, Turkey is an outstanding travel destination that should be high on your wish list!

Why travel with us
Innovative itineraries
From discovering the wonders of Istanbul and walking amongst the unique fairy chimneys of Cappadocia to taking in the Gallipoli memorials and exploring the ancient ruins of Ephesus and Troy, our itineraries have been carefully designed to reveal all of the highlights Turkey has to offer.
Ultimate value
Our range of Turkey itineraries offer great value for money, featuring comfortable accommodation and fully supported camping. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, entry fees, excursions and private transportation.
Experienced local guides
Our professional and passionate local guides will take you off the beaten track to reveal a genuine insight into their homeland. Their friendly, helpful nature and willingness to share their extensive knowledge of the incredible culture, scenery and history ensure your experience is memorable.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Responsible disposal of litter
While we inform travellers of ways to dispose of litter responsibly, our local partner participates in the annual cleanup of Mt Ararat and actively lobbies the government for better solutions for litter.
Traveller education
Our guides provide travellers with extensive information about local customs and traditions to promote mutual respect between travellers and the local community.
Support of local economies
We offer homestays and meals with local families and at small village cafes to ensure that travellers enjoy an authentic interaction with the culture. On mountain treks, our food supplies are purchased from local businesses at the foot of the mountains, and some trips include visits to tourism initiatives that support the development of women.
Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics. In the mountains of the Pyrenees and Mont Blanc our local partners reduce the amount of packaging taken on tour and ensure all waste is carried out from refuges that do not have road access to help dispose of it properly.
Supporting local
In the regions that we travel tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by only working with local family run hotels and suppliers so your money supports the community that hosts you.
Paddock to Plate
The paddock to plate across Europe is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Ismet Inan
Ismet has been working all over Turkey as a guide for cultural, trekking and mountaineering groups for the past seven years. Her passion for the mountains makes Ismet one of our most experienced guides in Cappadocia, the Taurus Mountains and Mt Ararat. Ismet is very enthusiastic and happy to share her knowledge of Turkey's flora and fauna, natural beauties, rich culture and history.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Weather
Turkey experiences a varied climate owing to the influence of mountains throughout the interior and oceans to the north, west and south.
Many areas have climate conditions typical of the Mediterranean—dry, hot summers and wet, mild winters—however winters are harsher and contrasts between summer and winter more pronounced in the interior due to higher elevations.
The higher peaks of the interior receive snowfall each winter (several weeks for the warmer western mountains and several months for the colder eastern mountains), and the country’s highest peak, Mount Ararat, is crowned in permanent ice and snow.
In Istanbul, average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of 2.9°C (37°F) to a maximum of 8.7°C (48°F) in January; to a minimum of 18.7°C (66°F) to a maximum of 28.5°C (83°F) in August.
In Ankara, average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of -3.5°C (25.7°F) to a maximum of 4.1°C (39°F) in January; to a minimum of 15.4°C (60°F) to a maximum of 30°C (86°F) in August.
In Van, average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of -7.9°C (18°F) to a maximum of 1.6°C (35°F) in January; to a minimum of 14.4°C (58°F) to a maximum of 28.3°C (83°F) in August.
Time in Turkey
Ankara is +3 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
The majority of the population speaks Turkish—Turkey’s official language—as their primary language
Kurdish, a west Iranian language, is spoken by the Kurds, Turkey’s largest minority group
Arabic and many different European and Central Asian languages are spoken by small minorities
English is widely spoken in Istanbul and tourist areas, but is less common in rural areas
Currency
Turkish Lire
The most widely accepted currencies are USD and Euro.
ATM machines are widely available throughout Turkey and exchange rates are usually better.
Most large purchases can be paid for on credit card.
International Dialing Code
+90
Electricity
Electricity in Turkey is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
A visa is required for passport holders from the following countries*:
Australia
Canada
New Zealand
USA
United Kingdom
Visas for Turkey (sticker) are no longer available upon arrival at the airport in Turkey. Travellers should obtain a visa online, prior to travel to Turkey through the Turkish government website:
https://www.evisa.gov.tr/en/
Applicants just need to log on to https://www.evisa.gov.tr/en, provide the requested information, (after the application is approved) make online payment and download their e-Visa.
This visa is valid for 6 months from issue, for a stay of up to 90 days. Please note we have known people to have trouble obtaining a visa 6 months in advance, if you experience this perhaps wait a while and try again. Further details of obtaining visas are provided in your confirmation kit.
*All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
