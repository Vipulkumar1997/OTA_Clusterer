Active volcanoes, palm-fringed surf beaches, pristine waterfalls and tropical rainforests filled with exotic wildlife - Costa Rica is a nature-lover's fantasy. With its fabulous weather, rich biodiversity and outrageous natural beauty, this is a destination that should be near the top of any active adventurer's wish list.
Here you can see biodiversity in living colour as you explore the mist-shrouded heights of the Monteverde Cloud Forest, and raft down the Pacuare, a spectacular river gorge flanked with steep jungle-clad cliffs.
Encounter abundant wildlife as you explore the lush canals and rainforests of Tortuguero National Park, marvel at the imposing symmetry of Volcano Arenal and explore the white sand beaches, rocky headlands and estuaries of Manuel Antonio National Park.
Explore Costa Rica's raw, majestic beauty in its many national parks and wilderness reserves, soak up culture, art and history in the vibrant capital of San Jose or simply kick back on one of the country's countless unspoiled beaches.
Or go all-in and challenge yourself with the thrilling Costa Rica Traverse, our award winning multi-activity adventure that will see you hike, bike, kayak and raft your way across the country.

Leaders in the field
Juan Carlos
Juan was born on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and spends most of his time trekking through the rain and cloud forests, mountain biking past sugar cane and coffee plantations or paddling the rapids of the Pacuare River. These natural arenas are perfect for multi-activity journeys which allow him to introduce active adventurers to the wonders of Costa Rican insects, birds and wildlife.
Greg Lee
There's nothing Greg enjoys more than setting out in search of adventure in Latin America. This passion shines through in the breadth of unique adventures reflected in the fantastic line-up of trips on offer. Greg is drawn to the beauty of this region's scenery, fascinating history, varied cultures and most of all, its people.
Sarah Higgins
Sarah joined World Expeditions in 2006 and became operations manager in 2010. South America is her second home and she has enjoyed many adventures in its beautiful landscapes. Her travels include 'across the circle' into Antarctica, among many others. When Sarah is not planning itineraries you'll find her out on the 'rock' and in the Australian bush with her avid interest in rock climbing and bushwalking.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.
