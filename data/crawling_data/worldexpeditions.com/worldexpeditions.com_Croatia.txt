Cycling in Northern Dalmatia













xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Croatia has long been considered a jewel of the Mediterranean, consistently ranking as one of Europe’s top destinations—and it’s not hard to see why.
From the postcard-perfect villages, colourful harbours and medieval walled towns that dot the seaside; to the countless beaches, bays and islands of the country’s spectacular coastline, studded with impossibly-coloured lakes and framed by rugged limestone outcrops, caves and canyons—this is a place of rich history and outrageous natural beauty.
Croatia is superbly suited to outdoor pursuits—be it rambling through the walled hearts of ancient cities or exploring the beaches, islands and azure waters of the coast by bike or yacht.
Fall in love with the World Heritage Listed old city of Dubrovnik, “the Pearl of the Adriatic”, with its rust-coloured roofs, fortified city walls and medieval monasteries, palaces and plazas.
Explore the magnificent Kvarner Bay in the north Adriatic, sailing between beaches, bays and islands and heading ashore to cycle through harbour villages and picturesque Mediterranean landscapes; and discover the crystal-clear waters and ancient architecture of the Dalmatian Coast, spending your days island-hopping by boat or bike and your nights moored in scenic ports and quiet bays.
Our unique cycling and sailing journeys are tailored to get you deep into the heart of this stunning country. Have a browse and start planning your Croatian adventure!

Why travel with us
Making Croatia affordable
Trips only include what you need like accommodation, meals, bikes on cycle trips, luggage transfers, maps and route directions on self guided trips and an experienced local guide for group trips, as well as the peace of mind that comes with complete backup and support.
Explore Croatia at your own pace
On self guided trips you can expect to receive up-to-date and well researched route notes and maps, seamless luggage transfers and competitive pricing on all essential services. Many self guided trips also have daily departure dates, allowing you to enjoy the convenience and flexibility a self guided trip offers.
Enjoy flexibility and choices
Cycling or walking, 2 star or 4 star, small groups or self guided, land or sea - we can help you explore Europe exactly the way you want.

Responsible travel

Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics. In the mountains of the Pyrenees and Mont Blanc our local partners reduce the amount of packaging taken on tour and ensure all waste is carried out from refuges that do not have road access to help dispose of it properly.
Supporting local
In the regions that we travel tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by only working with local family run hotels and suppliers so your money supports the community that hosts you.
Paddock to Plate
The paddock to plate across Europe is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Boats
Due to the shape of a ship's hull the size of cabins vary from boat to boat. Boat based trips include below deck berths however you can upgrade to above deck for an additional cost. Berths contain simple but functional equipment and are furnished with beds and a small wardrobe or an open shelf. There is enough space for sleeping and storing your travel bag. The crew includes an onboard cook.
Deluxe boats
Guest cabins are a little bigger than standard boats and include more luxurious fittings as well as a private bathroom.
Apartments
Self contained with basic cooking facilities, studio apartments cater for up to two people, with the option to upgrade to larger apartments with bedrooms if you have more in your party.
Barges
Think of it as your floating hotel, where each day you experience a different sunrise and sunset location and you unpack only once. Berths range from two lower or bunk bed style but can be upgraded to larger berths with double beds. The bar and dining area is always a popular hangout at the end of each day's activity. The crew includes an onboard cook.

Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it.

Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track.
