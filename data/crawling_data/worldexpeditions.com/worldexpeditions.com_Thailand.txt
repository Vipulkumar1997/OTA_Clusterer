Thailand is an intoxicating land of lush mountains and emerald green rice paddies, pristine beaches and jungle-clad islands, giant Buddhas and majestic temples - a heady mix of ancient cultural traditions, colourful religious festivals, fragrant cuisine and bustling cities.
Excite your senses in vibrant Bangkok, where you can visit sacred temples and palaces, indulge in world-renowned Thai massage and shop til you drop. Explore the fascinating ruins of Ayutthaya, Siam's ancient capital, and marvel at the splendid golden Buddhas and countless temple-monasteries that dot the country. Scout the stalls at one of Thailand's famous floating markets, and sample incredible Thai cuisine in humble local restaurants and busy street food stalls.
Cycle through picturesque countryside, trek to remote hill tribe villages and enjoy a homestay with a local family. Explore jungle-clad islands and white sand beaches, and kayak through the limestone caves and turquoise waters of southern Thailand's spectacular coastline. Slow down your pace with a visit to the tranquil, temple-laden northern capital of Chiang Mai, and then head to Pai for natural springs, waterfalls and stunning scenery.
Some flock to Thailand to shop and party hard, some to study cooking or yoga or massage, and others just to unwind in nature. It's stunningly beautiful, fascinating, affordable and easy to travel around, and the generous and outgoing nature of the Thai people will quickly win you over. As a holiday destination, Thailand has it all.

Why travel with us
Multi-activity adventures
Thailand is built for adventure and our innovative itineraries provide just that. Whether you are kayaking the crystal waters of Phang Nha Bay, cycling down the stunning coastline or trekking to hill tribe villages for an authentic homestay, discovering a destination under your own steam is one of the most rewarding ways to travel and gain insight into the local lifestyle.
Ultimate value
Our adventures in Thailand offer ultimate value for your money, featuring excursions that take you into the heart of the local culture and on days of cycling, bike hire and a support vehicle. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, transfers, accommodation and excursions.
Experienced local guides
The knowledge of our local staff in Thailand is second to none. Our friendly leaders are eager to impress you with their expertise of the local communities and culture as they take you on the paths less travelled through this exotic country.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Animal welfare focus
We advocate against the practice of riding on the back of an elephant as part of a tourism experience and as such, we do not include elephant rides in any of our Thailand itineraries. In the interest of public safety and animal welfare we also discourage travellers from partaking in such activities outside of our trips.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?

In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.

Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want.

Weather
Thailand’s climate is heavily influenced by its location in the tropical monsoon zone of mainland Southeast Asia, with three distinct seasons: the hot season (March-May), the monsoon/rainy season (June-October) and the cool season (November-February). Thailand’s tropical climate means you can expect temperatures ranging from mild to very hot year-round.
Most of the country is extremely humid, with the exceptions being Chiang Mai and the mountains to the north and the Khorat Plateau to the northeast, where it is cooler and drier.
Thailand receives generous precipitation during its rainy season, with the southern regions receiving the most rainfall and for the longest period. Diurnal (daily) and annual temperature ranges in the southern regions are very minor, and more pronounced in the northern regions.
In Bangkok and further south, the tropical monsoon climate is much more apparent and average daily temperatures range from a minimum of 20°C (68°F) to a maximum of 35°C (95°F) year-round, with very little variance from month to month.
In Chiang Mai and further north, the tropical monsoon climate is less apparent and average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of 14.2°C (57.6°F) to a maximum of 29.4°C (84.9°F) in January; to a minimum of 23.8°C (74.8°F) to a maximum of 31.8°C (89.2°F) in July.
Time in Thailand
Thailand is +7 hours ahead of UTC/GMT time
Language
Standard Thai is the primary and official language, spoken by almost all of the population.
Malay, Burmese, Mon, Khmer and various hill tribe and Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken among different rural and ethnic communities.
English is a secondary language of the elite, and widely spoken in business, government, tertiary education and tourism spheres, and among younger generations.
Thais are generally very friendly and attempts on your part to learn some basic Thai will be happily received!
Currency
Thai Baht (THB)
All major currencies are easily exchanged in Thailand including USD, EUR, GBP and AUD.
ATM's are easily accessible and reliable throughout Thailand.
International Dialing Code
+66
Electricity
Electricity in Thailand is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin types are A. (2 flat prong) or type C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Australian, British, Canadian, United States and New Zealand passport holders do not require a visa for entry into Thailand for stays of up to 30 days.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
