xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Landlocked Armenia, located in Asia Minor at the crossroads between Europe, Asia and the Middle East, is a remarkable but sometimes overlooked country that should be on your travel wish list. Blessed with breathtaking landscapes and littered with ancient monasteries and historical sites; it's easy to see how this small country captures the hearts of its visitors.
Armenia's landscapes offers never ending beauty. You can find everything from deserts to woodlands to alpine zones, with diverse geography including high mountain peaks and lush valleys, striking rock formations and scenic canyons, rapids, rivers, waterfalls and mineral springs. And with over 4,000 historical monuments scattered throughout the scenic countryside, Armenia is often referred to as an open air museum.
Journey through Armenia's lush rolling valleys; trek the mountains of the Lesser Caucasus; and follow the course of the gorgeous Debed River to see stone villages, medieval Christian art and the World Heritage Listed monasteries of Sanahin and Haghpat.
Marvel at the incredible ruins of Ani, the former capital of the Armenian kingdom; sample local wines in Arneli village, Armenia's wine capital; and soak up the ambiance of Dilijan, a resort town set deep in the forests of Dilijan National Park.
Stroll the tree-lined boulevards of Yerevan, enjoying the museums, monuments and high fashions of Armenia's charming capital; and visit the city's fascinating Manuscript Museum, one of the world's largest collections of ancient documents.
Join us as we cross into beautiful Armenia on our Iran to Istanbul via Georgia and Armenia departure!
