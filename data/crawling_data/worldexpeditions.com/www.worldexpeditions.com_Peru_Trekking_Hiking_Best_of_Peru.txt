Trip highlights
Experience iconic Machu Picchu at the best time of day
Undertake the quintessential Peruvian trek, the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu and experience dramatic mountain views
Enjoy the cultural delights and vibrant markets of Cusco
Embark on a scenic walk in the stunning Sacred Valley to view ancient Inca salt pans
Experience picturesque Lake Titicaca and floating Uros Islands
Peru offers so much variety and this itinerary combines it all. From colonial Lima, we fly across the Andes to our Amazon jungle lodge and with our naturalist guides explore this diverse environment. While in Cusco and the Sacred Valley we wander some of South America's best markets and discover a variety of Spanish and Inca heritage. The discovery of Machu Picchu in 1911 revealed an incredible Inca architectural masterpiece, and this startling find provides a grand finale to our trek along the Inca Trail. On the trail, we ascend from the jungle to the snow capped Andean peaks to complete our spectacular approach to Machu Picchu. Travelling onto Lake Titicaca, we visit the Uros Indians who live on floating reed islands and enjoy a night in a homestay on an island before returning to Lima.

Introductory
Introductory adventures are designed with the first time trekker in mind. They are challenging enough to make it a real adventure holiday, however the daily physical exercise is around six to eight hours and altitudes generally less than 4,200m. Introductory adventures are not necessarily easy. There will be some long steep ascents and some rough ground to cover.  Remember trekking rarely involves flat terrain. 
Two to three months prior to departure you should spend thirty minutes to one hour exercising, three or four times per week eg. Hard walking, jogging or cycling. To prepare for a walking holiday we recommend you take every opportunity to walk up and down stairs and/or hills, for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness.  Please remember the fitter you are the more you will enjoy your holiday.

Day 1
Fly to Lima
You will be met at the airport and transferred to the hotel where you are free to rest in the hotel or just wander around Miraflores, the area of Lima where our hotel is located. Some of Lima's best galleries and shops and restaurants are found in this area. Founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535, Lima is the oldest capital in South America, with a superb combination of Spanish Colonial and 19th century European architecture. If you have time to visit a museum we would recommend the Museo de La Nacion or the Larco Herrera Museum.
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Fly across the Andes to Puerto Maldonado in the Amazon jungle
Early morning wake-up call, breakfast and short drive to the airport for the the flight to Puerto Maldonado via Cusco. This provides an opportunity to experience a real jungle frontier town. You’ll be met at Puerto Maldonado airport by your tour guide, you’ll drive 15-minutes to local Puerto Maldonado office where you’ll be given a smaller kit bag to place your clothes and etc. that you’ll require over the coming days in the jungle. Your suitcase and larger luggage will be locked in the Puerto Maldonado storage room until you return to collect it. From there you’ll drive 20 mins by private vehicle to the port to board a large dugout canoe. The 40 min trip up river is smooth, but each guest must wear a life jacket. We reach the access point to the trail that leads to Lake Sandoval and after a 1 hour walk through the jungle we jump on board a smaller dugout canoe where we boat along a narrow canal. Within 10 mins the canal opens up to the spectacular views of Sandoval Lake. We slowly travel in the canoe across the breadth of the lake to reach the Sandoval Lake Lodge. The rainforest (both pristine primary and secondary growth forest) surrounding the lodges is a naturalist's paradise. (It is important to be aware that the lodge is comfortable but basic - only one of the lodges - Sandoval Lake Lodge - has electricity or hot water for instance). During the remainder of the day we go for walks with our naturalist guide along forest trails.  After dinner we get a chance to relax and discuss with resident naturalists the research projects taking place in the area. Serenaded by a chorus of jungle noises we go to sleep in the lodge's comfortable double rooms. 
Note: While staying at the Amazon jungle lodge you may be with other people from other operators worldwide in a group.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 3
At Lodge
Today is spent going on a long jungle walk to find monkeys and capybaras. We'll also take canoes out on to some of the jungle lagoons in the area. On the shores of these lagoons there are often lots of hoatzin to be seen - a really remarkable bird. Before the evening meal we head out for a short river trip using torches to look for cayman - this always proves to be exciting. PLEASE NOTE: it is important to be aware that the programs may vary according to flight schedules, weather, river height, group sizes, etc and participants should be aware there is no guarantee of seeing specific animals or birds and in general you may not see much wildlife since the rainforest provides such good camouflage for its inhabitants - but you will have a good chance to experience true rainforest first hand.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 4
Fly to Cusco
Early morning departure after breakfast for the downriver trip to Puerto Maldonado and the short flight back to Cusco 11,200' (3,400m), arriving there around midday. You'll be met by your guide and transferred from Cusco airport to our hotel for a short initial briefing and then a few hours of rest, essential to initiate successful acclimatisation. In the evening you'll have a longer briefing to discuss aspects of the itinerary and in particular the trek.
Meals:
B
Day 5
Tour of Cusco and the nearby ruins
Every alleyway we enter or corner we turn brings another surprise or enigma in the form of the superbly constructed Inca walls or the more architecturally extravagant colonial churches and palaces. The city, once capital of the extensive Inca Empire, has seen many changes since Francisco Pizarro's men took the city with such apparent ease in November 1533. We also take a short drive to visit the monolithic walls of Sacsayhuaman, spectacularly set above the city. In the afternoon you may have time to explore some of the central parts of the city and a chance to look at some of the great varieties of local craft work on sale in open air stalls and shops.
Meals:
B
Day 6
Drive and walk down into the Sacred Valley of the Incas
We leave Cusco and head to the Chinchero Plateau to explore Chinchero, an important town in Inca times. The most striking remnant of this period is the massive stone wall in the main plaza which has ten trapezoidal niches.  There are beautiful views overlooking the Sacred Valley of the Incas, with the Cordillera Vilcabamba and the snow-capped peak of Salkantay dominating the western horizon. Chinchero is believed to be the mythical birthplace of the rainbow. Visit the salt mines of Maras. This village is a salt-producing center that dates back all the way to pre-Inca times. There are over 3000 salt pools all carved into the mountain side. Discover Moray's mysterious concentric circular terraces which, according to some scholars, would be an agricultural research center. When the tour is over, we will end up in the Sacred Valley near a good restaurant where we can savour dishes made with locally grown produce. After a leisurely lunch we head for our hotel in the valley. The rest of the day is free to relax and enjoy beauty of this famous valley.
Meals:
B
Day 7
Second day in the Sacred Valley of the Incas
Another day in this beautiful place. The valley actually follows the course of the famous Urubamba River, one of the main tributaries of the Amazon River. During our time in the here we visit some of the enthralling citadels, fortresses and temple ruins that are found along the valley including the site at Ollantaytambo. The village itself is a fascinating mixture of Inca and Colonial architecture. If the weather is good and we have time we can enjoy some short walks in the valley - a good way to prepare for the trek ahead. The evening is spent preparing for the trek at our hotel.
Meals:
B
Day 8
Inca Trail trek commences
You will be picked up early from your hotel in the Sacred Valley for the drive to Chilca or Piscacucho where we start our first day of trekking. At this point we meet our trekking guide plus our cooks, porters and camp staff before setting off on this famous ‘Royal Highway of the Incas’, built more than 500 years ago. The first day involves approximately five to six hours of walking. During the first few hours of walking we follow the course of the famous Urubamba River before stopping to admire the archaeological site of Patallacta 2750m (9,020ft) – an ancient Inca city built on a series of terraces below the trail. From here we continue to follow the narrow valley of the Cusichaca River to camp at one of two sites near the village of Huayllabamba – this means we actually avoid the very crowded camp sites within the village used by most of the trekkers on the trail. Camp.
*Important: Please be aware that, because of the Peruvian authorities' new rules on the Inca Trail, there may be changes in the actual trek itinerary and the campsites we use.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
Trek towards first pass
Next morning we continue up this narrow valley on the left bank of the river - whose source is one of the great glaciers of Mt Salcantay. We then start a relatively steep climb up this classic trail towards the first pass – Warmihuañusca 4,200m (13,700ft). After a rest at the pass and time to take in the spectacular views we descend steeply into the Pacamayo Valley where we spend our second night on the trail. Camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 10
Trek over second and third pass to Wiñay Wayna
Today is the longest day of the trek. After breakfast in our campsite in the verdant Pacamayo Valley we start ascending towards the small but impressively set ruins at Runkuraqay and on to Cochapata set just below the second pass at 3,900m (12,800ft). From here we walk the short distance to the pass and then descend past a mysterious small green lake to the large ruins of Sayacmarca and on to the last pass at 3,800m (12,450ft) which is more like a low ridge-line than a true pass. From here we get a great view down into the forested gorge of the Urubamba River set more than 1700 metres below us. A short hike from here takes us over the Phuyupatamarca Pass at 3,700m (12,140ft), aptly named the ‘City in the Clouds’. We walk down along an incredibly well preserved section of the trail with great white granite slab walls and staircases all impressively set in high jungle to our final campsite at Wiñay Wayna, 2,679m (8,790ft).
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 11
Final day of trek to Machu Picchu, guided tour of Machu Picchu, to Aguas Calientes
After breakfast we walk the last few kilometres to finally reach Inti Punku (The Gateway to the Sun) awe-inspiringly set above the ‘lost city’ of Machu Picchu 2,400m (7,900ft). Your first view of the ruins really does take your breath away! We will enjoy a guided tour of the sanctuary followed by time to explore this fascinating site at your own pace (with the accompaniment of the guide). We return by bus down to Aguas Calientes for lunch (at your own expense) and check in to our hotel. Time for a well deserved soak in the nearby hot springs (optional). We say farewell to our trekking guide and some of the Inca Trail trekkers returning to Cusco this afternoon. Overnight: El Mapi hotel. 
*Important: Peruvian authorities have implemented entry restrictions to protect Machu Picchu from the impact of its immense popularity. As of 1st July 2017 there are three time slots in which patrons can enter Machu Picchu for a maximum of four hours and must follow one of three predetermined routes. Additionally, all visitors much be accompanied by a guide at all times. These changes have been made to improve the visitor experience and in an effort to deal with overcrowding. World Expeditions endeavour to ensure you get the most of your Machu Picchu experience regardless of these restrictions.
Meals:
B
Day 12
Explore Machu Picchu and return to Cusco
This morning we drive up to the ruins in time for the opening and savour the views and the atmosphere as the light changes as the sun rises. We have another guided tour visiting the sites that you may have missed yesterday. After the official tour ends, you will have more time in the company of the guide to continue exploring this incredible site. In the afternoon or early evening we depart from Machu Picchu for the train ride back to Ollantaytambo where we transfer to our vehicle for the drive back to Cusco. Overnight in Cusco – hotel. NB - depending on train schedules, we may arrive into Cusco very late at night.
OPTIONAL HUAYNA PICCHU CLIMB OR MACHU PICCHU MOUNTAIN CLIMB - For the more adventurous, you can purchase an additional Huayna Picchu or Machu Picchu Mountain permit (ask us for costs), and forego the guided tour of Machu Picchu which is non-refundable and non-transferable. Please be aware that this is NOT a guided climb, and it takes minimum 2.5 hours (45 mins up & 45 mins down and some time at the top). Both climbs are very steep (including many small and narrow steps) and can be slippery and are quite very exposed with vertiginous drops. Before purchasing the permit on your behalf (non-refundable and non-transferable), we require any passengers to sign a waiver form. Note - there are limited Huayna Picchu permits and they sell out fast.
Meals:
B
Day 13
Cusco - free day
A good day to relax, do your washing and re pack after the trek and perhaps a chance to do some 'tourist shopping', selecting from a great variety of expertly made craft work - including alpaca sweaters and hats, ceramics, weavings and traditional Andean instruments. In the evening we prepare for the next stage of our journey through the Andes.
Meals:
B
Day 14
Overland journey to Puno and Lake Titicaca
We depart early in the morning for the 6 to 8 hour journey by private vehicle* to Puno set on the shores of Lake Titicaca at 12,630' (3,820m). The road takes us south along the great valley below Cusco and then as we head further south we start to climb towards the great continental divide at La Raya. To the east we see some of the strange peaks of the Carabaya Range. From the pass we descend quickly onto the vast dry altiplano with its isolated villages and herds of Andean camelid including the alpaca and vicuña. Our first glimpses of lake Titicaca remind us that this is hardly a lake - its more like a vast inland sea that also happens to be the highest navigable lake in the world! We spend our night at our hotel in Puno.
*Note: For smaller groups of 2 - 5 passengers we use the first class public bus to Puno.
Meals:
B
Day 15
Lake Titicaca, Uros Islands and island homestay
Puno is a typical high Andean town, set on the great altiplano that surrounds the lake and stretches all the way to La Paz. After breakfast we head down to the old lake port with its century old steamers still tied up at the wharf. From here we board small motor boat to cruise out to visit the famous Uros Islands. These islands often given the misnomer of 'floating islands' are in fact tortora reed mats that grow out of the shallower waters of the vast bay of Puno. The islands have for centuries been occupied by the small Uros community who continue their traditional methods of 'farming' and fishing the lake. From here we continue to the islands of either Taquile or Amantani where we spend a night in a local island home. These islands have been occupied by traditional farming communities and spending a night gives us a good chance to learn more about the Andean people and their traditional lifestyles.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 16
Drive to Juliaca Airport, trip concludes
Return by boat to Puno and drive to Juliaca airport for flight to Lima airport where your services end.
