Lush, languid and full of surprises, Vanuatu is an unspoiled island destination blessed with a vibrant culture and dazzling natural beauty. Join us on a remarkable sea voyage as we sail into a world that few have experienced, where idyllic islands, isolated villages and time-honoured traditions remain unchanged.
Relax as our ship glides into secluded bays and takes us to remote islands where the art of traditional navigation lives on. Head ashore to visit small island townships, and swim and snorkel your way along quiet beaches and coral reefs, keeping watch for colourful orchids, rare birds and locals hand-crafting their vessels along the shore.
Enjoy the hospitality of the friendly ni-Vanuatu and discover the rich cultural traditions of Melanesia, where daily life centres around the village and family and occasions are celebrated with elaborate costume and ceremony.
Join our unique Secrets of Melanesia voyage via the Solomon Islands, and discover the beauty of Vanuatu!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
When you book one of our adventures you're supporting true sustainability in the support of remote island communities, the protection of natural environments, the well-being of our local staff and appreciation of the Melanesian culture.
Expert guides, naturalists and crew
Our staff are passionate individuals who have dedicated decades to exploration and tourism. From the ship captain and crew to our expert naturalists and guides, their combined knowledge will truly enhance your experience.
Exploratory voyages, not cruises
We use a vessel that carries just 50 passengers giving us access to areas that are unavailable to the larger cruise ships. We focus on spending time ashore enjoying the spontaneity of wildlife encounters, hearing from expert naturalists and observing from our zodiacs. No two trips are the same.
Authentic experiences
With us you can fully savour the rich culture and wild treasures of Melanesia, whether you are exploring by foot, boat or kayak.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Leave No Trace
We operate our itineraries following the principles of Leave No Trace, ensuring that we take out all waste that we bring in and more where possible.
Child safe tourism
Children working and living in tourist areas are especially vulnerable to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. We protect vulnerable children by adhering to our Child Protection Code of Conduct.
Animal welfare focus
We advocate for cruelty free animal encounters, encouraging travellers to follow the guidelines in our comprehensive Animal Welfare Code of Conduct as we seek to inform stakeholders about animal welfare matters.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Comfortable cruising vessel
Our vessel, specifically designed for expedition cruising, features cabins that range from triple and twin berths to spacious suites, accommodating all budgets and tastes. While most cabins have private bathrooms, some are shared between a small number of other cabins. Public areas include a dining room, lecture room, bar and library lounge and infirmary with a medical officer on board.

Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
