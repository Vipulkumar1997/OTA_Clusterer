Set just below the equator on the western arm of Africa's Great Rift Valley, Rwanda is an intriguing land of volcanic mountains and dense equatorial jungles. Blessed with lush landscapes, rare wildlife and the resilient spirit of its people, Rwanda has risen above its dark history, offering travellers a safe and unparalleled wilderness experience.
With Rwanda's mountainous terrain earning it the title of "The Land of a Thousand Hills", the lush, mist-shrouded forests that cloak the country's volcanic peaks provide safe haven for rare mountain gorillas, golden monkeys and chimpanzees. This is, quite simply, one of the best places on Earth to meet some of mankind's closest relatives.
Enjoy an incredible once-in-a-lifetime wildlife encounter, trekking with expert local guides and trackers through the mist-shrouded forests and bamboo thickets of Volcanoes National Park in search of Rwanda's famous primates. The privilege of observing these gentle giants in their natural habitat is a bucket-list experience you'll never forget!
Search for lions and abundant birdlife in Akagera National Park, Rwanda's only protected savannah; spend a day at beautiful freshwater Lake Kivu, one of African's Great Lakes; and trek the stunning Bisoke Volcano, where you may be lucky enough to spot a silverback in the wild.
Finally, reflect upon Rwanda's tragic past at the moving Genocide Memorial; and support sustainable tourism initiatives with local handicrafts, cultural performances and village visits. Join us as we explore beautiful Rwanda!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of our Rwanda programs. Our adventures provide a true wilderness experience by viewing wildlife in their natural habitat and supporting the protection and sustainability of diverse environments, rare and endangered species and local communities.
Authentic experiences
Our programs are packed with bucket-list items that provide a realistic experience of Rwanda's beauty. From trekking in search of Mountain Gorillas and an exhilarating ascent of Bisoke Volcano to spotting lion in Akagera, even the most experienced traveller will find inspiration within our range of itineraries.
Ultimate value
Our Rwanda adventures offer phenomenal value for money by providing comfortable accommodation, private vehicles and fascinating touring options. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible into the tour cost such as most meals, transfers, excursions, permits and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
From our experienced driver-guides to the national park rangers and local trackers, all of our staff go the extra mile to ensure an awe-inspiring and unforgettable experience, sharing their extensive knowledge on Rwanda's history, culture and natural wonders.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Animal welfare focus
We do not go off track on our wildlife viewing drives to ensure that wildlife are given the required space. We support anti-poaching efforts in partnership with Uganda Conservation Foundation.
Cultural preservation
We include unique cultural experiences on our itineraries such as visiting local homes for traditional meals and bark cloth making projects. Additionally, our guides have vast knowledge about native cultures and traditions that they pass on to travellers.
Support of local economies
We employ our office and field staff from local communities and partner with many locally owned accommodation facilities.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Safari lodges
In game parks, national parks and rural locations we use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area. Some may have extra facilities such as a swimming pool or private balcony.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Permanent safari camps
Like a tented hotel room, this is the perfect way to experience the African wilderness. We use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Essential information
Where to Go & Weather
Time

Electricity
Visas
Health & Safety
Weather
There are four discernible climatic periods – long rains from mid March to mid May; a long dry period from mid May to mid October; short rains from mid October to mid December; and the short dry from mid December to mid March.
The average daytime temperature is 30°C in Kigali and 12-15°C in the highlands.
The climate is not uniform throughout the country so use the above as a general guide. It is drier in the east than in the west and north.
Sometimes the volcanoes can even be capped in snow
Kigali and Volcanoes National Park can become quite chilly.
The areas around Lake Kivu are generally sunny and pleasant all year round.
Rwanda can be visited any time of the year even during the rainy seasons as the scenery then is greener and the skies are clearer. Although it can be raining quite heavily in the mountains in these periods, it is no problem to travel then.
The main dry season is the best time to trek the gorillas in Volcanoes National Park.
PLEASE NOTE: we suggest you pack a waterproof jacket with a hood at all times of the year.
Time in Rwanda
Rwanda is +2 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Kinyarwanda, French, English (all official)
Currency
Rwandan Franc
US dollars cash are by far the easiest foreign currency to exchange in Rwanda. It can either be changed to RWF or used directly (but often at a lower rate). We recommend you only take USD notes from 2006 or newer; older or torn notes are not accepted. We suggest bringing some smaller denomination notes as well as 20’s, 50’s and 100’s.
Credit cards are of very little use. Some big hotels in Kigali will accept them but be prepared for high merchant fees. Visa and Mastercard only are accepted. Diners and Amex are NOT accepted anywhere in Rwanda.
Do not rely on ATM machines as there are only a few in the whole of Kigali that are internationally connected and even then they cannot be guaranteed to work.
International Dialing Code
+250
Electricity
Electricity in Rwanda is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
A visa is required and is issued on arrival on presentation of an Entry Facility Letter. Entry Facility applications can be made https://migration.gov.rw/index.php?id=203. Visas for a single entry tourist visa are valid for a stay of 30 days. Extension for up to 90 days may be possible.
From 01st November 2014 nationalities that were previously exempt from paying for a visa for Rwanda now have to pay for this. Visas can only be paid in cash US$ and the notes have to be from 2006 or newer and also be nice, new, not soiled or torn.  Nationals of: Australia, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, Republic of South Africa, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States of America will be issued with entry visa valid for a period of up to 30 days and pay visa fee ($50 USD) upon arrival at any Rwanda entry point without prior application. Any nationalities not mentioned have the same requirements previously in place. For more information please refer to the following website:
https://www.migration.gov.rw/index.php?id=13
RWANDA VISA – ENTRY FACILITY LETTER
Have your passport details at hand when you apply for the Entry Facility Letter.
When filling in the application online they will ask for an “invitation letter”. This invitation letter should normally not be needed, if, on the same application, you click that you are visiting Rwanda as a “tourist”. If you get a reply where you are still asked for an invitation letter from your tour operator please let us know, and we will send you one confirming that “JK Safaris” is your ground handler, and is organising your safari in Rwanda.
Once approved Rwanda Immigration will e-mail you an "Entry Facility Letter" (usually within 3 - 5 working days of receiving the application). The Entry Facility Letter must be printed and a copy presented to both the airline upon check-in at departure point for your flight to Kigali and at immigration upon arrival in Kigali. The visa will then be issued upon presentation of the Facility Letter, your passport, and payment of USD$50.00 for a single entry tourist visa valid for 30 days stay. USD cash payment notes must be 2006 or later, clean and crisp. (Extension for stays of up to 90 days may be possible, subject to the discretion of Rwanda Immigration.)
Please print 2 copies of the Entry Facility Letter. Bring both to Africa. Keep one with your passport and the other separately as a spare just in case. No letter, no entry. Guard it like a passport.
Passport validity (minimum required):
6 months from date of entry.
At least 2 blank facing pages

It is possible to apply for an East Africa Tourist Visa (EATV) which allows applicants wishing to travel to the East African Community (EAC) countries of Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda to obtain one visa to cover all three countries. The visa allows for multiple entry within the EAC region within the validity period of 90 days. The holder shall also be allowed to move out of the EAC region to other countries and return without having to pay for another visa. This will only be applicable in the period of 90 days. Applicants must apply for the visa through the Embassy of the country they will be entering first and will be obliged to enter only through that country. Note that this multiple country visa arrangement does NOT include Tanzania.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
