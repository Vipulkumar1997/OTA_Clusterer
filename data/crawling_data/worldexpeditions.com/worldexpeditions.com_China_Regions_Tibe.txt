Experience life on the Tibetan plateau and discover the ancient palaces, monasteries and markets of Lhasa, Tibet's unforgettable capital and the heartland of Tibetan culture.
Trek to the base of the remote Kangshung Face of Mount Everest, for life-changing views of Earth's highest peak; or make the pilgrimage into far western Tibet to the sacred Mount Kailash, revered by Hindus and Buddhists as the center of the universe.
Experience the stunning vistas found along the Friendship Highway, on an epic road journey from Lhasa to Kathmandu; or cycle across the vast Tibetan plateau, pausing to admire the views of the Himalaya on what is hailed as one of the world's great bike adventures.

Why travel with us
Innovate itineraries
A journey to Mount Kailash in the far west of Tibet is considered one of the world's great adventures, in one of the most remote regions. Our experience operating trips to Kailash, combined with our leaders and local knowledge ensure your time in Tibet is truly memorable.
Authentic experiences
Trekking in Tibet takes you up close to the mountains and local people as you travel across the high Tibetan plateau under your own steam, providing authentic insight to life in this region of the world.
Ultimate value
Our trips offer exceptional value for money, featuring good quality, centrally located hotels in Lhasa and expert leadership. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as all meals on trek, entrace fees, Everest National Park permits and private transportation.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Child safe tourism
We ask travellers to avoid giving money or sweets to children as it encourages begging instead of attending school. As an alternative, we suggest supporting local charities working to alleviate problems associated with poverty in China.
Local employment
Employing local people in our offices and in the field ensures that wages remain with the people who are custodians of the places and cultures we visit. Additionally, there is no one better to educate travellers about the landscape and culture than a local person.
Leave No Trace
We operate our itineraries following the principles of Leave No Trace ensuring that we take out all waste that we bring in.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Wilderness camping
Enjoy fully supported camping in remote locations with our outstanding crew of sherpas, porters and kitchen staff. While the campsite locations have been handpicked for their location, our commitment to responsible travel ensures our footprint is kept to a minimum.
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated good quality properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.

Leaders in the field

Weather
The travelling season in Tibet extends from the beginning of May through the end of October.
During May and June the days are clear and fine. However, the region closest to the Chinese/Nepal border is subject to monsoonal rains which continue from the middle of June through to the middle of September.
In late September and October a clear and stable weather pattern returns until the onset of the first winter snows in late October.
Time in Tibet
Lhasa is +8 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Chinese language is comprised of many different dialects, which some would argue are different languages, because although they share a common writing system, spoken variations of Chinese are often unintelligible to speakers of other dialects.
Modern Standard Chinese (aka Mandarin, Beijing dialect) is the primary and official language of China. In addition, Mongolian is official in Inner Mongolia, Uighur and Kyrgyz are official in Xinjiang, Zhuang is official in Guangxi; Yue (Cantonese) is official in Guangdong and Tibetan is official in Tibet
Different ‘dialects’ include Yue (Cantonese), Wu (Shanghainese), Minbei (Fuzhou), Minnan (Hokkien-Taiwanese), Xiang, Gan and Hakka dialects.
Most people involved in tourism or business, as well as many students, will speak a good deal of English, however any attempts to speak basic Chinese will be warmly received by the people you meet.
Currency
Chinese Yuan
Yuan can be purchased with US$ on arrival at your hotel in Lhasa.
ATM’s are available in Lhasa and larger towns.
Credit cards are generally accepted in the hotels we stay at.
International Dialing Code
+86
Electricity
Electricity in Tibet is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. Plugs vary greatly however the most common pin types are A (2 flat prong), C (2 round prong) or I (3 flat Australian).
Visas
Please note that you should NOT apply for a Tibet visa in your home country. We enter via Nepal, and not through a Chinese border, hence the visa will not be held valid. Our World Expeditions office in Nepal applies for the group visa for Tibet.  On arrival in Kathmandu you will need approx US$114
(American passport holders currently require US$198, Canadian passport holders currently require US$165) along with your passport for your visa to enter Tibet. The Chinese authorities in Kathmandu will process this. If you are planning on travelling to China after your visit to Tibet you should be aware that a Tibetan and Chinese visa are two different things. If entering Tibet from Nepal with plans to travel on to China thereafter, you will not be able to apply for a Chinese visa before departure. If you do, this will result in the Tibetan visa that we organise on your behalf, being cancelled. What would need to happen is that you obtain the Tibet visa through our offices and participate on your Tibetan Adventure. You will then need to return to Kathmandu and apply at the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu for your China visa. They will need a minimum of two full working days to process the same. This would mean you would need to remain in Kathmandu while your visa was being processed. If you are travelling in China before arriving into Tibet, you are able to apply for a Chinese visa in your country of origin and once in China, we will need to provide you with a copy of your Tibetan visa before you commence your final journey leg (for example, a train trip from Chengdu to Lhasa). You would not be permitted to board the train from Chengdu to Tibet unless you had the Tibetan visa approval in your physical possession to show to authorities. (If you are travelling as an individual or in a group of less than 4 people, then the visa fee is US$114. This increases to US$198 for American passport holders.)
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
