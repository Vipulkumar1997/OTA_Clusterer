Like its northern neighbour Kenya, Tanzania is a country blessed with the epic landscapes, ancient cultures, abundant flora and iconic wildlife that usually spring to mind when one thinks of Africa.
It's largely untamed and unspoiled and contains an enormous variety of stunning landscapes ranging from deserts and grassy savannas to tropical beaches, fertile valleys and the rugged peaks of the Great Rift Valley.
The country is dotted with national parks known for their spectacular scenery and significant wildlife populations. It's here that you'll have the chance to see Africa's iconic 'Big 5' game animals up close and in their natural environments, and to experience the fascinating culture and traditions of the Masai people.
Head to the Serengeti National Park to witness the awe-inspiring sight of the great annual migration, as millions of wildebeest and other animals make their yearly northward journey into Kenya's Masai Mara; or descend into the Ngorongoro Crater, the world's largest caldera, to find a treasure trove of exotic wildlife including lions, elephants, pink flamingoes and the endangered black rhino.
Challenge yourself with an exhilarating summit of Africa's highest peak, the snowcapped Mt Kilimanjaro; and then escape to the unforgettable island of Zanzibar, where you can unwind on breathtaking beaches and wander the labyrinthine streets of Stone Town, soaking up Swahili culture and trawling busy markets for spices, baskets and textiles.
Check out our range of unique itineraries and start planning your Tanzania adventure!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of our Tanzania programs. Our adventures provide a true wilderness experience by viewing wildlife in their natural habitat and supporting the protection of endangered wildlife species, diverse environments and local communities.
Authentic experiences
From summiting Mount Kilimanjaro to witnessing the great migration herds in the Serengeti and experiencing the tribal cultures to watching the sunset over the waters of Zanzibar, our programs are designed to give you a true sense of Tanzania's geographic and cultural diversity.
Ultimate value
Featuring quality safari accommodation and wilderness camps, enthusiastic camping crews and porters and private vehicles, our Tanzania adventures provide exceptional value for money. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, transferes, game drives, camping services, excursions and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
Our excellent trekking guides and camping crews are what make your Tanzania experience special. While our safari guides are skilled in highly skilled at spotting wildlife, our ratio of 2 clients to 1 guide on Kilimanjaro climbs means you will receive the best personal attention and encouragement on the mountain.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Guide development
Since 2012 we have sponsored a guide every year to complete a scholarship training course through the Kilimanjaro Guide Scholarship Foundation.
Waste disposal and plastic reduction
We carry all of our waste from camp and dispose of it responsibly in the nearest city. Additionally, reusable containers store food our food.
Encouragment of women guides
We actively encourage women to break the male dominated world of guiding. While we have two female guides on Mount Kilimanjaro, we also have a number of female kitchen crew and mountain porters.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Safari lodges
In game parks, national parks and rural locations we use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area. Some may have extra facilities such as a swimming pool or private balcony.
Permanent safari camps
Like a tented hotel room, this is the perfect way to experience the African wilderness. We use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Mountain huts
Some treks feature camping in a communal dormitory with basic shared facilities.

Leaders in the field
Victor Kombe
Victor was born in the heart of Kilimanjaro and has been a safari guide for eight years. Tracking wild animals is in his blood and he has an intimate knowledge of all the wildlife, from the smallest insect to the largest predators. The big cats are his particular favourites, especially the elusive leopard which Victor describes as "an animal work of art".
January B Kayombo
January has been working 14 years as a driver-guide in Tanzania, with his favourite being the Serengeti National Park. He is a keen wildlife enthusiast with a passion for bird watching, flora and fauna. January's favourite animals are all the big cats, and favourite bird is the Didric Cuckoo. January's knowledge, skills and experience make him very popular with clients.
Anjela Tumaini
Anjela is one of our female guides on Kilimanjaro, breaking stereotypes in this male dominated field. She first worked as a porter in 2012 and in the same year made her first summit ascent and obtained her guides license. Anjela has completed the National Parks and First Aid courses. She enjoys meeting clients from all around the world and encouraging them to reach the summit.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

Where to Go

Summit the snow-capped Mt Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak (or Mt Meru for younger students)
Experience Maasai culture & witness the annual wildebeest migration in the Serengeti
Explore the labyrinthine streets of Zanzibar Stone Town, the sparkling jewel of Swahili culture
The Ngorongoro Crater, which has been called the eighth wonder of the natural world, is designated a World Heritage Site and a Biosphere Reserve, often referred to as the ‘Garden of Eden’.
Sail, snorkel and dive the beaches and coral reefs around Pemba
Lake Manyara National Park, noted for its elephant, giraffe, tree-climbing lions, baboons and warthog populations.
Tarangire National Park, known for its herds of elephants
Weather
Tanzania's climate varies from fertile west to arid interior to tropical coastline, but as a general rule, the country is usually warm by day and cool by night.
Tanzania has three climatic seasons: the 'short rains' (October - November), the 'long rains' (March - May) and the dry season outside of these months. Downpours generally occur in the late afternoons, with the earlier part of the day usually being warm and sunny.
Mainland Tanzania is divided into four climatic and physiographic regions: the highlands of the northeast and southwest; the high inland mountiand and lake region near Mt Kilimanjaro; the hot arid central plateau; and the humid lowlands of the coast.
Half of the mainland receives insufficient precipitation to support crop cultivation, with the coast and offshore islands receiving high annual rainfalls.
Temperatures plummet near the summit of Mt Kilimanjaro, where it is possible to experience temperatures as low as -20°C (-4°F), with rain, cold, snow and high-altitude conditions all commonplace as you ascend.
Zanzibar and Pemba have high temperatures and humidity year-round, with rainfalls highest in April - May and lowest in November - December.
Time in Tanzania
Tanzania is +3 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Swahili is the official and primary language of Tanzania and Zanzibar, and is also the lingua franca of central and eastern Africa. English is also an official language and common in commerce, administration and tertiary education. Arabic is spoken in Zanzibar and along the Muslim coast, with many local languages also spoken throughout the country. Attempting a few Swahili greetings and phrases will earn you lots of smiles!
Currency
Tanzanian Shilling (divided into cents)
US dollars cash are by far the easiest foreign currency to exchange in Tanzania. It can either be changed to T-shillings, or used directly (but often at a lower rate). We recommend you only take US$ notes from 2006 or newer, and with the new large-head design. Older or torn notes are not accepted in Tanzania.
Euro can also be changed in many places. However the rate is not always as good.
In Tanzania credit cards are becoming more useful and the quite a few hotels now take payment by credit cards. Please be aware identity theft is common so please be careful when using them for payment, and never allow your credit card to be out of your sight at all times.
There are only a few ATM machines in major cities that are connected internationally and reliability is not guaranteed.
International Dialing Code
+255
Electricity
Electricity in Tanzania is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin types are D (3 pin round) and G (UK – 3 prong).
