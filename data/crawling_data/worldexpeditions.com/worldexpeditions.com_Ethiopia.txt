Blessed with rich cultures, unique wildlife, startlingly blue skies and dramatic landscapes littered with ancient treasures, Ethiopia is a captivating destination that might not yet be on your radar, but should be.
Discover museums and colourful markets in the dynamic capital of Addis Ababa; and explore Camelot-style medieval castles and royal palaces in Gondar, Ethiopia's fascinating former capital.
Head to the spectacular Simien Mountains to hike along striking escarpment trails; tackle an ascent of Ras Dashen, Ethiopia's highest peak; and spot unique wildlife including gelada baboons, walia ibex and Simien foxes.
Visit the holy town of Lalibela and see its World Heritage Listed rock-hewn churches, superbly carved out of volcanic rock; or make the pilgrimage to Axum, littered with ancient obelisks and revered as the home of the Ark of the Covenant.
Experience Christmas Ethiopian-style with the Genna festival; or watch the moving rituals and colourful processions of the Timket festival, with thousands of white-robed Ethiopian Orthodox faithful observing the Epiphany.
Marvel at ornate island monasteries and the thundering Blue Nile Falls with a cruise on Lake Tana; and witness the largely unchanged lifestyles and unique traditions of the Omo Valley's diverse ethnic tribal groups.
If you're looking for a destination with a difference, combining ancient history, cultural riches and stunning landscapes, this might be the place!

Leaders in the field
Elias Berehe
Elias has a degree in Education and previously worked as a teacher, however his passion for travel and learning new things saw him change careers and attain his tour guide diploma six years ago. He has a friendly and sensitive nature and enjoys sharing his extensive knowledge of the cultural, social and historical gems of Ethiopia.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it.

Essential information
Where to Go & Weather
Time
Language
Currency
Dialing Code
Electricity
Visas
Health & Safety
Weather
Ethiopia, although almost on the equator, experiences a temperate climate and sometimes temperatures below freezing in the Simien Mountains, due to the high altitude here (up to 4600m in places).
Throughout the highlands, the climate is moderate and daytime temperatures rarely exceed 25oC. The temperature can drop at night to 8 - 10oC at around 2500m and below zero in higher areas. Frosts are not uncommon.
Lalibela and Addis Ababa are at a similar altitudes, that being around 2600m, and have a similar temperature range of about 6 – 25oC.
The hottest months are April and May, just before the main rains with the coldest months being June to August.
Ethiopia boasts “thirteen months of sunshine" a year - referring to the thirteen months of the Julian calender.
There are, however, two rainy seasons a year: the irregular short rains from late January to early March and the long rains that stretch from June until mid September.
One of the most ideal times to visit Ethiopia is between October and January, when the rains have ceased and the land is green.
It can rain or snow at any time of the year at altitude so a good waterproof jacket and warm layers of clothing are essential items on your packing list.
Time in Ethiopia
Ethiopia is +3 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Amharic (official national language); Oromo (official - State of Oromiya); Somali (official - State of Sumale); Tigrigna (official - State of Tigray) and Afar (official - State of Afar).
Currency
Ethiopian Birr
We suggest carrying money in US dollar cash (other currencies may cause confusion at banks) – use notes printed after 2006 only.
Many hotels will change USD cash into Birr.
A cash card affiliated with Visa or Mastercard that can be presented at a foreign exchange bureau or used in an ATM machine is also useful in major centres only.  ATMs/Cash Machines are found throughout Addis Ababa and in major cities such as Bahir Dar and Gondar. Beyond these centres it will be very difficult to change money.
The Jupiter Cazanchise and Jupiter Bole hotels (most commonly the group hotels) also have ATM machines which issue Birr in their lobbies. (NOTE: reliability of these machines cannot be guaranteed.) For this purpose, credit cards are very useful. However, few if any places accept credit cards for payment of purchases or meals.
International Dialing Code
+251
Electricity
Electricity in Ethiopia is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas for Ethiopia are required for passport holders from the following countries:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
It is now possible to arrange single entry tourist visas for Ethiopia online prior to travel. Travellers must be entering the country via Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. Go to, https://www.evisa.gov.et/#/home, and follow the instructions (visa fees apply). Please note online processing may take up to three days to be completed by the relevant authorities.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
