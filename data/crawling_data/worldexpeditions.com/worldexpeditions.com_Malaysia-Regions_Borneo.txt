The intriguing island of Borneo is host to three different nations - forming the southern bulk of the island is Indonesian Kalimantan; while in the north, the small country of Brunei is wedged between the two Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak.
Sabah and Sarawak are plucked straight from a naturalist's daydream - dramatic landscapes of craggy mountains, jagged limestone outcrops and virgin rainforest, teeming with exotic wildlife including proboscis monkeys, macaques, sun bears, pygmy elephants and orangutans. Remote rivers and jungle trails cut paths through untouched and unspoiled wilderness, leading to peaceful villages where vibrant indigenous cultures are preserved.
Climb to the summit of majestic Mount Kinabalu, Borneo's highest peak, for incredible views over the island's jungle canopy below; and reward yourself afterward with a soak in the soothing mineral waters of the Porong Hot Springs.
Meet the intelligent orangutans at the Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary, the world's largest of its kind; and head to the World Heritage Listed Gunung Mulu National Park to explore one of the world's largest cave systems and climb striking, razor sharp pinnacles of limestone karst.
Trek through virgin rainforest to Sungai Mawang in search of orangutans and other wildlife; mountain bike through twisting jungle tracks; and engage with the indigenous Iban people, staying in a traditional Iban longhouse and waking to sounds of the jungle.
Take a look at our unique program of Borneo adventures and join us as we explore the cultural and environmental treasures of spectacular Sabah and Sarawak!

Responsible travel

Wildlife conservation
We sponsor and participate in orangutan nest surveys and partner with NGOs to conduct environmental research.
Cultural preservation
For over 25 years we have worked with Iban communities at Batang Ai as part of our "Ulu Ai Project" to promote culture and traditions such as weaving and pottery.
Animal welfare focus
The animal encounters on our itineraries in Borneo are in the wild, with the exception of visiting Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary, a rehabilitiation centre for orphaned baby orangutans. When viewing wildlife, we keep a safe distance and follow local wildlife watching by-laws of forestry regulations.

Health & Safety
Weather
The weather is like other tropical regions governed by the monsoons. The wet season lasts from October to March, peaking in December and January, although rain can occur at any time during the year.
There is a higher level of rainfall in Sarawak than in Sabah. Temperatures vary little throughout the year and reach a maximum of 31°C (88°F) and drop to low 20’s°C (68°F) overnight. Inland temperatures can vary particularly in the more mountainous areas where it can fall to freezing on the summit of Mount Kinabalu.
Time in Borneo
Borneo is +8 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Bahasa Malaysia (official), English is also widely spoken
Currency
Malaysian Ringgit
In the main cities (eg. Kuching and Kota Kinabalu) you will generally be able to change AUD / EUR / US / GBP.
Traveller’s cheques can be harder to change and will incur a fee, however they are a safe way to carry money. Banks usually offer the best rate for exchange of travellers cheques
Credit cards and ATM are available in most large cities and hotels, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
International Dialing Code
+60
Electricity
Electricity in Malaysia is 240 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is G (UK – 3 prong).
Visas
Visas are exempt for passport holders from the following countries, if visiting Borneo as a tourist for a stay of up to one month:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
Generally most visitors can stay in Malaysia for 3 months without a visa however, in Borneo the maximum tourist visa is one month (30 days) only. If you would like to extend your stay in Sarawak or Sabah it is not a problem to arrange through the immigration office in either Kota Kinabalu or Kuching.
*All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
