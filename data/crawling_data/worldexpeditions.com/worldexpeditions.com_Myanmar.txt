Blessed with cultural riches and striking natural beauty, Myanmar is a surprising travel destination with so much to offer.
No trip to Myanmar is complete without a visit to Bagan, one of the world's greatest archaeological sites. This awe-inspiring ancient city is filled with literally thousands of incredible Buddhist temples, pagodas, palaces and monasteries. To see the stone spires of Bagan rising from the fertile plains of the Irrawaddy Delta at sunrise or sunset is truly one of Asia's most mesmerising sights.
In Yangon, you'll find handsome colonial architecture and bustling open-air markets alongside sacred shrines and temples, including the golden complex of Shwedagon Paya. And in Mandalay, you can catch an entertaining performance of traditional marionette puppetry or survey the city from atop Mandalay Hill.
Head out of town and take a cruise along the tranquil Irrawaddy, or kayak among the floating markets, gardens and villages of Inle Lake. Join us on a trek through quiet forests and enjoy village homestay with a local family, or join one of our superb cycle journeys and experience Myanmar's lush landscapes by bike.
This is a stunning country yet to be consumed by Western culture - a place of ancient cultural traditions and great ethnic diversity, with the generous spirit of the Burmese people rising above the country's challenging history. Join us on an adventure to this warm, welcoming and fascinating destination!

Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
Still relatively new to the tourism scene; Myanmar boasts an authentic culture preserved within the unique cities, towns and traditional hill tribes that our adventures encompass. From cultural and family touring to active adventures, our itineraries take you deep into the heart of this magical country on a journey you will never forget.
Ultimate value
Our Myanmar adventures offer you great value for money. While internal flight costs are included on all trips, our cycling trips feature a support vehicle for travellers who need a break. We aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost, such as most meals, accommodation, transfers, gear hire and excursions.
Experienced local guides
The expert local knowledge and passion demostrated by our team is second to none, and you will be impressed as you discover the authentic side of Myanmar with them. Highly skilled in exceeding even the most discerning traveller's expectations, our guides offer you a journey that digs deeper than the traditional Burmese itinerary.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Animal welfare focus
Myanmar is home to a number of threatened species that, due to a lack of environmental awareness, are often exploited for domestic consumption or sold illegally. We discourage our travellers from purchasing animal and plant products that exploit wildlife or aid in the destruction of species and habitats such as elephant ivory, tortoise shell, animal skins and traditional medicines made from animal parts or rare plants.
Community engagement
Our itineraries include much interaction with Myanmar's people, such as village walks in Bagan, visits to monasteries, excursions to the local markets, a ride on Yangon's circle train, cooking classes in family homes and lunch in a Nunnery.
Child safe tourism
We ask travellers to avoid giving money or sweets to children begging as it encourages this mentality instead of attending school. Instead, we suggest supporting local charities working to alleviate problems associated with poverty in Myanmar.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Inns
We use quality inns typically situated in natural environments. They are not luxury inns however we ensure they offer you a truly authentic experience.
Homestays
Stay with a local family as they open their home to you and gain a wonderful insight into the local culture.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?

Originally from a small village near Bago, Kyaw Thu moved to Shan State and worked in tourism in the early days that Myanmar was opening up. Kyaw Thu has a very wide knowledge of all kind of subjects, from history to daily life of country people.
Myint Myint Khaing
Myint Myint has been working as tour leader since 2006 and loves to lead to people from different countries around Myanmar to show them unique places, cultures and ways of life. She is passionate about Myanmar, which led to her becoming a guide: "I love its beauty, the peace of the pagodas, the safety and the lush green countryside and dense forests".
Nwe Ni THein (Nina)
Nina is always in a happy mood, eager to show and explain the beauty of her country. With more than 10 years' experience she is very focused on making the whole trip seamless for her clients. Her wide general knowledge enables her to explain many facets and sights of Myanmar. Nina speaks fluent English and was born and grew up in Northern Shan State (Lashio).

Her adventures have included setting up community projects in Myanmar, studying Mandarin in China, trekking in Nepal, spending time in a remote Bedouin camp in Jordan and chasing the Big 5 through Tanzania. With a particular passion for all things Asia, Laura loves to share the best of this region with others.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it.

Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Where to Go
Explore the countless Buddhist temples and pagodas, Hindu shrines, handsome colonial architecture and open air markets in the former capital of Yangon
Get up close to Shwedagon Paya, Yangon’s enormous golden temple complex and one of the world’s most sacred Buddhist sites
Take a cruise along the tranquil Irrawaddy River
Visit the awe-inspiring ancient temples of Bagan, literally in their thousands
Take a boat trip among the floating villages, gardens and markets of the placid Inle Lake
Head to Mandalay, Myanmar’s cultural capital, for entertaining live performances of pwe (traditional theatre), hsaing waing (folk orchestra), Mahagita (traditional Burmese songs), marionette puppet theatre and nat dances (honouring Myanmar’s important spirit beings)
Relax on the beautiful beaches and islands of Myanmar’s extensive coastline
Weather
Most of Myanmar lies with the Tropic Zone.
The hot season extends from March until October, and the cool season, from November through to February.
Temperatures during these seasons range from 17° to 40° C (62° to 104° F) in lower Myanmar.
Temperatures in upper Myanmar are usually less and mountainous regions can at times be cold.
The country receives pratically all its yearly rainfall between mid-May and October, the period of the Southwest Monsoon.
Time in Myanmar
Myanmar is +6:30 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Burmese is the primary and official state language, part of the Sino-Tibetan language family.
English is widely spoken as it was once the primary language of education, and is now the secondary language of instruction in schools and universities.
Many different indigenous languages are also spoken by the country’s ethnic minorities, including Mon, Shan, Kachin, Chin and Karen languages.
Currency
Kyat
US Dollars are the best currency for exchanging and the Euro is becoming more popular, especially in Yangon. The exchange rate in Yangon is generally better than upcountry and the larger the bill, the better the rate
Bring new series US Dollar bills (“big heads” instead of “small heads”) and with series numbers not starting with CB- these are not accepted in Myanmar due to rumours of these series being counterfeit. Notes should be in very good condition and not torn, dirty or washed as these will not be accepted in Myanmar, even in many hotels!
Only some upscale restaurants and some hotels do accept credit cards (surcharge of 3-8%) but it is not recommended to rely on this service as the Internet often shuts down during the day making payment by card impossible.
CB Bank, KBZ Bank and several other banks now have ATMs which accept overseas ATM cards and credit cards. Please note: Even where cards are accepted, payment terminals often don’t work and are hindered by poor Internet and telephone connectivity and power supply. Don’t rely solely on accessing money from ATMs in Myanmar.
