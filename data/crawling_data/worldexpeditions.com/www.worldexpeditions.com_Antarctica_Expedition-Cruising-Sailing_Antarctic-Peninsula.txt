Trip highlights
The most wildlife-rich part of Antarctica - penguins, whales, seals, sea birds
Narrow sheltered waterways and fjords
Spectacular mountains rising directly out of the sea
Historic sites
Active scientific stations
Great variety of terrain over short distances
Icebergs and active glaciers
Opportunity to camp on ice (optional)
Kayaking through Antarctic waters (optional)
Cast off your anchor and explore the incredible beauty of the Antarctic Peninsula. We cruise from the tip of South America and cross the famed Drake Passage. Accompanied by expert naturalists we spot albatross gliding gracefully over the southern ocean as we eagerly await our first sight of land. The Antarctic Peninsula offers dramatic scenery and an immense variety of wildlife, a veritable hotbed of activity waiting to be discovered. In the southern summer large ice-free areas provide breeding grounds for large numbers of seabirds, penguins and seals. From King George Island and Penguin Island we will sail down to the beautiful Paradise Bay, where we make our first landing on the Antarctic mainland. The narrow and spectacular Lemaire Channel is surrounded by mountains and glaciers and a popular passage for several species of whales. In the Antarctic Peninsula Minke Whales, and sometimes Orca and Humpback Whales can be spotted as well as the ferocious-looking Leopard Seals. We will return to Ushuaia renewed, with a fresh perspective on the world and a deep seated appreciation for its wonders.

Discovery and Cruising
Although there is no commitment to extended walking on this journey we nonetheless want to keep the ‘accent on the active’. We therefore advise that any physical training you complete before undertaking the trip will be to good effect.

Meals:
D
Day 2-3
Cross the Drake Passage
During these two days, we will sail across the Drake Passage. When we cross the Antarctic Convergence, we will arrive in the circum-Antarctic up welling zone. In this area we may see Wandering Albatrosses, Grey Headed Albatrosses, Black-browed Albatrosses, Light- mantled Sooty Albatrosses, Cape Pigeons, Southern Fulmars, Wilson’s Storm Petrels, Blue Petrels and Antarctic Petrels. Near the South Shetland Islands, we will glimpse at the first icebergs.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 4-8
Antarctic Peninsula
We will sail directly to “High Antarctica”, passing the Melchior islands and the Schollaert Channel between Brabant and Anvers Island.  On Cuverville Island, a small precipitous island, nestled between the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula and Danco Island, we will find a large colony of Gentoo Penguins and breeding pairs of Brown Skuas. If we land on Danco Island, we can observe Chinstrap Penguins, and possibly Weddell and Crabeater Seals. In Neko Harbour, we will have the opportunity to set foot on the Antarctic Continent in a magnificent landscape of huge glaciers, and enjoy the landscape during zodiac cruises. When sailing to Paradise Bay, with its myriad icebergs and deep cut fjords, we will have the opportunity for zodiac cruising between the icebergs in the inner parts of the fjords. In this area, we have good chances to see Humpback Whales and Minke Whales. After sailing through the Neumayer Channel, we hope to get permission to visit the British research station and post office - Port Lockroy on Goudier Island. Close to Port Lockroy we may also offer a landing on Jougla Point, with Gentoo Penguins and Imperial Shags. We will also sail through the spectacular Lemaire Channel to Pleneau and Petermann Island, where we can find Adelie Penguins and Blue-eyed Shags. In this area there are good chances to encounter Humpback Whales, Minke Whales and Fin Whales. A visit to one of the scientific stations in Antarctica, will give you an insight into the life of modern Antarcticans working on the White Continent. Sailing north through Neumayer Channel, we will arrive at the Melchior Islands with a very beautiful landscape with icebergs, where we may encounter Leopard Seals, Crabeater Seals and whales.
Meals:
B,L,D

Meals:
B,L,D
Day 11
Disembark Ushuaia, where trip concludes
During the early morning we will cruise up the Beagle Channel, before quietly slipping into dock in Ushuaia. It is a busy time, with people saying farewell to our crew and others who have shared the intensity of being in a magnificent white wilderness. We will head off in our different directions, hopefully with a new found sense of the power of natural forces.
