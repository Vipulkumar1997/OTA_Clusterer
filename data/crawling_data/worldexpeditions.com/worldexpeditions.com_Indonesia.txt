Blessed with rich cultures and astonishing natural beauty, Indonesia is a true choose-your-own-adventure destination. With a staggering diversity of cultures, landscapes and experiences waiting to be encountered, everyone from beach bums and culture buffs to serious outdoor adventurers will struggle to narrow down their itinerary once setting their sights on this vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands.
Don't miss beautiful Bali, where you can bliss out on perfect beaches, snorkel the turquoise waters of the Indian Ocean, cycle through lush landscapes and enjoy the island's fragrant cuisine and rich cultural heritage.
Admire the ancient splendour of Borobudur, one of the world's most significant Buddhist sites, and shop the lively streets of Yogyakarta for traditional puppets, silverware and beautiful batik fabrics.
Head to the island of Lombok to climb the majestic summit of Mount Rinjani, where you'll be rewarded with spectacular views over Segara Anak Lake from the crater rim. Afterward, reward yourself with a visit to the postcard-perfect Gili Islands for swimming and snorkeling in paradise.
Take a trek though the forests of East Java, hike to the volcanic peaks of Mount Bromo or Mount Sibayak, encounter ancient Komodo dragons and visit orangutan conservation projects deep in the jungles of Sumatra.

Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
Explore Indonesia beyond the tourist beaches and you will discover a intriguing tropical paradise that never fails to impress. Our adventures take an active approach designed to get you off the beaten path, and while most itieraries include atleast one summit hike, others feature jungle treks to witness wild orangutans in their natural environment and island hopping in the Gilis.
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of our Indonesia program. When you book one of our adventures you are supporting safety and sustainability in the region as well as employment for local communities.
Experienced local guides
Our bilingual guides are part of local communities and committed to providing you with an exceptional experience by imparting their extensive knowledge and introducing you to island life and culture. Many of the guides are also members of environmental care and sustainability groups that resound our responsible travel policies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Litter collection
The 10 Pieces litter collection initiative is offered on our Mount Rinjani climb. Trekkers volunteer to collect 10 pieces of litter that they find on the trail each day, which we then dispose of responsibly. This is a simple and effective way to harness the collective power of tourists to keep wilderness trails clean and educate local communities about the negative impact of litter on the environment.
Animal welfare focus
We advocate for cruelty free animal encounters, encouraging travellers to follow the guidelines in our comprehensive Animal Welfare Code of Conduct as we seek to inform stakeholders about animal welfare matters.
Child safe tourism
Children working and living in tourist areas are especially vulnerable to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. We protect vulnerable children by adhering to our Child Protection Code of Conduct.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, pleasant and reliable.
Inns
We use quality inns typically situated in natural environments. They are not luxury inns however we ensure they offer you a truly authentic experience.
Camping
Enjoy our fully supported camping in quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.

Electricity
Electricity in Indonesia is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Most passport holders, including Australians, British, Canadians, Americans and New Zealanders will be issued with a 30 day ‘visa on arrival’ when landing in Indonesia. This means you do not have to apply for a visa prior to your departure if staying for 30 days or less. You will however, need to have a passport that is valid for at least 6 months from your time of arrival into Indonesia.
If you are from another country, please check your visas requirements.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
