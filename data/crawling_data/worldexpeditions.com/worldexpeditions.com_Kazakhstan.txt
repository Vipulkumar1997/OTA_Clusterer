Kazakhstan
Magical camp spot on the mountain biking trip, Kazakhstan
Cycling across the grasslands of Kazakhstan after being dropped off by a helicopter

													 |

xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
The largest of the Central Asian countries by far, Kazakhstan is a land of big skies and vast open spaces. Dominated by the seemingly unending northern steppe, the country is also blessed with beautiful lakes and a rugged spine of snowcapped mountains along its borders with China and Kyrgyzstan. With such raw and remote landscapes, untouched and unspoiled by crowds, this is a destination superbly suited to outdoor adventuring.
After exploring the leafy boulevards, cafe culture and chic shopping of Almaty, the elegant former capital, you'll want to get straight out into Kazakhstan's wild landscapes.
Head to the stunning ranges of the Tian Shan "Celestial Mountains" for a unique mountain biking adventure that will take you through the incredible landscapes of Kazakhstan and neighbouring Kyrgyzstan. With huge skies overhead and snowcapped peaks in the distance, the only traffic you'll encounter in this rugged wilderness will be the occasional horseman or nomadic Kazakh moving their herds to higher pastures.
Cycle along glacier-fed rivers, through pine forests and open rolling grasslands carpeted in wildflowers, enjoying rocky jeep track ascents to high mountain passes, adrenalin-pumping downhill sprints to the grassy valleys below, and two days of unforgettable heli-biking in Kyrgyzstan's lush Karkara Valley.
Or for the experienced mountaineer, tackle a challenging expedition to climb the spectacular ice pyramid of Khan Tengri (7,010 m / 22,999 ft), Kazakhstan's highest point and the second highest peak in the Tian Shan mountains.
Join us as we explore the outstanding landscapes of Central Asia!

Authentic experiences
There is no better way to explore a new destination than under your own steam, and as the ninth largest country in the world, Kazakhstan is ideal for just that.

Health & Safety
Weather
Kazakhstan, a vast country of Central Asia, has a markedly continental climate, with very cold winters almost everywhere, while summers are warm in the north and definitely hot in the south.
There are no obstacles which could protect the country from cold air masses of polar or Siberian origin, while in summer the hot winds from the deserts of Iran can blow.
Central Asia gets very cold in winter and very hot in the summer, because of the distance from the oceans, so that both the highest and coldest records are noticeable: in the north the temperature can reach -50 °C in winter, as well as 40 °C in summer, while in the south it can go from 35 °C to 45 °C.
The clashes between different air masses can give rise to strong winds and dust storms, especially in spring and in the south. In the cold months, northern winds can cause blizzards, but without great snow accumulations due to the scarce amount of precipitation.
Time in Kazakhstan
Kazakhstan is +6 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Kazakh (Qazaq), Russian (both official)
Currency
Kazakhstani Tenge
International Dialing Code

Electricity
Electricity in Kazakhstan is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Please check current requirements with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Visa are required for Kazakhstan for passport holders from the following countries:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
Visa regulations change and you should be prepared for this. If you are stopping over or transiting other countries en-route to your destination, you should also check the visa requirements for that destination.  It is your responsibility to obtain the necessary visas.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
