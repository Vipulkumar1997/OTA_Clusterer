With its energetic cities, cultural treasures and outrageous natural beauty, South America is an unbeatable destination that’s superbly suited to outdoor adventuring.
From the formidable spine of the Andes and the rugged peaks of Patagonia to lush river deltas, vast grassy plains, arid coastal deserts, pristine beaches, Wild West canyons and thundering waterfalls—it’s hard to imagine a place with a wider variety of dramatic environments to discover.
Experience the grand temples and terraces of Machu Picchu, hike among the majestic wilderness of Patagonia and explore the twisting tributaries of the Amazon River basin. Explore the ancient ruins of powerful civilisations, encounter exotic wildlife and engage with local cultures by meeting remote indigenous communities.
Visit the thundering Iguazu Falls, see the surreal geysers and salt flats of the Atacama Desert, or take an unforgettable safari through the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland. Discover the famous wildlife of the Galapagos Islands, or visit mysterious Easter Island, one of Earth’s most isolated and intriguing places.
Soak up incredible culture and nightlife in Buenos Aires, Rio, Bogotá and Santiago; and tour the cobblestoned streets and handsome colonial architecture of Cusco, Quito, Cartagena and Salvador.
Join us as we explore the highlights and hidden gems of this extraordinary continent!

Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
Responsible Travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in South America. When you book one of our adventures you’re supporting true sustainability in the protection of local communities, natural environments and wildlife.
World Firsts
We proudly pioneered the first commercial Inca Rivers Trek in Peru (2004), showcasing a remote trail to the North of Machu Picchu; The Great Patagonia Traverse (2012), through untouched National Parks in Chile and Argentina; and the Venezuela Lost World trek (2001), amongst the great Tepui Mountains and spectacular Angel Falls.
Innovative Active Itineraries
We do things a little differently. We have something for everyone, from gentle walks to challenging climbs and vehicle based journeys as well as voyages. No matter what, all will get you off the tourist track to revel in natural environments, interact with remote communities and enjoy the camaraderie of your small group of fellow travellers. We can also customise your very own ‘ultimate’ itinerary.
Great Value
Quality services at the best prices make our adventures great value for money. Having essential items like meals, sightseeing and entry fees included in the trip cost allows you to better budget for your big adventure, and eliminates the risk of having to carry large sums of money around with you on your journey.
Expert Guides
Our guides in the field are the real keys to our success, making your experiences exceptional. From Simon Yates, author of ‘Touching the Void’, to Javier Bello, one of the most experienced guides in the Andes—our team of expert guides mean the difference between a good and an excellent adventure. It’s their knowledge and passion for the continent’s landscapes and best held secret places, restaurants and vantage points that will take your travels to a whole new level.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel
South America is home to one of the world's most important natural environments - the Amazon Basin, often referred to as the lungs of the world. The exotic continent boasts a multitude of diverse natural wonders including the Andes Mountains, Galapagos Islands, Torres Del Paine and the Atacama Desert in addition to its disctinct cultural diversity, including indigneous Inca people, European influenced cultures and the 'gauchos' of the Pampas, making it no secret that South America has much to protect. In order to minimise our impact on the natural environment, we practice the '7 Principals of Leave No Trace' and support local economies by employing guides and staff from local communities. Our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct, Child Welfare Code of Conduct and Porter Welfare Policy ensure the well-being of animals and children we encounter on our adventures, as well as the mountain porters we employ on our treks.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in good 3 to 4 star properties that are generally centrally located, atmospheric, and reliable and where we have seen a good track record with traveller satisfaction.
Lodges
In Patagonia and the Amazon we use a variety of quality lodges. They are not luxury lodges but what they do offer is very comfortable accommodation which is well maintained and with many facilities. Generally, the trip notes that we have prepared for each trip will give you details of the types of properties we use on any one itinerary.
Eco campsites
On some itineraries in Patagonia we use an eco camp located within the national park. A tribute to the Kaweskar people, the sustainable camp provides a ‘back to nature’ experience but spares nothing when it comes to comfort. The geodesic domes are perfectly suited to the Patagonian climate featuring organic elements, wooden floors and windows in the ceiling to stargaze at night. Meals are shared in one of the three interconnected community domes.
Camping
On many of our trips we will erect campsites in wilderness terrains. These feature two person tents, a dining tent and a portable toilet tent when permanent amenities are not available or their presence is ecologically unsound. The spacious tents, most of which you can stand up in, are well ventilated with insect nets.
Mountain huts
On some occasions we use mountain huts, also referred to as refugios. You can expect these to be basic but comfortable and from time to time the sleeping arrangements are dormitory style – in keeping with the true mountain spirit!

Leaders in the field
Andreas Holland
Andreas has always made our South America programs special. He has lived in South America for over 30 years, much of this time in Peru. His special knowledge of the mountains and passion for supporting local communities is evident in our program in Peru and Bolivia. Each year Andreas travels to different parts of the world to impart his vast knowledge, so stay tuned, he may be in your city soon!
Angel Armesto
Angel brings a Latin American connection – living and working in Argentina. He is an accomplished mountaineer with some 20 years of experience. Angel has led several groups to the summit of Mt Everest. In addition to his extensive climbing background Angel has previously led several of our Ama Dablam and Aconcagua Expeditions. Angel is well known for his infectious sense of humour and excellent cooking skills.
Javier Bello
Javier is one of the most experienced guides in the Andes having worked as a professional trek and tour guide for more than 30 years. He specialises in our longer high altitude treks of which his favourite is the superb Huayhuash Circuit, Peru. His knowledge of the mountain trails is simply astounding. That, combined with his ability to recount the cultural and natural history of Peru, makes him the perfect guide for Peru adventures.
Rene Flores
Rene is a graduate of Cusco University and started guiding our groups in Peru 15 years ago. He is trilingual in English, Spanish and German. Rene is also an expert in traditional Andean medicines and has given specialist classes on the subject in the USA. Rene's deep interest in Andean cultural and musical traditions makes him a truly fascinating guide, bringing a deeper understanding of the region for his travellers. His favourite trek is the high Inca Trail.
Josmar Valer
Josmar, known by friends and travellers as 'Chema', has endless energy and great humour, providing his groups with an unforgettable Andes experience. His enthusiasm and knowledge of the environment is unrivalled, built over 15 years' guiding. He is trilingual in English, Spanish and Quechua. He loves any trek that's off the beaten track, of which World Expeditions has many.
Victor Olarte
Victor has been one of the managers and is the driving force of the World Expeditions office in Cusco for more than 25 years and has a superb knowledge of the complexities of adventure travel. He really was one of the pioneers in Cusco and remains a well respected member of the tourism community. There is no problem that Victor cannot solve having met thousands of our clients during their time in the highlands of Peru.
Simon Yates
Simon has been at the very forefront of mountaineering for almost two decades with first ascents in the Andes, Himalaya and Karakoram. Best known as the climbing partner to Joe Simpson in Touching the Void, Simon has developed a strong reputation as an engaging expedition leader.
Jose Ugarte
Jose has been leading tours and treks for more than 20 years and if he hadn't become a guide would have ended up a botanist or biologist in the Amazon. We're happy he chose the former as he is now recognised as one of Cusco's best guides with great humour and endless knowledge. His favourite trips involve both trekking and expeditions into the rainforest.
Ernestina ‘Tina’ Valeriano
Ernestina has been working as a professional guide for five years but everyone who meets her thinks she must have been born one! Born in Cusco and brought up speaking 'Quechua' - the language of the Incas – Tina has a profound knowledge and connection with the Andes and her personality makes her a real favourite not just with the clients but will all the trekking and touring staff.
Daniel de Granville
Daniel was born in Brazil and has spent the past 18 years around the Pantanal Wetlands, where he works as a nature photographer, teaches in qualification courses and leads special interest eco tours. Being very patient and detail-oriented, Daniel likes to lead trips with peculiar objectives such as photographing jaguars in the wild or diving with anacondas and pink-river dolphins.
Herve Valluy
French by birth, Spanish speaking Herve has been leading trips in Patagonia for over 10 years and specialises in the Paine Circuit. His passion for trekking in remote regions is infectious, as our groups on the circuit will agree.
Admil Arce
Admil studied Andean Anthropology and Archaeology before becoming a guide in 2004. He is a great companion for anyone wanting to travel through the mountains and valleys of Southern Peru with his knowledge of local customs and both modern and pre Inca history. Like many guides he loves the Inca Trail despite having walked it so many times over the years!
Lily Caceres
Lily is the operations manager of the World Expeditions Cusco office and has overseen all our tours and treks for more than two decades. She has real attention to detail and makes sure that every little detail is carefully organised by our large team of professional guides and camp-staff in the Andes. Come rain or shine Lily will have it covered!
Joana Miranda
Joana is one of our youngest guides and is a university graduate of Archaeology and Andean Mythology. She was born in the highlands of Cusco and speaks Quechua, English, Spanish and Portuguese. Joana is happiest leading our longer treks, though still feels that the classic high Inca Trail is the most beautiful Andes short trek.
Sarah Higgins
Sarah joined World Expeditions in 2006 and became operations manager in 2010. South America is her second home and she has enjoyed many adventures in its beautiful landscapes. Her travels include ‘across the circle’ into Antarctica, among many others. When Sarah is not planning itineraries you’ll find her out on the ‘rock’ and in the Australian bush with her avid interest in rock climbing and bushwalking.
Greg Lee
There’s nothing Greg enjoys more than setting out in search of adventure in Latin America. This passion shines through in the breadth of unique adventures reflected in the fantastic line-up of trips on offer. Greg is drawn to the beauty of this region's scenery, fascinating history, varied cultures and most of all, its people.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
