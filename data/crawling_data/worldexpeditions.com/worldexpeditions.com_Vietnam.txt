With its striking landscapes, gripping history and rich culture, Vietnam is an outstanding destination on all fronts.
Seas of motorcycles swarm city streets, where lanterns and lacquerware jostle for space and street vendors push carts loaded with baguettes, brooms and fragrant street food. Head out of town and scenes change to remote mountain villages, meandering rivers and white sand beaches.
In Hanoi, faded propaganda posters line the streets of this city of contrasts. Lose yourself in the Old Quarter, Hanoi's ancient shopping district; explore the imposing Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum; or stroll around Hoan Kiem Lake, fringed with locals practicing the sweeping strokes of Tai Chi.
Sail through the breathtaking turquoise waters and limestone islands of Ha Long Bay, one of Asia's most spectacular sights; sunbathe and snorkel on the beaches of Nha Trang; or cruise down the lush waterways of the Mekong River.
Unwind in Hoi An, a charming ancient town of wooden houses and temples, cool cafes and shopping streets lined with silks, lantern and clothing tailors; then head south to Ho Chi Minh City to haggle in the Ben Thành Market and explore the frightening subterranean network of the Cu Chi tunnels.
Trek through the rice paddies and hill tribe villages of Sapa or the idyllic valley of Mai Chau; or join us on a thrilling cycle journey through forested mountains, fertile farmlands and down scenic backroads that criss-cross the Mekong.
From north to south, Vietnam offers a dazzling diversity of experiences, so whichever itinerary you choose you're in for an unforgettable adventure.

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
We are committed to responsible travel in Vietnam, a sentiment that is reflected in our community based projects. When you book one of our adventures, you are supporting true sustainability and conservation in the region, its people and cultures.
World firsts
In 1990, we became the first company to develop a cycling itinerary for international travellers in Vietnam. Decades of experience have allowed us to generate knowledge that is second to none, ensuring you have the very best experience exploring this incredible country at handlebar level.
Ultimate value
Our Vietnam adventures offer exceptional value for money. While internal flights are included on most of our trips, cycling itineraries include bike hire and a support vehicle for times you may wish to take a break. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, accommodation, transfers, gear hire and sightseeing excursions.
Authentic experiences
Whether you are cycling, trekking or kayaking, our adventures allow you to interact with Vietnam under your own steam. This incredibly rewarding experience provides a realistic perspective of life on this side of the world and the ways that its geographic and cultural diversity fit together.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Support of local communities
Employees are from local communities and are provided with training, good wages and insurance benefits under the labor law. We use locally run accommodation and encourage travelers to purchase handicrafts from village stalls and artisans and to elect to dine at small restaurants serving traditional foods.
Carbon travel minimisation
Our itineraries are designed to minimise the amount of carbon produced, opting for bikes, city walks, cyclos and electric cars as a first option.
Protection of vulnerable children
We protect vulnerable children by adhering to our comprehensive Child Welfare Policy and we seek to educate travellers about these issues.
No elephant rides
We advocate against the practice of elephant riding as part of a tourism experience and as such we do not include elephant rides in any of our Vietnam itineraries. In the interest of public safety and animal welfare we discourage our clients from partaking in such activities outside of our itineraries.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Lodges
Our lodges provide comfortable accommodation that is well maintained and with good facilities.
Inns
We use quality inns typically situated in natural environments. They are not luxury inns however we ensure they offer you a truly authentic experience.
Homestays
Stay with a local family as they open their home to you and gain a wonderful insight into the local culture.
Boats
Sleep aboard a deluxe junk boat, built entirely of aromatic wood that features an elegant dining room and bar with modern comforts.

Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Weather
Vietnam’s climate can vary markedly from region to region due to its length, stretching 1650km from north to south. You can go from soaring temperatures in HCMC to cool and mild conditions in Dalat to frosts and even occasional snow in the mountains of the north.
Generally two distinct seasons prevail in Vietnam: from November to April, the temperatures are usually fairly cool, especially in the north. In the mountain areas temperatures can be as low as 0°C (32°F) and there can be a constant light drizzle. May to October is marked by hotter temperatures, heavy monsoon rains and occasional typhoons, although you can experience rain at any time of year.
In the north, the hottest months of the year are June, July and August; November, December and January are the coolest. In the south, temperatures are fairly consistent across the year. Hanoi’s average daily min-max temperatures range from 12-20°C in January, to 26-32°C in July. HCMC’s range from 21-32°C in January, to 25-31°C in July.
Time in Vietnam
Vietnam is +7 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Vietnamese (official); English (increasingly favoured as a second language); mountains area languages (Mon-Khmer and Mayalo-Polynesian); plus some French, Russian, Chinese and Khmer.
Currency
Vietnamese Dong
USD, EUR & AUD dollars are easily changed in Vietnam.
Credit cards and ATM are available in most large cities and hotels, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
International Dialing Code
+84
Electricity
Electricity in Vietnam is usually 220v at 50Hz cycles, but you may sometimes find 110v at 50Hz cycles.  The pin type varies but is most commonly types A (two prong flat) or C (two prong round). We recommend taking a universal adapter.
Visas
Most visitors, including Australian, Canadian, American and New Zealand passport holders require visas for Vietnam.
United Kingdom – Vietnam visa exemption for a period of up to 15 days until 30/6/2017. For stays longer than 15 days a visa must be obtained prior to arrival in Vietnam.
Generally, when sending your passport to your nearest Vietnamese Consulate, it must be accompanied by the following:
1.	Passport with a validity of at least 6 months remaining.
2.	Completed visa application form with a passport photo attached.
3.	Visa fee (as a bank cheque, money order or cash).
4.	Travel itinerary.
5.	Return postage.
The visa processing will usually take 10 working days.
You may need 2 extra passport size photographs for customs. These are only sometimes required, however, it is better to be prepared and carry them with you on arrival.
Please Note: The Embassy of Vietnam advises the following in relation to companies promoting online visas for Vietnam: "The Vietnamese Embassies and Consular Offices are the only competent Government Agencies, who are authorised to issue visas abroad.
In order to avoid any risks that may arise when boarding flights or at ports of entry in Vietnam, travellers are strongly recommended to contact the nearest Embassy or Consulate of Vietnam to secure visas before departure.”
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
