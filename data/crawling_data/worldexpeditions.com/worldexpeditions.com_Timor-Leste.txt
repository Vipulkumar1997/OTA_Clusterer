Timor-Leste
Beautiful coastline of East Timor













xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
After years spent under Portuguese and Indonesian rule and a rocky start to its independence, East Timor (Timor-Leste) is a warm and welcoming destination offering rich culture and history, superb scenery and some of the friendliest people you'll ever encounter. With its fascinating mix of history, culture and natural beauty, this is a unique gem of Southeast Asia that should be on your radar.
The capital of Dili offers a taste of Portugal in the tropics, and once you venture further afield you'll soon discover traditional villages and intriguing colonial towns, beautiful beaches, rugged mountains and the lush green interior of Southeast Asia's newest nation.
Savour Dili's laidback atmosphere and Portuguese colonial architecture, learning about the country's turbulent past as you visit important historical monuments; discover traditional Timorese culture in welcoming villages; and shop for colourful basketry and handicrafts in regional markets.
Journey through fertile valleys, picturesque mountain ranges and lush coffee plantations; escape to the white sand beaches and turquoise waters of Atauro Island for snorkeling, swimming, fishing and beachcombing; and trek to the top of Mount Ramelau to see the sun rise from East Timor's highest peak.
Join our East Timor Adventure and be one of the few to experience this little-visited gem of Southeast Asia!
