Suggested Training
Inclusions & Equipment
1
Discovery & Cruising
These are our least demanding trips. These journeys of discovery and cruises involve little or no extended activity. The itinerary may take place in remote areas (with basic facilities) and may involve long travel days on various types of transport. Sightseeing may be conducted on foot and all participants should be capable of carrying their own luggage from vehicle to hotel rooms. These adventures do not go above 2500m and rarely involve camping.
2
Adventure Touring
These adventure tours sometimes involve travel at high altitude (rarely exceeding 4000m, except on certain trips in Tibet, Peru and India) and may visit remote areas of the world where facilities are often basic. Many of these trips sometimes involve some camping or basic lodging. These adventure tours will often involve long journeys and rough roads. Sightseeing and optional day walks are often included and these days may involve up to 5 hours of physical activity.
3
Intoductory
Up to 5 or 6 hours of physical activity a day at a slow but steady pace.
4
Introductory to Moderate
Introductory activity with several moderate stages.
5
Moderate
Up to 5-7 hours of physical activity a day at a steady pace. Terrain may vary and some steep ascents to be expected. Be prepared for variable weather conditions.



6
Moderate to Challenging
Moderate activity with several challenging stages.
7
Challenging
Up to 8 to 10 hours+  of physical activity a day, often in remote areas with variable and adverse weather conditions.
1
Discovery & Cruising
These journeys of discovery and cruises are suitable for people with a basic level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: Once or twice a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour, for at least 2-3 months prior to departure.
2
Adventure Touring
To enjoy these adventures we suggest you have a reasonable level of fitness and health, a moderately active lifestyle and a positive attitude.
Suggested preparation: Two or three times a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour or more, for at least 3 months prior to departure.
3
Intoductory
Our introductory trips are not ‘easy’ trips and you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 30 minutes of aerobic type exercise three times a week, starting at least two to three months before departure. This can include swimming, jogging, hard walking or cycling. For treks, hill or stair walking with a 5-7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week. For a cycling adventure, road cycling twice a week for three months prior to departure is advised.
4
Introductory to Moderate
On these adventures you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45 minutes of aerobic type exercise three times a week, from a minimum of three months period to your departure. This can include swimming, jogging, hard walking or cycling - good cardiovascular exercise. For treks, hill or stair walking with a 7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week. For a cycling adventure, road cycling twice a week for three months prior to departure is advised.
5
Moderate
These adventures require a good level of fitness and health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45-60 minutes of aerobic type exercise, three to four times a week. Hill walking with a pack in variable weather conditions, kayaking or road cycling is also recommended depending upon the activity you plan to undertake.



6
Moderate to Challenging
These adventures require a good level of fitness and excellent health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend one hour of aerobic type exercise, four times a week. Hill walking with a pack in variable weather conditions, kayaking or road cycling is also recommended depending upon the activity you plan to undertake.
7
Challenging
On these challenging adventures, you will need an excellent level of fitness.
Suggested preparation: We recommend one hour of aerobic exercise, four times a week – such as jogging, hard walking, cycling or paddling. Solid preparation is essential in the months leading up to your departure. For trekking, hill walking with a 7kg pack is a must. On the weekends mix in a relatively demanding bushwalk relatively steep ascents and descents. For cycling, regular biking for one to four hours at a time, with as many hills as possible, will help prepare you for your trip.
Inclusions & Equipment
The exact inclusions and equipment for each of our adventures is listed once you've found the trip you want. Our trips are generally more inclusive than others in the market place in line with our philosophy of minimising 'extra payments' displayed outside of the main trip price as well as out of pocket expenses once you reach your destination.
