With its snowcapped peaks and undulating altiplano, vast lakes, jungle lowlands and otherworldly salt flats, Bolivia is a country of raw, rugged beauty.
It's Latin America's most isolated nation, and the highest in elevation, with the region's largest indigenous population. It's Bolivia's mix of dramatic wilderness, ancient treasures, buzzing high-altitude cities and vibrant culture that make it such a rare and rewarding destination.
Experience Bolivia's raw beauty up close as you journey across the dramatic altiplano and explore the surreal landscapes of Salar de Uyuni, the world's largest salt flat. Visit the ancient ruins of Tiwanaku, capital of a powerful pre-Hispanic civilisation that dominated the southern Andes and beyond, or test your limits with our challenging Summits of Bolivia expedition, where we scale the towering peaks of the spectacular Cordillera Real.
Head to Lake Titicaca to visit the sacred Isla del Sol, unwind in the charming lakeside town of Copacabana, and shop for vibrant indigenous textiles and handicrafts at colourful local markets. Admire the elegant colonial architecture and romantic charm of Sucre, Bolivia's most beautiful city, and head to La Paz, the world's highest capital, for markets, food and buzzing nightlife in a stunning setting framed by snowcapped mountains.
No matter which pace of Bolivian adventure you choose, World Expeditions can get you deep into the heart of this exciting destination.

Responsible travel

Support of local businsses
On Sun Island (Isla del Sol) we employ the local boat services to transport travelers as well as food. The local boats are managed by the community and we provide service and safety training.
Child safe tourism
Child labor is a problem in Bolivia as the government allows children from 14 years of age to legally work. Our local partner in Bolivia does not employ children and discourages this practice
Community engagement
We provide many different cultural activities on our itineraries including dances, apthapi (communal food sharing), textiles, Andean rituals to pachamama (Mother Earth) and visits to local homes to learn the way they live and share experiences.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.

Leaders in the field
Andreas Holland
Andreas has always made our South America programs special. He has lived in South America for over 30 years, much of this time in Peru. His special knowledge of the mountains and passion for supporting local communities is evident in our program in Peru and Bolivia. Each year Andreas travels to different parts of the world to impart his vast knowledge, so stay tuned, he may be in your city soon!
Simon Yates
Simon has been at the very forefront of mountaineering for almost two decades with first ascents in the Andes, Himalaya and Karakoram. Best known as the climbing partner to Joe Simpson in Touching the Void, Simon has developed a strong reputation as an engaging expedition leader.
Sarah Higgins
Sarah joined World Expeditions in 2006 and became operations manager in 2010. South America is her second home and she has enjoyed many adventures in its beautiful landscapes. Her travels include 'across the circle' into Antarctica, among many others. When Sarah is not planning itineraries you'll find her out on the 'rock' and in the Australian bush with her avid interest in rock climbing and bushwalking.
Greg Lee
There's nothing Greg enjoys more than setting out in search of adventure in Latin America. This passion shines through in the breadth of unique adventures reflected in the fantastic line-up of trips on offer. Greg is drawn to the beauty of this region's scenery, fascinating history, varied cultures and most of all, its people.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

Where to Go
Enjoy markets, food and nightlife in picturesque La Paz, the world’s highest capital
Snowcapped peaks, undulating altiplano, jungle lowlands: don your hiking boots and experience Bolivia’s raw beauty
Explore the ruins of Tiwanaku, capital of the ancient empire
Unwind in the charming lakeside town of Copacabana

Weather
Bolivia’s latitude lays wholly within the tropics, yet the country experiences a full range of temperatures from equatorial/tropical to arctic due to its varying altitudes. Altitude and topography have a greater influence on climate here than seasons, but Bolivia does have two distinct seasons: the summer/rainy season (November–March) and the winter/dry season (May–October).
The summer months bring warmer temperatures but heavy rains, and cold winds sweep the Altiplano year-round. Although the weather in Bolivia can be unpredictable, generally speaking, temperatures are lower than people anticipate. December–February brings the heaviest rains, especially in the valleys of the Yungas. The typically wet summer months are much more apparent in the Amazon lowland regions, where flooding occurs during the heaviest rainfall months.
Time in Bolivia
Bolivia is -4 hours behind UTC/GMT
Language
Spanish (official) 60.7%; Quechua (official) 21.2%; Aymara (official) 14.6%; foreign languages 2.4%; Guarani (official) 0.6%; other indigenous languages 0.4%.
Bolivia is a country of great linguistic diversity. Spanish is an official language, along with 36 different indigenous languages as per the 2009 constitution. The country’s two most commonly used indigenous languages are Quechua and Aymara.
Some English (and other European languages) is spoken in cities and tourist areas, but attempts to speak basic Spanish will be well received.
Currency
Boliviano
Credit cards and ATM are available in most large cities and hotels, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
International Dialing Code
+591
Electricity
Electricity in Bolivia is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The pin types used are A and C.
Visas
A visa is exempt for passport holders from the following countries visiting Bolivia for short term tourism purposes:
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
For all other nationalities and longer stays please contact the relevant embassy.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
