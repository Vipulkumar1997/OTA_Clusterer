France is a country that needs no introduction—its fabulous cities, breathtaking countryside, rich history and world-class food and wine have cemented it as a European must-see. There’s so much to see and do that deciding on an itinerary will be the hardest part of your trip!
Explore the medieval castles and historic villages of Dordogne; and head to the Loire Valley to tour majestic chateaux, gardens and vineyards on foot or by bike.
Visit WWII landing sites and sample local cheese, cider and calvados in Normandy; and indulge in gourmet food and wine as you ramble or ride along canals and through vineyards in Burgundy.
Circumnavigate the spectacular Mont Blanc and hike its gentler lower stages, passing alpine meadows and charming villages; or trek the high passes of the Haute Route from Chamonix to Zermatt, a challenging trail steeped in mountaineering legend.
Discover the endless vineyards, fairytale villages and unique German-infused culture of Alsace; and explore the rugged island wilderness of Corsica on the iconic GR20, Europe's most challenging long distance walking trail.
Head to the Pyrenees to follow the famous French Way of Saint James; trace Dali's footsteps along the Mediterranean coast; or pass castles, chateaux and postcard-perfect villages and you cycle along the Avenue Verte from Paris to London.
With everything from gentle walks and exciting family holidays to challenging mountaineering expeditions, our broad program of unique walking, cycling and trekking adventures is designed to get you deep into the heart of France, regardless of your interests or fitness level.

Responsible travel

Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics. In the mountains of the Pyrenees and Mont Blanc our local partners reduce the amount of packaging taken on tour and ensure all waste is carried out from refuges that do not have road access to help dispose of it properly.
Supporting local
In the regions that we travel through tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by only working with local family run accommodations and suppliers so that your money actually assists the community that hosts you.
Mont Blanc mules
Our mules only work for 3-4 months per year. We have liaised with vets, farriers and other specialists to ensure we look after them correctly. During trips they are well fed in the abundant pastures and all of our guides are trained to ensure their well being. They spend their winters away from the mountains in a better climate where there is good food for them.
Paddock to plate
The paddock to plate concept is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Refuges or gite hostels
Used mainly on mountain walks, these convivial places add to the atmosphere of your journey through the mountains. Dorms may sleep up to 40 people and the beds are often bunk beds. Linen and blankets are provided and bathrooms are shared. Private rooms may be available, although private gite rooms still use shared bathrooms.
Hotels
Often family run, these charming hotels provide access to local living thanks to your hosts. The hospitality is generous and their local knowledge win invaluable. Where possible, we choose hotel locations that add to your experience.
Barges
Think of it as your floating hotel, where each day you experience a different sunrise and sunset location and you unpack only once. Berths range from two lower or bunk bed style but can be upgraded to larger berths with double beds. The bar and dining area is always a popular hangout at the end of each day's activity. The crew includes an onboard cook.
Chateau hotels
Set on large grounds, these large French country houses or castles are often family run and named after the local wine. The building and rooms are often decorated to match the history of the building, complimenting the local food and wine experiences.

Leaders in the field
Pierre Schmid
Pierre is a high altitude mountain guide and co-founder of our partner company in Chamonix.

Health & Safety
Weather
The walking season in the European Alps is short – from mid June to mid September and many of the mountain refuges are closed outside this time.  Temperatures in summer range from around 6 degrees Celsius to 20 degrees Celsius during the day.  Afternoon thunderstorms are common.  At higher elevations it is important to dress with layers as cold winds and possible snow falls can happen even in summer.

France is +2 hours ahead of GMT/UTC

Electricity
Electricity in France is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas not required for citizens of Australia, Canada, USA and New Zealand for up to 90 days in a period of 180 days for all Schengen countries (see www.schengenvisainfo.com/schengen-visa-countries-list/ for countries part of the Schengen). Please ensure your passport is stamped on arrival in the Schengen area. For all other nationalities and for longer stays in countries covered by the Schengen Agreement (Australian New Zealand, Canadian and US passport holders), please contact the relevant embassy. Stays of longer than 90 days in the Schengen area require a long stay visa for the country you are spending most time in. However long stay visas are unlikely to be issued unless there is a valid reason (eg. studying in country). Unfortunately we cannot assist in obtaining visas for long stays due to individual country visa requirements.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
