xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
What defines an exploratory trek is the level of local traffic and other travellers using the said trails and these treks generally have little to none of the above.  We go wild, into the rugged and remote corners where you’ll find peace and serenity knowing you and your trekking group are far from the crowds and embarking on an exploratory journey where few have been before. In these climes, nature is undisturbed and environments are pristine meaning that our responsible tourism practices will be front and foremost while our strong planning minimises risk but maximises the experience.
Exploratory treks often involve trekking at high altitude, sometimes above 5000m, for up to 12 hours a day. Though modern luxuries such as internet connection, warm showers and familiar treats from home are few and far between, they become but a distant memory as you spend your time gaining a deep connection to the land and the few that live amongst these remote mountain regions. Expect trail conditions to be poor in some places, and its likely you’ll encounter snow and ice requiring the use of mountaineering boots, crampons and ice axes – a genuinely true exploratory experience.
Designed for those with an excellent level of fitness, you need to be completely comfortable in adverse weather, with evenings spent in wilderness campsites in alpine or sub alpine conditions. You can expect to carry up to 12-15kgs in your backpack as you traverse rugged terrain that takes you far away from the tourist trails and deep into the mountains, all whilst led by experienced guides with an intimate knowledge of the area. When you embark on an exploratory trek, you leave the beaten path behind and set out for a journey of discovery – of the destination but also of yourself.

Trip Grading
Technical Grading
Suggested Training
Inclusions & Equipment
1
Discovery & Cruising
These are our least demanding trips. These journeys of discovery and cruises involve little or no extended activity. The itinerary may take place in remote areas (with basic facilities) and may involve long travel days on various types of transport. Sightseeing may be conducted on foot and all participants should be capable of carrying their own luggage from vehicle to hotel rooms. These adventures do not go above 2500m and rarely involve camping.
2
Adventure Touring
These adventure tours sometimes involve travel at high altitude (rarely exceeding 4000m, except on certain trips in Tibet, Peru and India) and may visit remote areas of the world where facilities are often basic. Many of these trips sometimes involve some camping or basic lodging. These adventure tours will often involve long journeys and rough roads. Sightseeing and optional day walks are often included and these days may involve up to 5 hours of physical activity.
3
Intoductory
Up to 5 or 6 hours a day at a slow but steady pace
4
Introductory to Moderate
Introductory walks with several moderate stages
5
Moderate
Up to 5-7 hours a day at a steady pace. Treks will involve carrying a day pack and trail conditions will vary between well-defined to rough trails



6
Moderate to Challenging
Moderate walks with challenging stages
7
Challenging
Often in remote areas in variable, adverse weather conditions, for up to 8 to 10 hours+ a day, possibly more. Be prepared to carry a daypack weighing up to 8 kgs, or in some cases a full pack weighing up to 20kg
8
Entry Level Mountaineering / Exploratory Treks
Classed as expeditions, they involve either extreme trekking and or basic mountaineering. Expect remote and poorly defined trails in variable weather conditions for up to 12 hours a day (possibly more subject to weather conditions and altitude). This may include a number of demanding high pass crossings and evacuation may be difficult from remote areas.
9
Intermediate Mountaineering
Participants should be competent and self sufficient in the outdoors and have experience in multi day trekking at altitude. Prior experience on an entry level mountaineering expedition is highly recommended. The terrain will involve low to moderate angle snow slopes and travelling on crevassed glaciers.
10
Advanced Mountaineering
These are our most challenging expeditions. Most are participatory expeditions & involve load carrying, setting up of camps, cooking and campcraft. Some of these expeditions also involve “technical” climbing and are for experienced alpine climbers / mountaineers only. Technical expeditions involve steep climbing at high altitude (including rock climbing).
Basic
The conditions are relatively straightforward and not technically difficult. Expect generally low angled slopes with no prolonged steep or exposed sections and glacier travel where participants are roped together. Abseiling may be required in short sections.
Intermediate
The conditions are variable with generally low angled slopes with some sections of moderately steep snow or easy rock where ropes are required. Some basic rock climbing and abseiling involved.



Difficult
The conditions are challenging involving steep and exposed snow and ice slopes with sections of rock climbing. Some sections involve abseiling and belaying.
Extreme
A more serious and technical undertaking involving long and exposed climbing on snow, rock and ice. Competent rope work, efficiency of movement and good technical skills are required.
1
Discovery & Cruising
These journeys of discovery and cruises are suitable for people with a basic level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: Once or twice a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour, for at least 2-3 months prior to departure.
2
Adventure Touring
To enjoy these adventures we suggest you have a reasonable level of fitness and health, a moderately active lifestyle and a positive attitude.
Suggested preparation: Two or three times a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour or more, for at least 3 months prior to departure.
3
Intoductory
Our introductory trips are not ‘easy’ trips and you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 30 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week, starting at least two to three months before departure. Hill or stair walking with a 5-7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness. We also advise doing some walking in variable weather conditions.
4
Introductory to Moderate
On these adventures you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45 minutes of aerobic type exercise three times a week, from a minimum of three months period to your departure. Hill or stair walking with a 7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness. We also advise doing some walking in variable weather conditions.
5
Moderate
These adventures require a good level of fitness and health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45-60 minutes of aerobic type exercise, three to four times a week. Hill or stair walking with a 7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness. We also advise doing some walking in variable weather conditions.



6
Moderate to Challenging
These adventures require a good level of fitness and excellent health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend one hour of aerobic type exercise, four times a week. Hill or stair walking with a 7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness. We also advise doing some walking in variable weather conditions.
7
Challenging
On these challenging adventures, you will need an excellent level of fitness. Some treks may require you to carry a full pack weighing up to 20kg.
Suggested preparation: We suggest up to one hour of strenuous exercise at least four days a week, interspersed with a relatively demanding bushwalk at the weekend. The best exercise for trekking is bushwalking involving relatively steep ascents and descents. Hill walking with a 7kg pack in variable weather conditions is a must.  Multi day walks are ideal preparation for our challenging adventures.
8
Entry Level Mountaineering / Exploratory Treks
To participate in these entry level expeditions or exploratory treks, you must be in excellent health and lead a very active lifestyle. The trips are suitable for first time mountaineers, previous altitude experience is preferable but not essential, and you must be comfortable in adverse weather conditions.
Suggested preparation: Physical fitness should be an ongoing thing, which should start from a base at around four to six months prior to departure and increase to build maximum endurance, stamina, flexibility and familiarity with the anticipated routine as much as possible by your trip commencement. Three to five hard sessions of 45 to 60 minutes of physical exercise per week such as running, hill walking, swimming, cycling or gym work will build excellent aerobic capacity and overall endurance and stamina which are so important in trekking and climbing at altitude. Overnight or multi day bushwalks (on rough, loose and rocky terrain) should be incorporated in your training regime; this develops skill and confidence on difficult terrain you will find on expedition. Rest and recovery, whilst at the same time steadily increasing your routine and incorporating variety, are just as important parts of the process if you intend to maintain and enjoy the regime for any duration.
Please review the ‘Physical Fitness’ section of the detailed trip notes for each expedition to ensure your fitness and training are sufficient.
9
Intermediate Mountaineering
To participate in intermediate level expeditions, you must be in excellent health and lead a very active lifestyle. Experience with multi-day trekking at altitude is essential. Experience using ice axes and campons is preferable but not essential.
Suggested preparation: Physical fitness should be an ongoing thing, which should start from a base at around four to six months prior to departure and increase to build maximum endurance, stamina, flexibility and familiarity with the anticipated routine as much as possible by your trip commencement. Three to five hard sessions of 45 to 60 minutes of physical exercise per week such as running, hill walking, swimming, cycling or gym work will build excellent aerobic capacity and overall endurance and stamina which are so important in trekking and climbing at altitude. Overnight or multi day bushwalks (on rough, loose and rocky terrain) should be incorporated in your training regime; this develops skill and confidence on difficult terrain you will find on expedition. Rest and recovery, whilst at the same time steadily increasing your routine and incorporating variety, are just as important parts of the process if you intend to maintain and enjoy the regime for any duration.
Please review the ‘Physical Fitness’ section of the detailed trip notes for each expedition to ensure your fitness and training are sufficient.
10
Advanced Mountaineering
Prior mountaineering experience is essential for participation in these advanced expeditions. Participation is also subject to acceptance by one of our high altitude mountaineering guides. Most are participatory expeditions, involving load carrying, setting up of camps, cooking and camp craft. Some of these expeditions also involve ‘technical’ climbing and are for experienced alpine climbers only.
Suggested preparation: Physical fitness should be an ongoing thing, which should start from a base at around four to six months prior to departure and increase to build maximum endurance, stamina, flexibility and familiarity with the anticipated routine as much as possible by your trip commencement.

Inclusions & Equipment
The exact inclusions and equipment for each of our adventures is listed once you've found the trip you want. Our trips are generally more inclusive than others in the market place in line with our philosophy of minimising 'extra payments' displayed outside of the main trip price as well as out of pocket expenses once you reach your destination.
