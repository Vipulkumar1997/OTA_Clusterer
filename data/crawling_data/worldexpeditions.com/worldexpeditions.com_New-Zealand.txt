Why travel with us
More guided Cycle Trails than anyone else
Adventure South NZ offer more supported trips along more of the Nga Haerenga Cycle Trails than anyone else. Travelling along a dedicated Cycle Trail is a great introduction to cycle touring with shorter, less demanding and very affordable options.
Unrivalled experience
We offered our first cycling trips in 1992. As a result, our knowledge of the routes and secret NZ wilderness spots are second to none.
Exceptional local knowledge
Our experienced team in Christchurch takes care of all of the logistics, ensuring you enjoy a seamless adventure in New Zealand.
Walks you won't find in any guidebook
While some of our hiking itineraries include the best sections of the more famous walking tracks, we thrive on creating engaging hikes in spectacular surroundings that provide travellers with the excitement that only real off the beaten track opportunities provide.
An activity for everyone
Our tours range from introductory walks and cycles to multi-activity trips and even the toughest guided walk in New Zealand.
Road cycling specialists
Keen cyclists need look no further; our road touring trips are ideal for those who relish greater distances and don't mind occasionally sharing the road with traffic and tackling a hill or two.
Widest range of active NZ holidays
No one offers a more comprehensive range of quintessential Kiwi destinations than we do. From the magic of the mountains and vineyards of the South to the volcanoes, geothermal regions and Maori culture of the North; we explore both islands and everything in between.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?

Local charity donations
Our annual donations made to the Otago Central Rail Trail Trust is used to fund the continual upgrade of the Rail Trail.

Leaders in the field
Bas Kruissellbrink
Born in the Netherlands, Bas was literally raised on a bicycle. At the age of 16 he cycled with a friend from Holland to Spain and Portugal; the start of a life full of cycling adventures. Bas loves sharing his cycle expertise and speaks Dutch, English and German and is proficient in French and Spanish.
Louise Vargaya-Conza
Louise is camp mum. She ensures our clients are re-energised with delicious meals and can rest their weary bones in a comfortable bed after each day's activities on tour. She also organises any pre and post tour accommodation, and in the winter months, guides cycling tours in Peru with her husband Rudy.
Peter Sexton
The reward of a terrific meal, a bottle of wine or a block of chocolate are likely to be found in any adventure where Peter is involved. Having left the corporate world behind years ago, nowadays he spends his time amongst the mountain peaks and hilly roads with his wife Angela in between guiding in New Zealand and Australia.
Wanda Vivequin
Born in Holland and raised in Kenya, Lebanon, Canada and New Zealand, Wanda developed her love for travel early on. She loves nothing more than sharing her passion for New Zealand, its history and stunning landscapes with visitors to the country. Wanda is an avid cyclist, hiker, skier and lover of the Himalaya where she has visited and guided for 15 years.
Rossco Daubney
Rossco loves all things sporting and the great outdoors, encompassed with an appreciation of photography and wine. His interests include multi-sport, sea kayaking, hiking and biking as well as discovernig new places. Between tours he can be found with his 'waterfront apartment', also known as a campervan, at the Marlborough Sounds.
Liam Stroud
Liam graduated university with a degree in Criminology, hung that expensive piece of paper on the wall and immediately pursued his career in the outdoors. He worked as a guide in Canada before making the move to New Zealand. While guides whitewater rafting, sea kayaking, mountain biking and cycle tours, his favourite activity is being on the bike.
Angela Sexton
Ange began her guiding career in her home of Colorado, in the highest peaks of the Rocky Mountains. She has since made the Southern Hemisphere her home, guiding in both New Zealand and Australia. She is fortunate enough to share her passion for mountain climbing and road cycling with her husband Peter.
Steve Tulley
Guiding allows Steve to continue his lifelong interest in the outdoors including mountaineering, tramping, skiing, fishing and cycling. When he's not guiding he is still lucky enough to be working outdoors in his own beekeeping business. Steve's overseas travel includes trips touring Europe and climbing in Tibet, Nepal, Chamonix and the Italian Alps.

Weather
As a general rule, November to April are the most ideal months for travelling in New Zealand’s stunning outdoors.  One of the most important things travellers need to know about the New Zealand climate is that it’s a maritime climate, as opposed to the continental climate typical of larger landmasses.
Thanks to its position in the path of the ‘Roaring 40s’ and mountainous terrain, New Zealand’s weather can frequently change with amazing rapidity.  Because the weather can change so unexpectedly you should be prepared for sudden changes in temperature and weather conditions.  This basically means having a good waterproof jacket and some warm clothing. You don’t need to bring your winter wardrobe but a good fleece/jumper and good thermals are a must.
The temperature during the South Island summers range from 10-30 ºC, with a pleasant 40- 50% humidity. Higher altitudes are always considerably cooler and snowfall is not uncommon even in summer. The Southern Alps act as a barrier to the moisture laden winds coming west across the Tasman Sea, creating a wet climate on the west side of the mountains and a drier climate on the east side. The geography also creates a wind pattern, which can in summer be very hot, dry and fierce. Maximum temperatures we may encounter range up to 30°C. Minimum temperatures expected in the Southern Alps in Summer time are around -5°C.  Weather is an integral facet of any mountain range and getting to understand and work with this major environmental factor is what will make you more prepared for your tour – any questions about what to expect on your tour talk to one of our sales team.
Time in New Zealand
New Zealand is +12 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
New Zealand has 3 official languages: English, Maori and New Zealand Sign Language.
New Zealand’s multi-ethnic society means that around 150 additional languages are spoken by different communities.
Maori language takes its roots from Eastern Polynesia, however, following settlement in New Zealand by Polynesian groups from the 13th century, Maori developed as a unique language distinct from other Polynesian languages. At the time of New Zealand’s 2013 Census, there were 148,395 Maori language speakers. Maori language is spoken mainly in the North Island, where the bulk of New Zealand’s Maori population resides.
Currency
New Zealand Dollar

We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
