Trip highlights
Staying in Japanese ryokans
Kyoto sightseeing
Shirakawago traditional village stay
Sake distillery visit
Matsumoto onsen baths
Tokyo touring
Wasabi farm visit
Kenroku garden
Optional snow shoe hike
Visit historic temples and shrines
Beginning in the historic city of Kyoto, where the modern and the ancient aspects of Japanese culture and tradition combine so well. You will visit the heart of what Kyoto has to offer such as Nijo Castle, Kinkakuji golden temple and the mouth watering Nishiki Food Market before taking a short hike out of town to see the Kurama temple and Kibune Shrine. On our fourth day we bid farewell to Kyoto for Kanazawa, the capital of Ishikawa Prefecture. Here, the must see locations are the beautifully tended Kenroku Garden and the Nomura family samurai house from the Edo period. We will make our way by bus to Shirakawago village in Gifu Prefecture. Shirakawago is renowned for its historic building style known as "gassho-zukuri" with thatched roofs. You will have enough time to explore and wander the small, picturesque streets of this village before you spend the night in a traditional village guesthouse. A truly authentic experience will be assured.
Takayama is famous amongst the Japanese for its many sake breweries thanks to its pristine river water where you will have the chance to step into a multi generational, family owned brewery to sample and learn about this revered national drink in all of its many varieties. In Matsumoto we will take a trip to a wasabi farm and also partake in Japans favourite past time, a soak in an onsen filled with hot, natural mineral water. We may even have the option to snow shoe hike here depending on the level of snow cover. Leaving history and tradition behind, we take a bullet train at up to 320kms/hr to the nations buzzing capital city, Tokyo. After a familiarisation walking tour of the city we will enjoy a farewell dinner together to reflect on what is sure to be one of the most scenic and fascinating ways to spend a winter in Japan.
