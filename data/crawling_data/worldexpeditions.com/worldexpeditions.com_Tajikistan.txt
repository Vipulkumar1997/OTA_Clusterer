Blessed with ancient cultures and landscapes of staggering beauty, Tajikistan is a little-visited gem of Central Asia that should definitely be on your radar.
Dominated by the rugged ranges of the Fann and Pamir Mountains, Tajikistan is the highest and most mountainous country in the region. In addition to stunning snowcapped peaks and jagged ridges, this gorgeous country is home to high-altitude lakes, fertile valleys and foothills dotted with small villages where ancient traditions persist.
With its truly spectacular landscapes, untouched and unspoiled by crowds, this is a destination superbly suited to outdoor adventuring. Join us as we explore this rugged treasure of Central Asia!
Join an unforgettable trek among the snowcapped peaks, high plateaus and picturesque valleys of the Pamir Mountains, passing crystal-clear lakes, flowering alpine meadows and the summer camps of Tajik shepherds; or for the adventurous mountaineer, consider an exhilarating exploratory trek out into remote regions of the Gissar, Fann and Pamir ranges.
Explore the leafy avenues, museums and monuments of Dushanbe; engage with rich local cultures and shop for vibrant carpets and handicrafts; or combine a trek among the incredible landscapes of Tajikistan with a tour of Uzbekistan's exquisite ancient cities of the Silk Road on our unique itinerary, In The Footsteps of Alexander the Great.
Whichever adventure you choose, you won't regret a visit to beautiful Tajikistan!
