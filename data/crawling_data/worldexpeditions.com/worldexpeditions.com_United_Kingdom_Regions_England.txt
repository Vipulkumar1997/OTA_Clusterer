xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
England’s vibrant cities and rich history need little introduction, but perhaps lesser known to foreigners is just how broad a range of different landscapes are available to the active adventurer. With its medieval towns, sleepy seaside villages, idyllic countryside and ever-changing coastline, England is a stunning destination that’s superbly suited to walking, hiking and biking adventures.
Follow the World Heritage Listed path of Hadrian's Wall, an incredible 84-mile stone wall built by the Romans in 122 AD, through rolling pastures and rugged moorland; and visit the picturesque Cotswold village of Bilbury, described by British designer William Morris as England’s most beautiful village.
Explore the Channel Islands of Jersey, Guernsey and Sark by bike; and hike the Cornish Peninsula, discovering fishing villages, historic towns and spectacular coastal scenery you walk sections of the Cornish Coastal Path.
Pass castles and chateaux as you cycle along the Avenue Verte from Paris to London; and head to Cumbria, one of the UK’s most beautiful regions, to admire the mountains, fells, lakes and tarns of the Lake District, the Pennines and the Yorkshire Dales.
Traverse England on foot following Wainright's famous Coast to Coast Trail from St Bees to Robin Hood's Bay; and explore the spectacular coastlines of Dorset and Wessex, steeped in history and blessed with landscapes that have inspired writers, filmmakers and travellers alike.
With everything from gentle walks to hikes and cycling journeys, our unique itineraries are designed to get you deep into the heart of England, regardless of your fitness level.

Why travel with us
Making England affordable
Our active trips in England only include what you need like accommodation, meals, bikes on cycle trips, luggage transfers, maps and route directions on self guided trips and an experienced local guide for group trips, as well as the peace of mind that comes with complete backup and support.
Explore England at your own pace
On self guided trips you can expect to receive up-to-date and well researched route notes and maps, seamless luggage transfers and competitive pricing on all essential services. Many self guided trips also have daily departure dates, allowing you to enjoy the convenience and flexibility a self guided trip offers.
Enjoy flexibility and choices
Cycling or walking, 2 star or 4 star, small groups or self guided, land or sea  - we can help you explore England exactly the way you want.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics.
Supporting local
In the English regions that we travel through tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by working with local family run accommodations and suppliers so that your money actually assists the community that hosts you.
Paddock to plate
The paddock to plate concept is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
Often family run, these charming hotels range from 2 to 4 stars and provide access to local living thanks to your hosts. The hospitality is generous and their local knowledge is invaluable. Where possible, we choose locations that add to your experience.
Bed & breakfasts (B&Bs)
Simple yet rich in local character, the B&Bs chosen are clean, comfortable and run by hosts that help add to your experience.
Guesthouses
Similar to bed & breakfasts, these family-owned accommodations are clean and comfortable. Rooms with en suites generally have a shower but no bath due to space. There may be a separate room with a bath tub.
Country inns
Enjoy the cosy country setting and convenience of staying in a comfortable place that is attached to a restaurant or pub, usually on the ground floor with the rooms above.

Leaders in the field
John Millen
With over 25 years of experience in active adventures, John's travels have taken him to a multitude of countries including Tanzania, Belize, Uzbekistan, Nepal, Kenya, Russia and Botswana. John began leading Sherpa Expeditions' trips in 1991, resulting in a strong sense of the outdoor activities that Europe has to offer. He is energised by exploring different environments and physical challenges and spends much of his spare time on mountaineering trips, cycling and walking in the Yorkshire Dales.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want.
