Private group travel


Create Your Own Adventure


Private group travel is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. Alter one of our pre-existing itineraries to match your interests and preferred departure date or create a new custom made itinerary completely from scratch!







Who can organise a private trip?

You can choose to customise your own private departure for most trips, provided there are a minimum of two of you travelling together. If you're travelling in a bigger group we will tailor your trip to meet the needs of your group.

















Create Your Own Adventure:
Choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it.

Alter one of our existing itineraries and pick a departure date for just you and a friend, partner or group.  You can add or remove as many elements as you like.

Alternatively, start with a blank canvas and we can work together to
design your dream adventure
from day one.
