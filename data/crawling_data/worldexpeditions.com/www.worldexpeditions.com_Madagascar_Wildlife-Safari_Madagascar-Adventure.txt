Canoe and beach camping along the Manambolo River
Search for lemurs in Ranomafana Nature Reserve and Kirindy Forest
Traverse the limestone pinnacles of Tsingy de Bemaraha

Trek amongst the granite peaks and valleys of Andringitra National Park
Hike the colourful sandstone canyons and swim in natural pools in Isalo National Park
Madagascar is the world’s fourth largest island and about the size of France. Isolated from Africa millions of years ago it has evolved an incredibly rich ecology and landscape that is as bizarre as it is unique. Home to one of the richest ecosystems on earth, you will be in awe of its quirky lemurs and endemic varieties of Baobab trees. Madagascar is "home" to nearly one-quarter of all the flowering plants in Africa. It also boasts ninety percent of the known species of lemur and half the world's population of chameleons. Marvel at the diverse landscapes, from lush tropical rainforest to semi arid and jagged limestone pinnacles. The local people, who are descendants of seafarers from the Indian Ocean, are proudly distinct from the peoples of continental Africa and are unfailingly polite and hospitable. We explore the spectacular collection of the island’s national parks on this itinerary including the UNESCO World Heritage site of Tsingy de Bemaraha.

Introductory to Moderate
This trip involves trekking, walking and canoeing for up to 5 - 7 hours a day at a slow but steady pace and should never be misinterpreted to mean this trip is easy. Some stages will involve uneven and steep terrain. At Tsingy of Bemaraha, whilst no technical climbing experience is necessary, this is not suitable for those with vertigo or claustrophobia. During the river trip, subject to water levels, it may be necessary to drag your canoe across the braided channels of the river, although our staff are always on hand to offer assistance. You will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health. The first half of the trip involves 8 days in a remote region whilst trekking and canoeing.  You must be comfortable about travelling in remote wilderness regions and be aware that wilderness camping is often basic and will involve some participation, ie putting up tents.
The optional summit ascent of Pic Boby is a strenuous 28 km and 12 hour return undertaking and is usually done over two days due to the steep and challenging terrain. Whilst this is included in our itinerary as an optional one day ascent, it requires full commitment and is only suitable for very fit and experienced trekkers walking at a fast pace with limited rest stops.

Day 1
Arrival in Antananarivo
On arrival in Antananarivo on Day 1 you will be met at the airport and transferred to the group hotel for overnight. The rest of the day is at leisure. Please be sure to advise us of your flight details. If you are arriving earlier than Day 1, please make your own way to the hotel. Alternatively, we can assist with private transfers (additional cost applies)
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Antananarivo to Tsiroanomandidy
We begin our exploration of Madagascar with a drive through typical landscape of mid-west Madagascar, a land of volcanic origin with rich soil and abundant agriculture. We will stop for lunch and explore the area around Ampefy before completing the days journey in Tsiroanomandidy, leaving us well place for tomorrows adventure. Overnight hotel.  (approx 245km by 4WD, 4 hrs)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 3
Drive to the Bongolava Massif via Belobaka
As we drive further west, the landscape is dominated by starkly eroded hills that serve as pasture land to the numerous cattle (or 'zebu') in this part of the country. The road to Belobaka is very rough but makes for an interesting journey. We have a short break here while our trek leader arranges any final supplies. Lunch is a picnic outside the village before driving another two hours, on rougher roads, into the Bongolava Mountains and our campsite. Here we meet our porters, cook and the rest of the trek crew. Overnight camping. (approx 120km, 6 - 7hrs by 4WD)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 4
Trekking to Ankavandra and begin the descent of the Manambolo River
We begin walking through a small rocky trail along the massif. We follow a natural spring where cascades have formed a natural swimming pool. Arrival and lunch in the village of Ankavandra in the region of Menabe (big red). In the afternoon we begin Manambolo river descent. Overnight camping on the river bank.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 5-6
Canoeing Manambolo River
This is a spectacular and isolated part of Madagascar that is only accessible by boat or by foot. We pass through scenic riverscapes of low hills, exposed low cliffs and bamboo thickets. Red, orange and yellow are the dominant colours of the cliffs due to erosion exposing the laterite soil. We will see some local people on the river performing their daily activities as well as seeing plenty of endemic water birds and possibly some chameleons along the way. With stops for lunch as well as occasional land excursions, the pace is leisurely. Our rhythm is determined by sunrise, sunset and the flow of the river. On Day 7, the landscape changes abruptly as we enter the spectacular Manambolo Gorge where the river carves a deep channel through the limestone plateau. Dry forest and sheer, vertical cliffs on both sides dwarf our canoes to insignificance. You can hear the silence.  We set up camp each night on sandy banks at the river edge. Camping (approx. 6 hours of canoeing daily)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 7
Canoeing Manambolo Gorge, Bekopaka
After breakfast we continue our way through this imposing gorge, between limestone walls, craggy caves and overhangs on which we can see unusual vegetation, much birdlife and many colours. We may also hear the shrill cries of black parrots resounding against the rock walls. Cliffs on both sides are marked by horizontal lines indicating the levels of water at different times of the year. Side canyons reveal pockets of rainforest where we may see our first lemurs if we are lucky. This is our last day of canoeing and in the afternoon we come out of the gorge at Andadoany village near Bekopaka. We enjoy the opportunity to have a cold drink to celebrate our river journey. Overnight permanent campsite (approx. 6 hours canoeing)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 8
Tsingy of Bemaraha
After breakfast we visit the “Tsingy of Bemaraha”. The World Heritage listed Tsingy is the largest reserve in Madagascar and is home to diverse wildlife including many species of Lemur. This fascinating raised limestone plateau is a complex of countless chaotic razor sharp pinnacles. The limestone plateau also hosts an extensive network of underground caves and many succulents growing in the crevices. We take an adventure walk traversing the pinnacles. A harness clipped to a steel cable is used for safety on the vertiginous and exposed scrambling sections amongst the rock. (Note: whilst no technical climbing experience is necessary, this is not suitable for those with vertigo or claustrophobia). Overnight permanent campsite. (4 - 5 hrs walking in the Tsingy)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
Bekopaka to Kirindy Forest
Today is a rugged 4WD journey (a rough and dusty road!) through the remote west of Madagascar. We stop for lunch at Belo Tsiribihina before crossing the Tsiribihina River by local car ferry.  The drive beyond passes through Madagascar's endemic western dry deciduous forest. Of great biological significance, these forests are home to many endemic species of flora and fauna, including some species of baobab. We  reach Kirindy Forest in the late afternoon. As the wildlife here is abundant we make the most of an opportunity on dusk to take a night walk (about 1hr duration) by torch light to spot nocturnal fauna. Dinner on return to camp. Overnight permanent campsite. (135km, approx 6hrs subject to road conditions)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 10
Kirindy Forest to Morondava
After breakfast we take another guided walk in the forest while the animals are active in the early morning period. Kirindy Forest is the only place in Madagascar where we may see Fosa (the island's largest carnivore). Striped mongoose, the giant jumping rat, the popular Verreaux's Sifaka and the widespread Brown Lemur also inhabit this area.  We return to camp for lunch before driving a relatively short distance to the iconic “Baobabs Alley” near Morondava. These distinctive trees make great photographs and we can watch the world go by as locals and visitors alike traverse the alley. We continue another 20km by vehicle to the port town of Morondava. Overnight hotel. (walk approx 2hrs; 80km by 4WD, approx 2 hrs)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 11
Morondava to Antsirabe
Today is a long day of driving but we are rewarded by spectacular scenery. From Morondava we drive to Miandrivazo, a small town on the edge of the Tsirbihina River.   We have a picnic lunch near here before continuing our drive to Antsirabe, known as the rickshaw (or "pousse-pousse") capital. It is also known for potatoes, clothing manufacturers, tobacco and vanillla. The landscape en route is beautiful  with the highlands decorated by rice fields. Overnight hotel. (approx 10hrs driving, mostly sealed road)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 12
Antsirabe to Ranomafana
Today we travel to Ranomafana Rainforest National Park located on the eastern mountain slopes of the island and dominated by a humid tropical climate - quite a contrast to the dry western regions. En route we stop for lunch at Ambositra, home of woodcarving (marquetry) craftspeople. We have a chance to visit a wood carving workshop before continuing our journey to Ranomafana. The drive this afternoon is picturesque with terraced hills and villages becoming thick rainforest, along a winding road that passes by the tumbling waters of the Namorona River. Overnight in hotel. (Approx 250km / 5 - 6 hrs driving)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 13
Ranomafana National Park, transfer to campsite outside Andringitra National Park
Today we have a whole day exploring this evergreen primary forest. This is one of the most extensive wildlife areas. It‘s the only locality for the recently discovered Golden bamboo lemur as well as the world‘s rarest primate, the giant bamboo lemur. There, we can appreciate the views of the tumbling waters of the Namorona river. Picnic lunch. Diner and overnight in hotel.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 14
Ranomafana to Andringitra
In the morning we will drive to Ambalavao to visit the factory of Antemoro paper and the market. After lunch drive to Andringitra. We arrive to our camp just outside the park in the evening to settle in for dinner and a rest ready for tomorrows adventure. (Driving 200km / 6 hours)
There are 2 different trekking excursions for this day, however the entire group stays at the same campsite (2050m) tonight - 
OPTION 1 - We pass through the village of Ambalamanandray before climbing a ridge with panoramic views over the valley. We cross the Zomandao River and reach the higher forest and plateau (altitude of 2000m) surrounded by heather. We walk to our overnight campsite at 2050m. (ascent - 500m; approx 8 hrs walking).
OPTION 2 - For the extremely fit and stronger hikers in the group, there is an optional ascent of Pic Boby (2658m) - the highest mountain in the region (and second highest in Madagascar). The climb is quite steep and very demanding but the trail is well marked up to a rocky valley before the final climb into the granite rocks. The view from Pic Boby is beautiful (in clear weather only, not guaranteed) with the surrounding granite peaks and to the Tsaranoro valley. At the end of the day we head back down to our campsite. (ascent - 1108m; descent - 608m; approx 12 hrs walking).  
NOTE - The summit ascent of Pic Boby is a strenuous 28 km and 12 hours undertaking and is usually done over two days due to the steep and challenging terrain. Whilst this is included in our itinerary as an optional one day ascent, it requires full commitment and is only suitable for very fit and experienced trekkers walking at a fast pace with limited rest stops. Too much cloud cover or bad weather may prevent a Pic Boby summit attempt.

Too much cloud cover or bad weather may prevent a Pic Boby summit attempt.
On day 2, we continue walking across a grassy plateau, and then climb up amongst the strange rock formations known as the 'Moonscape'. The beautiful trail descends steeply to the west of the massif with a stone staircase where the vegetation contrasts with the eastern part of the park. Enjoy magnificent views over the Tsaranoro valley, three 800m high granite peaks and a waterfall. Our campsite this evening is located outside Andringita National Park - 1650m. (approx 13km walking / 6 - 7 hrs).
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 17
Andringitra to Isalo National Park
This morning we farewell our guides, porters and crew, and drive back to Ambalavao (about 3 hrs) for lunch. In the afternoon, we travel on good road via Ihosy (zebu territory) across the Horombe plateau with its grasslands dotted with termite mounds. We reach the dramatic Isalo Massif in the late afternoon, a mysterious landscape of imposing rock formations called "ruiniforme". Overnight hotel. (approx 7 hrs driving)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 18
Walking in Isalo National Park
Today we explore the colourful and deeply eroded sandstone plateau of the Isalo National Park. We have a great day excursion, walking in "the Canyon des Makis" where we may discover some lemurs, exploring the rugged canyons with their abstract erosion sculpturing, and discovering natural swimming pools such as the "Piscines Naturelle, Noir or Bleu". Overnight hotel. (approx 5 - 6 hrs walking)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 19
Isalo to Toliara
As we leave the Isalo region today we drive through a semi-arid landscape known as the "Spiny Desert" and the famous "Mahafaly Tombs". We keep driving southwards, passing through wealthy sapphire mining towns, to reach the coastal town of Toliara. Overnight hotel. (Approx 4 hrs driving)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 20
