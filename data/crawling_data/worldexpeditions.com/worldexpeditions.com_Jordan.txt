Ancient, mystical and magnificent - Jordan is a true standout of the Middle East. In a region plagued with conflict, here lies a safe and stunning sanctuary of dreamlike landscapes, littered with archaeological treasures.
Jordan's striking scenery is the stuff of legend - vast sunbaked sand dunes and dramatic rocky outcrops of sandstone and granite, cool wadis fringed with date palms and hidden cities carved from stone.
Be blown away by the ancient city of Petra, one of the world's great archaeological wonders - a fairytale desert city of rock-cut buildings and monuments, exquisitely carved into the surrounding sandstone cliffs in warm hues of rose, rust and gold.
Experience the stark beauty of Wadi Rum at sunset, exploring by foot, jeep and camel the iconic gorges, cliffs, canyons and rock arches made famous by Lawrence of Arabia; and head to the Dana Nature Reserve to hike the 'Inca Trail of the Middle East' towards Petra, exploring remote canyons and near-vertical gorges and camping along spectacular wadis.
Explore the remarkably well-preserved ruins of Jerash, once a thriving Roman metropolis; marvel at the impressive frescoes and early Islamic architecture of Jordan's ancient Desert Castles; and stand as Moses did atop Mount Nebo, admiring a panoramic view of the Promised Land.
Then relax your travel-weary bones in the mineral waters and therapeutic mud of the Dead Sea; and enjoy the coral reefs, rich marine life and laidback holiday vibe of Aqaba, the jewel of Jordan's Red Sea coast.
Whichever itinerary you choose, you won't regret an adventure into this breathtaking biblical land!

Ultimate value

Responsible travel

Leave No Trace
We operate our itineraries following the principles of Leave No Trace, ensuring that we take out all waste that we bring in and more where possible.

Children working and living in tourist areas are especially vulnerable to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. We protect vulnerable children by adhering to our Child Protection Code of Conduct.
Animal welfare focus
We advocate for cruelty free animal encounters, encouraging travellers to follow the guidelines in our comprehensive Animal Welfare Code of Conduct as we seek to inform stakeholders about animal welfare matters.

Visas
There is no pre-arranged visa required to enter Jordan for passport holders from the following countries:
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
Please provide your reservations consultant with a scan of your passport so that we can organize the free Single entry group visa to Jordan.
Note the free Single entry group visa to Jordan is based on the same arrival and departure dates for each World Expeditions group trip only and valid for one single entry. Otherwise normal visa fees apply upon arrival or prior to travel.
If you are doing other tours or extending your stay in Jordan (not with World Expeditions), you will be required to apply for a separate visa with the other tour operator.
In rare instances, we may be able to obtain permission from the Jordanian authorities to extend the departure date on your single entry free visa – please check with your travel agent or World Expeditions reservations consultant.
If you are planning to travel to another country and return to Jordan at a later date (eg. Israel, Turkey or other Middle East countries), you will need to obtain and pay for your Double or Multiple entry individual visa at any Jordanian embassy or consulate prior to travel to Jordan. Departure taxes may also be payable and are at your own expense. For more information refer - http://international.visitjordan.com/generalinformation/gettingaround/bordercrossings.aspx
Single entry one month individual visas can be obtained for 40 Jordanian Dinars (subject to change) upon arrival at the Amman Queen Alia International Airport and at any border crossing EXCEPT the Allenby Bridge (King Hussein Bridge) and the ferry boat from Egypt. Visas must be arranged in advance and cannot be obtained at these crossings.  For more information refer - http://international.visitjordan.com/generalinformation/entryintojordan.aspx
Travellers considering a future trip to Iran or other Arab countries can request the Jordanian authorities to provide an entry card instead of an entry stamp on arrival. You should keep this entry card with your passport until you leave.
Your passport must be valid for at least six months from the date you enter.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
