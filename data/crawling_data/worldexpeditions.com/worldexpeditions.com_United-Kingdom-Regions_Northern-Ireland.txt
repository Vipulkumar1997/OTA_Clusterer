Why travel with us
Excellent value for money
Our trips are designed to be affordable providing you with all the necessary ingredients for a successful journey at a price that will leave more in your pocket for those random shopping finds on the trail.
Explore Europe at your own pace
On self guided trips you can expect to receive up-to-date and well researched route notes and maps, seamless luggage transfers and competitive pricing on all essential services. Many self guided trips also have daily departure dates, allowing you to enjoy the convenience and flexibility a self guided trip offers.
Enjoy flexibility and choices
Cycling or walking, 2 star or 4 star, small groups or self guided, land or sea  - we can help you explore Europe exactly the way you want.

Responsible travel

Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics. In the mountains of the Pyrenees and Mont Blanc our local partners reduce the amount of packaging taken on tour and ensure all waste is carried out from refuges that do not have road access to help dispose of it properly.
Supporting local
In the regions that we travel tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by only working with local family run hotels and suppliers so your money supports the community that hosts you.
Paddock to plate
The paddock to plate across Europe is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Charming local hotels
Often family run, these hotels range from 2 to 4 stars and provide access into local living thanks to your hosts. The hospitality is generous and their local knowledge is invaluable. Where possible, we choose locations that add to your experience.
Bed & Breakfasts (B&B's)
Simple yet rich in local character, the B&B's chosen are clean, comfortable and run by hosts that help add to your experience.
Boats
Due to the shape of a ship's hull the size of cabins vary from boat to boat. Boat based trips include below deck berths however you can upgrade to above deck for an additional cost. Berths contain simple but functional equipment and are furnished with beds and a small wardrobe or an open shelf. There is enough space for sleeping and storing your travel bag. The crew includes an onboard cook.

Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
