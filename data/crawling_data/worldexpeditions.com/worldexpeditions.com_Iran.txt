Iran is a true cradle of civilisation, filled with World Heritage Listed ancient cities and spectacular architecture, vibrant cultures and the gripping history of the Persian Empires.
Fans of ancient history, art and architecture, poetry and spirituality will be deeply moved by Iran's cultural riches, and nature lovers will fall for the country's snow-clad mountains and striking desert landscapes.
Savour the incredible culture and cuisine of Tehran, where you can explore museums and monuments, wander narrow streets and shop the aisles of bustling bazaars for colourful Persian carpets. Marvel at the spectacular architecture of Isfahan, one of the finest cities in the Islamic world, with its ancient bridges, mosques and bathhouses adorned with vaulted domes, towering minarets and tile mosaic.
Head to Shiraz, the heartland of Persian poetry and culture, for more exquisite shrines, mosques and monuments, and explore the historic bazaar of Tabriz, a magnificent covered marketplace that was once one of the most important commercial hubs along the famous Silk Road trading route.
Journey across remote mountains and dramatic landscapes to the desert city of Yazd, see the royal palaces, gardens and mausoleum of ancient Pasargadae, and tour the monumental ruins of the ancient city of Persepolis.
Iran's culture is as old and rich as they come, and its people are some of the world's warmest and most welcoming. Iran might not yet be on your bucket list, but it absolutely should be.

Iran highlights

Wander the streets of Tehran
A very underestimated capital, rich in history and culture, this bold and chaotic city features impressive museums, chic cafes and art galleries.
See the magnificent ruins of Persepolis
Step back in time as you explore the ancient city of Persepolis. Lost for centuries and completely covered by dust and sand, these ruins were only discovered again in the 1930s.
Walk amongst the mountains of Yazd
Yazd is situated at an oasis where the Dasht-e Kavir Desert and the Dasht-e Lut Deserts meet.
City tour in Isfahan
Considered to be one of the finest cities in the Islamic world, Isfahan showcases outstanding Iranian and Islamic architecture, boulevards and Persian gardens.
See the monuments of Shiraz
Affectionately described as shahr-e gol o bulbul (city of the flower and the nightingale), Shiraz is known as the poetic capital of Persia and is one of the most beautiful, historic cities in the world.

Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
