Why travel with us
Innovative Itineraries
Our European program offers unique itineraries with quality inclusions. Head to the Alps for an unforgettable mountaineering trip among some of Europe’s most spectacular scenery, or to Turkey to enjoy great cities, trek the Taurus Mountains and explore the remote trails of the Cappadocia region.
Mountaineering Opportunities
Our long history and extensive experience with mountaineering comes to the fore in our European line up, starring two of Europe’s most impressive peaks. Climb the highest peak in the European Alps on our classic Mont Blanc Ascent, or push yourself with a challenging summit of Matterhorn.
Expert Guides
Our guides in the field are what make your European experience special. In the Alps, they’re accredited mountain professionals with expert knowledge of local conditions and safety management. As with our guides in Turkey, they’re passionate about their work and will truly enhance your European experience.
More with UTracks
Our European walking & cycling division, UTracks, offers over 400 self guided or small group guided trips in over 35 European countries. Whether you prefer cycling or walking, 2-star or 4-star, small groups or self guided, land, river or sea – UTracks can help you to explore Europe exactly the way you want.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel
There are many ways to travel in Europe, but walking and cycling are the only true sustainable options. Europe leads the way in supporting our own philosophy of minimal impact tourism. We promote cycling and walking holidays not only because we believe they are a better way to experience a destination, but also because it creates the least impact on the environment, especially compared to the mainstream bus and cruise alternatives. Europe is home to a vast network of well sign posted walking trails as well as an extensive cycling infrastructure, from dedicated cycle lanes and paths, many which travel over borders, to bike friendly accommodations. Connecting them all is a reliable and efficient train network, that joins multiple countries seamlessly and provides a cheaper, more scenic and comfortable alternative to air travel. Our trips will see you staying in smaller towns and villages, which distribute the tourism revenues wider, and our travellers also enjoy picnics with reusable packaging and carry reusable water bottles.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Refuges or gite hostels
Used mainly on mountain walks, these convivial places add to the atmosphere of your journey through the mountains. Dorms may sleep up to 40 people and the beds are often bunk beds. Linen and blankets are provided and bathrooms are shared. Private rooms may be available (note that private gite rooms still use shared bathrooms).
Hotels
Often family run, these charming hotels range from 2 to 4 stars and provide access to local living thanks to your hosts. The hospitality is generous and their local knowledge is invaluable. Where possible, we choose locations that add to your experience.
Barges
Think of the barge as your floating hotel, where each day you experience a different sunrise and sunset location and only have to unpack once. Berths range from two lower single beds or bunk bed style but can be upgraded to larger berths with double beds. The bar and dining area is always a popular hangout at the end of each day’s activity. The crew includes an onboard cook.
Farmhouse bed & breakfasts
Live like a local on a farm, or purpose-built farm. Rooms are clean, comfortable, usually have a pleasant outlook and rooms vary as to whether they include an en suite bathroom or shared facilities.
Apartments
Self contained with basic cooking facilities, studio apartments cater for up to two people, with the option to upgrade to larger apartments with bedrooms if you have more in your party.
Boats
Due to the shape of a ship’s hull the size of cabins vary from boat to boat. Boat based trips include below deck berths however you can upgrade to above deck for an additional cost. Berths contain simple but functional equipment and are furnished with beds and a small wardrobe or an open shelf. There is enough space for sleeping and storing your travel bag. The crew includes an onboard cook.
