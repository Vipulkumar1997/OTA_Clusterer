Trek through the breathtaking archaeological treasures of the magnificent Red Rose City of Petra
Take a dip in the Dead Sea

The story of Abraham, Ibrahim,  the 'Friend of God' - as he has been named in Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition - is the beginning of Monotheism. Abraham is perceived in all monotheistic traditions as the ultimate host, opening his tent to any person in need. In this spirit we encounter the culture and places, share the food and the hospitality of the people of the three Abrahamic religions we meet along the way. This comprehensive journey goes beyond the usual touring and biblical itinerary with day walks amongst the most iconic sights and the myriad landscapes of Israel and Jordan. From vibrant seaside Tel Aviv to the captivating Old City of Jerusalem and the renowned holy sites of Nazareth, Galilee and Bethlehem. We hike in the Golan Heights and to the majestic fortress of Masada overlooking the Dead Sea, follow remote pilgrimage trails through the Judaean Desert to the ancient byzantine Chariton Monastery, and experience the unique Kibbutzim lifestyle. We also visit many sites of historical significance and natural beauty in Jordan with walks to the magnificent Red Rose City of Petra and Dana Nature Reserve, breathtaking Wadi Rum under the stars, and the impressive Greco-Roman ruins of Jerash, making this an all-encompassing and memorable adventure.

Introductory
This trip involves trekking and walking for up to five or six hours a day at a slow but steady pace and should never be misinterpreted to mean they are easy trips. You will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health. Although this trip is scheduled to avoid the height of summer, Israel and Jordan can get quite warm in the months either side of summer so any experience in dealing with physical activity in warm conditions would be advantageous, keeping hydrated is a must on this trip.
* Suggested preparation: 1 hour of aerobic type exercise, (either cycling or jogging) three times a week for three months leading up to your trip. For trekking, hill walking with a daypack in variable weather conditions is also recommended.

If time permits we will visit the aquaduct of ancient Caesarea enroute.
Approx driving time/distance: 1.5 hrs, 115 kms.  
Overnight: Hotel in Nazareth
Meals:
D
Day 2
Visit Sea of Galilee, Tabgha, Mt of Beatitudes and Capernaum
We will start our day by visiting the Church of the Annunciation. It represents the self-innovation of the Catholic Church after the Second Vaticanum – modern, multi-cultural, with a myriad of different representations of the Virgin Mary. We will stroll through the Arab market and walk up to the top of the City with its magnificent view over the landscape of the lower and upper Galilee.
A short drive will take us to the fantastic lookout of Arbel cliff where we will look over the Sea of Galilee to the Horns of Hittim - the site of the Battle of Hittim, Saladin's victory over the Crusaders in 1187; and the shrine of Nabi Shweib - the holiest site of the Druze religious community.
We will then hike to Wadi Hamman - the biblical Valley of the Doves, and down to the shore of the Sea of Galilee. After lunch (optional St. Peter’s fish) we will visit the Holy Sites of the Mt of Beatitudes, the Church of the Multiplication of Fish & Bread (Tabgha), and the headquarters of the early community around Jesus at Capernaum. A swim (depending on the time of year) in the Sea of Galilee will complete our adventures for the day.

Overnight: Kibbutz Guest House, area of Sea of Galilee
Meals:
B,D

Approx walking time/distance: 3-4 hrs, 8 kms.
Overnight: Kibbutz Guest House, area of Sea of Galilee
Meals:
B,D
Day 4
Border crossing into Jordan, visit Jerash
After a half an hour drive we will reach the “Sheikh Hussein” border at Beit Shean. Here we will cross into Jordan and meet our Jordanian guide and bus. Our first stop will be the town of Jerash, where we visit one of the largest and best preserved Greco-Roman ruins in the Middle East. Its colonnaded streets, public spaces, theatres, temples and exquisitely preserved mosaics provide a vivid picture of the grandeur of Imperial Rome. This afternoon we will continue to our hotel in Madaba, the “City of Mosaics”. If time permits, we will take a detour to visit the Monastery in Mount Nebo, a high hill overlooking the Dead Sea from where Moses is said to have seen the Promised Land.

Here we will take a hike along ancient terraced gardens and past giant boulders. Afterwards we continue to Wadi Musa (Petra) for overnight.

Overnight: Hotel in Wadi Musa
Meals:
B,D
Day 6
Trek from Little Petra to Petra
A short transfer brings us to the far less visited area of Little Petra (or Beidha). From here we begin the Petra "back door“ trail. This area is relatively untouched, with the colourful reddish and rose sandstone for which Petra has become famous as the Red Rose City. We reach the Ed-Deir Temple with its fantastic view over the Petra mountains, before heading down the ancient staircase to the Roman Cardo. After lunch, we will continue onto the King’s Tombs. From here, we will leave the Petra Valley through a colourful and narrow gorge WITHOUT passing the Siq and Treasury, which we will visit the following day.
Approx walking time/distance: 6-7 hrs, 14 kms.
Overnight: Hotel in Wadi Musa
Meals:
B,D
Day 7
Visit Petra, transfer to Wadi Rum bedouin camp
Today we have a full day visit of classical Petra. The soul-stirring, Red Rose City of Petra is chief among Jordan’s archaeological riches, and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Petra is the legacy of the Nabateans, an industrious Arab people who settled in south Jordan more than 2,000 years ago. We enter the site through the famous Siq, a 1km long narrow gorge flanked by towering cliffs. We will stop at Petra’s most spectacular monument, the Khaznet al-Faraoun (or Treasury) and afterwards visit the Roman amphitheatre. 
Afterwards there will be some free time for independent exploration of the area. You may wish to hike through colourful sandstone formations to the Monastery and the High Place of Sacrifice with its magnificent view of the Petra mountains. Various walks and climbs reveal literally hundreds of buildings, facades, tombs, baths, funerary halls, temples and haunting rock drawings and reliefs. 
This afternoon we will depart Petra and transfer to Wadi Rum, where we will enjoy a traditional dinner at our Bedouin camp.
Note: Your entry ticket into the city of Petra includes a horse ride into the site and you will have the option to ride a donkey to the end of the Siq. In line with our commitment to animal welfare in tourism we encourage you to walk, rather than ride a horse and donkey. There have been a number of instances where travellers have been upset by the treatment of the horses and donkeys by their handlers.
Approx walking time/distance: 3-4 hrs, 6-8 kms.
Approx driving time/distance: 1.5 hrs, 100 kms.
Overnight: Wadi Rum Camp
Meals:
B,D
Day 8
Jeep exploration & hike in Wadi Rum, border crossing into Israel
Amazing landscapes await us with scenery from the famous Hollywood production “Lawrence of Arabia”. We will ride in jeeps and do some exploring on foot through desert landscapes and unique valleys; between reddish sandstone, yellow sand and black rocks. 
(NOTE: the vehicles/ jeeps used in Wadi Rum are basic. They are built for purpose, that being to handle sandy desert tracks. They are owned and maintained by the local Bedouin people as part of local tourism initiatives). 
Afterwards we will depart from Wadi Rum and drive to the Arava border crossing and cross back into Israel, and meet our Israeli guide and bus. After a swim in the Red Sea, we continue to our Kibbutz accommodation for overnight. 
Approx walking time/distance: 2 hrs, 6 kms.
Approx driving time/distance: 1.5 hrs; 80 kms.
Overnight: Kibbutz Guest House, Eilat area
Meals:

After our visit, we will enjoy a dip in the famously buoyant waters of the Dead Sea, the lowest point on earth with a saline level around 30 per cent.
Approx walking time/distance: 1.5 - 3 hrs; 5-10 kms.
Approx driving time/distance: 4 hrs; 300 kms.

At the end of our hike we will refresh ourselves with a soak in the Officer’s Pool. From here it is a short drive up to Mt Scopus, the highest point of the Mount of Olives range.
