Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
Cycling, a popular past time of many South Koreas, is a very enjoyable way to experience the country. While our aluminum framed, multi-speed mountain bikes help you to get around the fascinating and rapidly developing country, the infrastructure was built with cyclists in mind featuring clear signage, distance markers and cycle paths. Our cycling holidays allow you to ineract with the region under your own steam, gaining a great sense of South Korea and the fascinating culture that lies within.
Ultimate value
Our South Korea adventures are highly inclusive, offering exceptional value for money. While most meals, bikes, site entry fees, accommodation and transfers are included in the tour cost, you can rest easy knowing a cycling support vehicle is always available for group members who need a break.
Experienced local guides
Our local experts aren't just guides; they are also keen cycling enthusiasts like you. Not only are they able to provide fascinating insights and commentary about the local sights enroute, but they are just as thrilled as you to be laying rubber to the road.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Leave No Trace
We operate our itineraries following the principles of Leave No Trace, ensuring that we take out all waste that we bring in and more where possible.
Child safe tourism
Children working and living in tourist areas are especially vulnerable to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. We protect vulnerable children by adhering to our Child Protection Code of Conduct.
Animal welfare focus
We advocate for cruelty free animal encounters, encouraging travellers to follow the guidelines in our comprehensive Animal Welfare Code of Conduct as we seek to inform stakeholders about animal welfare matters.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Inns
We use quality inns typically situated in natural environments. They are not luxury inns however we ensure they offer you a truly authentic experience.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?

Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
