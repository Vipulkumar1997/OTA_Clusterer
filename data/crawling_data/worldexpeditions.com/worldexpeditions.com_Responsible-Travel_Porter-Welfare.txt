Porter Welfare


We couldn’t get off the beaten path without them



Mountain porters are an integral part of each World Expeditions trekking or mountaineering adventure. Getting our travellers off the beaten path means that we use the self sufficiency of camping, a style of trekking that is enabled by mountain porters. On a trek or climb, the entire group - travellers, guides and porters alike - are a team who share the same needs for safety in the mountain environment.

Our Porter Welfare Code of Conduct ensures safe working conditions for the mountain porters we employ in Nepal, Peru, Papua New Guinea, Kenya and Tanzania.








In Nepal, the mountain porters we employ receive:






A good working wage that is regulated by the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal and the Labour Union of Nepal. We pay per their guidelines, which are unionized.



Life insurance and income protection insurance.



Access to the same first aid care that our travellers receive including emergency helicopter evacuation if required.



A wind and waterproof jacket and over-trousers, 2 pairs of woolen socks, 2 pairs of leather shoes on long treks and 2 pairs of canvas shoes while on short treks, woolen gloves, a warm cap and sunglasses.



A weight restriction of carrying no more than 30kgs.



A porter age restriction of minimum 16 years of age and maximum 50 years of age.







Additionally, we are one of the only trekking companies in Nepal to provide porters with:



Three meals a day, prepared by our cooks.



Lodging or tents, sleeping mats and blankets.




















In Peru, the mountain porters we employ receive:




The same access to medical service as clients.



Three meals per day based on a menu requested specifically by the porters as well as gas stoves for all cooking.



Access to interest free long-term loans from us, provided they can clearly indicate how the funds will be used.



Basic life and accident insurance.



Full coverage of any medical costs incurred, regardless of if it is work related, to any porter or member of their family.



Transport (private busses and trains) to and from the trek.



Sleeping tents, sleeping pads, sleeping bags (if requested), footwear (shoes or boots), warm jackets and rain gear.



Yearly meetings to discuss any other needs porters may have and areas they feel improvements are possible.



Additionally, we are one of the five companies (among almost 200) that pay the highest wages to porters.



















In Tanzania and Kenya, the mountain porters we employ receive:




A rate in excess of the Kilimanjaro Porter Assistant Project (KPAP) recommended minimum wage for porters.



At least two meals a day; the third meal is sometimes a snack/tea as this can work best with the itinerary and water supplies. We ensure there are more than adequate amounts of food and have a system to check that all porters are well fed.



A weight restriction of carrying no more than 20kgs.



A porter age minimum of 18. There is no maximum age; we assess their suitability on their health and willingness to work.



The same medical kit and evacuation processes as the travellers.



Any costs for treatment to injuries that are sustained while working.



Sleeping bags and mats, waterproof jackets, warm hats and walking boots are regularly provided.



We are proudly at the forefront of the process of changing local perceptions of sexual inequality by employing female crew members on Mount Kilimanjaro. We have two highly successful female guides, a female cook and around 40 female porters.

Since 2012, World Expeditions has sponsored a guide to complete a scholarship course through the Kilimanjaro Guide Scholarship Foundation each year. The course trains the guides in Tour Operations, Tourism Geography, Wildlife Knowledge and Basic Computer Applications.


In Papua New Guinea, the mountain porters we employ receive:




Wages that are above the minimum wage for Papua New Guinea.



Payment for the return trip home or flights to return home (depends on location and personal preference).



Allocated money to purchase their preferred food for the trek, uniform and first aid kit, as well as having their campsite fees paid for.




We encourage all trekking companies adopt similar policies as we believe that the welfare of the entire trekking crew, from porters to the most senior guide, is the responsibility of the company that sends them on the trek.

World Expeditions supports the
International Porter Protection Group
and the
International Mountain Explorers Connection
, international organizations that operate to ensure the health and well-being of porters globally.
