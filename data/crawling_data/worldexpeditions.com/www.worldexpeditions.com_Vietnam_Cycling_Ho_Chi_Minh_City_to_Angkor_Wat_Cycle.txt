Trip highlights
Bustling streets and markets in Ho Chi Minh City
Eye-opening wartime history at the Cu Chi tunnels
Floating markets, villages and waterways of the Mekong River Delta
Sun, sand and seafood in the sleepy beach resort of Kep
Cycling around the laid-back French colonial river town of Kampot
Siem Reap and the iconic temples of Angkor by bike
Supported cycling through some of Southeast Asia’s most stunning landscapes
Cycling is one of the best ways to experience the diverse scenery and rural cultures of Southeast Asia, and continuing our tradition of pioneering cycle trips, this unique itinerary takes us from the bustling streets of Ho Chi Minh City through untouched villages to the iconic temple complex of Angkor Wat. Our comfortable geared bikes, support crew and steady pace mean that you’ll be free to enjoy the stunning scenery along the way, with our backup vehicle available to give tired riders a break at any time. Our journey begins in fast-paced Ho Chi Minh City, which we leave behind for quieter back roads to the Cu Chi Tunnels. Crossing through to Cambodia, we take time out in the charming seaside resort of Kep and laid-back riverside town of Kampot, cycling through lush green countryside, fertile rice fields and small minority villages. We’ll have time to absorb the palaces, pagodas and French inspired architecture of Phnom Penh before embarking on an in-depth cycle of the spectacular Angkor temples.

Cycling
Grading:

More info about grading system
4
Introductory to Moderate
To determine the grade of a particular adventure we consider a number of factors. These include the distances cycled, the condition of the terrain, the altitude, and the length of the trip. The Ho Chi Minh City to Angkor Wat Cycle is graded moderate. This trip does not take place at altitude and most cycling surfaces are well paved roads, however some days cycling are over rough un-graded surfaces and the climate in Cambodia is very hot and humid. Expect cycling time to average up to 7 hours per day.
In order to complete this trip we advise that you undertake regular exercise – swimming, cycling, jogging, for at least 45 minutes three or four times a week for a minimum of three months prior to your departure.

Day 1
Arrive in Ho Chi Minh City
If you’re flying into Ho Chi Minh City today you will be met at the airport and transferred to the group hotel. The remainder of the day is at leisure to start exploring, with a group meeting being held in the hotel foyer at a time indicated in your final documents. Tonight we enjoy a welcome dinner at a local restaurant, allowing us to sample Southern Vietnamese specialties and meet our fellow travelers.
Overnight in Ho Chi Minh City.
Meals:
D
Day 2
Ho Chi Minh City sightseeing and Cu Chi Tunnels cycle (30km)
This morning we set off on a day of sightseeing, taking a short bus trip to Hoc Mon town where we’ll hop on our bikes and cycle through scenic rice paddies and rubber plantations making our way to the famous Cu Chi Tunnels, a twisting network of narrow underground tunnels and rooms that the Viet Cong used as its military base and living quarters during the Vietnam War. We’ll learn about the Viet Cong’s life underground as well as being able to explore the network of tunnels by foot. After lunch at a local restaurant we’ll then drive back to Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) for the afternoon, taking in some of the city’s most important sights. We begin with the Reunification Palace, an outstanding example of 1960s architecture that is steeped in modern history. It was here that the Vietnam War ended in 1975, when the city of Saigon fell after a North Vietnamese army tank crashed through the palace gates, from which point the city was to be known as Ho Chi Minh City. From here we visit some of the city’s major landmarks: the Notre Dame Cathedral, an imposing neo-Romanesque Catholic cathedral built in the late 19th century; and the Saigon Post Office, a classic French colonial building bearing a giant portrait of ‘Uncle Ho’ and many grand architectural details. To finish the day, you might like to visit the famous Ben Thanh Market, an enormous sprawling covered marketplace that is packed to the gills with everything from fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood and sweets, to suitcases, clothing and white goods, traditional lacquer ware, handicrafts and kitschy tourist trinkets. Bargaining is key here, but even if you’re not shopping, it’s a dazzling spectacle to photograph. Tonight we’ll enjoy dinner at renowned social enterprise restaurant, KOTO. Founded by Vietnamese-Australian Jimmy Pham, KOTO (“Know One, Teach One”) is a popular restaurant that provides hospitality training and welfare services to disadvantaged young Vietnamese, getting them off the streets and equipping them with life-changing skills and opportunities. 
Cycling distance: 30 km 
Overnight in Ho Chi Minh City.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 3
Cycle to Can Tho (65km)
Today we depart Ho Chi Minh City and cycle towards the lush waterways and farmland of the Mekong River Delta. One of the world’s great rivers, the mighty Mekong—Southeast Asia’s longest river—rises in China’s Tibetan Plateau and ribbons all the way down through Southeast Asia, emptying into the South China Sea south of Ho Chi Minh City. The vast alluvial plains of the Mekong Delta are the fertile food bowl of Southeast Asia, providing critical water for fishing, agriculture and transportation. We leave the busy streets of Saigon and drive to My Tho town, where we’ll hop on our bikes and cycle for around 40 km to our lunch stop in Vinh Long. From here we continue our cycle through small villages and farmland to Can Tho, the Mekong Delta’s largest city. 
Cycling distance: 65 km 
Overnight in Can Tho.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 4
To Rach Gia cycle (50km)
This morning we set off early for a pleasant ride along the riverside and through villages to the Cai Rang floating market, where we’ll visit a well known rice paper making village and explore the exciting floating market in a motorised sampan. After stopping for lunch at a local restaurant we’ll continue cycling towards Long Xuyen and Rach Gia, our home for the night.
Cycling distance: 50 km
Overnight in Rach Gia.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 5
To Kep, cross Cambodian border enroute cycle (60km)
After breakfast we travel to Ha Tien and cross the border at Prek Chak into Cambodia, where our Cambodian guide will meet us. From here we’ll cycle to the charming beach town of Kep on the Gulf of Thailand coast. Once a popular French colonial resort town, Kep is known for its fresh seafood, crumbling French colonial villas and relaxing lazy pace. Tonight we’ll enjoy some of Kep’s famous seafood with dinner at a local restaurant. 
Cycling distance: 60 km
Overnight in Kep.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 6
Cycle to Kampot (50km)
Today we take a gentle ride towards the relaxed riverside town of Kampot, where we’ll cycle around and visit some of the town’s sights. Like Kep, charming Kampot is also home to handsome French colonial villas and a relaxing pace that makes it a favourite hang out with travelers. Today we’ll also have the option of renting kayaks and paddling around the beautiful Kampot River.
Cycling distance: 50 km
Overnight in Kampot.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 7
To Phnom Penh, cycle (60km)
Today we set off on our bikes towards nearby Bokor National Park, where we’ll ride to foot of the hill and then drive in our support vehicle to the top of the mountain, for great views over Kampot and the Gulf of Thailand. We’ll ride back to Kampot for lunch and then continue on our bikes to Cambodia’s capital, Phnom Penh. We’ll ride most of the way before taking the support vehicle for the last 70 km or so, arriving at our hotel in the afternoon. With its handsome architecture and location at the convergence of the Mekong, Bassac and Tonle Sap rivers, Phnom Penh is regarded by many as the most beautiful of all the French-built cities in Indochina. The city has a growing fine dining and hip café culture, excellent museums and a booming arts scene, and Khmer and French influences are evident throughout the city’s ornate temples and grand colonial buildings—but its busy streets overflow with markets, motorbikes and fragrant food stalls as per most Southeast Asian cities. 
Cycling distance: 60 km
Overnight in Phnom Penh.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 8
In Phnom Penh
This morning, transfer to the riverbanks to catch a ferry to Koh Dach, known as Silk Island. Pedal through rustic scenic villages, silk weaving workshops, pagodas and meet friendly local people along the way. Drive back to the city. Scale the steps up this small hill to see Wat Phnom Temple, the birthplace of Phnom Penh.
After lunch we explore the main sights including the Royal Palace facing the Mekong River, and its adjoining Silver Pagoda built in 1962 famous for its lavish decorations of silver paved floor and several Buddha statues made from precious metals & stones. National Museum is the museum we gather and keep the statue since Angkorian period. National Museum: also called Musee des Beaux-Arts. We will spend the rest of day shopping at the Toul Tompong Market (Russian Market) where you will feel a bustling daily life of local people with Cambodia’s special character through local specialties, their houses, their faces, palaces and buildings of Khmer & colonial style architecture. 
•	Overnight in Phnom Penh
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
To Siem Reap
Today is a rest day from cycling as we take a private bus to Siem Reap. We drive through picturesque countryside, stopping along the way to walk through local villages. After stopping for lunch in Kompong Thom we’ll visit Sambor Prei Kuk, an impressive collection of 7th century temple ruins that served as the capital of the pre-Angkorian Chenla Kingdom. The remainder of the afternoon is then free to explore Siem Reap at leisure.
Overnight in Siem Reap.
Drive time: 6-7hours
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 10
Angkor Temples (40 km)
If you’re happy to rise early today, we’ll have the option of driving to Angkor Wat for an unforgettable sunrise. After breakfast back at our hotel we’ll hop on our bikes and spend a full day exploring the spectacular Angkor temples. The UNESCO World Heritage Listed site of Angkor Wat, one of the great wonders of the world, encompasses not just the one temple but an expansive religious city covering several square miles near Siem Reap—the largest religious complex in the world—including scores of temples, shrines, canals and other structures. This is one of the world’s most significant archaeological sites, and is at once an arresting and unforgettable experience to see the temples in person. With the majority of construction taking place between the 6th and 13th centuries, the temples of Angkor together form an incredible testimony to the spiritual vision and artistic genius of the Angkor civilisation that flourished and prospered from about 800 to 1400 AD. Many of the temples are still in excellent condition—especially the iconic Angkor Wat—but many structures are in states of ruin as the surrounding forests have taken over during the centuries since their abandonment. The iconic temples are intricately carved and adorned with sculpture and bas-relief depicting sacred scenes of Cambodian life and mythology. Today we’ll visit the South Gate of Angkor Thom Temple, the Bayon, the Royal Enclosure, Phimeanakas, the Terrace of Elephants and Terrace of Leper Kings, the Ta Prohm Temple and the iconic Angkor Wat. Please prepare yourself to be exposed to the sun for long intervals today. 
Cycling distance: 40 km
Overnight in Siem Reap.
For sunrise clients need to be ready to leave hotel around 4:45-05:00am otherwise they may miss it.
Appropriate attire when visiting temples in Angkor Wat is long pants (covering the knee) and shirts that cover shoulders. Skirts, small shorts, tank tops, and other items of revealing clothing are not allowed within temple grounds. Visitors can and are frequently turned away from temples when wearing revealing clothing.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 11
Angkor Temples (60 km)
After breakfast, you head out to Roluos group, located just outside Siem Reap. The temples date back to the late ninth century and are believed to denote the beginning of the ‘classic period’ in Khmer architecture. You will cycle to Kompong Kleang floating village, a settlement of over 20,000 people, mostly fisherman and traders. Floating over the canals, houses tower up to ten meters above the water, and you will constantly see waving hands of the friendly locals. Take your time and make the best of this opportunity to glimpse Cambodia’s countryside culture and family lifestyle, a contrast to the constant bartering you'll find in the cities. From Kompong Khleang, you head out to the hidden jungle temple of Beng Mealea. A short walk through dense jungle brings you to the wonders of this overgrown temple which lay undiscovered for centuries 
Enjoy our final dinner together in one of the local restaurants with Traditional Apsara Dance Show.
Cycling distance: 60 km
Overnight in Siem Reap.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 12
