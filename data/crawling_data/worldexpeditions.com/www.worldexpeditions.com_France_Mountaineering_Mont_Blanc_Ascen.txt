Trip highlights
Opportunity to climb to the summit of Mt Blanc, with 2 opportunities for a summit attempt with our carefully planned itinerary
Learn basic mountaineering skills and acclimatise on our 3 day training course prior to the climb
Climb the spectacular Aiguille du Tour and Petit Fourche as part of your training
Exhilarating walking & climbing in the French Alps
Time to experience Chamonix staying in a 4 star hotel, the world capital of mountaineering
Two to one ratio of guides to climbers on Mont Blanc
Anybody with a high level of fitness contemplating a more active visit to Europe could not resist the proposal of climbing the highest peak in the Alps, Mont Blanc (4810m / 15,771 feet). Whilst the range has attracted the attention of world class alpinists worldwide for its challenging routes for centuries, there are also many options available to the novice climber under the guidance of our experienced guides. Please be aware that the training and the ascent of Mont Blanc involve long challenging days at altitude and is only suitable for very fit, strong walkers that are capable of climbing at a consistent speed with short breaks over long periods.  If you are in doubt about your level of fitness then please contact your nearest office to discuss.
Acclimatisation and basic technical mountaineering training are our main focus of the first 3 days. This trip is designed with the experienced trekker, winter walker and beginner mountaineer in mind and these days are spent learning or brushing up on the basics of travel on snow and ice to help prepare you for the tough climb ahead. Pre trip fitness preparation is absolutely vital if you wish to get the most out of this expedition and you must arrive in Chamonix on day one in excellent condition as the first 3 days are certainly not fitness training, but demanding preparation for Mont Blanc.
Our summit strategy:
In this itinerary which includes 3 days on Mont Blanc, we have the flexibility in our program to make a longer summit attempt from the Tete Rousse Refuge (on day 6) and staying overnight in the Gouter Refuge on the descent or to make a summit attempt from Gouter (on day 7) and descend to Chamonix. This flexibility gives our groups a significant advantage of 2 windows of opportunity to attempt the summit on either day 6 or day 7 depending upon the weather conditions or forecast. But please note that after attempting & failing the summit it is important to realize that it is not possible to make a second attempt on the summit on the following day. Over recent seasons our preference has been to attempt the summit from Tete Rousse, which means we cross the Grand Couloir early in the morning on both the ascent and descent when it is frozen. Your guides will be well aware of the forecast and will make a decision on when to attempt the summit.

8
Entry Level Mountaineering or Exploratory Treks
Mt Blanc is often underestimated, a high level of fitness and experience walking/scrambling over uneven and steep terrain is essential, so we would recommend you prepare well as all group members will need to walk at good speed. A good speed is the ability to walk/ascend 400m in 1 hour at altitudes in excess of 3000m. To undertake this trip you must be very fit and a good walker on rough terrain. You can expect to hike for 6 to 12 hour days with up to 800 to 1600 metre vertical gains in elevation. The snow slopes will be up to 35-40 degrees in parts and there is also rock climbing involved in some sections, (Alpine grade PD: 'peu difficile' - not very difficult)- this combined with exposure and possibly adverse weather conditions can be difficult for those who have not experienced this type of climbing before. Additionally you will be wearing stiff mountaineering boots and crampons which take some getting use to. During days 2-4 you will have one guide for every 4-6 participants. During these days we hope to attempt the relatively easy summits of Aiguille du Tour or Petite Fourche (only with 4 clients at a time which may require the guide to make 2 trips), to give you the best practice for the actual ascent on Mont Blanc. On days 5-7 one certified UIAGM High Mountain guide will accompany 2 participants. We recommend undertaking some long hill walks on uneven and rough terrain, before the trip, to get used to walking for long periods on steep slopes, with a pack of about 8-10kg, and get used to trekking in bad weather. At the completion of your training days, your guide will assess if you are capable of attempting the Mont Blanc climb. There are many other climbing options in the Alps, and on the odd occasion that an attempt on Mont Blanc is not possible your guide will consult with you and make alternative arrangements if necessary. Our guides on Mont Blanc are accomplished and experienced guides, if your guide decides not to allow you to attempt Mont Blanc this decision must be taken as final in the interests of your own safety and the safety of the group and the guide. To participate in the Mont Blanc Ascent prior mountaineering experience is an advantage but not essential, most important is an excellent fitness level, with a good level of experience walking in the mountains on snow/ice. The walking is often on uneven rock and ice, with exposed sections of trail for a vast majority of the climb, balance and tenacity are very important.
Preparation- the best preparation for this ascent is extended periods of hard paced walking with a pack in mountainous terrain. Legs and lungs should be the focus, as mentioned above the ability to ascend quickly at a rate of 400m in 1 hour is a minimum requirement. If you are not fit and strong your chances of summitting are vastly reduced. You should aim to start your preparation 6 months or more in advance of taking the trip. Practice on uneven ground, so that you are accustomed to uneven footings, basic rockclimbing, and at the least, scrambling should also be a part of your training regime. Incorporating running and cycling in hilly regions into your program will further prepare you well for this trip. We can teach you the skills to get you to the top, however your fitness and preparation is your responsibility and key to a successful climb.
Technical Grading:
Basic
Technical Grade: Basic
The conditions are relatively straightforward and not technically difficult. Expect generally low angled slopes with no prolonged steep or exposed sections and glacier travel where participants are roped together. Abseiling may be required in short sections.

Day 1
Join Chamonix
Please make your way to the 4 star Mercure Hotel (or similar) which will be advised in your final documentation (any airport transfer service will take you direct to the hotel reception).  
A group briefing will be held at 6pm at the hotel reception, it is essential that you attend and bring your equipment with you; you will then proceed to the gear hire shop, Snell Sports, with your guide. Please ensure that your travel arrangements will have you in Chamonix at this time. Overnight at the Mercure Hotel (or similar). 
Please note: Hotel details are subject to change, and your final documents will confirm the name of the group hotel.
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Introduction to mountaineering, overnight at Albert 1er Refuge
After a hearty breakfast at the hotel we take the Charamillon Cablecar and spend the day learning mountaineering basics on the Tour glacier, including the use of crampons, ice axe and ropes on the glacier, and rope management skills. We climb to the Albert 1er refuge (2702 m) for our nights accommodation. Overnight mountain hut.
Schedule: 3-4 hours. Vertical: +570m.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 3
Mountaineering training, overnight at Trient Refuge
Today we continue to learn the skills necessary to prepare for Mont Blanc itself. We climb on glacier through the Col supérieur du Tour and weather permitting we ascend the magnificent Aiguille du Tour (3529 m) which provides a spectacular outlook on the whole range, on both the French and Swiss sides. Your guide will take 3 at a time to the top. Today the technical focus is on belaying on steep snow slopes and learning basic rock climbing. Following our first major peak we then cross to the Trient Refuge where we stay for a second night of acclimatisation. The sunrise on the Aiguille du Tour and the Chardonnet will be a marvellous souvenir from our mountain hut.
Schedule: 6-7 hours. Vertical: + 820 m and – 370 m.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 4
Ascend Petite Fourche
This morning we hope to rise to a marvellous backdrop of peaks before setting out on a challenging traverse across the Col de Neige under the dramatic peak of Tête Blanche. Our aim today is to make an attempt on the summit of Petite Fourche which provides excellent training on ice and snow and another opportunity to hone our skills before attempting Mont Blanc. Descend down the Tour glacier via the Albert 1er hut to the cable car and return back to the village of Le Tour. Drive back to Chamonix by bus and a comfortable night at the Mercure Hotel (or similar).
Schedule: 6-7 hours. Vertical:  + 550 m and –1400 m.
Meals:
B,L
Day 5
Climb to Tete Rousse Refuge (3167m)
Following last minute preparations we transfer to the train or cable car to the Nid d’Aigle at 2372m. From the Nid d’Aigle, we commence the trek onto the lower flanks of Mont Blanc.  It is a relatively short 3 hour hike that brings us to a short and steep path leading to the Tete Rousse Glacier and the Tete Rousse Refuge (3167m). As we climb higher above the valley we enter an alpine environment of snow, ice and rock. The views as we approach the Tete Rousse Refuge are breathtaking. The Tete Rousse is a new hut perched on the edge of the glacier in a stunning mountain setting. Today is not a long day, but still quite challenging due to the increasingly rugged terrain. We can expect to reach the hut by mid afternoon, giving plenty of time to recover for the climb to the Gouter Hut the next day. It is important to keep well hydrated. Meals at the hut usually begin with soup accompanied by bread & cheese, followed with a hearty meat casserole and dessert of fruit puree or similar, normally served around 6.30pm.
Schedule: 3-4 hours. Vertical:  + 800 m.
Our summit strategy:
In this itinerary which includes 3 days on Mont Blanc, we have the flexibility in our program to make a longer summit attempt from the Tete Rousse Refuge (on day 6) and staying overnight in the Gouter Refuge on the descent or to make a summit attempt from Gouter (on day 7) and descend to Chamonix. This flexibility gives our groups a significant advantage of 2 windows of opportunity to attempt the summit on either day 6 or day 7 depending upon the weather conditions or forecast. But please note that after attempting & failing the summit it is important to realize that it is not possible to make a second attempt on the summit on the following day. Over recent seasons our preference has been to attempt the summit from Tete Rousse, which means we cross the Grand Couloir early in the morning on both the ascent and descent when it is frozen. Your guides will be well aware of the forecast and will make a decision on when to attempt the summit.
*PLEASE NOTE: Throughout the season there are times when the Tete Rousse Hut and/or the Gouter Hut are overbooked, although this has vastly improved since the new Gouter Hut was completed. Availability is controlled by French Alpine Club and allocation of beds is on a random basis and released in mid April each year. Please note that booking in advance is highly recommended but still does not guarantee a bed in these huts. From time to time, we may need to stay both nights in Tete Rousse and it may be necessary to camp outside this hut (equipment will be provided).
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 6
Ascend to summit at 4810m and return to Gouter Refuge (3800m)*
By utilising both the Tete Rousse Refuge and the Gouter Refuge, we give ourselves the best chance of making a successful summit bid. An early alpine start this morning is steeper and more demanding, and we will be roped up when we leave the Tete Rousse. We soon come to the famous Grand Couloir and after safely crossing over we continue to ascend through steep rocky terrain involving rockscrambling. We continue past the old Gouter Hut and after 3 hours we shall arrive at the recently built new refuge set in a spectacular location where we will stop for a tea break. From Gouter we ascend over snow and ice slopes and traversing ridges to the summit of Mont Blanc. First we will reach the top of the Dome Du Gouter at 4300m.  We then pass the Vallot shelter and continue our challenging climb up the Les Bosses ridge and finally after 4 - 5 hours, the summit of Mont Blanc. Weather permitting we savour the stunning mountain views for only a short time before making our descent to the Gouter Refuge.
Schedule: 10 to 12 hours, Vertical: + 1600 / - 1000 m.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 7
Descend to Nid d'Aigle and to Chamonix
Our descent on steep rock and ice and across the Grand Couloir requires concentration. After the Tete Rousse the terrain becomes easier enroute to the Nid d'Aigle station where we board the train down to the valley and the town of Chamonix. Overnight at Mercure Hotel (or similar).  
Schedule: 4 hours, Vertical:  - 800 m
Meals:
B,L
Day 8
Trip concludes in Chamonix
The trip concludes after breakfast in the hotel.
PLEASE NOTE: The above route and estimated times must be seen as a guide only. This itinerary may change at any time due to weather, snow conditions, group fitness or other reasons. Your guide will always make a final decision after assessing the situation and liaising with the group members. On any climbing trip in the Alps it is important to understand that weather can be changeable and can sometimes affect your chances of summitting.  On any climbing trip it is the experience of the climb, learning new skills, your safety and the magnificent scenery that are most important and if you are able to reach the summit due to good weather then that should always be considered as a bonus.  Whilst ultimately your decision, we often feel it is recommended to stay an additional night in Chamonix at the end of the trip in case poor weather means a delay of your climb on Mont Blanc. This contingency day can be well worth the extra time and modest cost and if not used the Chamonix is a great town to relax after the climb.
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE EVENT OF BAD WEATHER ON MONT BLANC?
Your guide will choose between the following options:
1. Climbing of Gran Paradiso (4060 m) in Italy if there is a bad weather on the Mont Blanc Range.
2. Cancellation if there is a bad weather on the French and Italian ranges,our partner in Chamonix may give you a credit for any unused services. Please liaise directly with our local partner with regards to this credit and the validity of the credit. The credit will not apply to any future World Expeditions trips.
WHAT HAPPENS IF I AM NOT FIT OR STRONG ENOUGH TO CLIMB MONT BLANC?
During the training days your guide will assess your ability, fitness and suitability to climb Mont Blanc.  If you are deemed unsuitable then you will not be able to get a refund of any services or hut fees. Depending on your fitness and skills, your guide may give you the opportunity to climb to Tete Rousse Refuge. If this is not possible then any hotel in Chamonix would be at your own expense.
