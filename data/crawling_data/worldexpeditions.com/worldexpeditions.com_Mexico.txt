Mexico is a land of incredible beauty and contrast. The variety of dramatic landscapes on offer is astounding, from extensive coastline fringed with pristine beaches to cactus-studded deserts, snowcapped volcanoes and lush jungles littered with the ruins of ancient civilisations; and the nation's rich culture, cuisine and art are among the world's most vibrant.
This is an exciting, expansive country with extraordinary environmental and cultural diversity, energetic cities and rich pre-Columbian and colonial history. Join us as we explore this incredible country!
Tour the spectacular ruined cities of Mexico's pre-Hispanic civilisations, from the ancient pyramids of Teotihuacan, to the Mayan jungle sanctuary of Palenque, the remarkable ancient structures of Uxmal and Kabah, and the striking Mayan temples of Chichen Itza.
Be blown away by the beauty and grandeur of Sumidero Canyon, a lush river gorge whose steep cliffs tower up to a kilometer above you; and unwind with a cold drink on the perfect white sand beaches of Cancun.
Discover culture, cuisine and history in the busy streets and world-class museums of Mexico City, Mexico's overwhelming capital; then grab your camera and explore the cobblestoned streets, striking cathedrals and colonial architecture of charming San Cristobal De Las Casas.

ATM's are available in most cities.
Although many businesses will accept foreign currency (particularly US Dollars) it is best to use pesos. Foreign currency can be exchanged at one of many casas de cambio (exchange houses), which have longer hours and offer a quicker service than the banks.
International Dialing Code
+52
Electricity
Electricity in Mexico is 127 Volts, at 60 hertz. The most common pin type is A. (2 flat prong).
Visas
Australian, British, European Union, United States, Canadian and New Zealand passport holders do not require a visa for entry into Mexico for a stay of up to 180 days. However, on arrival you will be required to obtain a Mexican government tourist card (tarjeta de turista) which is available free of charge at Mexican Immigration points (including airports). You must retain this card for the duration of your stay and hand it to immigration on your departure. All other nationalities should check with their nearest consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
