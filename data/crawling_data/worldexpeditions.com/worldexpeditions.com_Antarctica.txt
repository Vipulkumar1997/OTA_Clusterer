Antarctica is a spectacular wilderness that needs no introduction. A voyage into this otherworldly environment puts you among breathtaking frozen landscapes, rugged icy coastlines and towering mountains, stunning coves and islands, abundant wildlife and the seemingly endless expanse of the continental ice sheet.
Marvel at the majestic frozen landscapes of Earth's most pristine wilderness; see whales, seals, penguins and other Antarctic species at play; and watch as enormous icebergs are spectacularly '"calved'" into the ocean.
Snowshoe across the ice sheet; explore previously unclimbed peaks in the company of expert guides; and visit key scientific stations to learn about their critical research work.
Practice your photography on dramatic icy landscapes and majestic wildlife; take the plunge with a kayak, snorkel or dive experience like no other; and enjoy a sunset cocktail on the deck of your vessel, complete with a chunk of Antarctic ice.
Our range of Antarctic adventures travel lightly aboard small vessels with a core focus on sustainability and minimal environment impact. Your shipmates will be research scientists and wildlife experts, photographers and fellow travellers with a shared interest and respect for this frozen wilderness.
Join us as we journey across the fabled Antarctic Circle into this spectacular wilderness- a mysterious and remarkable environment that has long-lured explorers and adventurers - for a once-in-a-lifetime experience that should be on everyone's bucket list!

xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
The Polar regions are pristine natural environments. Preserving them for future generations is not just important, but essential. We are an associate member of The International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators.
Exploratory voyages, not cruises
We use vessels that carry no more than 198 passengers, giving us access to areas that are unavailable to the larger cruise ships. We focus on spending time ashore to enjoy the spontaneity of wildlife encounters, hearing from experts in research stations and observing sculptured ice formations from our zodiacs. No two trips are the same.
Widest choice of voyages
We have a diverse selection of voyages and departures to choose from. Don't want to travel the Drake Passage in both directions? Take one of our voyages that fly to King George Island. Sit amongst a million king penguins on South Georgia or sail south to the Antarctic Circle.
Expert guides, lecturers and crew
Our staff are the best in the business - passionate individuals who have dedicated decades to polar exploration and tourism. From our Russian captains and crew to our expert naturalists and lecturers, their combined knowledge will truly enhance your polar experience.
Real interaction with the polar regions
With us you can fully savour the spectacular landscapes of the Polar regions by getting active. Cross South Georgia on foot, camp out on the ice for a night or try your hand at a range of activities including kayaking, diving or snow shoeing on one of our base camp voyages.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Environmental protection
The International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO) was formed in 1991 to promote environmentally responsible travel to Antarctica, and World Expeditions is proud to be an Associate B2 Member of IAATO. We operate within the parameters of the Antarctic Treaty System, including the Antarctic Treaty and the Protocol on the Environment and Annexes and IAATO guidelines.
Minimal impact
Our voyages have a maximum of 198 passengers on board, ensuring to ensure minimal impact to the environment.
Traveller education
We provide educational lectures and experiences on board to ensure our travellers understand the natural elements of Antarctica, including the environmental code of conduct and the scientific explanations behind them.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Comfortable vessels
Our vessels are specifically designed with expedition cruising in mind. Cabins range from quadruple berths right through to spacious suites, accommodating all budgets and tastes. Most cabins have private bathrooms, however some share a bathroom between a small number of other cabins. Public areas include dining quarters, lecture theatres, a bar and a library and some of our ships also have spas and gymnasiums aboard.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Expedition Staff
Our polar expedition leaders and crew are specialists in wilderness environments with years of experience in the field. Your Expedition Leader will be highly skilled in communication and decision making, along with wilderness first aid and safety. It will be their job to ensure the expedition runs smoothly and that as many of our itinerary objectives are met whilst ensuring all participants safety and wellbeing. Your tour leader will be assisted by an expedition team, which may include a variety of polar specialists including geologists, ornithologists, marine biologists, naturalists and historians. There is also a resident medical officer on board each voyage. During the trip all of the team will impart their knowledge of the environments, as well as acting as zodiac drivers, lecturer’s, dinner companions and all round great travel buddies!

Where to Go
Follow in the footsteps of explorers and adventurers by crossing the fabled Antarctic Circle
Marvel at the majestic frozen landscapes of Earth’s most pristine wilderness
See whales, seals, penguins and other Antarctic species at play
Enjoy a drink onboard at sunset, complete with a chunk of Antarctic ice
Watch as enormous icebergs are spectacularly “calved” into the ocean
Head ashore in a zodiac to explore the ice sheet and visit one of the Antarctic Peninsula’s research stations

Weather
The climate in Antarctica is characterized by a long winter and a relatively short summer. We visit the Peninsula during the summer (November to March) when temperatures hover between –15 and +2 degrees Celsius during the day. Wind chill can cause this temperature to drop below –15 degrees Celsius. The Antarctic continent is considered to be the coldest desert in the world. Precipitation can occur during the summer on the Peninsula however it is unlikely to persist for longer than a few hours.
Time in Antarctica
There are numerous time zones across the Antarctic continent, however the Ukraine research station of Vernadsky which is located on the Antarctic Peninsula is -3 hours behind UTC/GMT.
Language
There is no official language for the Antarctic continent.
Currency
Payment of incidental expenses aboard most ships can be paid for with US dollars cash or with Visa and Mastercards.
Electricity
We recommend taking a universal adapter.
Visas
Whilst visa's are not required to visit Antarctica many passport holders may require visa's for countries they transit en-route to the voyage. Please check with your reservations consultant or travel agent to determine if visa's are required for your journey.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
