Set on the eastern ridges of the mighty Himalaya and sandwiched between Tibet and India, Bhutan is a dream destination. Dramatic scenery, winding mountain passes, snow-capped peaks, fluttering prayer flags and vibrant rhododendrons are the backdrop for a colourful culture steeped in religion and mythology.
Here in the Land of the Thunder Dragon, you can hike through stunning valleys and across rugged high passes, visit isolated villages and explore the countless dzongs (fortresses) and tiny Buddhist monasteries that dot the landscape. Then, visit the unforgettable "Tiger's Nest", the sacred Taktsang Monastery that clings dramatically to the side of a steep, forest-studded granite cliff.
Trek through the picturesque Paro Valley to the base of Chomolhari, Bhutan's second highest mountain, crossing glacial streams and observing the majestic peaks of the Himalaya through a frame of colourful rhododendron blooms. Or be one of the few people each year to join our challenging Bhutan Snowman Trek, ranked as one of the greatest treks in the Himalaya, as it weaves a path through the most remote region of Bhutan.
Explore local culture and shop for beautiful textiles and handicrafts in Thimpu, Bhutan's delightful capital; take in the dancing, cheering and drama of a traditional Bhutanese archery tournament; or watch local history and mythology come alive at Bumthang's Jambay Lakhang festival.
Whichever adventure you choose; you'll be captivated by the stunning landscapes, ancient culture and humble people of Bhutan.

Rugged adventure awaits in Bhutan
Bhutan Snowman ranks as one of the great treks of the Himalaya and is undertaken by only a handful of trekkers each year.
Visit the unforgettable Tiger's Nest
Taktsang Monastery is an unforgettably dramatic cliffside temple revered by Buddhists throughout the Himalaya.
Festivals in the Land of the Thunder Dragon
Bhutan is known for its traditional Buddhist culture and the Jambay Lakhang festival in Bumthang offers a picturesque location to encounter it first-hand.
Trek to the base of Chomolhari
Chomolhari, Bhutan's second highest mountain is revered by Buddhists and situated in a picturesque border region with Tibet in western Bhutan.

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in Bhutan, where we pioneered the 10-Pieces initiative. When you book one of our adventures you're supporting a program that is committed to safety and sustainability.
Innovative itineraries
We've been organising treks and tours in Bhutan for many years and our firsthand knowledge of the region is exceptional. From fascinating cultural tours through the Paro Valley and Bumthang, to the challenging Snowman Trek, widely recognised as one of the most challenging in the Himalaya, we specialise in showing you the highlights of this amazing land.
Ultimate value
Quality services at the best prices make our adventures great value for money. Our trip costs cover valuable inclusions like all meals while trekking and a dedicated local crew who will go the extra yard to ensure you have the experience of a lifetime. Our high level of support allows you to relax and focus on the incredible journey ahead of you.
Custom made adventures
With our team of local experts, we can customise your Bhutan experience to create the perfect holiday, whether it be extending your trek or spending additional time at a beautiful Bhutanese resort.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Litter collection
The 10 Pieces litter collection initiative is offered on the Chomolhari Base Camp Trek. Trekkers volunteer to collect 10 pieces of litter that they find on the trail each day, which is then disposed of responsibly. This is a simple and effective way to harness the collective power of tourists to keep wilderness trails clean and educate local communities about the negative impact of litter on their environment.
Animal welfare focus
We advocate for cruelty free animal encounters, encouraging travellers to follow the guidelines in our comprehensive Animal Welfare Code of Conduct as we seek to inform stakeholders about animal welfare matters.
Child safe tourism
Children working and living in tourist areas are especially vulnerable to physical, emotional and sexual abuse. We protect vulnerable children by adhering to our Child Protection Code of Conduct.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Wilderness camping
Enjoy fully supported camping in remote locations with our outstanding crew. While the campsite locations have been handpicked for their location, our commitment to responsible travel ensures our footprint is kept to a minimum.
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in good quality properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.

Leaders in the field
Andrew Lock
Andrew is an inspiring and immensely accomplished adventurer, and a wonderful communicator. In October 2009 he conquered Shishapangma, Tibet, becoming the first Australian to climb all 14 of the world's 8000m peaks - a feat only achieved by a select few worldwide. His achievements include multiple ascents of Everest, Lhotse & Manaslu, five Australian first ascents and establishment of many new routes.
Jo Haines
Jo has been exploring the hills since she was a teenager. As well as over 20 years adventuring in the New Zealand Southern Alps and climbing many of NZ's peaks, she has been fortunate to have spent considerable time in the Himalaya, on the rock walls in Australia and the USA and studying Emperor Penguins in Antarctica. Jo leads is a well respected, inspirational leader.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a Family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

Weather
Bhutan has an extremely diverse climate profile for a country of its size, owing to both its highly varied altitude and the influence of the north Indian monsoons.
The country can be divided into three broad physiographic zones: the cold alpine peaks and tundra of the Great Himalayas to the north; the temperate mountain valleys of Lesser Himalayas region in central Bhutan; and the subtropical foothills and floodplains of the Duars Plain in the south.
The capital of Thimphu, in central-west Bhutan, is the only place in Bhutan to experience temperature conditions. Winter temperatures in Thimphu usually range between 2°C (35°F) and 12°C (53°F) in January. In July, summer temperatures range from 13°C (55°F) to 19°C (66°F). The north of the country experiences extreme cold and generally dry conditions, and the south, extreme heat and significant rainfall.
Bhutan, like eastern Nepal, comes under the influence of the Indian monsoon from late May to mid-September and Bhutan receives more rain during the monsoon than other Himalayan regions (up to 5.5 metres a year).
The ideal time to visit Bhutan is either pre-monsoon from mid-March when the winter snow has begun to melt off the high passes, until the end of May; or post-monsoon, from October to mid-November.
Temperatures can vary considerably depending on your elevation but as a guideline, temperatures in Thimphu in April/May and October range from around 5°C (41°F) to around 25°C (77°F).
Time in Bhutan
Bhutan is UTC/GMT +6 hours
Language
Dzongkha (official); Sharchhopka; Lhotshamkha; Nepali and English widely spoken in more populated areas; 1% of population make up a variety of different ethnic groups each with own languages.
Currency
Ngultrum (Divided into chetrums)
US DOLLARS in cash is the main currency of exchange for tourists in Bhutan, with the AUD also as widely accepted, and internationally recognised credit card if you intend to shop.
For basic purchases eg drinks, snacks and small items US or AU cash will meet your needs in Bhutan.
Smaller denominations of clean, unmarked notes should be carried with you for ease of exchange.  Other currencies will be very difficult to change and perhaps impossible.
There are now some ATM’s in Bhutan however, these are not reliable, and often for the use of locals only.
Ngulstrum cannot be changed back when you depart nor used outside of Bhutan, so keep this in mind in your calculations.
International Dialing Code
+975
Electricity
Electricity in Bhutan is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The pin type varies but is most commonly types C, D and G. We recommend taking a universal adapter.
Visas
The cost of a Bhutan visa is US$40 per person and is payable to your World Expeditions Reservations consultant or travel agent. The visa process for Bhutan requires you to provide us with a scanned colour copy of your passport as we require your full passport details (full name as it appears in your passport, nationality, date of birth, passport number, date of issue and expiry date, and occupation) at least 30 days before your arrival in Bhutan. Following the processing of your visa clearance we will provide you with a clearance number to enable you to board the plane from your respective airport; you will then receive a stamped visa upon arrival at Paro airport. You must carry the visa approval letter with you and you will be required to show this when checking in for your DRUK flight into Paro.
NOTE:- Please be aware that it is very usual that we do not receive visa clearance numbers from the Bhutanese government until the week of travel, sometimes 2 or 3 days before departure date. If you have already left on your travels prior to receiving the visa clearance number, then the visa number will be emailed to you shortly before departure date. Please ensure that we have your correct and up-to-date email and contact details.
If you are doing more than one tour in Bhutan you may be required to extend your visa, this will be done for you while you are in Bhutan.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
