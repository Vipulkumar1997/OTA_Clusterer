Once the seat of a wealthy empire whose power and influence stretched throughout Arabia and as far as India and East Africa, Oman is an endlessly fascinating destination for lovers of rich culture, ancient history and diverse and dramatic landscapes.
Explore the resplendent Grand Mosque, labyrinthine souk and picturesque harbour of Muscat, Oman's historic capital; shop for frankincense in Salalah's Al-Husn souk, one of Arabia's oldest markets; and admire the stunning frescoes, carved doors, painted ceilings and secret passageways of Oman's architectural treasures.
Follow centuries-old paths through dramatic canyons, terraced farms and remote villages in the beautiful Hajar Mountains; and head out into the savagely beautiful Wahiba Sands desert to roller-coast by 4WD over massive sand dunes, visit a local Bedouin home and camp out beneath a canopy of stars.
Witness thousands of giant green sea turtles breeding on the gorgeous Arabian Sea beach of Ras Al Hadd; swim in the spectacular blue-green pools of Wadi Bani Khalid, a palm-studded desert oasis set among striking rocky landscapes; and discover sheer cliffs, rugged mountains and crystal-clear waters as you cruise the wild coastline of the Musandam Peninsula in a traditional wooden dhow.
Explore the ancient forts and Islamic architecture of historic walled towns; train your lens on impossibly photogenic scenes; and enjoy the warm hospitality of some the friendliest people you'll ever meet. Join us as we explore the cultural and natural riches of beautiful Oman!

Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
