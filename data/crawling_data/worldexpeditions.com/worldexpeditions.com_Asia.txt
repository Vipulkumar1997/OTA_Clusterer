Encompassing a staggering diversity of cultures, landscapes and experiences, Asia is a true choose-your-own-adventure destination. Everyone from beach bums and history buffs to serious outdoor adventurers will struggle to narrow down their dream itinerary.
Here you can marvel at imperial palaces and World Heritage Listed ruins, explore dramatic landscapes teeming with wildlife, and discover the complex histories of some of the world’s oldest and richest civilisations.
Summit majestic mountains, trek through rainforests and cycle down quiet country back roads. Kick back on white-sand beaches and jungle-clad islands, paddle down mighty rivers, and visit indigenous villages where cultural traditions remain largely intact.
Sample some of the world’s most exciting cuisines, trawl for treasures in ancient market squares and futuristic shopping malls, and train your camera lens on impossibly photogenic scenes. Enjoy the energy of Asia’s dynamic, modern cities and the laid-back pace of its stunning countryside in equal measure.
With a program of exciting journeys including walking, trekking, climbing, cycling, cruising, kayaking, diving and sailing holidays, each of our Asian adventures will give you an authentic introduction to this very special region.
Join us as we explore the highlights and lesser-visited gems of some of the world’s most intriguing places!

Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
Responsible Travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in Asia. When you book one of our adventures you’re supporting true sustainability in the protection of local communities, natural environments and wildlife.
World Firsts
We proudly pioneered the first commercial cycle trip in China (1978) and also in Vietnam (1990), where our inaugural group was met personally by the president on arrival. We also offered the first trek along Japan’s Omine Pilgrimage Trail, and our unique Footsteps of Mongolia itinerary has been awarded one of National Geographic’s Top 50 Tours of a Lifetime.
Innovative Multi Active Itineraries
We’re always looking to provide new and unique experiences to get you off the well-trodden tourist trails. One of the best ways to do that is by joining one of our superb multi activity Asian adventures. Whether you enjoy cycling, hiking, kayaking or all of the above, travelling under your own steam is an incredibly rewarding way to explore the hidden gems of Asia.
Great Value
Quality services at the best prices make our adventures great value for money. We include bikes on our cycle adventures with back up vehicles in case you want to hang up your gloves for the day, kayaks to enable you to paddle to scenic spots, many meals and atmospheric accommodation. We also include national park fees, domestic flights and sleeper trains on most of our adventures.
Expert Guides
Our guides in the field are the real key to our success. From Tim Cope, one of the world’s leading Mongolia experts, to Stony Xiao, who has been guiding our trips in China for more than 15 years—our expert guides are the difference between a good and an excellent adventure.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel
From China to Japan and Mongolia to Thailand, Asia is blessed with natural and cultural beauty. Despite this beauty, dense populations, emerging economies and the industrialisation of many Asian countries make this area of the world particularly susceptible to environmental and cultural deterioration. To minimise our impact on the natural environment we practice the '7 Principals of Leave No Trace', in addition to supporting local economies by employing guides and staff from local communities. Our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct and Child Welfare Code of Conduct ensure the well-being of animals and children encountered on our adventures.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric, and reliable and where we have seen a good track record with traveller satisfaction over many years.
Lodges
In various parts of Asia, we use quality lodges situated in natural environments. They offer comfortable, authentic accommodation that is clean, well maintained with good facilities and the best choice for the location that they are in.
Ryokans
Traditional style ryokans offer travellers a true taste of Japanese culture, sleeping on comfortable ‘futon’ bedding, laid out on tatami mat floors in wonderfully minimalistic rooms. Modified by sliding rice paper partitions, shoes are always left at the entrance upon entering these serene spaces.
Boats
Stay on board a traditional ‘junk’ boat, built entirely of aromatic wood with style and comfort that create the perfect balance of modern convenience and traditional Asian ambience. Cabins are twin share with private facilities. Features vary by vessel; however they may include a viewing platform, dining halls, panoramic windows and a library.
Camping
Enjoy fully supported camping with quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness settings, a dining tent and a toilet tent with a sit toilet. Our crew looks after all logistics including food preparation as we focus on keeping our impact on the environment to a minimum.
Homestays
During homestays, a local family opens their home providing wonderful insight into the local culture, cuisine and lifestyle. Expect simple but clean and comfortable communal lodgings with shared bathrooms and a warm reception from your hosts.
Ger camps
A ger is a circular felt tent used by the nomadic people of Mongolia and sometimes in Central Asia. Spacious with comfortable beds, our gers allow you to experience ‘life on the steppe’ as you interact with a local family. In the evening, candles illuminate the gers providing an atmospheric night time experience.

Leaders in the field
Bin Yan
Bin Yan was born in the far west of China in Urumqi Xinjiang, and graduated from Xinjiang University. He has worked as a guide since 2002 and is arguably one of the most experienced Silk Road guides in the business. He is very devoted to his work and his jokes always evoke peals of laughter from his travel companions.
Stony Xiao
Stony has been a favourite cycle guide for World Expeditions since 2001.  In his spare time he explores the most remote corners of China, often helping to pave the way for new adventures, making him an authority who is often published in China Travel magazines. Stony's great knowledge of religion and culture and his sense of fun make him well liked by our travellers.
Tim Cope
Tim’s adventures include a 14 month cycle trip from St Petersburg to Beijing and a three year Mongolia to Hungary traverse on horseback.  An accomplished writer and documentary maker, he is also a past recipient of the 'Australian Geographic Adventurer of the Year Award'.
Kyaw Thu
Kyaw Thu, with a great positive outlook and humour, has been guiding tourists from all over the world for over 15 years throughout Myanmar and is doing that still with as much enthusiasm as his first trip. Originally from a small village near Bago, Kyaw Thu moved to Shan State and worked in tourism in the early days that Myanmar was opening up. Kyaw Thu has a very wide knowledge of all kind of subjects, from history to daily life of country people.
Myint Myint Khaing
Myint Myint has been working as tour leader since 2006 and loves to lead to people from different countries around Myanmar to show them unique places, cultures and ways of life. She is passionate about Myanmar, which led to her becoming a guide: "I love its beauty, the peace of the pagodas, the safety and the lush green countryside and dense forests".
Nwe Ni Thein (Nina)
Nina is always in a happy mood, eager to show and explain the beauty of her country. With more than 10 years' experience she is very focused on making the whole trip seamless for her clients. Her wide general knowledge enables her to explain many facets and sights of Myanmar. Nina speaks fluent English and was born and grew up in Northern Shan State (Lashio).
Yuka Suzuki
Born in the Shizuoka prefecture, Yuka moved to Chicago in the US at age seven before returning in her teens to study Japanese culture at University. When travelling with Yuka, expect a fascinating insight into the historic and modern day lifestyles of Japan.
Hiroyuki Matsumura (Hiro)
Hiro was born in Tokyo and attended primary school in Moscow from age seven. Returning to Japan as a young adult he began an interest in paragliding amongst other things. Fun, intelligent and adept at explaining the intricate facets of Japanese culture, Hiro’s adventure guiding expertise is consistently praised by our travellers.
Nom Vannak Nom
Nom joined the tourism industry in 1999 after completing a Tourism degree in Siem Reap. His interest in adventure tourism propelled him into a career of taking travellers walking and cycling across many regions of Indochina. A great communicator, his genuine interest in nature and history make him an exceptional guide.
Vincent Zhu
Vincent is a native of Guangdong and a graduate of Guangdong University in Foreign Studies. Vincent’s expertise is in cycle tourism and he has led many bike trips all over China in the last decade. He is an inspirational guide who has also spent time cycling in the Himalaya. You are in good hands when out on the trails with Vincent.
Cathy Liu Cathy
Cathy grew up in Yunnan Province, China, and was drawn from an early age to cycling. Her easy going nature and passion for Yunnan’s myriad of peoples and cultures make her a favourite with locals and fellow travellers alike. After 10 years as one of China’s most experienced cycling leaders showing off her extensive knowledge of back roads, she remains happiest when on a bike!
Frank Guo
Frank was born in the year of the dragon, hence, in Chinese his nickname is ‘dragon’. A qualified lawyer, Frank evolved his career realising that he had a great interest in history, photography, overseas and domestic adventure travel. Frank is also a master of traditional Chinese massage which he learned from his father.
‘Joy’ Chittanong
Joy is one of our favourite guides for adventure tours in Laos. Joy lives in Luang Prabang, and has over seven years experience guiding a great variety of adventures from hiking and trekking to kayaking and biking. If you travel with this young, dynamic and super friendly man, you will always find the joys of exploring the stunning back roads, hills and rivers of Laos.
Do Chi Hung
Do was born in Ha Noi, graduating in Tourism from Ha Noi Open University. He has been guiding for more than 10 years in both touring and adventure trips. As part of the Ha Noi cycling team he has a great passion for biking tours as well as showing his fellow travellers the beauty of all of Vietnam – from the remote villages and mountainous areas to cities and beaches.
Su Zhi Wei
Our association with ‘Mr Su’ goes back more than two decades when we jointly pioneered the first commercial cycling trips in Southern China. Defying all the odds, Mr Su’s vision of providing active, off the beaten track experiences for our travellers to China has been a marvellous accomplishment in a tightly regulated industry. Our adventures in China continue to thrive as a result.
Laura Kirk
Originally from the United Kingdom, Laura brings a wealth of travel experience to the World Expeditions team having explored over 60 countries to date. Her adventures have included setting up community projects in Myanmar, studying Mandarin in China, trekking in Nepal, spending time in a remote Bedouin camp in Jordan and chasing the Big 5 through Tanzania. With a particular passion for all things Asia, Laura loves to share the best of this region with others.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.
