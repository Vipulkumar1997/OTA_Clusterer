Trip highlights
Savour the delicious and world renowned Peruvian cuisine
Choose ingredients at Cusco's central market & enjoy a cooking class
Walk an ancient Inca trail to the incredible ruins of Machu Picchu
Journey through the beautiful Sacred Valley
Discover the charms of Ollantaytambo and Arequipa
Peru is one of the world’s “hottest” food destinations. Many of the ingredients we take for granted today - corn, avocadoes, mushrooms, potatoes, countless tropical fruits - are native to this fascinating land with its magnificent mountains, glorious coastline and Amazonian jungle. But it’s also a country of many culinary influences - Japanese, Chinese, Spanish and more as well as a vibrant contemporary food culture. Peruvian chefs have taken the world by storm. This ‘“Food Lovers’ Peru” is your opportunity to find out what the fuss is all about. This culinary journey through Peru goes well beyond a standard touring itinerary. We keep the accent on day walks (there is no trekking) with plenty of time to appreciate the rich Andean culture and landscapes. Explore every aspect of this truly exciting gastronomic melting pot. The Incan treasures of Machu Picchu are also included, of course!

Although there is no commitment to extended walking on this journey we nonetheless want to keep the ‘accent on the active’. We therefore advise that any physical training you complete before undertaking the trip will be to good effect.

Day 1
Join Lima
You will be met at the airport and transferred to the hotel where you are free to rest in the hotel or just wander around Miraflores, the area of Lima where our hotel is located. Some of Lima's best galleries and shops and restaurants are found in this area. Founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535, Lima is the oldest capital in South America, with a superb combination of Spanish Colonial and 19th century European architecture. (NB - no meals provided today).
Overnight: Casa Andina Private Collection Miraflores
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Sightseeing in Lima
After a late breakfast, we will meet in the hotel lobby at 11.00am for a first group briefing. Afterwards we will drive (approx. 30 mins) to the Larco Herrera Museum for a tour to get a good overview of the history and culture of Peru. This is the very best museum in Lima and is the perfect start to our trip. We will then enjoy a late lunch at the excellent Café del Museo restaurant before heading back to the hotel to rest and relax.
Later this afternoon, we will set off from the hotel to walk (approx. 1 hour) along the famous ‘malecon’ that runs from Miraflores to Barranco - considered to be the city’s most romantic and bohemian area, being the home and working place of many of Peru's leading artists, musicians, designers and photographers. We aim to walk during the last hour of daylight to take advantage of the wonderful views as the sun sets over the Pacific. Once in Barranco we will go to one of its famous bars, “Ayahuasca”, for a 'hands-on’ cocktail session including the preparation of Peru’s most famous cocktail – the pisco sour!
The rest of the evening is free at leisure. Lima’s culinary reputation stretches far and wide, and doesn’t disappoint for those chasing a serious taste adventure. Your guide will be able to provide some local dinner suggestions (NB - dinner is at your own expense). 
Overnight: Casa Andina Private Collection Miraflores
Meals:
B,L
Day 3
Chef's visit to Lima market, fly to Arequipa
Today we visit one of the famous Lima markets (probably the Mercado de San Isidro) with one of the hotel chefs before heading to the airport (90 to 120 mins transfer) for 90 minute flight to Arequipa (2350m). Transfer (30 mins) to the hotel located in the historic centre of the old city. Arequipa is known as the white city because of the lovely pale volcanic rock that is used for many of its buildings. 
A short drive takes us to one of Arequipa’s famous outdoor garden restaurants - famous for their ‘chupe de camarones’ (shrimp soup) or the rocoto relleno or shuffle de rocoto (stuffed peppers). Afterwards we take a tour of the stunning 16th century Santa Catalina convent - one of the must-see attractions of Arequipa. The complex is a work of art designed applying Colonial architecture and built with white volcanic rock, also called Silla. Its walls enclose a complete religious world with interesting rooms, little plazas and streets. This evening is free to try one of Arequipa’s many excellent restaurants (NB - dinner is at your own expense).
Overnight: Casa Andina Private Collection Arequipa
Meals:
B,L
Day 4
Chef's visit to Arequipa market, cooking class
After breakfast, we will walk to Arequipa’s central market with one of Arequipa’s leading chefs for an introduction to some of the unique fruit found in this desert environment. There we will purchase the ingredients for our hands-on cooking course with our Arequipa chef during which we will prepare a very famous Peruvian dish - the ‘adobo’ (a pork dish prepared with ‘chicha’ corn beer). Then we will enjoy a light lunch, including the adobo and a light salad we will have prepared.
Afterwards we visit the Sillar Route and discover the impressive Añashuayco Quarries, located a few minutes from the city of Arequipa, where the white volcanic rock called sillar is extracted with which much of the city is built.  
In the late afternoon we visit the Museum of Andean Sanctuaries. Visitors can see exhibits that focus on Andes Mountain archaeology and history, such as the world-famous preserved mummy of ‘Ice Princess’ Juanita, a young Inca girl whose remains were only discovered in 1995. Juanita was sacrificed over 500 years ago as part of a Capac Cocha ceremony in which children were sacrificed to appease mountain gods. The child is thought to have been about 11 to 15 years old, and the body is so well-preserved that it has been touted numerous times as one of the world's top discoveries.
This evening's meal will be at the wonderful Zig Zag restaurant, famous for its meat dishes cooked on hot ‘volcanic’ rocks at the table. They also have superb ice-cream!
Overnight: Casa Andina Private Collection Arequipa
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 5
Fly to Cusco
After breakfast, we will transfer back to the airport for the flight (50 min) to Cusco (3400m). Transfer (30 min) to our hotel, which is set in the historic heart of this beautiful city. Cusco was once the capital of the Inca Empire and has perfect examples of stunning Inca stonework, and wonderful colonial palaces and churches. The rest of the day is free to rest and acclimatise to the altitude.
Evening group briefing and a light meal in one of the many good restaurants near the hotel. Your guide will be able to provide some local dinner suggestions (NB - dinner is at your own expense).
Overnight: Hilton Garden Inn Cusco
Meals:
B
Day 6
Sightseeing in Cusco, lunch at Pachapapa
In the morning we take a tour of the city of Cusco. Every alleyway we enter or corner we turn brings another surprise or enigma in the form of the superbly constructed Inca walls or the more architecturally extravagant colonial churches and palaces. The city, once capital of the extensive Inca Empire, has seen many changes since Francisco Pizarro's men took the city with such apparent ease in November 1533. We also take a short drive up to the huge ruins at Sacsayhuaman, spectacularly set above the city. Our vehicle then drops us at a high point above the city for a spectacular walk (2 to 3 hours)  down through the hills to one of the oldest parts of the city to the lovely colonial square of San Blas - known as the ‘artisans quarter’ of the old city. We will have lunch in the lovely patio of the famous Pachapapa restaurant. The rest of the afternoon and evening are free at leisure (NB - dinner is at your own expense).
Overnight: Hilton Garden Inn Cusco
Meals:
B,L
Day 7
Chef's visit to Cusco central market, cooking class, lunch at La Chicha
We will meet up with a local chef for a visit to Cusco’s central market to choose ingredients for the morning’s cooking classes where we will prepare classic highland dishes including Andean trout tiradito (trout ceviche) and Papa a la Huancaina (potatoes with a spicy peanut sauce).
We then head for lunch at La Chicha – one the many restaurants created by Peru’s most famous chef - Gaston Acurio. It has a large and varied menu that highlights the incredible range of products found in the high altitudes of the Andes mountain range that surrounds the city. After the evening group briefing, the rest of the evening is free (NB - dinner is at your own expense).
Overnight: Hilton Garden Inn Cusco
Meals:
B,L
Day 8
Journey to the Sacred Valley of the Incas
Today we drive (60 mins) up to the beautiful Chinchero Plateau (3600m) where we visit its main village, which is famous for its traditional Andean textiles. We visit one of the many village weaving cooperatives and associations for a fascinating demonstration of the traditional techniques used for many centuries to clean, spin and dye the wools of the andean camelids (alpaca and llama), and the traditional techniques used to weave their famous textiles. 
Afterwards we will drive (45 mins) across the great plateau with spectacular views of the peaks of the Urubamba and Huayanay Ranges to Moray to visit the impressive circular Inca terraces.
From Moray we walk (2 to 3 hours) down through the incredible salt pans at Maras – there are literally hundreds of glistening white slat pools that have been used since pre Inca times. Finally we end up down in the lovely and fertile Sacred Valley where we will eat our picnic lunches by the Urubamba River, before taking a short (20 mins) drive down to the quaint Inca village of Ollantaytambo (2800m) to spend 2 nights at the loveliest hotel in the valley – a small boutique hotel 10 minutes walk from the village. Dominated by two massive Inca ruins, Ollantaytambo (known to locals and visitors alike as Ollanta) is the best surviving example of Inca city planning with narrow cobblestone streets, that have been continuously inhabited since the 13th century.
The evening is free at leisure. We would recommend dinner in the excellent hotel dining room. Most of the ingredients are sourced from the terraces above the hotel where they have their own kitchen garden and livestock (NB - dinner is at your own expense).
Overnight: El Albergue
Meals:
B,L
Day 9
Day walks in the Sacred Valley
After a very early breakfast, we will drive (1 hour) up one of the most spectacular roads in the Andes to the Malaga Pass (4400m) from where we start our descent (3 hours) through the most lovely polylepis woodland with spectacular views of the great glaciers of Mount Veronica (5700m) and on down a magical glaciated valley with herds of llamas.
We then drive back to Ollantaytambo for a coffee and snack before walking up to its impressive fortress/citadel and the village itself to visit its famous preserved Inca and colonial streets and canals.
We also visit a traditional ‘chicha’ bar where the famous Andean corn beer is prepared using very traditional methods and its modern equivalent before driving a short distance to Peru’s most famous artisan brewery - Cerveceria Valle Sagrado - to try some of its huge range of beers using both traditional ingredients and newer locally sourced ingredients. 
After returning to our hotel we will visit their kitchen gardens to watch a demonstration of the preparation of a Andean classic – the ‘Pachamanca’ - where potatoes, beans and meat are cooked in a special oven that is buried in the earth. Taken from the Quechua words pacha meaning ‘earth’ and manka, meaning ‘pot’, a pachamanca is the Inca tradition of burying and baking foods found in the fields that surround a community. In reality, they’re not dissimilar from foods found on a modern barbecue, but are flavoured and served with a distinct Peruvian twist. We will relax in the hotel gardens until the Pachamanca is uncovered, and then enjoy a mid afternoon lunchtime feast with the earth-prepared dishes and wonderful salads using all their own products.
Then we are set for another treat with a short tour of the hotel distillery – the Destileria Andina - where they double distil the famous cane alcohol of the highlands to produce some superb liqueurs used for a large variety of cocktails; plus a demonstration of the preparation of some unique cocktails!
Remainder of the evening is free at leisure to enjoy the excellent cuisine of the hotel restaurant (NB - dinner is at your own expense).
Overnight: El Albergue
Meals:
B,L
Day 10
Train to KM 104 and complete trek, arrive at Aguas Calientes (6-7 hours walking)
After a very early breakfast we walk down to the train station for a spectacular journey (90 mins) to Km104. From here we commence our trek, ascending steeply, to join the last and perhaps most beautiful section of the fabulous “Classic Inca Trail” to Machu Picchu. The last part of the walk takes us through the famous Inti Punku (or Gateway of the Sun). Your first view of the ruins really does take your breath away! After a brief ‘first look’ at the ruins, we head down to our hotel in Aguas Calientes (25 mins bus) for a well deserved soak in the nearby hot springs (optional). Dinner will be in the excellent hotel restaurant.
Overnight: El Mapi by Inkaterra Hotel
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 11
Explore Machu Picchu, return to Cusco, dinner at Cicciolina
After an early breakfast, we make our way to the bus station for the ride (20 mins) up to Machu Picchu. The official guided tour of the sanctuary lasts 2 hours and at the end, we will explore this fascinating site further in the company of your leader, including taking a walk (1.5 hours) to the impressive old Inca drawbridge on another classic Inca trail. We return by bus to Aguas Calientes for a light lunch (at own expense) or shopping, and board the train to Ollantaytambo (1.5 hours). From this point, a private vehicle will drive us back to Cusco and you will be transferred to your hotel (1.5 hours drive). On arrival in Cusco we check in at the hotel, and then walk the short distance to the Chocolate Museum for a course on the preparation of chocolate using some of the award winning cacao beans found in the Cusco region. In the evening we have a farewell to the highlands dinner at the wonderful Cicciolina restaurant.
Overnight: Hilton Garden Inn Cusco
Meals:
B,D
Day 12
Fly to Lima, lunch at Cala, farewell dinner at Huaca Pucllana
We will drive to the airport for our flight to Lima. Upon arrival, transfer to the hotel. 
We then drive a short distance to one of Lima's most famous seafood restaurants - Cala - for lunch. Cala is one of the leading innovators of new seafood cuisine in Lima, with a spectacular ocean view.
Our last afternoon in Lima is free for exploring and shopping. This evening, we will drive to one of Peru’s top restaurants that has a spectacular view of Pre-Inca ruins – “Huaca Pucllana”. We spend our last evening together enjoying a remarkable tasting menu with unique dishes - a fitting finale to this extraordinary food adventure! 
Overnight: Casa Andina Private Collection Miraflores
