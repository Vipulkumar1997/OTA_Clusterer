With its rugged natural beauty, ancient ruins and architecture, rich history and vibrant culture, Peru is an unforgettable destination.
From deep within the Peruvian Andes rises Machu Picchu, the most spectacular legacy of the Inca Empire. Enshrouded in clouds and perched surreally among the verdant slopes of the Andes, the grand temples and terraces of Machu Picchu are one of the most awe-inspiring sights on Earth.
There's the striking city of Cusco, with its marriage of ancient Inca and Spanish colonial architecture; the vibrant capital of Lima, with its museums, galleries and buzzing food scene; the bustling markets overflowing with vivid textiles and handicrafts.
We trek and cycle among the sacred valleys, snowcapped peaks and ancient ruins of the Andes, and journey across the solitary high plains of the Altiplano; we cruise, raft and canoe our way through the lush jungles and twisting tributaries of the vast Amazon River basin; we tour vibrant cities and set our lenses on diverse and dramatic landscapes, always engaging with the people, culture and history of this incredible country.
No matter your age or inclination, World Expeditions has an exciting adventure ready to take you deep into the heart of Peru.

Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
Whether you are trekking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, canoeing the waterways of the Amazon Rainforest, savouring the cuisines of Lima and Cusco or experiencing a traditional homestay on Lake Titicaca, our diverse range of active itineraries encapsulate the cultural heart of Peru. Our adventures take you off the beaten path to provide realistic insight into this corner of the world and the ways that its incredible geographic and cultural diversities fit together.
Ultimate value
Our trips offer exceptional value for money featuring good quality, centrally located hotels and private transportation. We aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, entrance and permit fees, transfers and gear hire.
Experienced local guides
Our guides in the field are the real keys to our success, demonstrating a wealth of local knowledge and passion that they are eager to share with you. From climber Simon Yates of 'Touching the Void' to Javier Bello, one of the most experienced guides in the Andes, our team of experts ensure you receive the very best service as you gain insight into the unique Peruvian culture.
World firsts
We proudly pioneered the first commercial Inca Rivers Trek in Peru in 2004, showcasing a remote trail to the north of Machu Picchu. As a result, our knowledge of the region and logistics is second to none, ensuring your adventure is unforgettable.
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in Peru. When you book one of our adventures you're supporting true sustainability in the protection of local communities, natural environments and wildlife.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Litter collection
The 10 Pieces litter collection initiative, where travellers collect 10 pieces of plastic or paper litter on the trail each day, is offered on all our Peru treks. This simple yet effective initative harnesses the collective power of tourists to keep wilderness trails clean and to educate local communities about the negative impact of litter on their environment and tourism economy.
7 Principals of Leave No Trace
We use campsites that are not on cultivated land, are not near sources of drinking water and are always on durable, well drained surfaces. All waste is carried out, and campfires are not lit on our treks, with the exception of village visits where sheep or llama droppings are used as a fuel source or an underground stone oven is used.
Porter welfare policies
Porters receive the same access to medical service as clients. We provide three meals per day, as well as gas stoves for cooking, and are one of five companies (among almost 200) that pay the highest wages. All porters can access interest free long-term loans from us and are provided with basic life and accident insurance, full coverage of medical costs that they incur, transport to and from the trek's start and finish, sleeping tents, sleeping pads and bags, footwear, warm jackets and raingear.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Lodges
Our lodges provide comfortable accommodation that is well maintained and with good facilities.
Homestays
Gain wonderful insight into the local culture during a homestay, a style of accommodation where a local family opens their home to you.
Camping
Enjoy our fully supported camping in quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.

Leaders in the field
Andreas Holland
Andreas has always made our South America programs special. He has lived in South America for over 30 years, much of this time in Peru. His special knowledge of the mountains and passion for supporting local communities is evident in our program in Peru and Bolivia. Each year Andreas travels to different parts of the world to impart his vast knowledge, so stay tuned, he may be in your city soon!
Javier Bello
Javier is one of the most experienced guides in the Andes having worked as a professional trek and tour guide for more than 30 years. He specialises in our longer high altitude treks of which his favourite is the superb Huayhuash Circuit, Peru. His knowledge of the mountain trails is simply astounding. That, combined with his ability to recount the cultural and natural history of Peru, makes him the perfect guide for Peru adventures.
Rene Flores
Rene is a graduate of Cusco University and started guiding our groups in Peru 15 years ago. He is trilingual in English, Spanish and German. Rene is also an expert in traditional Andean medicines and has given specialist classes on the subject in the USA. Rene's deep interest in Andean cultural and musical traditions makes him a truly fascinating guide, bringing a deeper understanding of the region for his travellers. His favourite trek is the high Inca Trail.
Josmar Valer
Josmar, known by friends and travellers as 'Chema', has endless energy and great humour, providing his groups with an unforgettable Andes experience. His enthusiasm and knowledge of the environment is unrivalled, built over 15 years' guiding. He is trilingual in English, Spanish and Quechua. He loves any trek that's off the beaten track, of which World Expeditions has many.
Jose Ugarte
Jose has been leading tours and treks for more than 20 years and if he hadn't become a guide would have ended up a botanist or biologist in the Amazon. We're happy he chose the former as he is now recognised as one of Cusco's best guides with great humour and endless knowledge. His favourite trips involve both trekking and expeditions into the rainforest.
Admil Arce
Admil studied Andean Anthropology and Archaeology before becoming a guide in 2004. He is a great companion for anyone wanting to travel through the mountains and valleys of Southern Peru with his knowledge of local customs and both modern and pre Inca history. Like many guides he loves the Inca Trail despite having walked it so many times over the years!
Ernestina 'Tina' Valeriano
Ernestina has been working as a professional guide for five years but everyone who meets her thinks she must have been born one! Born in Cusco and brought up speaking 'Quechua' - the language of the Incas - Tina has a profound knowledge and connection with the Andes and her personality makes her a real favourite not just with the clients but will all the trekking and touring staff.
Simon Yates
Simon has been at the very forefront of mountaineering for almost two decades with first ascents in the Andes, Himalaya and Karakoram. Best known as the climbing partner to Joe Simpson in Touching the Void, Simon has developed a strong reputation as an engaging expedition leader.
Victor Olarte
Victor has been one of the managers and is the driving force of the World Expeditions office in Cusco for more than 25 years and has a superb knowledge of the complexities of adventure travel. He really was one of the pioneers in Cusco and remains a well respected member of the tourism community. There is no problem that Victor cannot solve having met thousands of our clients during their time in the highlands of Peru.
Joana Miranda
Joana is one of our youngest guides and is a university graduate of Archaeology and Andean Mythology. She was born in the highlands of Cusco and speaks Quechua, English, Spanish and Portuguese. Joana is happiest leading our longer treks, though still feels that the classic high Inca Trail is the most beautiful Andes short trek.
Lily Caceres
Lily is the operations manager of the World Expeditions Cusco office and has overseen all our tours and treks for more than two decades. She has real attention to detail and makes sure that every little detail is carefully organised by our large team of professional guides and camp-staff in the Andes. Come rain or shine Lily will have it covered!
Greg Lee
There's nothing Greg enjoys more than setting out in search of adventure in Latin America. This passion shines through in the breadth of unique adventures reflected in the fantastic line-up of trips on offer. Greg is drawn to the beauty of this region's scenery, fascinating history, varied cultures and most of all, its people.
Sarah Higgins
Sarah joined World Expeditions in 2006 and became operations manager in 2010. South America is her second home and she has enjoyed many adventures in its beautiful landscapes. Her travels include 'across the circle' into Antarctica, among many others. When Sarah is not planning itineraries you'll find her out on the 'rock' and in the Australian bush with her avid interest in rock climbing and bushwalking.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

Weather
The main trekking season in Peru lasts from late April - mid October.  This is the dry but 'cold' period, with the best mountain views and all passes open.
The Costa dry coastal desert region experiences mild average daily temperatures ranging from 19 °C (66 °F) in winter to 22 °C (72 °F) in summer. Rain-bearing winds from the Amazon Basin are blocked by the Andes mountain system, contributing to the west coast of South America having one of the driest climates on Earth. Despite this, coastal fogs (garúa) provide some areas of the Costa with sufficient moisture to support some vegetation. These fogs cloak the central and southern beaches from April - early December, but coastal cities can be visited all year regardless, and the northern beaches will keep sun-worshippers happy year-round.
Variance in latitude, elevation and local winds all factor into the wide range of climates experienced in the central Sierra/Andean mountain region. Average temperatures in the Sierra vary little between seasons, but there is dramatic daily variance. While the average daily temp may only vary a few °C between January and July, the diurnal (daily) temp range is often huge: you can expect daytime temperatures in the highlands to be in the range of 10-25 °C (50-77 °F), falling as low as -10 °C (14 °F) at night.
Higher elevations in the Sierra receive snow falls, with many peaks having permanent snow caps. In general, temperatures decrease as elevation increases, and rainfall decreases from north to south and from east to west. November – March brings the rainy season to the Sierra highlands, with the heaviest precipitation in the north and along the eastern flanks of the Andes, facing the Amazon Basin. Some trek routes do not operate at these times due to possible wet conditions on the passes, but the heavy rain periods do not usually arrive until late January.
The eastern Amazonia region is characterised by wet tropical conditions. High rainfall is common throughout the year, although somewhat heavier from December - March. As in the Sierra region, there is little variance in seasonal average temperature but relatively large daily temperature variation, with daily temperatures often ranging from lows of 15 °C (60s°F) to highs of mid-30s °C (mid-90s °F). Be prepared to shelter from rain pretty much all year, but be consoled by the fact that downpours rarely last more than a few hours.
Time in Peru
Peru is -5 hours behind UTC/GMT
Language
Peru is a country of great linguistic diversity. Spanish is the main official language, spoken by 84.1% of the population; Quechua is the second official language spoken by 13%; followed by the third official language of Aymara at 1.7%; then Ashaninka 0.3%; other native languages (including a large number of minor Amazonian languages) 0.7%; and Other 0.2%. Some English (and other European languages) is spoken in cities and major tourist areas, but attempts to speak basic Spanish will be well received.
Currency
Nuevo Sol (divided into céntimos/cents)
US dollars are easily changed.
Credit cards and ATM are available in most large cities and hotels, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
International Dialing Code
+51
Electricity
Electricity in Peru is 220 Volts, at 60 hertz. The most common pin types are A. (2 flat prong) or type C. (2 round prong).
Visas
A visa is exempt for passport holders from the following countries visiting Peru for short term tourism purposes:
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
For all other nationalities and longer stays please contact the relevant embassy.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
