Whether you’re a veteran rock climber or a newbie busting to develop your skills, our rock climbing adventures are truly incredible experiences. With expert guides taking you up, down and around some of the most stunning rock faces around the world, you’ll soon appreciate the beautiful natural surrounds of a specific location and its local climbing community. It will be understood that most participants will have rock climbing experience of varying levels, and our experts will always be on site to provide encouragement and tuition where needed.
The hands-on workshop style environment of our rock climbing trips demonstrate climbing techniques (precise footwork, body positioning, breathing, resting and recovering, route reading and red pointing tactics), so you can make the most from your trip and come back with a few new skills to boot! The climbing locations have been carefully selected based on their merits as top climbing destinations around the world. Needless to say, one rock climbing trip with World Expeditions will leave you hooked.

Essential information
Trip Grading
Suggested Training
Inclusions & Equipment
1
Discovery & Cruising
These are our least demanding trips. These journeys of discovery and cruises involve little or no extended activity. The itinerary may take place in remote areas (with basic facilities) and may involve long travel days on various types of transport. Sightseeing may be conducted on foot and all participants should be capable of carrying their own luggage from vehicle to hotel rooms. These adventures do not go above 2500m and rarely involve camping.
2
Adventure Touring
These adventure tours sometimes involve travel at high altitude (rarely exceeding 4000m, except on certain trips in Tibet, Peru and India) and may visit remote areas of the world where facilities are often basic. Many of these trips sometimes involve some camping or basic lodging. These adventure tours will often involve long journeys and rough roads. Sightseeing and optional day walks are often included and these days may involve up to 5 hours of physical activity.
3
Intoductory
Up to 5 or 6 hours a day at a slow but steady pace
4
Introductory to Moderate
Introductory walks with several moderate stages
5
Moderate
Up to 5-7 hours a day at a steady pace. Treks will involve carrying a day pack and trail conditions will vary between well-defined to rough trails



6
Moderate to Challenging
Moderate walks with challenging stages
7
Challenging
Often in remote areas in variable, adverse weather conditions, for up to 8 to 10 hours+ a day, possibly more. Be prepared to carry a daypack weighing up to 8 kgs, or in some cases a full pack weighing up to 20kg
1
Discovery & Cruising
These journeys of discovery and cruises are suitable for people with a basic level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: Once or twice a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour, for at least 2-3 months prior to departure.
2
Adventure Touring
To enjoy these adventures we suggest you have a reasonable level of fitness and health, a moderately active lifestyle and a positive attitude.
Suggested preparation: Two or three times a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour or more, for at least 3 months prior to departure.
3
Intoductory
Our introductory trips are not ‘easy’ trips and you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 30 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week, starting at least two to three months before departure. Hill or stair walking with a 5-7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness. We also advise doing some walking in variable weather conditions.
4
Introductory to Moderate
On these adventures you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45 minutes of aerobic type exercise three times a week, from a minimum of three months period to your departure. Hill or stair walking with a 7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness. We also advise doing some walking in variable weather conditions.
5
Moderate
These adventures require a good level of fitness and health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45-60 minutes of aerobic type exercise, three to four times a week. Hill or stair walking with a 7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness. We also advise doing some walking in variable weather conditions.



6
Moderate to Challenging
These adventures require a good level of fitness and excellent health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend one hour of aerobic type exercise, four times a week. Hill or stair walking with a 7kg daypack is also highly recommended at least once a week for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness. We also advise doing some walking in variable weather conditions.
7
Challenging
On these challenging adventures, you will need an excellent level of fitness. Some treks may require you to carry a full pack weighing up to 20kg.
Suggested preparation: We suggest up to one hour of strenuous exercise at least four days a week, interspersed with a relatively demanding bushwalk at the weekend. The best exercise for trekking is bushwalking involving relatively steep ascents and descents. Hill walking with a 7kg pack in variable weather conditions is a must.  Multi day walks are ideal preparation for our challenging adventures.
Inclusions & Equipment
The exact inclusions and equipment for each of our adventures is listed once you've found the trip you want. Our trips are generally more inclusive than others in the market place in line with our philosophy of minimising 'extra payments' displayed outside of the main trip price as well as out of pocket expenses once you reach your destination.
