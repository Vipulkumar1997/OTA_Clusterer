Sharing one of the seven natural wonders of the world and blessed with an abundance of wildlife, water and vast open spaces, Zambia offers a plethora of exciting experiences for visitors.
Without question, a highlight of any trip to southern Africa is a visit to the spectacular Victoria Falls. Straddling the Zambezi River between Zambia and Zimbabwe, with twice the width and depth of Niagara Falls, this legendary waterfall has earned itself the local name of Mosi-oa-Tunya- "The Smoke That Thunders".
Admire this awe-inspiring waterfall in action, and discover why this is Africa's adrenalin sports capital with a thrilling bungy jump, white water raft or scenic flight over the falls.
Canoe along the Lower Zambezi River, paddling past secluded villages, vibrant wildlife and magnificent scenery as you make your way to our camp on the banks of this majestic river.
Experience exhilarating walking safaris and 4WD game drives in South Luangwa National Park, one of Africa's finest wildlife sanctuaries, or head to the remote pristine wilderness of the Liuwa Plains to witness a summer wildebeest migration to rival the Serengeti.
Take a look at our unique program of itineraries through southern Africa and start planning your Zambian adventure today!

Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
Our Zambia adventures offer a myriad of options for those looking for an active or relaxing holiday, from visiting Victoria Falls and wild camping along the Zambezi River to spotting wildlife on a game walk in South Luangwa and embarking on an idyllic sunset cruise.
Ultimate value
Featuring comfortable accommodation or campsites, helpful camping assistants and private vehicles, our Zambia adventures offer fantastic value for money. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the trip cost such as most meals, game drives and walks, river excursions and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
Our guides are passionate about Zambia and its natural wonders and will strive to ensure that you have an enjoyable and seamless experience.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Deforestation alleviation
When cooking, we use gas to avoid depleting limited wood resources. We take all waste out and use responsible waste disposal facilities.
Plastic bottle reduction
To reduce the amount of plastic water bottles purchased by travelers our vehicles have a tank of clean drinking water that is filled up along the journey.
Community interaction
At local markets we encourage travellers to barter (gently and in good humor) with the local people while remaining mindful that this is their livelihood.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Safari lodges
In game parks, national parks and rural locations we use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area. Some may have extra facilities such as a swimming pool or private balcony.
Permanent safari camps
Like a tented hotel room, this is the perfect way to experience the African wilderness. We use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.

Leaders in the field
Phumuzile Ncube
Phumuzile was born in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, and moved to South Africa to work in the hospitality industry and learn more about his passion for wildlife and nature. His love of the local cultures, beauty of nature and sense of humour make Phumuzile an excellent guide for Southern African safaris. In his spare time, he loves supporting local football.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Currency
Zambian Kwacha
Visa & Mastercard are accepted in major cities and tourist centres such as Livingstone. Outside these areas it is difficult to use credit cards.  Note that merchant fees can be high on credit card purchases. Amex and Diners cards are very rarely accepted.
Do not rely on automatic teller machines (ATM’s) however some may be available in major towns.
We recommend that you travel with USD cash (printed after 2006 and in denominations smaller than $100 bills) or EUR cash. Make sure your cash notes are clean and undamaged as many banks and change bureau will not accept dirty, damaged or torn notes. It is useful to bring along some small denomination notes as you can pay for curios, drinks and restaurant meals in USD or EUR if you run out of local currency.
International Dialing Code
+260
Electricity
Electricity in Zambia is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin types are D (3 pin round) and G (UK – 3 prong).
Visas
Visas are required for Zambia for all the following nationalities. These visa fees are payable at the border.
American visa fees US$ 50 single entry
British visa fees GBP 75 single entry
Canadian visa fees US$ 50 single entry
All other nationalities liable for visa fees
including Australians and New Zealanders
US$ 50 single entry
US$ 80 double entry
Visit www.zambiaembassy.org for up to date info
A common tourist visa was recently introduced for Zambia and Zimbabwe known as the (KAZA) UNIVISA. The US$50 Univisa (recommend to pay in cash) is valid for 30 days and allows the bearer to enter both Zambia and Zimbabwe. So if you think you will cross into Zambia even for a short period from Zimbabwe (eg. to look at Victoria Falls from that side), then it is better to purchase the Univisa. Full details including ports of entry issuing the Univisa, the eligible countries and more are available here: here <http://www.kazavisa.info/index.php/about/zambia-zimbabwe-visa-info> . Keep in mind that if you are visiting Botswana for longer than a day trip, you will need to get a single entry visa (for Zambia or Zimbabwe depending on where you land) or a Univisa (if you plan to visit both Zambia and Zimbabwe), then visit Botswana and on return, will need to purchase another single entry visa or Univisa. In other words – if you have a Univisa but leave the joint Zambia/Zimbabwe area, you will have to buy a new visa on re-arrival.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Visa requirements do change regularly so we suggest you check with your travel agent or reservations consultant.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
