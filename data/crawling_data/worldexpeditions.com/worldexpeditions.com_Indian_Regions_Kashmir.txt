Sitting high in India’s extreme north is the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Dominated by fertile valleys and flanked by the rugged snowcapped spines of the Pir Panjal range and Western Himalaya, this is a remote wilderness home to the mystical Buddhist former kingdom of Ladakh and the romantic alpine region of Kashmir.
Our unique Kashmir Ladakh Adventure will see you discover unique Kashmiri culture, cuisine and history with a luxurious houseboat stay on the mirror-like waters of Srinagar’s Nagin Lake.
Travel to Anchar Lake and the famous Moghul Gardens by shikara (traditional Kashmiri gondola), explore ancient monasteries and monuments and trawl through Srinagar’s stunning array of Kashmiri carpets, fabrics and handicrafts.
Join us as we explore the rich cultures and stunning landscapes of Kashmir!

Responsible travel

Cultural sensitivity
Positive interactions are achieved when the traveller is aware of the cultural sensitivities of the community they are visiting. Our guides are always ready to inform travellers about the correct etiquette, including matters of appropriate clothing and actions when entering a temple.
Support of local economies
We ensure that the landowners whose fields we use for camping are paid fairly for the use of their land and we encourage travellers to shop at handicraft shops within the small villages we pass through.
Animal welfare focus
We adhere to our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct in the Indian Himalaya. We engage the services of reputable and registered horsemen and yak contractors, insisting that all animals are in good health before carrying loads and that the loads are appropriate for the animal.

Hindi is India’s most widely spoken and official language, and the primary language of 41% of the population. Along with Hindi are another 22 different official/recognised languages, plus hundreds of other major and minor languages and regional variations/dialects
English is an “associate official language” and India’s most common lingua franca, and is widely spoken in business, law, politics, education and tourism.

Currency

For stays of less than 30 days, travellers can apply for an ETA online (US$60) at the official website https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/tvoa.html, no less than five days and no more than 30 days before the date of travel.
At present other nationalities including the UK and Canada and those clients regardless of nationality visiting Sikkim and other restricted areas must have an Indian visa stamp in their passport prior to arrival in India.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
