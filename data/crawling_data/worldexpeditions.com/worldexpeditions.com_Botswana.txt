Botswana is an unforgettable travel destination blessed with abundant wildlife, ancient cultures and a staggering diversity of landscapes. Much of the country is vast wilderness, untouched and untamed by modern infrastructure, making it a destination that requires a little extra time and planning, but one that is incredibly rewarding.
Head to the magnificent Moremi Game Reserve to get close to Africa's iconic Big 5 game animals and camp overnight surrounded by the sounds of the wild, fully experiencing the beauty and diversity of this magnificent environment.
Don't miss the lush wetlands of the Okavango Delta, one of the world's richest bird and wildlife watching spots, where you can encounter abundant wildlife while being poled along gently in a traditional mokoro dugout canoe through the spectacular tributaries of the Okavango.
Marvel at the stark, otherworldly beauty of the sandy plains, dunes and pans of the vast Kalahari Desert, and discover the ancient history, rich culture and artistic traditions of the San people. Then, venture north to the vast Chobe National Park to see huge herds of African elephants on an early morning game drive, and watch hippos, elephants and other iconic wildlife at play as you take an unforgettable cruise down the Chobe River at sunset.
Our unique itineraries are designed to get you deep into the heart of this unspoiled wilderness - so start planning your Botswana adventure today!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of every program we offer in Botswana. Our adventures provide a true wilderness experience by viewing wildlife in their natural habitat and supporting the protection of diverse environments and local communities.
Authentic experiences
Our Botswana adventures are packed with unique elements that give you real insight to this part of the world. From visiting the best wilderness areas to camping under the stars and spotting wildlife during a safari, there are many options to satisfy the keenest wildlife and cultural enthusiast.
Ultimate value
Botswana is an expensive country following the principle of low volume and high cost. Our adventures offer the ultimate value for money by providing top quality service and atmospheric accommodation. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, transfers, excursions, game drives, permits and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
Our expert guides are the real key to our success. From spotting wildlife and natural signs during a walking adventure to cooking up a feast on the campfire, our guides are passionate about sharing the wonders of their country and culture to make your Botswana experience special.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Employment of local guides
Our guides are all professional Botswana safari guides, equipped with an intimate knowledge of their cultural and natural environment and driven to conserve and preserve.
Animal welfare focus
We adhere to our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct in Botswana. We strongly discourage contact with lions through lion cub petting and walking with lion activities, as well as elephant back rides.
Sustainable development
We support the villages in the vicinity of our camps and safaris, implementing projects that improve their access to education and health.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Safari lodges
In game parks, national parks and rural locations we use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area. Some may have extra facilities such as a swimming pool or private balcony.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Permanent safari camps
Like a tented hotel room, this is the perfect way to experience the African wilderness. We use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Kembo Sithole
Starting life as a bank teller in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, Kembo saw the light and began his safari career in Hwange National Park in 1998. Since then he has grown to become one of our most popular Southern African guides. He has vast knowledge of fauna and flora and this with his excellent manner with people ensures he brings that something extra to our guests' safari experience.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Weather
Botswana is classed as semiarid, with hot summers and warm winters, and only a brief wet season.
Summer (Oct to Mar) begins with a windy season (Aug to mid Oct) carrying dusts from the Kalahari, followed by a long dry hot season, punctuated by the infrequent subtropical downpours of the country’s only wet season (Dec to Mar).
Average daily temperatures in summer rise to about 34°C (93°F) in the warmest parts of the country, the north and southwest.
Winter (Apr to Sep) is marked by sunny, cloudless skies and dry, temperate weather. Daytime temperatures are warm to mild, but the absence of cloud cover means nighttime and early morning temperatures drop significantly, with frosts being common. Winter is generally considered the best time to visit in terms of both favourable weather and game viewing.
During the dry and early rainy seasons, all but four of Botswana’s rivers (Chobe, Limpopo, Okavango and Boteti) cease to flow.
Botswana’s semiarid climate is prone to cyclic droughts, sometimes lasting up to six years and wiping out harvests and reducing livestock to starvation.
Time in Botswana
Botswana is +2 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Tswana (aka Setswana, Sechuana) 78.2%, Kalanga 7.9%, Sekgalagadi 2.8%, English (official) 2.1%, Other 8.6%
Currency
Pula (divided into thebe)
Botswana banks accept US Dollars, Pound Sterling, Euro and South African Rand notes only.
Travel with US Dollar cash, preferably in small denominations. Pre-1996 notes are not accepted due to the high number of counterfeits in circulation.
The only ATMs in Botswana are in the major urban centres, where banks can also be found.
Visa and MasterCard are usually accepted throughout Botswana. American Express and Diners Club are not accepted. All outlets charge a significant premium for using a card so expect to pay an additional 5% to 10%.
International Dialing Code
+267
Electricity
Electricity in Botswana is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The pin types used are D and G.
Visas
Visas for Botswana are exempt for passport holders from the following countries:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
A US$30 Botswanan Government tourism levy, valid for thirty days, is payable by all foreign tourists at border posts and airports on arrival. This can be paid by cash (recommended), credit and debit card.
Regulations have been implemented for people travelling with children to/from Botswana. Anyone who is a minor (less than 18 years) must produce an original birth certificate in addition to a valid passport. If the child is not travelling with both parents named on their birth certificate a statutory declaration or affidavit made by the parent/s who are not accompanying the child, declaring that they give consent for the accompanying adult/s to travel with the child. This should be done and signed before a Justice of Peace. If the new requirements are not met, then boarding can be denied by any airline flying to/from Botswana, or travellers may be turned back at the border. If this applies to you, please make enquiries with your respective Botswana consulate/mission to confirm, as the conditions frequently change. We can assist with contact details of the relevant authorities if required.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
