Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
Responsible Travel practice is at the heart of every program we offer in Africa. When you book one of our adventures you’re supporting true sustainability in the protection of local communities, natural environments and wildlife.
World Firsts
We proudly pioneered the first commercial treks of Mount Kilimanjaro‘s Remote Northern Circuit and Shira Routes and have developed new trekking routes in the Ruwenzori, High Atlas and Simien Mountains. Our Madagascar Adventure also gets plenty of attention for its unique itinerary.
Innovative Itineraries
Africa is a diverse and contrasting continent, encompassed by our broad and exciting program of active, touring and safari itineraries. We constantly strive to highlight the unique—touring Madagascar’s iconic sights but also exploring its lesser know national parks, spotting wildlife from dugout canoes in the Okavango Delta, or traversing the little-used mountain trails of Mount Kenya.
Great Value
Quality services at the best prices make our adventures great value for money. Having essential items like meals, sightseeing and national park fees included in the trip cost allows you to better budget for your big adventure and eliminates the risk of having to carry large sums of money around with you on your journey.
Expert Guides
Africa is a complex continent that requires guides with vast knowledge of local landscapes, flora and fauna, as well as rich local cultures. Our line up of guides is second-to-none; passionate individuals who will truly enhance your African experience.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel
On a continent rich in wildlife and cultural diversity that is famed for its spectacular landscapes, the importance of sustainable travel is high. While we aim to minimise our impact on the natural environment by practicing the '7 Principals of Leave No Trace', our adventures support local economies by employing guides and staff from local communities. Our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct, Child Welfare Code of Conduct and Porter Welfare Policy ensure the well-being of animals and children we encounter, as well as the porters we employ on Mount Kilimanjaro, Mount Meru, Mount Kenya and in the Ruwenzori Mountains.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in 3-4 star properties that are generally centrally located, atmospheric and reliable and where we have seen a good track record with traveller satisfaction over many years. At times, accommodation will be chalet style with a bedroom and bathroom attached to a lounge area. Very occasionally, hotels may have shared bathroom facilities.
Safari lodges
In game parks, national parks and rural locations we use properties that reflect the character of the area. They are generally one storey high and will be a collection of individual bungalows or a series of adjoining rooms, based around a central main dining/lounge area.
Luxury safari lodges
Luxury lodges differ to standard safari lodges in that they feature extra facilities such as swimming pools, satellite TVs or rooms with private balconies. You will find this type of accommodation in East Africa at Serene Lodges and at boutique, 4-5 star lodges in Southern Africa.
Riads
Found in Morocco, a riad is a traditional house often located in the ancient medina (walled city) and usually includes an internal courtyard with a garden or water feature. Generally all rooms are a different shape and size, adding to the character. Riads range from elaborate traditional tiled decor to ultra modern furnishings.
Homestays
A homestay describes any stay with a local family where we share their current home. Sleeping arrangements may be dormitory style and bathroom facilities will generally be shared. The standard is often basic but the experience is unbeatable.
Permanent safari camps
The perfect way to experience Africa wilderness; think of this as a tented hotel. Rooms are individual tents with built-in floors, doors and windows and include an en suite bathroom. Tents are usually placed on a solid structure and may also be sheltered under a solid roof. Guest tents are generally clustered around a main central dining/lounge area and power is either solar or by generator.
Luxury permanent safari camps
A luxury permanent safari camp differs to a standard permanent safari camp in that they feature extra facilities such as swimming pools, satellite TVs or rooms with private balconies; all with premium views.
Bedouin camps
Found in desert regions in North Africa and the Middle East, these are permanent safari camps using traditional Bedouin tents and decor. Bathroom facilities may be basic as water is scarce in the desert. Power is limited to specific hours of the day and is usually by generator when available. Kerosene lanterns or candles provide night time lighting, adding to the ambience.
Camping
Camping refers to any accommodation using mobile tents, ranging from large dome tents to small trekking tents. The local camp crew erects the tents or, on a limited participation safari, guests are expected to assist with this process. Group camping equipment (dining tent, kitchen tent, toilet tent) is supplied. Bathroom facilities are shared, and on rare occasions, bush toileting may be required.
Mountain huts
Mountain huts can be considered camping in a basic shelter. These generally consist of dormitory rooms with shared bathroom facilities and in the majority of cases are not exclusive to World Expeditions guests. Some mountain huts have cooking facilities that will be used by your crew; others have separate shelters for this.

Leaders in the field
Elias Berehe
Elias has a degree in Education and previously worked as a teacher, however his passion for travel and learning new things saw him change careers and attain his tour guide diploma six years ago. He has a friendly and sensitive nature and enjoys sharing his extensive knowledge of the cultural, social and historical gems of Ethiopia.
Victor Kombe
Victor was born in the heart of Kilimanjaro and has been a safari guide for eight years. Tracking wild animals is in his blood and he has an intimate knowledge of all the wildlife, from the smallest insect to the largest predators. The big cats are his particular favourites, especially the elusive leopard which Victor describes as "an animal work of art".
January B Kayombo
January has been working 14 years as a driver-guide in Tanzania, with his favourite being the Serengeti National Park. He is a keen wildlife enthusiast with a passion for bird watching, flora and fauna. January's favourite animals are all the big cats, and favourite bird is the Didric Cuckoo. January's knowledge, skills and experience make him very popular with clients.
Anjela Tumaini
Anjela is one of our female guides on Kilimanjaro, breaking stereotypes in this male dominated field. She first worked as a porter in 2012 and in the same year made her first summit ascent and obtained her guides license. Anjela has completed the National Parks and First Aid courses. She enjoys meeting clients from all around the world and encouraging them to reach the summit.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Kembo Sithole
Starting life as a bank teller in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, Kembo saw the light and began his safari career in Hwange National Park in 1998. Since then he has grown to become one of our most popular Southern African guides. He has vast knowledge of fauna and flora and this with his excellent manner with people ensures he brings that something extra to our guests’ safari experience.
Phumuzile Ncube
Phumuzile was born in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, and moved to South Africa to work in the hospitality industry and learn more about his passion for wildlife and nature. His love of the local cultures, beauty of nature and sense of humour make Phumuzile an excellent guide for Southern African safaris. In his spare time, he loves supporting local football.
George Griffiths
George first started working as a guide in Namibia in 2006 and soon became a very much loved guide.  His bright and friendly personality plus his years of experience make George a sought after guide, and his ability to speak many of the local languages opens up doors when you travel with him.
Clive Dougherty
Growing up in the Kenyan bush has inspired Clive to seek out East Africa’s greatest adventures. From the summit of Mt Kenya and the Ruwenzori Mountains to the plains of the Masai Mara, his rapport with fellow Africans and local knowledge ensure that our trips in East Africa offer an exceptional insight into the cultures, wildlife and environments of the region.
Thierry Andrianirinantenaina
Thierry has been an adventure guide for the past 14 years. The chameleon is his favourite animal due to its ability to adapt to the environment. His experience and love of diverse local cultures and natural environments makes him an excellent and highly experienced guide for our Madagascar and Mauritius adventures.
Youssef Elouali Kaissar
Youssef is a Berber from the High Atlas Mountains. He studied at Marrakesh University before completing his mountain guide qualification in 1994. While his love for the mountains is unmistaken, Youssef is also highly regarded for his extensive knowledge of the imperial history of Morocco. The union of the two also makes Youssef an ideal guide to develop new treks and tours for our travellers.
John Sempele
John, a Masai born in the region between Aberdare and Mount Kenya, is a popular safari guide best known for guiding on foot safaris in remote and beautiful corners of Kenya. His favourite is the climb on Mount Kenya with its lobelia strewn valleys. He has led many traditional safaris and has the innate ability – from a childhood in the bush – to read animals movements, a good skill when on foot!
Jackson Odhiambo
Jackson is from a small village on the shores of Lake Victoria, Western Kenya. He has always admired East Africa’s environment and wildlife.  Following in his uncle's footsteps, he has put his passion to good use. Jackson became a driver and guide more than a decade ago and has clocked more than 500,000kms. He is a member of the Kenya Professional Safari Guides Association.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus’ travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the ‘Big 5’ in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana’s Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar’s beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus’ usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don’t be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.
