Central Asia has long tugged at the heartstrings of the adventurous. With its sunny blue skies and striking landscapes, spectacular ancient cities and Islamic architecture, complex histories and fascinating cultures; it’s easy to see why this is such a captivating region.
A cultural crossroads between Asia, Europe and the Middle East, it was across these remote lands that nomadic empires, conquerors and Silk Road traders traversed, leaving behind a rich cultural and archaeological legacy.
Retrace history as you explore the stunning oasis cities of the Silk Road, admiring the vaulted domes, towering minarets and intricate tile work of medieval Islamic architecture. Tour imperial palaces, mosques and mausoleums, wander the cobbled streets of historic walled towns and shop for colourful wares in ancient market bazaars.
Discover contrasting desert and mountain landscapes, cycle along glacial rivers or tackle a challenging mountaineering expedition on one of the region’s highest peaks.
Journey through luscious green valleys dotted with farms and grazing livestock, trek among dramatic glaciers and snowcapped peaks and explore fairytale stone villages where age-old traditions have been preserved.
Whichever route you take, don’t miss the outstanding landscapes and cultural treasures of Central Asia!

Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
Responsible Travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in Central Asia. When you book one of our adventures you’re supporting true sustainability in the protection of local communities, natural environments and wildlife.
Innovative Itineraries
Our Central Asian program is packed with unique itineraries and quality inclusions. From completing the classic Trans Siberian Train Journey or tracing the historical trade routes of the Silk Road, to trekking in the spectacular Pamir Fann Mountains or ascending to Peak Lenin base camp—the choices are as exciting as they are varied.
Fully Supported, Highly Inclusive
All of our Central Asian journeys are supported by well-maintained private vehicles, which means we can be flexible with our start times and stop off points. Carefully selected hotels, informative guided commentary, quality train journeys, internal flights and most meals are all included to make your trip as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.
Expert Guides
Our guides in the field are what make your Central Asia experience special. They’re a passionate group of tourism professionals with extensive knowledge about the long and varied history of the region, the tapestry of cultures that occupy these lands, the best walking trails and most authentic restaurants to eat at.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel
The 'Five Stans' of Central Asia - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are connected by the 'greatest route in the history of mankind', the ancient Silk Road, which today represents countless historic and cultural sites along its network. Sustainable tourism allows these sites to be preserved and protected, ensuring that the communities nearby enjoy the economic benefit that tourism can bring. To minimise our impact on the natural environment we practice the '7 Principals of Leave No Trace', in addition to supporting local economies by employing guides and support staff from local communities. Our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct and Child Welfare Code of Conduct ensure the well-being of animals and children encountered on our adventures.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable and where we have seen a good track record with traveller satisfaction over many years.
Camping
While trekking in most parts of Asia you will enjoy fully supported camping. Quality two person tents will be erected in scenic wilderness settings where our crew look after all the logistics, leaving you to relax at the end of the day. Campsites also feature a dining tent and a toilet tent with a sit toilet.
Homestays
During homestays, a local family opens their home providing a wonderful insight into the local culture, cuisine and lifestyle. Expect simple but clean and comfortable communal lodgings with shared bathrooms and a warm reception from your hosts.
Ger camps
A ger is a circular felt tent used by the nomadic people of Mongolia and sometimes in Central Asia. Spacious with comfortable beds, our gers allow you to experience ‘life on the steppe’ as you interact with a local family. In the evening, candles illuminate the gers providing an atmospheric night time experience.

Leaders in the field
Jabbar Usta Juma
Jabbar has been working as an English-speaking guide for more than six years. Jabbar was raised in northern Afghanistan before returning to his ancestral homeland in the early '90s. He is interested in all things that make up the Turkmen identity, from history to flora and fauna, as well as legends and linguistics. He loves sharing local legends over a camp fire to bring the Turkmen spirit alive for you during your visit through Turkmenistan.
Kalmykov Aleksandr
Kalmykov is a highly experienced guide and guide interpreter. He is very well travelled across Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, with further forays to the USA, Italy and Germany. Kalmykov is a tremendously focused guide – responsible, punctual – and a very active individual whose interests include running, playing football, swimming and gym/general fitness.
Alexandra Anchikova
Alexandra was born in Bishkek city and started travelling at 12, covering Siberia by the time she was 13. Her travels continued throughout Central Asia, feeding her hobby: culture and foreign languages. After graduating in Tourism in 2005, Alexandra pursued her passion by working as a guide/interpreter. With her knowledge of languages, culture and traditions she is an expert and truly charming guide.
Laura Kirk
Originally from the United Kingdom, Laura brings a wealth of travel experience to the World Expeditions team having explored over 60 countries to date. Her adventures have included setting up community projects in Myanmar, studying Mandarin in China, trekking in Nepal, spending time in a remote Bedouin camp in Jordan and chasing the Big 5 through Tanzania. With a particular passion for all things Asia, Laura loves to share the best of this region with others.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
