Everest Base Camp Trekking


Tips and advice for trekking Everest Base Camp & beyond



Are you ready to take on the challenge of trekking to the base of the world's highest mountain?

If you love mountains, you'll love Nepal. This tiny land-locked Himalayan country, the size of England, is home to 10 of the world's highest peaks - including Mt Everest, and offers some of the most dramatic mountain scenery on the planet.

The
Everest Base Camp trek
is perhaps the most popular trekking holiday on earth. Walking through the stunning Khumbu region of Nepal, to view the highest peaks on earth, is something everyone should experience at least once.

If you're considering a trek in the Everest region, you're bound to have some questions. Most of them should be answered in this handy
Everest Base Camp tips blog article
. If it isn't, get in touch with our experienced trekking experts.

Everest Base Camp was the first trek that we offered way back in 1975. We’ve established our own operation in Nepal, rather than sub-contract, and this gives us complete hands-on control over the quality of your trekking holiday in Nepal. Since 1975 we have assisted many people to Everest Base Camp and the experience we have gained will only add to the quality of experience you will receive when trekking to the base of the worlds highest peak with us.

Fitness & Preparation
All our adventures are graded from introductory to challenging - we've got options that range from low altitude hikes to high altitude climbs. Depending which level of trip you choose, we recommend 30 mins. to 1 hour of aerobic type exercise, (either cycling or jogging) 3 times weekly, 3 months before you leave. Hill walking with a daypack in variable weather conditions is also a great way of building stamina and fitness.


Trip Grading Definitions










How Long Have You Got?
Everest Base Camp is 5360m above sea-level. The air has less oxygen at such altitudes so the more time you give your body to adjust to the change in altitude (oxygen levels) on the ascent the better chance you have of realizing your goal. Our treks to Everest Base Camp are between 14 to 25 days and include an extra day between Lukla and the Sherpa capital of Namche Bazaar. This extra day gives your body a better chance to acclimatize and will maximise your chances of successfully completing your trek.











When to Travel
Our trekking season for Everest Base Camp extends from mid-September to May. Travel during October to November and enjoy rich autumn colours, clear skies and wonderful mountain views. From January to February winter treks mean fewer people and wonderful photo opportunities with snow-dusted landscapes and frozen waterfalls. Nepal has 30 indigenous species of Rhododendron, and March to May is the best time to see them plus a colourful display of Spring flowers in full bloom.

Guides & Staff
All of our Everest Base Camp treks are fully supported with a bilingual group leader and a team of other staff including driver, cook, kitchen staff and porters. We use expert local leaders and staff and they are pivotal to the success of each adventure. By training and empowering local people we are able to provide positive employment opportunities and secure incomes, while our travellers benefit through the authentic experience locals impart.











What to Pack
We’ll provide you with a gear package which includes a sleeping bag and liner, a down or fibre-filled jacket, and complimentary kit bag. Make sure you pack a pair of good quality walking boots and be sure to wear these in prior to your trek. Also take plenty of layers and bring a good quality waterproof day pack.











Eating & Drinking
All meals are included with all our Everest Base Camp treks and a trained cook and assistants will prepare delicous and quality meals for you 3 times a day. Using as many fresh ingredients as possible, our carefully selected menus combine the best of both western and local cuisine. We cater for any special dietary requirements and carefully manage food preparation and hygiene standards.


More About Food & Drink










Budgeting
Due to the inclusive nature of our trip prices, the only other money you will need to budget for is US$200 – US$400 spending money for incidentals and souvenir shopping. There are many beautiful handicrafts produced in Nepal. In Kathmandu, shop for pottery from Bhaktapur, paintings, Buddhist thangkas, distinctive weaving from various regions, hand-knitted woollen wear, pashminas, Tibetan rugs and carpets, jewellery,  brassware, and more.


Nepal Shopping Guide










Where You Will Stay
After a hard day’s trek you can look forward to relaxing in the comfort of one of our private campsites located on the trail to Everest Base Camp. World Expeditions' campsites comprise spacious tents with comfortable beds and thick mattresses, composting toilets, and hand basins, plus a dining room with eco-friendly heating and windows offering spectacular views over the Himalaya.


All Private Eco Camps




Last, If you need any extras, we can also help you book flights, get travel insurance, book stop-overs, and trip extensions.
