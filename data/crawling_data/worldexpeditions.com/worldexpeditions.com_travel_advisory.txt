Travel Advisory


Your well-being is our top priority

At World Expeditions, your safety is our first concern. Our specific protocols and safety analysis procedures, in conjunction with updates provided by our local partners and Government Travel warnings, allow us to carefully assess the stability of each region we visit and plan our operations accordingly. Our staff frequently review all aspects of our adventures to ensure we are providing you with the best possible travel experience.

For updates on specific events and regions, please see our most recent travel warnings and advice below.


CURRENT UPDATES:

Zimbabwe Update: 15 November 2017

Following the military action in Harare Zimbabwe on 13 November with President Mugabe being placed in military custody, government travel advisories are advising travellers to reconsider need to travel to Harare. None of our trips visit Harare and it should be noted that this advisory does not apply to Victoria Falls or Hwange National Park. We are in constant contact with our local operators in Victoria Falls, and they advise that the situation on the ground remains unchanged and it is very much business as usual. Borders are open with travellers arriving from Botswana, Livingstone Zambia and Hwange National Park with no road blocks along the way; and inbound/outbound flights into Zimbabwe are operating as scheduled. Please be aware that immigration may take longer than usual – please allow at least 4 hours for check-in and screening procedures and extra time for road transfers/border crossings. However in Harare there is an increased military presence, including road blocks and baggage searches at Harare Airport. Travellers are being advised to avoid demonstrations, rallies and large-scale public gatherings as they could turn violent, and not engage in any political activity including political discussions in public places. The overall travel warning level in Zimbabwe remains unchanged at “Exercise a high degree of caution” for Australian travellers and equivalent levels for those from the UK, US, Canada and NZ. The safety of our travellers is of the utmost importance; we are closely monitoring the situation and are in constant contact with our local operators. Should it be necessary, contingency plans will be enacted however at present all trips are operating as normal.



Vietnam Update: 06 November 2017
Typhoon Damrey made landfall on Saturday 04th November in the southern region of Vietnam resulting in flooding and damage to buildings and infrastructure.  The southern city of Nha Trang and surrounding area was the worst affected. The tourist hotspot of Hoi An has also seen significant flooding. The worst of the strong winds have now dissipated and clear-up operation is under way. However, heavy rain is forecast until at least Tuesday (07th) throughout the region causing a continued risk of flooding and landslides in rural areas.
All World Expeditions travellers are safe and accounted for. Impacts on future trips (if any) are being assessed and details will be forwarded to those travellers affected. However, it is expected that trips should continue, potentially with slightly amended itineraries. As always the safety and security of our travellers is our foremost priority and we are in constant contact with our office in Vietnam.

Japan Travel Advice -  Sunday, 22 October 2017
Typhoon Lan made landfall at Shizuoka, 175km (110 miles) south-west of Tokyo, at about 03:00 local time on Monday (18:00 GMT Sunday). Gusts of up to 198km/h (123mph) hit the country. The storm drenched many regions over the weekend causing wide spread flooding which led to almost 300 flights being cancelled on Monday, after 500 were cancelled on Sunday. Our office in Japan has advised that the main storm has past the Kanto region (Tokyo), heading north. All World Expeditions clients are safe and itineraries continuing as planned. Minor changes to itineraries of those currently travelling have been implemented and tours are continuing with no major disruptions. All forward trips are operational.

Madagascar Update: 16 October 2017
There is an outbreak of plague in Madagascar which differs from the ‘normal’ endemic versions normally seen, with more cases of pneumatic (as opposed to bubonic) plague which is highly contagious. Plague is an endemic disease in Madagascar (among other countries including Peru), with cases of bubonic plague being reported nearly every year, particularly during the epidemic season between September and April. However, a pneumonic plague event has been reported in a non-endemic area and in densely populated cities for the first time. Bubonic plague is spread by infected rats via flea bite, pneumonic by person-to-person transmission. The current outbreak includes both forms of plague. Human-to-human transmission typically requires contact with the person with pneumonic plague. The World Health organisation have mobilised a response to the present outbreak and wide ranging strategies are in place in an effort to control it.
We have groups on the ground in Madagascar at present and they are continuing on as planned, however it is the case that the situation can and will change quickly. There are precautionary measures which can be taken, namely very stringent hygiene and monitoring of personal health with a keen eye on possible symptoms. Whilst death can result if left untreated, it can also be cured by common antibiotics if delivered early. World Expeditions continues to monitor the situation daily and consults frequently with our medical advisor, Dr Ross Anderson and refers to recommendations made by the World Health organisation.
It should be noted that the UK, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand governments are not currently advising against travel to Madagascar and the World Health Organisation, at the time of writing, advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Madagascar. Advice to travellers departing this year has been provided and advice for 2018 departures will be provided as departure dates near, with the expectation that the situation will normalise once the annual rainy season passes and ongoing efforts at control of the outbreak bear fruit. As always the safety of our travellers is our foremost priority and this will not be compromised. Our thoughts are with those affected by the outbreak and we commend the efforts of those who seek to control it.

Central America Update: 16 October 2017
Tropical Cyclone Nate swept through Central America this week leaving widespread damage across the region due to severe flooding. Monteverde, Costa Rica was severely affected but we have been informed by our office in Costa Rica that the recovery progress is expected to be swift with work already underway. We do not envisage any changes to existing itineraries and have travellers set to arrive later in the year. Most major roads are now open and safe to travel.  As always the safety and security of our travellers is our foremost priority and we are in constant contact with our offices in Central America.


Air Zimbabwe: 16 October 2017
Air Zimbabwe has recently been refused permission to operate flights in the EU due to an apparent inability to demonstrate compliance with international air safety standards. It is strongly recommended that this be taken into account when choosing an airline for inbound and outbound travel to Victoria Falls Airport.

California, USA Update: 16 October 2017
Wildfires in California’s Sonoma and Napa Counties have resulted in at least 23 deaths and thousands homeless this week. World Expeditions does not currently have any travellers in this region. As towns in the region have been evacuated, and businesses and communications have been affected, our California Wine Route by Bike tour is temporarily unavailable for new reservations. No other World Expeditions tours/travellers have been affected. We will continue to monitor the situation and have every intention to support local businesses in the affected regions once it is safe to return.

Myanmar Travel Advisory: 5 October 2017
World Expeditions expresses deep concern for the plight of the Rohingya people in the Rakhine State of Myanmar.

We support the recommendations put forth by former UN chief, Kofi Annan, who was appointed by Aung San Suu Kyi to lead a Commission into the persecuted Rohingya minority with a view to mitigate the tensions there. According to the Commission’s Terms of Reference – agreed by the Government of Myanmar and the Kofi Annan Foundation – the Commission analysed the present situation of all communities in Rakhine State, and sought to identify the factors that have resulted in violence, displacement and underdevelopment. In accordance with established international standards, the Commission developed recommendations within five thematic areas: conflict prevention, humanitarian assistance, reconciliation, institution building and development. World Expeditions considers that if the recommendations are engaged the situation will be vastly improved.

Additionally, World Expeditions would like to assure travellers that the affected border areas have long been closed to tourists and that we only visit parts of Myanmar authorised by the Myanmar Government. The vast majority of Myanmar is safe, welcoming and open to tourism.

We are urging all travellers to continue to visit Myanmar as thousands of local families and private small businesses across the country have become dependent on tourism for their income. Boycotting this wonderful destination would penalise the local people who are now dependent on Myanmar’s fledgling tourism economy. All our trips are operational and as always, we will continue to monitor the situation carefully. We utilise the advice of government authorities, including the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade (DFAT) and those of Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand when assessing the operation of our trips along with the local knowledge inherent in our global offices. The safety of our travellers is of utmost importance to us and we will continue to remain vigilant as always in monitoring and reacting to any situations should they arise. We encourage travellers to visit Myanmar and will continue to support the local communities so in need of tourism.









Cuba update: 18 September 2017


After a difficult week for most people in Cuba after Hurricane Irma, the clear up process is progressing well and only the worst affected regions of the country are yet to reopen fully. The majority of streets in Havana now have electricity back. The Northern Keys of Central Cuba that are popular with all-inclusive beach holiday-goers are closed for repair, and also some hotels in Varadero. We have one trip due to start (Mexico & Cuba Explorer arrives in Havana on 1st Oct), and there is no impact on the itinerary or any hotel changes. The Havana Airport is back to full operation, and all major routes between destinations are safe to travel. As always the safety and security of our travellers is our foremost priority and we are in constant contact with our offices in Cuba and Central America.



Vietnam Update: 15 September 2017


Tropical Cyclone Doksuri made landfall in Northern Vietnam today resulting in localised flooding, power outages and damage to homes, primarily in Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and neighbouring Nghe An and Quang Tri provinces. All World Expeditions travellers in Vietnam are safe and accounted for. Halong Bay cruises are currently suspended and flight cancellations are widespread, including those between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Contingency plans are being enacted for those in country and the impacts on future trips (if any) are being assessed. More details will follow however it is expected that trips should continue, potentially with slightly amended itineraries. The typhoon is expected to weaken before dissipating in northern Laos early Saturday. As always the safety and security of our travellers is our foremost priority and we are in constant contact with our office in Vietnam as this fluid situation evolves.



Bolivia Travel Advisory: 5 Sept 2017


There is community unrest and blockades that have affected transport routes around Achacachi and other areas near Lake Titicaca, including roads to Copacabana. As always the safety of our travellers is our foremost priority. World Expeditions and our partners in Bolivia and Peru continue to monitor the situation and we are receiving constant updates, and if necessary will effect contingency plans or short detours which will not affect any tour operations or services in Lake Titicaca, Copacabana and La Paz.



Asia Security Situation: 31 August 2017


Much media attention is focused on the ongoing tensions in the Korean Peninsula and missile testing in the region, though for all intents and purposes, all is as normal in the surrounding countries. All World Expeditions trips in Asia, including Japan and China remain operational with our specific protocols and safety analysis procedures being carefully adhered to. We utilise the advice of government authorities, including the Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs & Trade (DFAT) and those of Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States and New Zealand when assessing the operation of our trips along with the local knowledge inherent in our global offices. The safety of our travellers is of utmost importance to us and we will continue to remain vigilant as always in monitoring and reacting to any situations should they arise. Our local teams in Japan and throughout Asia are eager as always to showcase their countries and look forward to welcoming our World Expeditions travellers.



Nepal Travel Advisory: 14 August 2017


Torrential Monsoon rains have caused major flooding throughout southern Nepal, including Chitwan National Park. Sadly, 49 fatalities have been reported so far, with hundreds of houses inundated.
None of our trips are affected
and we will continue to monitor conditions. As always, the safety of our travellers is our foremost concern. If required, contingencies will be implemented however at this stage it is expected that all trips will operate as planned. Our thoughts are with those affected.



Venezuela Travel Advisory: 31 July 2017


Elections for the new constituent assembly were held on 30 July. Violent protests and civil unrest continue, with security forces out in strength since 23 July. The level of the advice remains “Reconsider your need to travel to Venezuela”. The safety of our travellers is our foremost priority, and accordingly World Expeditions has made the decision to suspend trips to Venezuela for the time being due to ongoing security concerns. World Expeditions and our partner in Venezuela continue to monitor the situation and we are receiving constant updates. Venezuela is a beautiful country and we will resume operations once the security situation has improved.



Peru update: 15 March 2017


There have been heavy rains across many regions of Peru in recent weeks causing flooding, landslides and mudslides. Trujillo and surrounding areas in the north of Peru have been particularly affected as have areas of Lima. November through April is the rainy season in Peru and every year this region experiences flooding and landslides in some regions. Our partner has advised that at present no World Expedition trips have been affected. We will of course be monitoring the situation and will provide updates if there are any further developments. In the event that any of our trips will be affected, contingency plans will be implemented to ensure their smooth running. As always the safety of our travellers is our foremost priority. World Expeditions and our partner in Peru continue to monitor the situation and we are receiving constant updates.





Japan update: 22 November 2016


A 6.9 magnitude earthquake off north-eastern Japan near Fukushima prefecture has prompted a tsunami warning of possible 3m waves; small tsunamis have been observed in coastal areas. The quake struck this morning at about 06:00 local time with an estimated depth of around 25km. Damage from the quake remains unclear, but there are some reports of minor injuries. Tremors were felt in Tokyo and residents have been urged to evacuate some coastal areas. A tsunami warning has been issued for Fukushima prefecture and Miyagi prefecture.

World Expeditions presently has a group of travellers on our Backroads of Japan trip who are now in Nara and safe and well; their itinerary will continue as planned unless changes become necessary. The safety of our travellers is our foremost priority.

We will continue to monitor the situation and further updates will be provided if required. Those in Japan should follow all instructions issued by local authorities, including evacuation orders, and should expect aftershocks. Our thoughts are with those affected by this event.





India update: 18 November 2016


Currency restrictions remain in place across India. No more than 2,000 Indian rupees (around AUD40) may be exchanged over the counter at one time. The current ATM withdrawl limit is 2,500 rupees (around AUD50). Indian authorities recently announced that all 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes were to be withdrawn from circulation as part of a crackdown on corruption and counterfeit currency. Please do not rely on ATMs or the bank to withdraw money in India at this time. We suggest all travellers bring foreign currency to exchange upon arrival in India. Please also use ATMs at the airport on arrival.





Zika Virus update: 18 November 2016


The Zika Virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne disease, transmitted by some species of Aedes mosquito which bite in the day, particularly around dawn and dusk. The Zika virus is present in a number of countries in Central and South America, the Caribbean, the Pacific and parts of Asia. Click
here
for a list of affected countries, in order of prevalence of the disease. Travellers are advised to protect themselves from mosquito bites by using insect repellents and wearing long sleeves and long pants, especially during daylight when the mosquitoes tend to be most active. The virus has been identified as a particular concern for pregnant women and they are being urged to reconsider or postpone their trips to countries affected by the virus. For more information, see the World Health Organisation (WHO) website
here
. We will be monitoring the situation and provide updates if there are any further developments warranting concern. For now, all of our trips remain operational.





Thailand update: 23 October 2016


World Expeditions joins the people of Thailand and people all over the world in offering our deepest condolences and respect upon the passing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. The dedication of His Majesty to the well-being of the nation and its people is unparalleled.

Thailand is entering a period of mourning that will last for one year commencing 14 October 2016. During the first 30 days of the mourning period, all public festivities are cancelled. In the initial period, some entertainment venues may decide to close or operate with restricted hours. Major sites, with the exception of Wat Pra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha) and the Grand Palace in Bangkok, are open as usual, as are restaurants and shops. The general atmosphere is, as expected, subdued.

Travellers should exercise special sensitivity as Thailand mourns the passing of its monarch. The Tourism Authority of Thailand encourages visitors to continue with their travel plans as normal and has created a list of recommendations regarding the Mourning Period for His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The recommendations should be adhered to as a mark of respect and solidarity with the Thai people.

Many Thai people will be wearing black or white clothing as a sign of mourning. This is not required of visitors but if possible, they should wear sombre and respectful clothing when in public and avoid colourful, eye-catching dress. Visitors should refrain from conducting any inappropriate or disrespectful behaviour. Most of the traditional and cultural events will be taking place as usual, although the celebrations may be changed for appropriateness as a mark of respect, or the events may be dedicated to the memory of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. All transport, banks, hospitals and other public services will be operating as usual. The related authorities have stepped up safety and security measures for all Thais and visitors to facilitate their travelling around the country.

All World Expeditions trips are operating as normal and do so with the utmost respect for the remarkable King Bhumibol Adulyadej and his people.





Vietnam update: 18 October 2016

Vietnam has been struck by severe flooding from a tropical low pressure event that brought rains of up to 900mm to central parts of the country in recent days. Reports indicate that at least 25 people have died and four are missing, with these numbers expected, unfortunately, to rise. Our thoughts are with those affected by this event. The regions affected (at present) are four provinces in the central north of Vietnam (Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Vinh and Ha Tinh).
All World Expeditions travellers are safe and accounted for.


The country is bracing for the prospect of more floods and landslides to come as Typhoon Sarika regroups over the South China Sea. Winds are forecast to be up to 150km per hour, with the storm expected to be in striking distance of Vietnam’s northern coast by tomorrow morning or possibly this evening. All cruises in Halong Bay will be cancelled for the next few days at least.

Below is the status in relation to current and forthcoming trips (until the end of October). As always, the safety of our travellers is our foremost concern. If required, contingencies will be implemented. Naturally the situation is fluid and we are receiving regular updates from Vietnam as the situation unfolds.

Best of Vietnam and Cambodia 1/10/16: The group have left Vietnam and are doing well in Cambodia.

Vietnam by Bike 15/10/2016: Travelling to Hue by train tonight (18 October). The railway routes from the north to the centre of Vietnam are operating normally. The group completed the overnight cruise in Halong Bay as normal last night but this morning for safety reasons all the cruises returned to shore earlier than scheduled by about two hours; the trip continues to follow the itinerary as normal.

Mekong Delta Cycle 15/10/2016: Trip runs in southern Vietnam, no impact at present.

Waters Vietnam Adventure 17/10/2016: Halong Bay cruise is cancelled today, remaining in Hanoi tonight and will continue as normal tomorrow.

The forthcoming trips below are expected to operate as normal however the situation is fluid and contingencies will be implemented if needed.

Ho Chi Minh City to Angkor Wat Cycle - 29/10/2016
Mekong Explorer River Cruise - 29/10/2016
Bike, Hike and Kayak Northern Vietnam - 31/10/2016



Myanmar update: 14 October 2016


The government has imposed a state of emergency in the majority of Rakhine State (except Sittwe and resort areas at Ngapali Beach) in response to armed clashes. World Expeditions does not offer trips in this area and all forthcoming World Expeditions trips are operational. The rest of the country is calm; the affected area is in the most northern part of Rakhine State and it is business as usual in the rest of the country. The people of Myanmar look forward to welcoming travellers as always.





China update: 19 September 2016


Typhoon Meranti made landfall early Thursday September 15 in Fujian province. The strongest typhoon to hit China this year has left 28 people dead and 15 others missing in the east of the country. Reportedly the worst hit area is Xiamen (or Amoy) and Fuzhou has been flood affected. World Expeditions trips do not go to any of these places so none of our trips have been impacted, however naturally we are watchful as ever during typhoon season. Chinese authorities on Saturday warned of high waves and strong winds from a new storm, Malakas, which was bearing down on the east coast of the Chinese mainland after skirting Taiwan; we will monitor the impacts of this new storm however it is likely to affect the same region as Meranti. Our thoughts are with those affected by these storms. All trips in China are operational as normal and as always we are carefully monitoring conditions, with trip changes implemented where necessary to ensure the safety of travellers.





Myanmar update: 28 August 2016


On the 24 August a 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck 19km from Seikphyu (south of Bagan) in Myanmar, resulting in the deaths of three and damage to some 187 pagodas and temples. All World Expeditions travellers and staff on the ground are safe and all trips have continued to run as normal. After an earthquake struck Bagan in 1975, more than 600 pagodas were poorly renovated. The parts of the pagodas that were renewed after the 1975 earthquake have been damaged but the ancient bricks have not collapsed. We will continue to monitor conditions locally and if necessary amendments to itineraries will be implemented however at this stage no significant changes are expected. As always the safety of our travellers is our foremost priority.
