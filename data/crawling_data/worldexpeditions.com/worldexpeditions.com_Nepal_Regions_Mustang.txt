With its rugged mountain terrain and rich cultural legacy, the remote Mustang region is one of the Himalaya’s finest treasures. Set on the border of Nepal and Tibet, between the Annapurna range and the Tibetan Plateau, the landscape here is striking and otherworldly—a semi-arid desert of deep ravines, rocky cliffs and narrow valleys, flanked by high mountain passes and majestic snowy peaks.
Although politically part of Nepal, Mustang’s geographic isolation has meant that its ancient Tibetan culture, religion and language have been preserved remarkably well. Prayer flags, simple monasteries and impressive chortens dot the unique landscape and Tibetan Buddhist culture still thrives in the whitewashed settlements and cliff-side villages of this former Himalayan kingdom.
Join us as we savour the rich culture, spectacular scenery and outstanding trekking on offer in this isolated gem of the Himalaya.

Why travel with us
Unrivalled experience
We've been organising treks, climbs and tours in Nepal for over four decades. Our firsthand knowledge of the region is unmatched, and we continue to push the envelope each year by innovating new programs while also finessing our classics.
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel is at the heart of every program that we offer in Nepal. World Expeditions is a founding member of the International Porter Protection Group and has pioneered many sustainable tourism initiatives that benefit our staff, the local community and the environment such as our 10 Pieces Litter Collection initiative, our Community Project Travel program and our exclusive eco-campsites in the Everest, Gokyo and Annapurna regions.
Ultimate value
Quality services at the best prices make our adventures great value for money. Our trip costs cover valuable inclusions like all meals while trekking and a dedicated local crew who will go the extra yard to ensure you have the experience of a lifetime. Our high level of support allows you to relax and focus on the incredible journey ahead of you.
Experienced guides
From Tim Macartney-Snape, who with Greg Mortimer completed the first Australian summit of Mount Everest, to Bir Singh, one of Nepal's most experienced local guides, our leaders are the key to our success as they strive to make your experience exceptional.
Widest range of adventures
From a trek around the Annapurna Circuit and crossing the high passes of the Everest region to a challenging mountaineering expedition, we offer the widest range of Nepal adventures on the market with a trip to suit every level and interest.
World firsts
World Expeditions operated the first commercially guided and fully supported expedition along the entire length of the Nepal section of the Great Himalaya Trail, a representation of exploratory trekking at its finest. Our ability to pioneer this challenging trek underscores our superb logistics and crew in Nepal and embodies the essence of World Expeditions' travel philosophy.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Litter collection
The 10 Pieces litter collection initiative, where travellers collect 10 pieces of plastic or paper litter on the trail each day, is offered on all of our Nepal treks. This simple yet effective initative harnesses the collective power of tourists to keep wilderness trails clean and to educate local communities about the negative impact of litter on their environment and tourism economy.
Porter welfare policies
All porters that we employ receive a good working wage that is regulated by the Trekking Agents Association of Nepal and the Labor Union of Nepal, paying as per their guidelines, which are unionized. We are one of the only trekking companies in Nepal to provide porters with three meals a day, prepared by our cooks, as well as lodging or tents, sleeping mats and blankets. Porters receive income protection and life insurance and have access to the same first aid care that travellers receive including emergency helicopter evacuation if required. Porters are provided with a wind and waterproof jacket and over-trousers, woolen socks and gloves, leather or canvas shoes, sunglasses and a warm cap, and carry a maximum of 30kgs.
Eco-campsites
Our series of eco-campsites in the Everest and Annapurna regions contribute to the local economy by providing employment and yearly rent and by bringing trekkers into nearby villages to purchase handicrafts. The campsites minimise our environmental footprint by using yak or cow dung to fuel heaters, kerosene to cook meals and boil water, rainwater tanks, composting and septic toilets and incinerators to burn paper and non-toxic plastic waste.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Private eco-campsites
Comfort and adventure are combined in our private eco-campsites. The campsites are exclusive to World Expeditions, featuring raised beds and high ceiling tents as well as dining and toilet structures. The campsites were designed with the environment in mind, minimising the impact of our presence and providing employment opportunities to local communities.
Wilderness camping
Enjoy fully supported camping in remote locations with our outstanding crew of sherpas, porters and kitchen staff. While the campsite locations have been handpicked for their location, our commitment to responsible travel ensures our footprint is kept to a minimum.
Eco-lodges
Select locations involve lodges on a twin share basis that provide a comfortable and hygienic environment to relax at the end of the day.
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in good quality properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Tim Macartney-Snape
Tim is Australia's best known mountaineer and an inspiring leader whose passion is taking small groups into the most isolated and wildest places. He has climbed Everest [twice], Ama Dablam and Gasherbrum 4, among many others. Tim brings different tangents to exploratory treks with his natural history knowledge and true understanding of the Himalayan culture.
Soren Kruse-Ledet
One of our most experienced leaders; Soren has summitted many Himalayan peaks as well as completed a six month traverse of Nepal, and attempted Everest solo. He has also led many climbs and treks in Nepal, Tibet, China and Bhutan including Cho Oyu. Popular, easy-going and professional, Soren can be found leading various adventures for us in Nepal.
Andrew Lock
Andrew is an inspiring and immensely accomplished adventurer, and a wonderful communicator. In October 2009 he conquered Shishapangma, Tibet, becoming the first Australian to climb all 14 of the world's 8000m peaks - a feat only achieved by a select few worldwide. His achievements include multiple ascents of Everest, Lhotse & Manaslu, five Australian first ascents and establishment of many new routes.
Simon Yates
Simon has been at the forefront of mountaineering for almost two decades with first ascents in the Andes, Himalaya and Karakoram. Best known as Joe Simpson's climbing partner [Touching the Void], he has developed a strong reputation as an engaging expedition leader.
Lhakpa Lama
Based at our desk at the Radisson Hotel, Kathmandu, Lhakpa is always on hand to advise you on the best restaurants, local sightseeing opportunities and to assist with questions on forthcoming treks. Lhakpa has been with World Expeditions for over 20 years. His helpful, cheerful and efficient manner ensures the beginning and end of your Nepal adventure will be smooth, letting you focus on enjoying Kathmandu and preparing for your trek.
Meraj Din
'Mr Din' has been the driving force behind the operation and management of our Nepal trekking program for the past two decades. His tireless commitment to trip quality and focus on responsible tourism practices has ensured that World Expeditions remains at the forefront of the Himalayan trekking scene.
Mrs Uma
Mrs Uma has been with us nearly 20 years and is the driving force behind our Kathmandu office. Coordinating the details of school and private groups and managing our community project works, her skills are as diverse as her knowledge of achieving the best services and prices for our travellers. We are privileged to have such an effective administrator and negotiator on the team, not to mention Uma's delightful manner when liaising with travellers.
Jon Muir
Jon has been at the cutting edge of world adventure for 33 years. Jon reached the summit of Everest alone and completed first ascents of extreme new routes in the Himalaya. An accomplished polar explorer, Jon was the first Australian to trek to both poles with Eric Philips. The culmination of Jon's dedication to adventure was his unsupported traverse of Australia in 2001, where he completed the first unsupported walk to the geographic centre of Australia.
Bir Singh
Bir is one of our most versatile leaders, escorting our trekking groups along challenging sections of the Great Himalaya Trail, our family treks in the Annapurna region, private special interest groups to Everest Base Camp and our Mera and Island Peak Expeditions. He has also been instrumental in the organisation of our community projects at the Sanjiwani Health Clinic which has seen positive change for this important medical facility in the lower Annapurnas. Bir is a very popular guide with all groups he is involved with.
Sorrel Wilby
Sorrel is best known as a television presenter on Channel Nine's Getaway and the ABC's Painting Australia, brings a vast adventure heritage with her. Her adventures began with a 3000km solo trek across Tibet and a pioneering complete Himalaya traverse with her husband. Sorrel has also made a name for herself as an accomplished travel writer, photographer and illustrator.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

Weather
Our trekking season in Nepal extends from mid-September to May. However within this period there are clear seasons in the weather.
Trekking in Nepal during winter, from December to February, offers cool to mild and clear days with often very cold nights. Occasionally winter storms can bring snow as low as 2500m.
In March the cold, dry winter season begins to give way to warmer, spring conditions. Mornings are usually clear with cloud build-up occasionally bringing afternoon rain.
Late spring conditions, in May, are generally hot at low elevations and as the clouds build up to the next monsoon, which generally begins in June, daily afternoon rainstorms are common. This is a period that generally has clear weather at the higher altitudes and is traditionally a time when mountaineering expeditions commence their ascents.
The monsoon creates a rainy season in Nepal, which lasts from mid-June to mid-September. During this time the Nepal Himalaya is unsuitable for trekking, with the exception of a few remote valleys.
During the monsoon in Nepal it is possible to trek in Tibet, the Indian Himalayan regions of Kulu, Garhwal & Ladakh, Central Asia and Pakistan, places that are at their best during this time.
The post-monsoon period - From early September the monsoon rain starts to decrease. By mid-October through to mid-December the weather is usually stable with mild to warm days, cold nights and clear views. Daytime temperatures can reach 25 - 30 degrees Celsius at lower altitudes and decrease as you gain height. Over 3000 meters the daytime temperatures can vary as much as 10 to 20 degrees Celsius, and may be hotter or colder, depending on whether it is sunny or windy etc. At night at lower altitudes, temperatures do not normally drop much, although as you approach November it does get colder and the days shorter. Up high it can drop sharply at night, from 0 to minus 10 or 15 and more when camped on the ice or snow.
The pre-monsoon period - In March the cold, dry winter season begins to give way to warmer, wetter spring conditions. Mornings are usually clear with cloud build-up bringing occasional afternoon rainstorms. Views of the mountains in the middle of the day and afternoon may often be obscured. Daytime temperatures increase quickly in March with temperatures of up to 30 degrees Celsius and mild nights. At higher altitudes it is similar to the conditions of the post-monsoon period, however there is usually more snow, which has accumulated over the winter period. There are spectacular displays of rhododendrons and wildflowers at this time of year. Late spring conditions ie April and May, are generally hot at low elevations and as the clouds build up to the next monsoon, daily afternoon rainstorms are common.
Time in Mustang
Nepal is +5:45 ahead of UTC/ GMT
Language
Nepal is a country of high linguistic diversity. 123 different primary languages were reported in Nepal’s 2011 national census—including Nepali (official) 44.6%, Maithali 11.7%, Bhojpuri 6%, Tharu 5.8%, Tamang 5.1%, Newar 3.2%, Magar 3%, Bajjika 3%, Urdu 2.6%, Avadhi 1.9%, Limbu 1.3%, Gurung 1.2%, other 10.4%, unspecified 0.2%
Nepali is Nepal’s official language and also its lingua franca, understood by most in Nepal, and spoken by many living in Bhutan, India and further abroad
Newar (aka Nepal Bhasa; not to be confused with Nepali) is the native language of the Newar people and was Nepal’s official administrative language from the 14th to late 18th centuries, but is now considered by UNESCO to be an endangered language.
English is spoken by many in government, business and tourism sectors, and is part of the core curriculum of Nepal’s education system
Currency
In Nepali the local currency is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR). The Nepalese Rupee is different to the Indian Rupee, and the Government of Nepal has banned the import, export and use of 500 and 1000 Indian Rupees notes in Nepal.
It is difficult to convert your NPR back to foreign currency, and you will not be able to exchange NPR once back in your own country. There are many money change shops in Thamel and around Kathmandu where you will also be able to change money, however, note that many places will not allow you to change currency back. There are also ATM’s available for use in Kathmandu.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Nepalese traders do not like TORN notes. Most people will not accept them so ensure you check your notes when exchanging and refuse to accept any torn notes
International Dialing Code
+977
Electricity
Electricity in Nepal is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C (two round prong).
Visas
All nationalities require a visa for Nepal. You will find visa application forms and detailed instructions in your pre departure information kit and the up to date prices for visas obtained in your home country. Please note that if you are applying in Australia you must fill out the visa form provided and paste or staple your photographs in the top right hand corner. However, please note that THE VISA IS ONLY VALID FOR 6 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE, ie. you must enter and depart Nepal within six months of the date of issue of the visa. If you are American or Canadian you will need to obtain application forms for your visa directly from your nearest embassy/consulate.
It is possible to obtain your Nepal visa on arrival at Kathmandu Airport, however this is not ideal as it can cause long delays to your group. At the time of printing the cost is as follows;
15 day tourist visa US$25
30 day tourist visa US$40
90 day tourist visa US$100
(All are multiple entry)
Although the preferred payment is USD, AUD, CAD and GBP will also be accepted very readily.
You can collect the application form required to obtain your visa on arrival, from your reservation consultant or at the Kathmandu Airport on arrival. You should carry two current passport photographs with you, to obtain the visa. These prices are subject to change without notice, however we will do our utmost to keep you informed prior to your departure.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
