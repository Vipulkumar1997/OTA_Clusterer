Trip highlights
Rebuild a mountain school that was badly damaged in the 2015 earthquakes
Observe Gurung and Tamang culture, working alongside the Gorkha community
Undertake a remote trek from the Langtang region to the Manaslu Circuit
Immerse in a total wilderness experience to discover timeless cultures
Spot red panda, musk deer, bear or even leopard in these remote regions
Benefit from ample acclimatisation days on this well-crafted itinerary
Take in the sights in Kathmandu including Pashupatinath and the giant Buddhist stupa at Boudhanath
Are you a well-seasoned trekker with an interest in leaving behind something positive and tangible in the places you pass through? If you answered in the affirmative … this is the trip for you!
In April and May 2015, Nepal was struck by a series of devastating earthquakes. The community of Kashi Goan in the Gorkha region of Nepal was close to the epicenter of the quakes. Tragically, nine people from the village died during the earthquake, 150 people were injured, 50 houses were destroyed and the secondary school received considerable damage. The World Expeditions Foundation will fund the construction of three classrooms at this school. In November 2017, you can be one of 16 travellers to take this incredible trek and assist this community to rebuild their school.
The school was established in 1962 and has 365 students attending, aged between three and seventeen years. There are twelve teachers, five of which are funded by the Government and the remaining teachers are funded privately or by the village community.
Kashi Goan village is made up of 50% Buddhists, 40% Christians and 10% Hindus, and 90% of the villagers are Ghale Gurungs and 10% are Dalits.
The trek is remote and spectacular affording views of the Langtang and Ganesh Himal, including a crossing of the Khurpu Dada Pass (3710m). This trek is not for beginners; previous trekking experience is required. The trails are mainly used by the villagers for herding stock, so they can be loosely defined. The beauty of this trek is that the chances of you seeing another group of trekkers are slim.

Moderate
On a moderate trek physical activity will generally not exceed eight hours in a day, and altitudes generally not exceeding 5,500 metres.  On a moderate adventure the physical activity is sustained and travelers should be comfortable with occasional rough terrain. At any stage of a moderate trek you can expect long steep climbs and descents and a wide range of weather conditions. An example of an average day on moderate trek could include several ascents and descents of 500 metres or more, level ground is rare in the mountains. To prepare for a moderate trek you should begin training at least four to five months before your departure.  As a guideline, an hour of aerobic exercise three to four times per week would be considered a minimum requirement. The best preparation is bushwalking involving relatively steep ascents and descents. If you can manage a couple of valley floor to ridgeline ascents per bushwalk, albeit with stops along the way, you will cope with a moderately graded trek. Speed is not important, stamina, confidence and continuity are.

Day 1
Arrive in Kathmandu (1330m)
You will be met by a representative of World Expeditions and transferred to the hotel. The remainder of the afternoon is at leisure. A pre-trek briefing will be given around 5pm where arrangements will be made for the distribution of your kit bag, sleeping bag and down/fiberfill jacket. There are a million things to see in Kathmandu and we recommend you spend the afternoon wandering the town and exploring the valley on bicycle or by taxi. The old Royal Palace, Durbar Square and the tourist quarter of Thamel are all worth a visit. Evening drinks are held in the hotel for all World Expeditions clients arriving today. Drinks and snacks will generally be served from 6:30pm until 7:15pm, and this is a great opportunity to get acquainted with your fellow group members before heading out to dinner. Overnight in hotel in Kathmandu.
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Kathmandu sightseeing
This morning a sightseeing tour takes in the key attractions in and around Kathmandu. We will visit Pashupatinath and Boudhanath, returning to the hotel by 2pm. In the afternoon you may have time to explore Durbar Square, Patan, Swayambhunath or Bhaktapur, and the lesser-known towns that dot the valley on foot, by bicycle or trishaw. The area has an amazing range of fascinating highlights, whatever your interest. Excellent bookshops, extensive markets, and novelty and handicraft shops contrast with fantastic centres of cultural and spiritual significance - Kathmandu has more World Heritage sites than any other city in the world. Overnight in Hotel in Kathmandu.
Meals:
B
Day 3
Kathmandu to Syabrubesi (1503m), drive approx. 7-8hrs
After an early breakfast we drive north from Kathmandu to Syabu Besi, gateway to the Langtang Valley at the confluence of the Bhote Kosi and Langtang Rivers. Parts of the road are unsealed and the condition of the road often depends upon the monsoon season. We will travel via Trisuli Bazaar where the dam and hydroelectric project was completed by the Indian Technical Mission. Finally we drive on to Syabrubesi where we will make our first camp and final preparations for our trek. This trek is off the beaten track experience, which highlights an ancient lifestyle combining it with picturesque scenery. During this trek along unbeaten trails and offering a total wilderness experience you will explore traditional Tamang villages, unspoiled and virtually untouched culture, life, crafts and nature. You will receive a warm welcome by the locals rich in their distinct colorful costumes, their houses adorned with beautiful woodcarvings. This region offers a wilderness experience with beautiful landscapes of alpine terrain, flat meadows and rhododendron forests. There are still bears, leopards, red panda and musk deer seen in this region. Overnight in wilderness camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 4
Trek to Gatlang (2238m), walk approx. 5-6hrs
After two to three hours of ascent from Syabrubesi we reach a view point where we gain fantastic views of the Ganesh Himal, Gosainkunda range and Langtang Lirung. We head down to Goljang valley (lunch stop) which is an hour walking down hill from our view point. Today we walk through many villages and along the trails there are numerous Buddhist chortens and mani walls. Gatlang is a beautiful Tamang village that is set high on a hillside among terraced fields.  Gatlang is a cornerstone village on the Tamang Heritage Trail with unique customs and craftsmanship in a magnificent setting. We are now travelling on the Ganesh link of the GHT on our way to the Manaslu and Annapurna regions. Overnight in wilderness camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 5
Trek to Somdang (3258m), walk approx. 7hrs
Leaving Gatlang we enter pine and rhododendron forests until we reach 3100 metres where there is a large kharka and campsite, we continue on from here where we meet up with a road which we follow whilst traversing a steep hillside to another kharka. Here we take a small trail which leads us over the Khurpu Dada Pass (3710m) before heading west and descending to Somdang River, border between Rasuwa and Dhading Districts. Overnight in wilderness camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 6
Trek to Tipling (1890m), walk approx. 7-8hrs
After breakfast we trek gently uphill passing through beautiful jungle and mesmerizing landscapes with views of the Langtang ranges and finally by noon we arrive at Pangsang Kharka to take in more views. It is a view point southwest of Somdang village with a broad panorama of the surrounding terrain. To the north are the soaring peaks of Manaslu and the Ganesh Himal Range. The whole Ganesh Himal region is blessed with abundant herbal plants. Previously herbs were taken to Tibet along an ancient trade route and exchanged for salt, livestock, wool and turquoise. We descend down to Tipling which is a large village that hosts two Buddhists gombas and both a Protestant and Catholic church. Being a majority of Tamang people we will watch a beautiful Tamang culture show said to have been brought from Tibetan culture long ago. Overnight in wilderness camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 7-8
Trek to Lapa Goan (1850m), walk approx. 6-7hrs and rest day
We descend to cross the Adha Khola on a box bridge and ascend to the sister villages of Shertung and Chalish, regally overlooking the fertile river valley and abundant fields. Shertung is inhabited mainly by Tamang. The name Shertung means ‘place of gold'. According to a legend, two brothers in search of gold were led here by a dream and thus the settlement was born. Jhankri (shaman) activity is robust in this territory with the worship of natural forces and indigenous local deities interwoven with Hindu and Buddhist practices. Chalish is inhabited primarily by Ghale Gurung and Dalit (black smith). Dohori is also popular with call and response between male and female participants, a type of courtship ritual, complemented by folk music. We then continue towards Lapa Goan which is a big community of Tamang people where you will have lots of opportunities to learn about Tamang culture as we have a rest the next day. Overnight in wilderness camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
Trek to Nauban Kharka (2750m), walk approx. 7hrs

Over the course of the next four days we will work hard to complete as much of the school construction as possible.

We complete another 2-3 hrs of work before finishing up for the day and a snack before our evening meal.

Overnight in wilderness camp.

Our trail consists of lots of stones and rocks. This trail is used by villagers only. Overnight in wilderness camp.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 16
Trek to Arughat (608m), walk approx. 4-5hrs
