Explore the lush Okavango Delta by mokoro and on foot
Spot wildlife in safari game vehicles in the Moremi Game Reserve
Enjoy a unique wildlife experience in the Savuti region of Chobe National Park
Botswana has a legendary reputation as a superb wildlife destination. The Okavango Delta where the Okavango River reaches its terminus in the sands of the Kalahari Desert is teeming with wildlife. Over 15,000 square kilometers of wetlands, channels, islands and lagoons offer a unique safari experience. With our experienced local guides, we travel on foot encountering wildlife as the Africans always have, without the barriers of vehicles. The skill and understanding of our guides ensures we have access to great wildlife experiences, without endangering the animals or ourselves. For the big-game experience in the Moremi Game Reserve and Savuti (Zwei Zwei) region of Chobe National Park we use 4WD vehicles that allow us a greater opportunity to get close to the animals. This exceptional wilderness experience is concluded back in Maun.

Adventure Touring
Although there is no commitment to extended walking on this journey we nonetheless want to keep the ‘accent on the active’. We therefore advise that any physical training you complete before undertaking the trip will be to good effect. We recommend you incorporate 2-3 times per week aerobic or physical activity for at least one hour per session. The best exercise to do is the one you are participating in so walking with day packs is a great way to improve your fitness for this adventure. The fitter you are the more this will enhance your experience.

Day 1
In Maun, transfer to lodge
On arrival at Maun airport, you will be met and transferred to the group hotel. The name Maun is derived from the San word 'maung', which translates 'the place of short reeds'. Maun, the gateway to the Okavango Delta, is situated on the banks of the Thamalakane River. After a tour briefing at around 14:00hrs we prepare for the delta excursion then have the rest of the afternoon free to relax by the pool. This afternoon, arrival time permitting, and subject to weather conditions, there is also the option of a 45 minute scenic flight in a light aircraft over the Okavango Delta - you should budget approx US$120 depending on the number of people. 
Overnight: Crocodile Camp, Maun (or similar) - rooms with ensuite facilities
Please note: The distance and travel times quoted in the itinerary are an estimate only, and subject to local road conditions.
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
Explore Okavango Delta, mokoro canoes and day walks
We drive into the Okavango Delta to a village 1-2 hours 4WD drive from Maun. At the village we meet the local mokoro polers, and pack our equipment into the dugouts. From here it is a 2-3 hour mokoro ride to our remote campsite in the heart of the largest inland delta in the world. This amazing environment has large numbers of red lechwe, buffalo, elephant and birds, particularly kingfishers! One of the best experiences in the Okavango Delta is to be poled along reed lined channels in a mokoro (dug out canoe). Sit back and relax as the water gurgles gently under the mokoro while your skilled poker points out the fauna and flora. Overnight tonight is wild participation camping – basic camping communal facilities including tent, camp bed, linen, ensuite chemical toilet, and shared bucket showers in separate tent. (Distance: 2 hour 4WD transfer into the Delta)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 3-4
Okavango Delta
This morning, after a safety briefing, we will undertake a 3-4 hour walk in the Okavango Delta led by our local head poler, with assistance from a second poler and the Sunway safari leader. The area in which we will walk has elephant, buffalo, lion and leopard and as such our walks will be slow, stopping to look at the finer details of the bush. Our local poler guides live in the delta and as such we will rely on their intimate knowledge of this area, and it’s wildlife to determine our route for the morning. We expect to see some general game such as giraffe, zebra and warthog on these walks and elephant on occasion. Finding a cat is a distinct possibility, but by no measure certain. After the walk we return to our campsite for a brunch, and some free time in camp to relax in the hot of the midday. Our poler guides will also show us where it would be safe to swim. In the late afternoon we again head out on a shorter 1-2 hour walk, perhaps with a mokoro ride to start. The following day is similar, as we explore the delta on foot. Overnights are wild participation camping – basic camping communal facilities including tent, camp bed, linen, ensuite chemical toilet, and shared bucket showers in separate tent.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 5
Savuti region of Chobe National Park, game drives
We pack up camp early on the morning of day 5, and pole back to the poling station with our equipment. Here we meet the waiting 4WD and transfer everything across to the vehicle. Thereafter follows a fairly long 4WD drive out of the Okavango Delta and north into the dry regions of northern Botswana. Moving north over the sand ridge and into the Mababe depression we arrive at the Savuti Marsh. This open grassland area attracts herds of zebra and wildebeest, which in turn draw the large lion prides for which Savuti is famous. We camp wild in the central Chobe National Park at either Savuti or Zwei-Zwei (north east of Savuti). Overnight is wild participation camping – basic shared ablutions with bucket shower. (Distance: 200kms ± 6½ hours, excludes game drives and stops for wildlife viewing)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 6
Zwei Zwei / Savuti
Today we have a full day to explore the areas of Zwei Zwei and Savuti on open 4WD game drives. Game drives will, of course, be determined by game sightings.
Overnight is wild participation camping – basic shared ablutions with bucket shower.
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 7
Private concession bordering Moremi Game Reserve, game drives
Chief’s Island is the largest landmass within Moremi and was the Batswana tribe’s richest hunting ground, before being declared a game reserve by the tribe. We spend 4 days on game drives watching the abundant wildlife including elephant, hippo, buffalo, lion and other game, both in Moremi Game Reserve and in private concession reserves surrounding the park. This morning, after packing up camp, we game drive towards Moremi. We should arrive at the lodge in time for a late lunch followed by an afternoon game drive on the private concession bordering Moremi Game Reserve. Overnight is a tented bushlodge – twin permanent tents with en-suite facilities. (Distance/time: 100kms ± 5½ hours, excludes game drives & stops for wildlife viewing.)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 8-9
Moremi private concession, day walks and game drives
Up at first light for a cup of coffee and light breakfast before we head out on a morning bush walk with our guide for 3-4 hours. The area around the lodge is largely mopane veld (Colophospermum mopane) interspersed with natural waterholes. We’ll follow elephant paths as we walk from pan to pan. The area is frequented by lion, leopard, buffalo and large numbers of elephants. Game viewing from foot will be limited but we hope to encounter kudu, roan, sable, warthog and elephants. The guides will point out the fascinating details only possible on a walk in big game area along the ancient migration routes of thousands of elephants. We return to the lodge for lunch and some free time, before undertaking an afternoon game drive on the concession. The following day is much the same, exploring the area on foot and game drive. Overnights are tented bushlodge – twin permanent tents with en-suite facilities. (Distance/time: walk and game drive.)
Meals:
B,L,D
Day 10
To Maun, trip concludes
This morning we game drive back towards Maun, arriving in the early afternoon in Maun, in time to catch flights ex MUB @15:00. End of services. (Distance/time:	180km ± 5 hours.)
Meals:
