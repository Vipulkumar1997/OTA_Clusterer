xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Encompassing the diverse histories, cultures and landscapes of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom forms a destination so rich and so varied that it must sit prominently on any travel bucket list. While the region’s energetic cities need no introduction, many travellers are unaware of the breadth and the beauty of its landscapes.
With its medieval towns and sleepy fishing villages, ancient forests, dramatic coastline and scenic countryside dotted with castles, chateaux and Roman ruins, the UK is the perfect place to head out and explore by foot, bike or boat.
Here you can cycle through the rolling pastures and rugged moorland of the Scottish Highlands, explore the striking beauty of Northern Ireland’s rugged Causeway coast, follow the ancient path of Hadrian's Wall or trace the Welsh-English border along the Offa's Dyke Path. Hike the region’s idyllic interior and discover a complex coastline of windswept cliffs, lonely islands and pretty seaside towns.
Our broad program of active UK itineraries are tailored to get you deep into the heart of this very special corner of the world, regardless of your fitness or interests.

Why travel with us
Making the United Kingdom affordable
Our active trips in the United Kingdom only include what you need like accommodation, meals, bikes on cycle trips, luggage transfers, maps and route directions on self guided trips and an experienced local guide for group trips, as well as the peace of mind that comes with complete backup and support.
Explore the UK at your own pace
On self guided trips you can expect to receive up-to-date and well researched route notes and maps, seamless luggage transfers and competitive pricing on all essential services. Many self guided trips also have daily departure dates, allowing you to enjoy the convenience and flexibility a self guided trip offers.
Enjoy flexibility and choices
Cycling or walking, 2 star or 4 star, small groups or self guided, land or sea  - we can help you explore the UK exactly the way you want.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics. In the mountains of the Pyrenees and Mont Blanc our local partners reduce the amount of packaging taken on tour and ensure all waste is carried out from refuges that do not have road access to help dispose of it properly.
Supporting local
In the regions that we travel tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by only working with local family run hotels and suppliers so your money supports the community that hosts you.
Paddock to Plate
The paddock to plate across Europe is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
Often family run, these charming hotels range from 2 to 4 stars and provide access to local living thanks to your hosts. The hospitality is generous and their local knowledge is invaluable. Where possible, we choose locations that add to your experience.
Bed & breakfasts (B&Bs)
Simple yet rich in local character, the B&Bs chosen are clean, comfortable and run by hosts that help add to your experience.
Guesthouses
Similar to bed & breakfasts, these family-owned accommodations are clean and comfortable. Rooms with en suites generally have a shower but no bath due to space. There may be a separate room with a bath tub.
Country inns
Enjoy the cosy country setting and convenience of staying in a comfortable place that is attached to a restaurant or pub, usually on the ground floor with the rooms above.
Barges
Think of it as your floating hotel, where each day you experience a different sunrise and sunset location and you unpack only once. Berths range from two lower or bunk bed style but can be upgraded to larger berths with double beds. The bar and dining area is always a popular hangout at the end of each day's activity. The crew includes an onboard cook.

Leaders in the field
John Millen
With over 25 years of experience in active adventures, John’s travels have taken him to a multitude of countries including Tanzania, Belize, Uzbekistan, Nepal, Kenya, Russia and Botswana. John began leading Sherpa Expeditions’ trips in 1991, resulting in a strong sense of the outdoor activities that Europe has to offer. He is energised by exploring different environments and physical challenges and spends much of his spare time on mountaineering trips, cycling and walking in the Yorkshire Dales.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
