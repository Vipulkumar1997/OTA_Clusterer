A journey by bike provides the ultimate immersion into the landscapes and culture of a country. The simple pace of cycling lends itself to meeting the locals, accessing remote monasteries and experiencing the exhilaration of freewheeling in vast valleys.
Whether you’re a first timer or an experienced cyclist, our cycling holidays open up a world of adventure and self discovery. From gentle two wheel adventures through the Loire Valley in France to a challenging traverse of the High Atlas mountains in Morocco, we offer a range of exciting and memorable bike tours that are each fully supported and all at exceptional value.
We pioneered the first commercial cycle tours ever in India and China in 1978 and have evolved to provide you with some of the most unique and memorable bike tours that take you away from the highway and into the hills. Whether you’re interested in exploring the hidden cultures of Vietnam by bike, embarking on a thrilling downhill adventure by cycling through the Andes in Peru, discovering the wilds of Kenya and Tanzania at handlebar level,  cycling the mountain passes of the Western Cape in South Africa, biking through the Napa Valley in the US, pedalling across Europe on a self-guided tour, or riding through the lush, prehistoric landscape of New Zealand, rest assured each adventure will evoke a special sense of discovery with a hint of daredevil thrown in.
Our easy-to-challenging grading system helps you choose a cycling tour that is perfect for your fitness level. Opt to travel by mountain bike, guided road bike, self-guided, or mix it up with walking and/or a water based activity on a multi-activity adventure. Our high quality accommodation will ensure you get enough rest to recuperate and get back on your bike day after day.
Unlike other providers, we include the cost of your meals, accommodation and transport so there are no surprises while you’re away. On most of our trips we also include the use of a purpose speed bike (21-27 gears). Our guided cycle tours include use of a backup vehicle and air-conditioned passenger vehicle so you can cycle at your own pace. On a self-guided trip, the thrill is being left to your own devices, equipped with an emergency assistance number should the need arise.
Whilst preparation is encouraged in the months leading up to your cycling adventure, it will all be worthwhile in the end as you cycle along stunning landscapes, create unforgettable memories, and make some treasured friends.

Trip Grading
Suggested Training
Inclusions & Equipment
1
Discovery & Cruising
These are our least demanding trips. These journeys of discovery and cruises involve little or no extended activity. The itinerary may take place in remote areas (with basic facilities) and may involve long travel days on various types of transport. Sightseeing may be conducted on foot and all participants should be capable of carrying their own luggage from vehicle to hotel rooms. These adventures do not go above 2500m and rarely involve camping.
2
Adventure Touring
These adventure tours sometimes involve travel at high altitude (rarely exceeding 4000m, except on certain trips in Tibet, Peru and India) and may visit remote areas of the world where facilities are often basic. Many of these trips sometimes involve some camping or basic lodging. These adventure tours will often involve long journeys and rough roads. Sightseeing and optional day walks are often included and these days may involve up to 5 hours of physical activity.
3
Intoductory
Between 20 and 60kms a day depending on the terrain, few steep ascents.
4
Introductory to Moderate
Introductory riding with several moderate stages
5
Moderate
Between 30 to 80 kms depending on the terrain and may involve some steeper ascents which can be avoided by using the support vehicle.



6
Moderate to Challenging
Moderate rides with challenging stages
7
Challenging
Designed for stronger riders who prefer longer distances and good climbs with distances ranging between 50 to 120kms per day depending on the terrain.
1
Discovery & Cruising
These journeys of discovery and cruises are suitable for people with a basic level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: Once or twice a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour, for at least 2-3 months prior to departure.
2
Adventure Touring
To enjoy these adventures we suggest you have a reasonable level of fitness and health, a moderately active lifestyle and a positive attitude.
Suggested preparation: Two or three times a week, we recommend you walk on undulating terrain for an hour or more, for at least 3 months prior to departure.
3
Intoductory
Our introductory trips are not ‘easy’ trips and you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 30 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week. Road cycling twice a week for three months prior to departure is recommended.
4
Introductory to Moderate
On these adventures you will need a reasonable level of fitness and good health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45 minutes of aerobic type exercise three times a week, from a minimum of three months period to your departure. Road cycling twice a week should also be part of your training.
5
Moderate
These adventures require a good level of fitness and health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend 45-60 minutes of aerobic type exercise, three to four times a week. Road cycling twice a week should also be part of your training.



6
Moderate to Challenging
These adventures require a good level of fitness and excellent health.
Suggested preparation: We recommend one hour of aerobic type exercise, four times a week. Road cycling twice a week should also be part of your training.
7
Challenging
On these challenging adventures, you will need an excellent level of fitness.
Suggested preparation: We recommend one hour of aerobic type exercise, four times a week. Solid preparation is essential in the months leading up to your departure. Regular biking (four to five times a week) for at least one to four hours, with as many hills as possible, will well prepare you for the trip. It will also allow you to familiarise yourself with your bike, your personal clothing and equipment, and your preferences for fluid and food intake whilst exercising. You can also combine biking with other aerobic exercise such as running, swimming or gym work for variety. Consistency is the key, so that you build aerobic fitness, leg strength and stamina.
Inclusions & Equipment
The exact inclusions and equipment for each of our adventures is listed once you've found the trip you want. Our trips are generally more inclusive than others in the market place in line with our philosophy of minimising 'extra payments' displayed outside of the main trip price as well as out of pocket expenses once you reach your destination.
