Between Greenland and the northernmost reaches of the North American mainland lies a vast frozen wilderness known as the Canadian Arctic. This stunning archipelago of 36,563 islands is an untouched, uncrowded expanse of dreamlike landscapes.
With its deep fjords and imposing glaciers, vast ice pack and tundra, lonely islands and jagged mountain ranges, the Canadian Arctic is blessed with some of the world’s most dramatic scenery. Add in rich Inuit culture, seafaring history and an abundance of diverse wildlife, and you’ve got yourself a remote and rewarding Polar experience.
Join us on a remarkable expedition cruise as we traverse the fabled Northwest Passage, exploring deserted channels and historic islands by zodiac. Cruise through waters teeming with walrus, whales, narwhals and huge seabird colonies, and spot polar bears, caribou, arctic foxes, wolves and muskoxen on beautiful Baffin, Devon and Prince Leopold Islands. Discover local indigenous and maritime history, and encounter the rich culture of the Arctic’s first peoples.
Take a look at our unique program of Arctic voyages and join us as we explore one of Earth’s most intriguing regions.

Canadian Arctic highlights

View Polar Bear in the wild
Any trip to the Arctic comes with the huge anticipation of seeing Polar Bear in their natural habitat.
Ilulissat
The UNESCO World Heritage site of Ilulissat is an awe inspiring sight. From the ice-berg laden Disco Bay to the massive moving Jakobshavn Glacier a visit to Illulisat will long linger in your memories.
Explore Baffin Island
The 5th largest island in the world, Baffin is one of the most remote and pristine wilderness experiences on offer. With ancient Inuit culture and abundant wildlife Baffin Island is a must see destination.
The history of Beechey Island
Follow in the early Arctic explorers footsteps and visit the remote outposts on Beechey and Devon Islands.
Cruise the fabled Northwest Passage
The Northwest Passage has long conjured strong emotions for the avid traveller. It's wild and remote regions provide some of the world's best wildlife opportunities, surreal landscapes and isolated historical sites.
Inuit culture and community
A highlight of any trip to the Canadian Arctic is the exposure to the rich and enduring traditions of the native Inuit. Arts, crafts and music are all thriving within these remote communities.
Uummannaq
Spectacular mountain scenery punctured by huge floating icebergs makes the waters around Uummannaq a photographers dream.
The immense Karrat Fjord
The raw beauty of Karrat Fjord has to be seen to be believed. The stunning bays filled with ice-bergs and the massive glaciers that produce them give the fjord it's wild and remote feel.

Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
The Polar Regions are pristine natural environments. Preserving them for future generations is not just important, but essential. We are associate members of The International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators and founding members of The Association of Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operators.
Exploratory Voyages, not Cruises
We use vessels that carry no more than 132 passengers, giving us access to areas that are unavailable to the larger cruise ships. We focus on spending time ashore to enjoy the spontaneity of wildlife encounters, hearing from experts in research stations and observing sculptured ice formations from our zodiacs. No two trips are the same.
Widest Choice of Voyages
We have a diverse selection of voyages and departures to choose from. Don’t want to travel the Drake Passage in both directions? Take one of our voyages that fly to King George Island. Sit amongst a million king penguins on South Georgia or search for polar bears in North Spitsbergen.
Expert Guides, Lecturers and Crew
Our people are the best in the business—passionate individuals who have dedicated decades to polar exploration and tourism. From our Russian captains and crew to our expert naturalists and lecturers, their combined knowledge will truly enhance your polar experience.
Real Interaction with the Polar Regions
With us you can fully savour the spectacular landscapes of the Polar Regions by getting active. Cross South Georgia on foot, camp out on the ice for a night or try your hand at a range of activities including kayaking, diving or snow shoeing on one of our base camp voyages.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Environmental conservation
When visiting continents rich in wildlife and home to fragile and pristine environments, such as those found in the Polar regions, the importance of travelling responsibility is extreme if we are to preserve them for future generations. We are an Associate B2 Member of the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators, operating within the parameters of the Antarctic Treaty System. In the Arctic, we abide by the guidelines set by the Association of Arctic Expeditions Cruise Operators.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Comfortable expedition cruising vessels
Our vessels are specifically designed with expedition cruising in mind. Cabins range from quadruple berths right through to spacious suites, accommodating all budgets and tastes. Most cabins have private bathrooms; however some share a bathroom between a small number of other cabins. Public areas include dining quarters, lecture theatres, a bar and a library and some of our ships also have spas and gymnasiums aboard.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Expedition Staff
Our polar expedition leaders and crew are specialists in wilderness environments with years of experience in the field. Your Expedition Leader will be highly skilled in communication and decision making, along with wilderness first aid and safety. It will be their job to ensure the expedition runs smoothly and that as many of our itinerary objectives are met whilst ensuring all participants safety and wellbeing. Your tour leader will be assisted by an expedition team, which may include a variety of polar specialists including geologists, ornithologists, marine biologists, naturalists and historians. There is also a resident medical officer on board each voyage. During the trip all of the team will impart their knowledge of the environments, as well as acting as zodiac drivers, lecturer’s, dinner companions and all round great travel buddies!

Electricity
We recommend taking a universal adapter. Electricity in Canada is 110 Volts, at 60 hertz. The most common pin type is A. (2 flat prong).
Visas
Starting March 15, 2016, most travellers entering Canada will need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visitor visa. The following nationalities will require an eTA for visiting or transiting by air (but not a visa):
Australian
New Zealand
United Kingdom
Applying for an eTA is a simple online process that takes just a few minutes. Please visit http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/eta-start.asp. You will need your passport, a credit card, and an email address. It costs CA$7 to get an eTA and it will be valid for up to five years. Government advises passengers planning to visit the nation should apply for an eTA before purchasing a ticket to enter the country, as applicants may be found to be in-admissible and refused entry due to fraud or a criminal history. *U.S. citizens do not need an eTA or a visa, providing you don’t have a criminal record. However, proper identification must be presented at the border. Should you have a criminal record please contact the Canadian Embassy or nearest Consulate General.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
