Brimming with colour, culture and life, India is like no other. Steeped in culture and spirituality, blessed with vast and varied landscapes, birthplace of some of our most important religions and philosophies and home to more than a billion people, Mother India is ancient, fascinating and shamelessly photogenic.
It can be both peaceful and exhausting, confronting and inspiring; but there's so much on offer here that you need to simply dive in and explore its countless cultural and natural treasures.
Lose yourself among colourful textiles, spices and handicrafts in bustling market bazaars; savour the heady flavours of one of the world's great cuisines; and explore India's incredible architecture - ancient citadels, temples and palaces in rich earthy tones and gaudy candy colours.
See the sun rise over the "teardrop on the cheek of time", the spectacular Taj Mahal; watch the faithful pray on the banks of the sacred Ganges in Varanasi; explore the flamboyant architecture of the coloured cities of Rajasthan; or take a houseboat trip down the beautiful palm-fringed backwaters of Kerala.
Trek among the snowcapped peaks, glaciers and wildflowers of the Indian Himalaya; experience rich local cultures as you pass through traditional towns and remote villages; and encounter stunning wildlife and endlessly varied landscapes.
No matter when or where you visit, there's so much to experience here that the hardest part will be narrowing down an itinerary. Take a look at our huge collection of unique India journeys and start planning your India adventure today!

Weather
India’s huge landmass, long latitudinal span and range of elevations make for a wide variety of different climatic zones. Major factors moderating India’s climate are its mountain ranges, extensive coastline and the seasonally reversing prevailing winds to which the subcontinent is subjected.
India is the world’s best example of a monsoon climate, in which alternating wet/dry periods are caused by the seasonal reversal of prevailing winds. The wet/dry monsoon pattern creates three major seasons for most of India: a hot wet season from mid-June to late-September; a cool dry season from October to February; and a hot dry season from March to mid-June.
During the pre-monsoon, early monsoon and post-monsoon, India’s coastal regions are often battered with fierce tropical cyclones coming off the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. The fairly reliable patterns of rainfall brought by the monsoon cycle play a crucial role in Indian agriculture, but poor rainfall years and improper irrigation unfortunately leads to occasional years of drought in which whole crops can fail in some regions.
The rugged spine of the Himalaya in India’s northernmost reaches acts as a giant buffer, protecting India from the extreme cold of the Central Asian plateau and trapping moisture from the monsoon within the subcontinent.
Temperatures are generally highest in May/June and September/October, just before and after the southwest monsoon brings heavy rainfall. The moderating effects of the ocean bring significantly smaller temperature ranges to the coastal regions compared to the much wider temperature ranges of the interior regions and higher elevations.
In Delhi, average daily temperatures range from a minimum of 7.8°C (46°F) to a maximum of 20.8°C (82°F) in January, to a minimum of 28.3°C (83°F) to a maximum of 39.4°C (103°F) in June.
In Mumbai, average daily temperatures range from a minimum of 16.7°C (62°F) to a maximum of 30.7°C (87°F) in January, to a minimum of 26.4°C (80°F) to a maximum of 33.3°C (92°F) in June.
Time in India
India is +5 and a half hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Hindi (41%); Bengali (8.1%); Telugu (7.2%); Marathi (7%); Tamil (5.9%); Urdu (5%); Gujarati (4.5%); Kannada (3.7%); Malayalam (3.2%); Oriya (3.2%); Punjabi (2.8%); Assamese (1.3%); Maithili (1.2%); Other (5.9%), including Kashmiri, Sindhi and Sanskrit
As befitting a nation of such ethnic diversity, India is home to huge linguistic diversity. Most Indians are multilingual and many people speak a great number of different languages
Hindi is India’s most widely spoken and official language, and the primary language of 41% of the population. Along with Hindi are another 22 different official/recognised languages, plus hundreds of other major and minor languages and regional variations/dialects
English is an “associate official language” and India’s most common lingua franca, and is widely spoken in business, law, politics, education and tourism. Hindustani is India’s second most common lingua franca, but is considered technically to be a variation/combination of Hindi/Urdu languages, rather than an official language itself
Currency
Indian Rupee
We recommend that you bring a small reserve of US dollars (in cash) as it is readily accepted over other currencies in India. For the purposes of foreign exchange most major currencies are accepted by foreign exchange bureaus and banks.
Credit cards and ATM are available in most large cities and hotels, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely. Always keep a watch when your card is being processed and please note that you will be surcharged for the use of your card.
International Dialing Code
+91
Electricity
Electricity in India is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas are required to enter India and visitors from some countries including Australia and New Zealand can obtain an online visa, the Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) prior to arrival.
For stays of less than 30 days, travellers can apply for an ETA online (US$60) at the official website https://indianvisaonline.gov.in/visa/tvoa.html, no less than five days and no more than 30 days before the date of travel.
At present other nationalities including the UK and Canada and those clients regardless of nationality visiting Sikkim and other restricted areas must have an Indian visa stamp in their passport prior to arrival in India.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
