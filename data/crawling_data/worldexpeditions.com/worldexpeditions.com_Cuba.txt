Cuba is a thoroughly unique and outrageously photogenic destination, with its palm-studded tropical beaches, rows of faded colonial buildings painted in muted candy colours and streets filled with hand painted Socialist murals, ice cream parlours and classic American cars from the 1950s.
Explore history, arts and culture in Havana, Cuba's photogenic capital. Grab your camera and wander the striking streets, soaking up the faded beauty of Havana's diverse architecture, or put on your glad rags and experience Cuba's spectacular live music and dance scene - the Rumba, the Salsa, the Cha-Cha and world-renowned Afro-Cuban jazz.
Enjoy the cobblestoned streets, quiet plazas and colonial charm of Trinidad, head to Santa Clara for revolutionary history at the famous Ernesto "Che" Guevara Monument and soak up the soul of Santiago De Cuba, one of Cuba's cultural capitals.
Discover the extraordinary scenery of the lush Vinales Valley, with its picturesque villages, oxen-ploughed fields, underground rivers and dramatic rocky outcrops. Surf, dive or sunbathe on white sand beaches, join a cycle journey to explore the lesser-known regions of Cuba at handlebar level, or hike through the spectacular Topes de Collantes, with its exuberant flora, grottoes and waterfalls.
With its atmospheric cities, unspoiled nature, rich history and one of the world's great music and dance cultures, Cuba really has it all! Take a look at our unique program of adventures to this island gem of the Caribbean.

Weather
Cuba lies within the tropics and its climate is generally hot and moist. Cuba’s climate is moderated by trade winds, which give the country two distinct seasons: a dry season from December to April, and a wet season from May to November. Rains tend to fall during the wet season, although are not confined to these months.
The average annual temperature is around 25-26°C (77-79°F), with little variation between the coolest month (January) and warmest month (August). Temperatures often rise to 32°C (89.6°F) in summer, and higher in the eastern part of the country. Midwinter temperatures can dip to around 10°C (50°F), but rarely go below this.
In Havana, average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of 18.6°C (65.5°F) to a maximum of 25.8°C (78.4°F) in January; to a minimum of 24.1°C (75.4°F) to a maximum of 31.6°C (88.9°F) in August.
Time in Cuba
Cuba is -4 hours behind UTC/GMT
Language
Spanish is Cuba’s primary language. Although the country has no specific Spanish dialects, Cuban Spanish is known to have something of a unique rhythm and intonation owing to the influence of Cuba’s Afro-Caribbean populations.
Haitian Creole is spoken by a significant number of people.
People who work in the tourism industry generally speak English, but usually only very basic English is spoken by others.
Cuban followers of the Santería religion also speak a special language called Lucumí, a dialect of the West African Yoruba language.
Currency
Cuban Convertible Peso (aka ‘dollar’) and the Cuban Peso (aka ‘national peso’).
Most purchases are quoted in convertible pesos (CUC$) and nearly everything travellers buy will be in this currency.
We recommend that you take Pounds Sterling or Euros to exchange into Convertible Pesos in Cuba.  US Dollars may be exchanged for Convertible Pesos, but a service charge of 10 per cent will be levied.
Euros may be accepted directly in some areas without the need to change into Convertible Pesos.
Money can be changed at your hotel, in exchange bureaux, and at banks.  Banking hours tend to be Monday – Friday from 9.00 – 3.00pm.
Most hotels, travel suppliers, and larger restaurants will accept credit card payments (but not credit cards drawn from US banks). All credit card payments will incur a charge. Please check what the charge will be before making your purchase. Usually 3-9% is added to the bill.
ATM machines are few and far between and withdrawals incur approximately 9% charge.
25.00 CUCs is required for departure tax from Cuba.
International Dialing Code
+53
Electricity
The standard power source in Cuba is 110v, 60hz AC, although a few hotels operate on 220 volts.   It is generally supplied through the American flat 2 pin plugs ( 110v ) Type A or European round 2 pins ( 220v) Type C.  You should buy the appropriate adapters before you leave home, as you may not find them overseas.  Powercuts are frequent in Cuba so we recommend you carry a torch with you.
Visas
Visas are required for all nationalities visiting Cuba. A tourist card, which is considered a visa for entry for tourism purposes can be obtained from Cuban embassies and consulates. All passengers must hold return air tickets. It is your responsibility to ensure you have all required visas for your trip. Rules and regulations governing the issuance of visas are constantly changing, and vary for different nationalities and you should check visa requirements with your travel agent or relevant consular authority well before travel.
Visa regulations change and you should be prepared for this. If you are stopping over or transiting other countries en-route to your destination, you should also check the visa requirements for that destination.  It is your responsibility to obtain the necessary visas.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
