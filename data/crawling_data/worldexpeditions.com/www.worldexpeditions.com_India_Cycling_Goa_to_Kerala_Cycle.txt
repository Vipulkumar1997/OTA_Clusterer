Travelling at a pace well suited to the laid-back attitude of the south - we linger in villages and towns en route, connecting to the people, their myriad life-ways and rich culture.

Day 1
Join Goa
Welcome to Goa! Our representatives will meet your flight today and transfer you to your hotel. Feel free to spend the rest of the afternoon relaxing – in your comfortable hotel room, on the beach, or swimming in the shallow shore-breakers of the Arabian Sea. Overnight: O’ Hotel
Meals:
D
Day 2
In Goa
After breakfast we unpack our bikes and head off on a short ride. This will give everyone a chance to familiarise themselves with the region’s road conditions and an opportunity to check everything mechanical is in order, before we begin our cycling adventure in earnest.  The rest of the day is then yours to enjoy at your leisure, perhaps exploring some of the city of Goa itself. It has a completely different feel to other Indian cities, due in no small measure to four centuries of Portuguese influence. Overnight: O’ Hotel
Meals:
B,D
Day 3
Drive to Karwar, cycle to Gokarna (cycle 50 km)
To avoid the city’s more congested roads, we’ll actually drive out of Goa to Karwar --a quiet port town on the southern-side of the Kali Nadi river. The scenery here is quite picturesque, with emerald-green hills and beautiful bays welcoming us to the Indian State of Karnataka.  We ride 50km today, past Ankola, with its 15th Century temple and fort ruins, and into the sleepy little village of Gorkarna. Think: Goa – without all the hype. There is a temple here dedicated to Lord Shiva that you may like to visit, but chances are – once we have checked into our accommodation -- you’ll be hailing down an auto-rickshaw and making a bee-line for a well-deserved swim at Om Beach. Overnight: Om Beach Resort
Meals:
B,D
Day 4
Cycle to Honavar (cycle 40 km)
With 40km to cycle today, we have time to stop at a school along the way to meet some of the irrepressible local students. After lunch we’ll wheel our way through an unhurried landscape with rural vistas aplenty on the one side, and sweeping ocean views on the other. Overnight: Kamat Executive Inn
Meals:
B,D
Day 5
Cycle to Maravante (cycle 100 km)
We have our longest ride of the trip today – 100km in total – so make sure you fuel up at breakfast, to keep those leg muscles pumping! On our way there we’ll have great views of Kodachadri Hill Looming up on our inland side. If it feels like you’ve bitten off a little more than you can chew today, rest assured, help is on the way! Our support vehicle is never too far behind to pick up the tired and the weary... Overnight: Turtle Baybeach Resort
Meals:
B,D
Day 6
Free day at leisure in Maravante
After our long ride yesterday, you’ll no doubt appreciate our scheduled rest day here in Maravante. The beach is considered by many to be the best in all of Karnataka. And our resort affords the best of both worlds: a magnificent place to simply “drop and flop”, or for those with energy to burn - water-sports galore. Overnight: Turtle Baybeach Resort
Meals:
B,D
Day 7
Cycle to Udipi (cycle 45 km)
We have a relatively short 45km ride ahead of us today, ensuring we reach Udipi with time to eat and explore! Udipi is a popular pilgrimage site among Hindus, who come to worship at the town’s 13th Century Krishna Temple. There’s always something happening here – from musicians playing at the entrance gates to elephants bestowing blessings on the faithful. Non believers are welcome in the temple, but an unusual edict stipulates men must enter bare-chested.  The other thing Udipi is famous for is its food – in particular its delicious vegetarian thalis. And it would be tantamount to sacrilege not to try a dosa here, for Udipi is (allegedly) the birth-place of the ever-popular Indian snack. Overnight: Sharada International Hotel
Meals:
B,D
Day 8
Cycle to Mangalore (cycle 58 km)
With the promise of a spicy seafood dish at day’s end, our 58km ride to Mangalore will be done and dusted in no time! We’re aiming to reach this busy port city (which manages around 75% of India’s exports) by mid-afternoon, allowing plenty of time for sight-seeing. There are some lovely temples in Mangalore, including the Kadri Manjunatha Temple, with its 1,000-year-old bronze statue of Lokeshvara – India’s Saviour God. Overnight: Hotel Goldfinch
Meals:
B,D
Day 9
Cycle to Nielshawr (cycle 87 km)
Soon after leaving Mangalore we cross our second state boundary, this time crossing from Karnataka in to Kerala. Nielshwar, a small fishing town, gives us the opportunity to explore the serene beache and fishing villages. Overnight: Malabar Beach Resort
Meals:
B,D
Day 10
Relax on the beach
Woo hoo! We only have a short rode today, so plenty of time in the schedule for everyone to soak up the sun and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of Bekal’s beautiful beach. For those itching for more exercise, Bekal Fort beckons! Built in 1660 it is the largest fortification in Kerala, dominating a rocky headland that overlooks the main beach. Overnight: Malabar Beach Resort
Meals:
B,D
Day 11
Cycle to Thalasseri (cycle 65 km)
We are nearing the end of our journey now and we’re certainly much fitter than when we began! Our 50km ride will all but fly by in a blur of coconut palms and open ocean vistas.  Thalassery, our final destination today, is home to a fort built in 1708 by the British East India Company –flexing of their colonial imperialist muscle. Overnight: The Peral Regency
Meals:
B,D
Day 12
Cycle to Kozhikode
Our last day on two wheels! Our final 63km ride along Highway 17 hugs the coastline for most of the way. And hopefully the sea breeze will be at our backs as we enter the city of Kozhikode.  Once dubbed the “City of Spices” Kozhikode (aka Calicut) continues to trade in pepper and lemongrass but additionally markets commodities such as coconut coffee and rubber. Overnight: The Taj Gateway
Meals:
B,D
Day 13
Fly from Kozhikode to Mumbai, trip concludes
Our trip ends today with a transfer to the domestic airport for your flight to Mumbai.
Meals:
B
