Authentic experiences
Our programs are packed with unique elements that provide real insight to the geographic features and cultural diversity of South Africa. From exhilarating wildlife encounters in Kruger National Park to hiking the Drakensberg Mountains and exploring vibrant cities and local townships, there are endless options for those with an adventurous spirit.
Ultimate value
All of our South Africa adventures offer fantastic value for money by featuring atmosphere accommodation and exceptional staff. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, transfers, excursions, game drives, permits and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
Our guides are passionate about South Africa and its people, wildlife and scenic beauty, and are eager to share their knowledge with you. From spotting wildlife to cooking up a feast on the campsire, our staff are dedicated to making your South Africa experience the trip of a lifetime.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Hunting avoidance
We do not participate in, support or promote any activities connected with hunting, including the purhcasing of products derived from hunting activities.
Employee welfare focus
All of our staff are local Southern Africans and are paid monthly salaries even if they do not have a tour group during a month. They are provided with uniforms that are suitable for the climate and conditions, accommodated in a company house in between tour groups and offered various skills training courses.
Responsible litter disposal
We ensure that the waste that is produced at our campsites is taken to the nearest city and disposed of responsibly, leaving nothing behind for animal consumption.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Safari lodges
In game parks, national parks and rural locations we use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area. Some may have extra facilities such as a swimming pool or private balcony.
Permanent safari camps
Like a tented hotel room, this is the perfect way to experience the African wilderness. We use 3 to 4 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Chalets/guesthouses
We use quality 2 to 3 star chalets or guesthouses. They can be rustic; however we ensure that they provide a comfortable and friendly experience.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Kembo Sithole
Starting life as a bank teller in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, Kembo saw the light and began his safari career in Hwange National Park in 1998. Since then he has grown to become one of our most popular Southern African guides. He has vast knowledge of fauna and flora and this with his excellent manner with people ensures he brings that something extra to our guests' safari experience.
Phumuzile Ncube
Phumuzile was born in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, and moved to South Africa to work in the hospitality industry and learn more about his passion for wildlife and nature. His love of the local cultures, beauty of nature and sense of humour make Phumuzile an excellent guide for Southern African safaris. In his spare time, he loves supporting local football.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.

Where to Go

Sample the country’s excellent wine & local produce, or take part in a South African braai (barbecue) if you’re lucky!
Shop for colourful traditional arts and crafts
Weather
Most of the country is considered to be semi-arid, however, there is considerable variation in topography and climate. South Africa is blessed with one of the most temperate climates on the continent, with extremes of heat and cold rare and temperate weather conditions year-round.
Most of South Africa lies at a fairly high elevation and, as such, experiences average temperatures that are cooler than countries at similar latitude (for example, Australia).
South Africa’s climate and weather patterns are greatly influenced by the oceans surrounding the country to the east, south and west, and cold polar wind fronts in the winter months, and by high-pressure systems from the Atlantic Ocean in the summer months.
Precipitation is highly variable, but rains and thunderstorms generally occur in the summer months (November to March) with the exception of the Western Cape, which receives its rainfalls in winter (June to September). The higher areas of the Cape and the Drakensberg mountains generally receive snowfalls in the winter months.
Across almost the entire country, summers are warm to hot and winters cool to cold. Diurnal temperature ranges are dramatic in the interior but much more stable in coastal areas.
Summer temperatures range from 15 to 35°C (59 to 95°F), with winter temperatures ranging from -2 to 25°C (28 to 77°F).
While the temperate climate permits a visit to South Africa in any month, the days can be wet and uncomfortably hot in summer (November to March) and the cooler, drier winter months (June to early September) are generally the best for hiking, outdoor adventuring and wildlife watching. Spring (mid-September to November) and autumn (April to May) are ideal times to visit.
Time in South Africa
South Africa is +2 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
South Africa’s 1996 constitution gives official status to 11 different languages, with two West Germanic languages and nine Bantu origin languages broken down as follows:  Zulu (23.82%), Xhosa (17.64%), Afrikaans (13.35)%, Northern Sotho/Sepedi (9.39%), English (8.2%), Tswana (8.2%), Sotho (7.93%), Tsonga (4.44%), Swati (2.66%), Venda (2.28%) and Ndebele (1.59%). Other languages account for 0.5%.
South Africa is an extremely linguistically diverse country, with most people speaking multiple languages. Afrikaans and, increasingly, English being the predominant languages of business and education.
Currency
Rand (Divided into cents)
Recommend that you travel with ZAR cash preferably, or USD cash (printed after 2006) or EUR cash.
Automatic teller machines (ATM’s) are regularly available in South Africa to draw money.
Visa & Mastercard are accepted in major and tourist centres such as Johannesburg and Cape Town. Outside these areas it is difficult to use (credit cards widely accepted except in rural areas). Note that merchant fees can be high on credit card purchases.
Amex and Diners are not readily accepted.
International Dialing Code
+27
Electricity
Electricity in South Africa is 220 Volts, at 60 hertz. The most common pin type is M. (3 round prong). Not compatible with any other plug types. In some areas the pin type C (2 round prong) can also be found.
Visas
Visas for South Africa are exempt for a stay of less than 90 days for passport holders from the following countries:-
Australia
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
New Zealand passport holders arriving into South Africa on or after 16 January 2017 require a visa. This visa will need to be applied for in person at the nearest South African High Commission.
*All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Regulations are in place for people travelling with children to/from South Africa. Anyone who is a minor (less than 18 years) must produce a certified copy of their unabridged birth certificate in addition to a valid passport. If the child is not travelling with both parents named on their birth certificate a statutory declaration or affidavit made by the parent/s who are not accompanying the child, declaring that they give consent for the accompanying adult/s to travel with the child. This should be done and signed before a Justice of Peace. If the new requirements are not met, then boarding can be denied by any airline flying to/from South Africa, or travellers may be turned back at the border. If this applies to you, please make enquiries with your respective South African consulate/mission to confirm, as the conditions frequently change. We can assist with contact details of the relevant authorities if required.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
