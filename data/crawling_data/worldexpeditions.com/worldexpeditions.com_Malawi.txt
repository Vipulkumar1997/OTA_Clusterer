With its spectacular lake and famously friendly people, the small landlocked country of Malawi is commonly referred to as 'the warm heart of Africa'. Unspoiled and uncrowded, this is a stunning destination that has been spared the impact of heavy tourism.
What Malawi lacks in infrastructure it makes up for in stunning untouched wilderness. Here you can trek through remote national parks, explore game reserves packed with wildlife and kick back on the tranquil beaches of Lake Malawi.
Wander the busy market stalls of Lilongwe, shopping for fresh provisions and local treasures such as wood carvings, woven baskets and traditional wooden chairs, then head to the turquoise waters of Lake Malawi to explore unspoiled bays and islands by boat and snorkel next to schools of jeweled Cichlids, returning to camp on the sun-drenched lakeshore. Join us as we explore this authentic and little-visited gem of Africa!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of our Malawi programs. When you book one of our adventures you are making a difference by supporting sustainable tourism initiatives in the protection of local communities and natural environments.
Authentic experiences
Experience Malawi and its culture the way the locals see it - thorugh a myriad of options from snorkelling the turquoise waters of Lake Malwai and experiencing the warmth of the Malawi people to browsing the local markets.
Ultimate value
Our adventures provide ultimate value for money by providing top quality service, comfortable accommodation, private vehicles and experienced drivers. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the trip cost such as meals, entry fees and excursions.
Experienced local guides
Our experienced guides are passionate about Malawi, its people and the culture, and will strive to ensure that you have an enjoyable and seamless experience.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Deforestation alleviation
When cooking, we use gas to avoid depleting limited wood resources. We take all waste out and use responsible waste disposal facilities.
Plastic bottle reduction
To reduce the amount of plastic water bottles purchased by travelers our vehicles have a tank of clean drinking water that is filled up along the journey.
Community engagement
At local markets we encourage travellers to barter (gently and in good humor) with the local people while remaining mindful that this is their livelihood.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Chalets/gueshouses
We use quality 2 to 3 star chalets or guesthouses. They can be rustic; however we ensure that they provide a comfortable and friendly experience.

Leaders in the field
Phumuzile Ncube
Phumuzile was born in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, and moved to South Africa to work in the hospitality industry and learn more about his passion for wildlife and nature. His love of the local cultures, beauty of nature and sense of humour make Phumuzile an excellent guide for Southern African safaris. In his spare time, he loves supporting local football.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
