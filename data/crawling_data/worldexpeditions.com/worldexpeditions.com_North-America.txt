Why travel with us
Leaders in Responsible Travel
Responsible Travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in North America. When you book one of our adventures you’re supporting true sustainability in the protection of local communities, natural environments and wildlife. Itineraries that traverse sections of the Trans Canada Trail include a C$100 donation towards the completion and maintenance of the trail system, a feat only made possible with the support of volunteers from hundreds of local organisations.
Innovative Active Itineraries
We do things a little differently. Even when visiting major parks, we venture into areas away from the large tourist sites. Accessing secluded vantage points enables us to gain a unique insight into these spectacular regions. You can hike or cycle along sections of the Trans Canada Trail, explore the natural treasures of the Hawaiian Islands by bike or foot, or immerse yourself in the heart of North America’s vast wilderness with remote treks in the Rocky Mountains, deep within the Grand Canyon, up and down the Fundy Footpath, or along the iconic Chilkoot and West Coast Trails.
Great Value
Quality services at the best prices make our adventures great value for money. Having essential items like internal mountain flights, experienced guides, National Park fees, meals, sightseeing and entry fees included in the trip cost allows you to better budget for your big adventure. Our excellent safety record, outstanding service and commitment to responsible and sustainable travel practices guarantee you unsurpassed value for money.
Expert Guides
Each guided adventure is led by exceptional leaders whose local knowledge, professionalism and passion for the outdoors ensure an enriched experience. On remote hikes, you can feel confident that you’re in safe hands with leaders certified in wilderness first-aid and the backcountry know-how that only comes from experience and a deep understanding of their natural environment.
Self-Guided Options
Prefer independent travel but without the hassle of planning or carrying all of your gear? Our Great Canadian Trails division offers supported, self-guided hiking and cycling packages so that all you need to do is get yourself to the start point and the rest is taken care of! We’ll provide you with bicycles, accommodation, luggage transfers, route notes and maps, and emergency assistance so that you’re free to explore the countryside and communities at your own pace.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel
Lying entirely in the Northern Hemisphere; Canada, the United States and Alaska boast some of the world's most famous natural wonders which are as diverse in their geography, flora and fauna as they are in their beauty. From the Canadian and American Rockies, Banff, Jasper and Yosemite National Parks, the Grand Canyon, and Monument and Death Valleys to the Mississippi River, Niagara Falls, the fjords and glaciers of Alaska and the volcanoes and coastlines of Hawaii, preserving the environment is of utmost importance. Aiming to minimise our impact on the natural environment, we practice the '7 Principals of Leave No Trace', in addition to supporting local economies by employing guides and support staff from local communities. Our Animal Welfare Code of Conduct and Child Welfare Code of Conduct ensure the well-being of animals and children encountered on our adventures.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities and large towns you will be accommodated in good 3 to 4 star properties that are generally centrally located, atmospheric, and reliable and where we have seen a good track record with traveller satisfaction.
Lodges
We use a variety of quality lodges across North America. They are not luxury lodges but what they do offer is very comfortable accommodation which is well maintained and with many facilities. Generally, the trip notes that we have prepared for each trip will give you details of the types of properties we use on any one itinerary.
Bed & breakfasts
Selected for their desirable locations and local charm, B&Bs and guesthouses offer tasty meals, comfortable rooms, and warm, friendly welcomes at the end of each day.
Camping
On many of our trips we will erect campsites in wilderness terrains. These feature two person tents, a dining tent and a portable toilet tent when permanent amenities are not available or their presence is ecologically unsound. The spacious tents, most of which you can stand up in, are well ventilated with insect nets.
Mountain huts
On backcountry trails, mountaineering routes and glacier traverses we stay in remote mountain huts. You can expect these to be basic but comfortable and from time to time the sleeping arrangements are dormitory style – in keeping with the true mountain spirit!

Leaders in the field
Bryan Caenepeel
Bryan first visited Alaska in 2005. The roots grew deep and six years later he still calls Anchorage home. Guiding has been his passion since he arrived and he has led some 4,000 travellers through the state. Mountains and the adventure within them have always inspired Bryan. On any given day you can find him enjoying his 'backyard' seeking out powder stashes in the backcountry, casting a fly into pristine glacial streams, or just capturing the beauty through the lens of his camera.
Keri May
Originally from Ottawa, Canada, Keri's passion for adventure was first ignited when she took a summer job in the Rocky Mountains. In 2007 - fifteen years, many residences, and over thirty countries later - she found herself back in Ottawa helping World Expeditions clients with their own travel. In 2013, Keri hit the trails again to create unique itineraries for our new Great Canadian Trails division and is now responsible for the operations and development for our growing suite of Canadian and American products.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.
