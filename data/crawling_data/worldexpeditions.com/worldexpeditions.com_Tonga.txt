Blessed with staggering natural beauty, rich cultural traditions and a very pleasant climate, Tonga is a special island destination that should be on your radar. With powdery, palm-studded beaches and placid turquoise waters, pristine rainforests, coral atolls and deserted islands, this is an incredible setting for outdoor adventuring!
Join us on an unforgettable kayaking journey as we explore some of Tonga’s most beautiful and secluded islands, the Vava’u island group.
Paddle between the remote islands of Vava’u on modern expedition-style kayaks, through crystal clear waters filled with corals and colourful sea life, stopping frequently to explore sea caves and to swim, snorkel and picnic on the white sand beaches of deserted islands. Camp on a new beautiful island each night, and engage with Tongan culture, history and tradition as you meet friendly locals in small island villages.
Take a look at our exciting Tonga Kayak Adventure and join us as we explore the remote islands of Vava’u!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of every program that we offer in Tonga. When you book one of our adventures you're supporting true sustainability in remote island communities, the protection of natural environments, and appreciation of the Tongan culture.
Ultimate value
We ensure that our Tonga kayaking trips include everything required for you to simply focus on having an amazing experience. We take care of the logistics with an aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as top quality service, kayaks and safety equipment, all meals while camping and group camping gear.
Experienced local guides
Our enthusiastic and friendly kayaking guides have many years of experience leading trips and their expertise will ensure a safe and comfortable holiday. Our guides look forward to introducing you to the tropical wilderness of the Vava’u Island Group and the warmth and hospitality which is central to the Tongan way of life.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Cultural sensitivity
Our guides provide travellers with instructions on how to be culturally sensitive to the Tongan culture and traditions, such as wearing modest clothing in villages and respecting Sunday as a day for spirituality and family.
Whale protection
It is believed that swimming with whales changes their natural behaviours. Due to this, in addition to safety reasons, we do not promote swimming with whales. Instead, we encourage visitors to whale watch from the safe platform of a vessel.
Support of local communities
Our operations create local employment and provide training for Tongans in adventure tourism and marine education. Each trip aims to give business to local trades including accommodation, restaurants, makers and distributors of handicrafts, food stores and market produce vendors.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 2 to 3 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
