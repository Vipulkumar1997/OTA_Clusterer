Sandwiched between Europe and Asia, Georgia is a remarkable country that should be high on your travel wish list. Blessed with vibrant small cities and World Heritage Listed ancient towns, complex history, fascinating culture and breathtaking landscapes; it’s easy to see how this small country captures the hearts of its visitors.
Start with the charming capital of Tbilisi, set dramatically on hills straddling the Mtkvari River. Wander the narrow cobbled streets of the Old Town, explore colourful markets and historic architecture with camera in hand, and enjoy culture, cuisine and nightlife.
Visit the holy city of Mtskheta, a 3,000-year-old World Heritage site filled with historic churches and monuments. Head to the abandoned ancient cave town of Uplistsikhe, once a stop along the legendary Silk Road; then see the incredible cave city of Vardzia, a 12th century fortified monastery complex carved out of the slopes of Mt Erusheti.
Explore fairytale stone villages where ancient cultural traditions have been preserved, journey through luscious green valleys dotted with farms and grazing livestock, and walk among the snowcapped peaks and glaciers of the spectacular Caucasus Mountains.
You can tour the highlights of this stunning country in comfort, or hike out onto the uncrowded trails of the Caucasus for an unforgettable trekking adventure. Whichever trip you choose, you won’t regret a visit to this stunning country.

Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
Bordered by the Caucasus to the north and the Black Sea to the west, Georgia has always been a cultural crossroads. Our adventures travel off the beaten path and into the heart of this unique country to take in the fantastic scenery, authentic food and warm hospitality that Georgia is renowned for.
Ultimate value
Our trips offer great value for money, taking in the country's highlights through guided walks and visits to ancient buildings. We aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the trip cost such as most meals, quality accommodation, transfers and site entry fees.
Experienced local guides
It's our expert field guides that make your Georgian experience special. The guides are highly experienced and have strong local knowledge and a love of their country that they are always eager to share.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics. In the mountains of the Pyrenees and Mont Blanc our local partners reduce the amount of packaging taken on tour and ensure all waste is carried out from refuges that do not have road access to help dispose of it properly.
Supporting local
In the regions that we travel tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by only working with local family run hotels and suppliers so your money supports the community that hosts you.
Paddock to Plate
The paddock to plate across Europe is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Guesthouses
We use quality guesthouses that have been picked for their charm. They are not luxury inns however we ensure they offer you a truly authentic experience.

Weather
Georgia has a warm, temperate climate. The Likhi mountain range divides the country into western and eastern halves, shielding the eastern part of the country from the influence of the Black Sea, and creating a continental climate.
The western part of the country can get humid and experiences rainfall throughout the year, although it is at its heaviest in the autumn and winter months.
In the east rainfall peaks in spring and winter is the driest season; although the mountainous areas receive a lot of rain, generally the amount of rainfall decreases with distance from the coast.
Time in Georgia
Georgia is +4 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
Georgian (official)
Currency
The official currency is the Lari (GEL), which is divided into 100 tetri.
Euros, Roubles or US Dollars can be exchanged at any of the widespread bureaux de change, but other currencies should be changed at the bank.
ATM machines can be found in the major cities.
International Dialing Code
+995
Electricity
Electricity in Georgia is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas are not required for passport holders from the following countries:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
Please note the following: The traveller must hold proof of sufficient funds, hold all documents required for the next destination and hold proof of return or onward tickets to next destination.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information.

We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
