With its handsome colonial cities, rich cultural heritage, remarkable landscapes and extraordinary biodiversity, Ecuador is perhaps the perfect introduction to South America.
From the snowcapped peaks and rolling green foothills of the Andes, to the lush rainforests and indigenous communities of the Amazon, and the unrivalled wildlife of the Galapagos Islands - this is a country of staggering beauty and diversity.
Fall in love with Quito, Ecuador's photogenic capital city, with its beautiful colonial buildings, relaxed ambiance and dramatic mountain setting; and admire the faded beauty of Cuenca's 16th century architecture.
Explore vibrant local culture in Otavalo, famous for its colourful indigenous markets; and experience a series of hair-raising switchbacks as you ride the famous Devil's Nose Train, one of the world's great rail journeys.
Discover the astounding beauty and abundant flora and fauna of Ecuador's rainforests at the award-winning Napo Wildlife Center and eco-lodge; or tackle a hike of Ecuador's highest peak, the Chimborazo, or the world's highest active volcano, Cotopaxi.
And last but not least, head to one of the world's greatest environmental treasure troves, the Galapagos Islands, to cruise through this spectacular archipelago and discover the unique wildlife that inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.
Take a look at our unique range of itineraries and join us as we explore this gem of South America.

Authentic experiences
From one of the world's greatest treasures of natural history, the Galapagos Islands, to the impressive peaks standing over 5000m including Cotopaxi and Chimborazo, our active itineraries in Ecuador prove to be inspiring adventures you will never forget.
Ultimate value
Our trips offer exceptional value for money, featuring good quality, centrally located accommodation and private transportation. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the tour cost such as most meals, entrance and permit fees and excursions.
Experienced local guides
The passion and professionalism possessed by our guides will leave you enlightened with a true sense of their homeland. They are eager to share their extensive local knowledge with you, adding a special and personal touch to your Ecuador adventure.
Small ship cruising
In the Galapagos Islands, our boats have been handpicked for their quality and size. Most boats accommodate a maximum of 16 passengers allowing you to enjoy your Galapagos cruise intimately.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Responsible sailing
On board boats we recycle paper, cans, glass and plastic and separate organic waste. We also return used oil from the boat engines to the mainland to be recycled.
Local supply purchases
We buy locally to support small businesses including produce from local farms and suppliers, coffee from a local plantation, bread from a local baking cooperative, chicken and meat raised on the islands and fish from the local fishermen.
Support of local communities
We support the Napo Wildlife Centre, a jungle lodge community completely managed and operated by a Kishwa indigenous community.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Haciendas
Also known as estates, haciendas offer authentic experiences with each boasting their own piece of history.
Cruising
Travel intimately aboard a small ship, accessing regions that big ships cannot. Cabins are typically twin share or multi-share with private facilities.

Health & Safety
Weather
The weather in Ecuador is unpredictable and it's not uncommon to experience all four seasons in a single day. Generally speaking, Ecuador has two seasons, wet and dry, but in a country as geographically diverse as Ecuador, local weather patterns vary greatly.
The mainland coastal areas and the Galápagos Islands are influenced by ocean currents and are hot and rainy between January and April and cool and dryer the rest of the year.
In the highlands, the dry season is between June and September and around Christmas, but even the mountains' wet season isn't particularly wet and the dry season sees its share of downpours. The central valley is generally spring like year round, with mild temperatures around 24°C (66°F).
Time in Ecuador
Ecuador is -5 hours behind GMT/UTC
Language
Spanish (Castillian) (official), Quechua
Currency
US Dollar
US dollars cash are the main currency of Ecuador.
Credit cards and ATM machines are available in large cities and hotels, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
International Dialing Code
+593
Electricity
Electricity in Ecuador is 120 Volts, at 60 hertz. The most common pin type is A. (2 flat prong).
Visas
A visa is exempt for passport holders from the following countries visiting Ecuador for short term tourism purposes:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
If you are travelling via any other countries en-route to Ecuador please ask your reservations consultant/travel agent about any other necessary visa requirements.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
