There are few destinations as diverse and exciting as Russia. With its cultured cities, alive with historic architecture and dynamic arts, scenic countryside and vast, dramatic wilderness spread out over the world?s largest land mass, this is a country of staggering depth and variety.
Without question, one of the finest ways to experience Russia's diversity is onboard the famous Trans Siberian railway, one of the world's most iconic train adventures.
Marvel at the museums, monuments and all-round grandeur of St Petersburg, Russia's imperial city. Head to The Hermitage Museum to admire one of the world's finest art collections, housed in a splendid cluster of 18th century palatial buildings; and see the historic Peter and Paul Fortress, one of St Petersburg's oldest and most important monuments.
Once in Moscow, head straight for the Red Square - the heart of Russia's majestic capital. Waiting for you here in this iconic public plaza is the magnificent St Basil's Cathedral, a masterpiece of Orthodox art with its fairytale candy-coloured domes; and the famous Kremlin, a fortified citadel complex of palaces and historic buildings that has been the epicentre of all religious and political activity in Russia since the 12th century.
From here, continue on to Irkutsk aboard the Trans Siberian, passing through a variety of scenic landscapes on this classic train journey. Take a look at our exciting range of itineraries and start planning your once-in-a-lifetime Russian adventure!

Responsible travel

Reducing waste
Our Waste Management Policy encourages our travellers to take their own reusable water bottles, coffee cups and reusable stuff sacks to avoid single use plastics. In the mountains of the Pyrenees and Mont Blanc our local partners reduce the amount of packaging taken on tour and ensure all waste is carried out from refuges that do not have road access to help dispose of it properly.
Supporting local
In the regions that we travel tourism is the main source of income for many local people. We support them by only working with local family run hotels and suppliers so your money supports the community that hosts you.
Paddock to Plate
The paddock to plate across Europe is one we encourage by choosing to work with accommodations that source produce from local farms. This provides you with fresher meals and ensures your money directly assists local economies.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Camping
Enjoy our fully supported camping in quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.

Leaders in the field
Elena Vasilyeva
Elena is an English-speaking guide with more than 10 years experience. Professionally educated in Moscow, Elena's main interest is in history and the arts. She loves visiting bazaars and local festivals and never misses a chance to chat with locals for new insights or to swap stories. She is knowledgeable, cheerful and has a wealth of experience in guiding groups.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want.

Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
