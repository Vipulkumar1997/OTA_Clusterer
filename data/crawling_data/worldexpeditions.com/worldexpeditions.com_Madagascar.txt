Isolated from Africa millions of years ago, Madagascar has evolved an incredibly rich ecology and a landscape that is as bizarre as it is unique. Home to one of the richest ecosystems on earth, the island is teeming with cartoon-quirky wildlife and nearly a quarter of all of Africa's flowering plants.
This thoroughly captivating destination is blessed with diverse natural beauty ranging from lush rainforests to arid rust-coloured landscapes and jagged limestone outcrops. The spirited Malagasy people are unfailingly polite and hospitable, with a rich culture that is as unique as the rest of the island.
Don your pack and boots and explore Madagascar's striking wilderness on foot, trek through the Bongolava Mountains and canoe down the stunning Manombolo River. See dramatic 'forests' of limestone pinnacles at the World Heritage Listed Tsingy de Bemaraha, witness one of Africa's most iconic sights at the Avenue of the Baobabs and enjoy the palm-fringed beaches and turquoise waters of dazzling Nosy Be.
Marvel at the island's diverse landscapes and abundant wildlife in its spectacular collection of national parks, including Isalo, Andringitra and Ranomafana, where you can practice your photography skills on tropical flowers, ancient trees, spirited lemurs and deadpan chameleons.
Join us as we explore the best of this fascinating treasure trove of exotic flora and fauna!

Why travel with us
Leaders in responsible travel
Responsible travel practice is at the heart of our Madagascar adventures. Our trips provide a true wilderness experience by viewing wildlife in their natural habitat, supporting the conservation of rare fauna and flora and aiming to protect the natural environments and local communities.
Authentic experiences
Our Madagascar program is an exceptional introduction to the so-called eighth continent with elements to suit every age, interest and fitness level. Whether it be hiking, canoeing or wildlife viewing, our Masagascar adventure provides opportunities to encounter the nation's culture in its true form.
Ultimate value
All of our Madagascar tours feature well-maintained private vehicles with experienced drivers, handpicked comfortable hotels, fascinating touring options and helpful camping crews. Additionally, we try to incorporate as many inclusions as possible in the trip cost such as most meals, transfers, excursions, permits and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
Our enthusiastic and friendly guides have a deep love of the Malagasy culture, nature reserves and diverse ecosystems and enjoy sharing their extensive knowledge with you. From the national park guides to our local porters, you will be treated like extended family as you embark on the adventure of a lifetime.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Development of local communities
Our local partner assists families to develop their homes to cater to travellers. They then train the families in hospitality so that they are ready to welcome tourists into their homes and benefit from the income. Our itineraries are developed to utilise these homestays.
Protection of wildlife
Our forest trekking guides ensure that travellers stay quiet, walk in a single file line and do not leave the trail in order to minimise the disturbance of wildlife and to preserve the vegetation.
Habitat preservation
While we participate in reforestation projects, all guides are trained to preserve the native plants and trees.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 star, twin share properties that are centrally located, comfortable and reliable.
Camping
We offer two styles of camping; fully supported and semi-participation. Both styles feature quality two person tents erected in scenic wilderness.
Permanent safari camps
Like a tented hotel room, this is the perfect way to experience the African wilderness. We use 3 star comfortable properties that reflect the character of the area.

Leaders in the field
Thierry Andrianirinantenaina
Thierry has been an adventure guide for the past 14 years. The chameleon is his favourite animal due to its ability to adapt to the environment. His experience and love of diverse local cultures and natural environments makes him an excellent and highly experienced guide for our Madagascar and Mauritius adventures.
Ian Williams
Ian lives and breathes the bush and is known as the "Africa Guru". It would be a hard task to determine where Ian has not travelled in Africa over the past 40 years! He is a keen photographer and is passionate about all things African. His in-depth knowledge is integral to the itineraries he organises for our Africa private and school groups.
Gesine (Gus) Cheung
From Cairo to the Cape and beyond, Gus' travels have taken her to the roof of Africa (Kilimanjaro), the 'Big 5' in South Africa, Tanzania's annual migration, Botswana's Okavango Delta, Rwanda's Mountain Gorillas, Namibia, Zanzibar's beaches, majestic Victoria Falls, Morocco, Turkey, Iran, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Oman and Jordan. Gus' usual mode of transport is her own two feet, so don't be surprised if you see her out on an African trail sometime.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it. If you love our current itineraries but want to customise it privately as a couple, a group of friends, family, club, business or school, you have the freedom to add or remove as many elements as you like to suit the interests of your group. Alternatively, you can start with a blank canvas and create a new and exciting itinerary from scratch! Our well-travelled consultants can give you firsthand suggestions and eliminate any uncertainty with trip planning to ensure you maximise the quality of your experience and get truly off the beaten track. Simply email, phone or visit us to start planning your dream adventure.

Where to Go
Enjoy palm-fringed beaches and turquoise waters on the island of Nosy Be
Head to Isalo National Park for striking sandstone outcrops and lush forested canyons
See dramatic ‘forests’ of limestone in Tsingy de Bemaraha Strict Nature Reserve
Jump in a canoe and paddle down the stunning Manombolo River
Don your pack and boots and explore Madagascar’s striking wilderness on foot
Practice your photography skills on tropical flowers, ancient trees, spirited lemurs and deadpan chameleons
Marvel at the Avenue of the Baobabs, one of Africa’s most iconic sights
Experience unique Malagasy culture at markets, museums and festivals
Weather
Madagascar has two main seasons: a hot, wet season from November–April, and a cool, dry season from May–October. However, climate varies across the island based on elevation and proximity to trade winds/monsoon winds. The south is protected from moisture-bearing winds and remains arid, with the southwest in particular being almost desert-like.
Tropical cyclones are a major feature of Madagascar’s climate. Forming far out in the Indian Ocean, they bring heavy rains and destructive flooding to the east coast between December–March.
July is the coolest month, and December/January are the warmest months. Generally speaking, temperatures decrease with elevation, being coolest on the plateau and warmest on the northwest coast.
In Antananarivo, average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of 16.6°C (61.9°F) to a maximum of 27.7°C (81.9°F) in January, to a minimum of 10.3°C (50.5°F) to a maximum of 20.2°C (68.4°F) in July.
Time in Madagascar
Madagascar is +3 hours ahead of UTC/GMT
Language
French (official), Malagasy (official), English
Malagasy belongs to the Austronesian language family, a widely dispersed group that includes Japanese, Filipino/Tagalog, Malay/Indonesian, Hawaiian, Rapa Nui and many other languages throughout Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
French has been an official language on the island since 1958; it is used as a language of education, law and business and is widely spoken among Madagascar’s educated population.
English is spoken by an increasing number of people, but it is not yet widespread. Knowledge of basic Malagasy and/or French will be very useful throughout the island.
Additional foreign languages are spoken by the island’s Indian, Pakistani, Chinese and Comorian communities.
Currency
Malagasy Ariary
It is advisable to carry Euro’s in cash, mostly in notes smaller than €100 as banks, hotels and change bureaus don’t readily accept notes larger than €100. Do not try to change money "on the streets" as the black market is illegal and you risk having your money stolen or being arrested and fined by plain-clothes government agents.
Banks are generally open from 0800-1100 and from 1400-1630, Monday-Friday.
You can also change money in your hotel - the rate of exchange is about 5% less than that of the bank. You should always get a receipt when changing money.
Try to ask for some small denomination notes in the local currency as change is often scarce in the rural areas
Major credit cards (Visa and Mastercard) are accepted in larger hotels and some shops in main cities. Expect larger merchant fees.
ATM’s are located in major towns and cities only (ie. Antananarivo, Morondava, Antsirabe, Fianarantsoa, Toliara). Visa is accepted at all ATM’s. Mastercard is accepted at some but not all.
International Dialing Code
+261
Electricity
Electricity in Madagascar is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. The most common pin type is C. (2 round prong).
Visas
Visas are required for Madagascar for a stay of less than 90 days for passport holders from the following countries:-
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
A single entry visa can be obtained upon arrival at the airport in Antananarivo, provided your passport is valid for at least 6 months beyond the last day of the intended stay in Madagascar, and provided that you have an airline-issued ticket or passenger receipt confirming your intention to leave Madagascar within 60 days.
From 1 January 2016, the approximate visa fees (subject to change) are:
For a stay up to 30 days - 31 Euros per person (payable in Cash)
For a stay from 31 days to 60 days - 39 Euros per person (payable in Cash)
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
