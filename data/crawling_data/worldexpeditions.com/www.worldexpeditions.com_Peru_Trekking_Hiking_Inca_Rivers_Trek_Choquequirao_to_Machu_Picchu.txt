Trip highlights
Undertake a remote and unique trek along the spectacular Vilcabamba Mountain Range between two sacred Inca Rivers & enjoy 3 hearty meals a day on trek prepared by our cook
Explore the magnificent and remote ‘lost’ Inca ruins of Choquequirao, and experience an incredible and very rarely seen view of Machu Picchu against dramatic mountains from the Inca site at Patallacta
Discover ancient Machu Picchu as the sun rises
Take in the historic city of Cusco, the royal capital of the Inca Empire
Embark on scenic walk in the Sacred Valley to view ancient Inca salt pans
Stunning views of snow-covered Andean peaks, ancient cloud forest, abundant wildflowers and the Inca ruins of Choquequirao are just some of the highlights of this outstanding trek.  Our route follows a mountain traverse between two sacred Inca rivers - to the west the Apurimac and to the east the Urubamba. These mighty rivers are the main tributaries of the Amazon. Between them lies the great Vilcabamba Mountain Range - the last stronghold of the Inca Empire. Unique to this area is the spectacular 'lost' ruins of Choquequirao. Built by the Incas in the 15th century, like Machu Picchu, it became lost in high jungle which engulfed the ruins until being rediscovered in the early 20th century. A day is set aside to explore this impressive site before continuing our trek to the Inca site at Patallacta which provides a stunning and rarely seen view of our final destination - Machu Picchu.

More info about grading system
6
Moderate to Challenging
This trip is graded moderate to challenging and is suitable for fit and healthy people. Prior trekking is not necessary, although you would be expected to be comfortable in the outdoors and enjoy camping for successive days. These adventures involve trekking for up to 6 - 8 hours a day at a steady pace and may include longer days up to 10 hours. These trips may spend successive days at altitudes not generally exceeding 5,500m and the actual treks are usually between 10 and 15 days in duration. You will need a good level of fitness and be in good health. 
*Suggested preparation: 45 minutes of aerobic type exercise, three to five times a week for the three months leading up to your trip. Hill walking with a pack in variable weather conditions is also recommended. To prepare for a walking holiday we recommend you take every opportunity to walk up and down stairs and/or hills, for leg strengthening and aerobic fitness. Please remember the fitter you are the more you will enjoy your holiday.

Day 1
Arrive Cusco
You'll be met by your guide and transferred from Cusco airport to our hotel for a short initial briefing and then a few hours of rest, essential to initiate successful acclimatisation. In the evening you'll have a longer briefing to discuss aspects of the itinerary & in particular the trek.
Meals:
Nil
Day 2
After breakfast we take a tour of the city and nearby ruins.
Every alleyway we enter or corner we turn brings another surprise or enigma in the form of the superbly constructed Inca walls or the more architecturally extravagant colonial churches and palaces. The city, once capital of the extensive Inca Empire, has seen many changes since Francisco Pizarro's men took the city with such apparent ease in November 1533. We also take a short drive to visit the monolithic walls of Sacsayhuaman, spectacularly set above the city. In the afternoon you may have time to explore some of the central parts of the city and a chance to look at some of the great varieties of local craft work on sale in open air stalls and shop.
Meals:
B
Day 3
Drive and walk down into the Sacred Valley of the Incas.
We leave Cusco and head to the Chinchero Plateau from where we get impressive views of three mountain ranges. We then down through the remarkable Inca Salt Pans below Maras. We end up in the Sacred Valley near a good restaurant where we can savour dishes made with locally grown produce. After a leisurely lunch we head for our hotel in the valley. The rest of the day is free to relax and enjoy beauty of this famous valley.
Meals:
B
Day 4
Second day in the Sacred Valley of the Incas.
Another day in this beautiful place. The valley actually follows the course of the famous Urubamba River, one of the main tributaries of the Amazon River. During our time in the here we visit some of the enthralling citadels, fortresses and temple ruins that are found along the valley including the site at Ollantaytambo. The village itself is a fascinating mixture of Inca and Colonial architecture. If the weather is good and we have time we can enjoy some short walks in the valley - a good way to prepare for the trek ahead. The evening is spent preparing for the trek at our hotel.
Meals:
B
Day 5
Drive to Trailhead at Capuliyoc to start trek.
Today you will be collected from your Sacred Valley hotel for the drive (approx 5 hours) to the trail head. On the way we stop in the famous Sayhuite carved rock for a short visit.

B,L,D
Day 7
Full day exploring Choquequirao
This morning after breakfast we explore this marvellous site, which actually is larger than Machu Picchu! There are many similarities with Machu Picchu, this enigmatic monumental site was also built during the mid to late 15th century, it became lost for many centuries as the high jungle in this area soon covered the ruins and it was re-discovered by Hiram Bingham in the early 20th Century.

Meals:
B,L,D
Day 9
Trek Pinchi Unuyoc to Maizal
Descend approximately 2 hours to the Rio Blanco and then ascend 4 hours through some beautiful cloud forest all the way to Maizal (3085mts) for lunch. Walking time/distance: approx 6 hours/8km.
