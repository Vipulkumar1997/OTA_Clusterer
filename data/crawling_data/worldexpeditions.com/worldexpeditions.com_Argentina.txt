With its cosmopolitan cities, passionate culture and staggering natural beauty, Argentina is a destination that's difficult to top.
From the formidable peaks of the Andes and the stunning frozen wilderness of Patagonia, to the to the vast grassy plains of the Pampas, lush rainforests, pristine beaches, Wild West canyons and thundering waterfalls - it's hard to imagine a place with a wider variety of spectacular landscapes. And with the buzzing energy of its cities, you'll quickly fall for Argentina's culture, cuisine and architecture.
Soak up incredible culture and nightlife in Buenos Aires, the "Paris of South America" and birthplace of the sensual Tango. Explore elegant colonial architecture in Córdoba and experience the country's thriving arts scene in the romantic small city of Salta, Argentina's cradle of folklore.
Trek among the mountains, glaciers and icy landscapes of Patagonia's Los Glaciares National Park, watch for southern right whales, orcas, elephant seals and sea lions on the Península Valdés, and head to Iguazu to witness one of the world's largest and most spectacular waterfalls.
Explore ancient ruins, hike among spectacular mountains, forests and alpine lakes, horse ride across dramatic rolling grasslands, or for the truly adventurous, join a challenging expedition to Mount Aconcagua, South America's highest peak and one of the world's Seven Summits.
Whether you want to tour the highlights in comfort or push yourself with an exciting active adventure, our unique itineraries are tailored to get you deep into the heart of this extraordinary destination.

Where to Go

Explore the fascinating ruins of the Jesuit Missions of the Guaranis, set deep in the tropical forestlands of the indigenous Guaraní
For the fit and adventurous, join an expedition to Mount Aconcagua, South America’s highest peak and one of the world’s Seven Summits
Explore the waterways and islands of the Tigre Delta, and don’t miss the stunning Tigre Club building, now home to the Museo de Arte Tigre

Hit the slopes of the Patagonian Andes in winter for skiing and winter sport fun
Try your hand at watersports or just relax on one of Argentina’s stunning beaches
Head to the town of Gualeguaychú to celebrate Argentina’s most extravagant Carnival celebrations

Catch a live performance of the Argentine tango, the country’s sexually-charged national dance, at one of Buenos Aires’ theatres or milongas (dance clubs)
Devour some famous Argentine beef at one of the country’s many barbecue restaurants
Weather
The climate in the north of Argentina is hot (tropical and sub tropical); in the centre the weather is temperate; in the northern highlands, it's dry while the coldest conditions are experienced in the south, in the mountains of Tierra del Fuego.
The trekking season lasts all year round. During winter it's possible to trek in the north, in the jungle and desert areas, and during summer in the south – Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.
The best time for climbing in the Aconcagua region is from December to March. The weather then is relatively stable, but be warned the weather can still change completely in a matter of hours. The winds can be very strong. Needless to say, on days like that, we stay put. It can also get extremely cold on the upper slopes of the mountain; temperatures can drop to -20°C or lower with the wind chill factor. Warm clothes and a good down jacket are essentials items for the climb.
Mendoza, at 760m, enjoys a Mediterranean style climate in summer, as a result of a rain shadow effect from Aconcagua and other Andean peaks that separate it from the Pacific Ocean and prevailing weather. The region has a consistent supply of water, however, from rivers that are fed by nearby glaciers, and make it well suited to irrigation style farming such as vineyards and olives.
Time in Argentina
Argentina is -3 hours behind UTC/GMT
Language
Spanish (official), Italian, English, German, French, indigenous languages (Mapudungun, Quechua)
Spanish is most definitely the national language, although here it is spoken with several different regional accents, and includes many borrowed words from other languages, in particular Italian. Many different European languages (and dialects/accents within those) can be heard throughout the country, especially Italian, which is still widely spoken in Buenos Aires.
A curious lingua franca called Lunfardo developed in Buenos Aires towards the end of the 19th century, composed of many different languages including Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, German and different African languages. Lunfardo was developed as a common slang language by the city’s criminal underworld, and was then picked up by lower classes, then spread to all classes from the start of the 20th century. The language can often be heard in the lyrics of tango music.
Currency
Argentinian Peso
US dollars are easily changed.
Credit card facilities and ATM’s are available in most major cities, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
International Dialing Code
+54
Electricity
Electricity in Argentina is 220 Volts, at 50 hertz. The pin types used are C and I.
Visas
A visa is exempt for passport holders from the following countries visiting Argentina for short term tourism purposes:
Australia
New Zealand
Canada
United States
United Kingdom
For all other nationalities and longer stays please contact the relevant embassy.
ARGENTINA RECIPROCITY FEE:
Canadian passport holders (only) are required to prepay a “reciprocity fee” prior to entering Argentina by any means (land, sea or air).
The fees at the time of writing are as follows (note these are subject to change).
Canada: US$75
The reciprocity fee must be prepaid online using the steps below:
1) Enter the web site http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/vsrvbapro.php and ‘sign up’ to start the process.
2) Complete the form with the corresponding personal and credit card information.
3) Print the payment receipt.
4) On arrival in Argentina, this printed receipt must be presented at Immigration Control. The receipt will be scanned by the Immigration officials, the information will be checked, and the traveller’s entry to the country registered.
Please note you will be unable to enter the country unless this process is completed prior to your arrival.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
