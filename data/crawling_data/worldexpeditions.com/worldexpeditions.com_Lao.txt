Lush, languid and welcoming, it's easy to see why travellers are lured back to Laos. With its meandering rivers, remote villages and tranquil cities, Laos is famous for a gentle pace that invites you to slow down, relax and absorb your surroundings.
But this is by no means a boring destination: Laos's cities are a unique mix of golden Buddhist temples, French colonial architecture and colourful markets, thick with aromas of incense and fragrant street food, and yet you need not travel far to find waterfalls, caves and jungle-clad mountains to explore.
You can tour splendid temples and handsome colonial architecture in Vientiane, and unwind in the tranquil river city of Luang Prabang, with its saffron-robed monks and vibrant night markets. Then delve into the history of Southeast Asia by visiting the ancient Hindu Khmer ruins of Wat Phu or walking among the mysterious stone megaliths of the Plain of Jars.
Enjoy Laos's wild natural beauty with a cruise down the lush waterways of the mighty Mekong or a sojourn in the stunning 4,000 Islands of southern Laos. Don your boots and trek through the remote northern mountains, join one of our superb cycle journeys through scenic backroads and ethnic minority villages, or kayak down rivers fringed with dramatic karst outcrops.
Whichever itinerary you choose, you'll love the unique landscapes, cultures, cuisine and ambiance of this unspoiled gem of Southeast Asia.

Laos highlights

Cycle through local villages
Explore villages at handlebar level to meet Lao people and learn about local culture and traditions.
See the hundreds of Buddha statues in the Pak Ou Caves
Hundreds of very small and mostly damaged wooden Buddhist figures are laid out over the wall shelves that have been added to over many centuries.
Enter the Golden Stupa in Vientiane
Gaze up at Pha That Luang, one of the most significant monuments of Laos. Covered in gold, this signifies the splendour of Laos.
Walk around the Plain of Jars in Phonsovan
Of an unknown ancient origin and purpose, these large carved stone jars will get your imagination going as you ponder why they were originally built.
Kayak down river in Vang Vieng
Surrounded by dramatic lime kast hills, the river snakes its way past this lake side town. Paddle and admire the stunning scenery of river and rock formations.
Hike to Kuang Si waterfall from Luang Prabang
See Lao ethnic minority villages as you make your way to arguably one of the most beautiful waterfalls in the world.
Stroll the streets of Luang Prabang
Definitely a must see in Laos is this beautiful town which lies on the banks of the Mekong River tributaries.
Journey to the river region of the 4000 islands
The views of stumbling water and lush vegetation around the waterfalls are nothing short of spectacular.








xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Why travel with us
Authentic experiences
Our adventures are designed to take you off the well-trodden tourist trails and gain insight into life on this side of the world. Whether you choose a cycling or hiking adventure, travelling under your own steam is an incredibly rewarding way to explore the hidden gem of Laos.
Ultimate value
Quality services at the best prices make our Laos adventures great value for money. While all of our cycle trips include bikes and back up support vehicles, accommodations have been chosen based on their location and local charm. Additionally, we aim to incorporate as many inclusions in the trip cost as possible including most meals, transfers, domestic flights and national park fees.
Experienced local guides
It is our expert field guides that make your Laos experience special. Not only are our guides passionate about the otudoors, but they choose to lead our trips with a deep belief that our itineraries minimise our environmental footprint and give back to local communities.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Responsible travel

Support of local communities
We employ staff from local communities and provide them with training, good wages and insurance benefits under the labor law. We also use locally run accommodation and encourage travellers to shop and dine at locally operated stalls and establishments.
Carbon travel minimisation
Our itineraries are designed to minimise the amount of carbon produced, opting for bikes, city walks, cyclos and electric cars as first options.
Child safe tourism
We protect vulnerable children by adhering to our comprehensive Child Welfare Code of Conduct and seek to educate travellers about the issues surrounding such abuses.
Animal welfare focus
We advocate against the practice of riding on the back of an elephant as part of a tourism experience and as such, we do not include elephant rides in any of our Cambodia itineraries. In the interest of public safety and animal welfare we also discourage travellers from partaking in such activities outside of our trips.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Accommodation
Hotels
In cities or large towns you will be accommodated in 3 to 4 star properties that are centrally located, atmospheric and reliable.
Inns
We use quality inns situated in natural environments. They are not luxury inns; however we ensure they offer you a truly authentic experience.
Lodges
Our lodges provide comfortable accommodation that is well maintained and with good facilities.







xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?
Leaders in the field
Nom Vannak Nom
Nom joined the tourism industry in 1999 after completing a Tourism degree in Siem Reap. His interest in adventure tourism propelled him into a career of taking travellers walking and cycling across many regions of Indochina. A great communicator, his genuine interest in nature and history make him an exceptional guide.
'Joy' Chittanong
Joy is one of our favourite guides for adventure tours in Laos. Joy lives in Luang Prabang, and has over seven years experience guiding a great variety of adventures from hiking and trekking to kayaking and biking. If you travel with this young, dynamic and super friendly man, you will always find the joys of exploring the stunning back roads, hills and rivers of Laos.
Laura Kirk
Originally from the United Kingdom, Laura brings a wealth of travel experience to the World Expeditions team having explored over 60 countries to date. Her adventures have included setting up community projects in Myanmar, studying Mandarin in China, trekking in Nepal, spending time in a remote Bedouin camp in Jordan and chasing the Big 5 through Tanzania. With a particular passion for all things Asia, Laura loves to share the best of this region with others.
Dr Ross Anderson
Dr Anderson lives with his wife in a small town near the Lakes District in the north of England. He is a family doctor and spends much of his spare time travelling as an expedition doctor. He has more than 10 years of altitude and travel medicine experience. Previous treks and expeditions have focused on the Himalayas, with others in the Scandinavian Arctic and mountainous areas of Africa. He also enjoys trail running, cycling and open-water swimming.










Custom made itineraries

A custom made itinerary is the ultimate way to see the world how YOU want. They are created especially for you, giving you complete freedom to choose what you want to see, where you want to go and when you want to do it.

Laos has a tropical monsoon climate with three distinct seasons:
A rainy/monsoon season from May to October, a cool dry season from November to February, and a hot dry season from March to April.
April is the hottest month. It is necessary to take along a warm jumper or fleece during the cool season as nights can be cool, especially in mountainous areas such as Luang Prabang. Between March and June, light cotton clothing and hats are recommended.
On average you can expect daytime temperatures of between 25-32°C (77-90°F), with cooler night temperatures.
In Vientiane, average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of 16.4°C (62°F) to a maximum of 28.4°C (83°F) in January; to a minimum of 24.7°C (76°F) to a maximum of 31.3°C (88°F) in July.
In Luang Prabang, average daily temperatures vary from a minimum of 14.2°C (58°F) to a maximum of 27.7°C (82°F) in January; to a minimum of 24.3°C (76°F) to a maximum of 32.5°C (91°F) in July.

Currency
Laotian Kip
Thai Baht and USD are the best currencies to exchange although AUD, GBP, NZD are also excepted.
Banks and exchange facilities are found in Luang Prabang, Vang Vieng and Vientiane.
Visa cards and ATM are available in most major centres, however it is not recommended to rely on these solely.
If you are purchasing items of over US$50 it is best not to change this into Lao kip as you will require a small back pack to carry all the notes!
International Dialing Code
+856
Electricity
Electricity in Laos is 230 Volts, at 50 hertz. The pin type varies but is most commonly types A and C. We recommend taking a universal adapter.

It is possible for citizens of the above countries to obtain a visa on arrival in Laos at MOST airports and land border crossings. You will need two passport photos and USD$35 cash (subject to change without notice) with you at the point of arrival. Please check with your consultant about you entry point into Laos if you intend to get your visa on arrival.
As of February 2017 a new tourist arrival tax has been introduced on arrival. The cost is USD$2.25 and it will be collected on arrival in Laos.
All other nationalities should check with your nearest embassy or consulate.
Safety
Your safety is our number one concern. Our safety track record is exemplary thanks to careful management and thorough consultation with local partners. Our industry leading risk management procedures have become a skill that we continue to refine. Our leaders in the field are highly trained and have safety as their number one priority. Expert leaders, risk assessments, quality inclusions and your financial security all come standard when you travel with us.
Please refer to our Travel Advisory page for updates on recent events, travel warnings and advice.
We strongly recommend that all clients take out travel insurance at the time of booking to cover against sickness, accident, loss of baggage, unexpected alterations to travel arrangements and travel disruption, emergency evacuation, cancellations, etc. Insurance information is enclosed with your pre-departure information. Please contact us if you would like to obtain a quote for your trip duration.
We suggest that you consult your doctor, local government inoculation centre or a travel medical specialist in order to get the most current advice regarding vaccination requirements.
Money and valuables should always be stored safely when travelling. Keep your passport with you at all times and do not leave it in your main luggage. You will need it to change money and check into hotels. Where safety deposit boxes are available, we recommend that you use them. Keep jewellery and valuables to a minimum.
