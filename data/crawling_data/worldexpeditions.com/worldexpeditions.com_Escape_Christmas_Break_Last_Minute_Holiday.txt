Escape for The Holidays


6 Last-Minute Christmas Break Ideas




Finish the year on a high? Follow the historic route to Everest Base Camp or summit the ‘roof of Africa’.

Away for two weeks? Discover Mexico’s fascinating past, embark on a wilderness adventure in Namibia or soak up the atmosphere in Indochina.


Whatever the reason, if you have no plans for the upcoming holidays yet, you still have time to plan a last minute trip for a Christmas break. We have availability on a number of guaranteed departures in December, including the following six…







Discover Mexico's fascinating past

Take in the glory of Mexico, from frenetic Mexico City to the spectacular heritage of the Aztec and Maya empires, and from seemingly timeless colonial sites to vast areas of outstanding natural beauty. Highlights include: the National Museum of Anthropology, home to one of the world’s largest collections of pre-Hispanic artefacts; the ‘White City’ of Merida; the soaring jungle-swathed temples of Palenque; and of course Chichen Itza, the best preserved Maya site on the Yucatan peninsula.

Follow the historic route to Everest Base Camp

This trek is designed to fulfil the dream of many adrenaline-seekers to experience the historic route to the base of the world’s highest mountain. After a slow ascent through picturesque Sherpa villages, visiting traditional monasteries and enjoying the spectacular scenery, the trip culminates with a fine opportunity to trek to both Everest Base Camp and the nearby peak of Kala Pattar for spectacular views of the mighty Mount Everest.

Soak up the atmosphere in Southeast Asia

Cycle from the fast-paced city of Ho Chi Minh City to the famed temple complex of Angkor Wat. Following the quieter roads to the Cu Chi Tunnels, you will cross through to Cambodia and on to the traditional seaside fishing village of Kep, taking in the lush green countryside and fertile rice fields. Absorb the exquisite French-inspired architecture of Phnom Penh before visiting the renowned complex of Angkor – the flat roads around the temples make exploration of the area ideal by bike!

Embark on an in-depth wilderness adventure in Namibia

From game viewing in Etosha to interacting with a Himba Tribe, this two-week journey in Namibia, a country known for its vastness and harsh beauty, promises stunning desert colours, wildlife that has adapted to an arid environment, ancient rock art, living fossils and a heritage borne of both European and indigenous traditions. Your in-depth Namibian experience will be rounded off by visits to several working projects influential in the conservation of African Big Cats, such as cheetah and lions.

Summit the 'roof of Africa'

Approaching the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro by the remote Shira Route is an exhilarating option for hikers keen to explore less trodden trails. From forests and moorland to rock formations and ice fields, enjoy stunning early morning views of Kibo and spend time in the rarely visited Lent Hills before heading to Uhuru Peak, on the crater rim. The itinerary gives maximum possible acclimatisation and flexibility to take in the scenery, from the volcanic summit to the vast plains.

Cycle to Mount Popa for Asia’s finest collection of temples in Bagan, savour witness the sunset from the top of Mandalay Hill, trek off the beaten track on Shan Plateau and kayak on Inle Lake among the stilt houses and floating gardens of the hospitable Intha people.
