This is a very impressively run hostel, with close attention to minimising waste, recycling and general eco-awareness. All rubbish is segregated, and minimising water usage is encouraged. The hostel itself is very comfortable and welcoming with a really nice relaxed atmosphere. Communal areas are cozy and nicely decorated. Staff are amazing, offering vegan brownies in support of feeding street dogs. Kitchen was spotless had a great atmosphere for cooking and meeting fellow travellers. Lastly the beds are above average size and rooms are spacious. I really enjoyed my stay here and have been recommending this place to everyone I meet traveling to Santiago!

Nous avons loué une chambre privée pour 3. Ambiance calme, très belle auberge de jeunesse, très bon petit déjeuner. Un petit peu excentré du centre-ville, mais ça se fait bien à pied et c'est proche d'une grande artère pour restos (les meilleurs de la ville sont dans le coin), location de voiture, banques...

Je recommande vivement!

Buen lugar para pasar la noche, buena ubicación y seguro.

Las instalaciones un poco deterioradas, no ofrecen toallas, ni siquiera de mano en el baño, se cancela $1.000 el arriendo de una. Se tardaron 1 hora más para poder hacer el check in...no limpiaron la habitación el día siguiente y cobraron $10.000 pesos más de lo que decía el anuncio, aparte de los impuestos.

Como puntos a favor, la mayoría del personal era muy simpático. Tiene una muy buena ubicación, cerca del metro y de muchos lugares para comer y divertirse.

Très bon accueil par un groupe de jeunes qui tranche avec la façade grise quelque peu austère de l'hôtel.Ambiance plutôt cool et sympathique, propreté correcte.

La proximité du centre et du Palacio de la Moneda en fait un atout considérable pour qui veut éviter les longs déplacements.





















2/10 et je suis généreux, malgrés un prix avantageux et des hotes agréable, trés mauvaises nuits à coté d'une fenêtre ou des voitures passe toute la nuit. Salle de bains trés salle avec un débit d'eau frolant le goute par goute "pratique pour ce laver les cheveux" et le summum on nous à voler des vetements dans nos valises, le top.

Je ne recommande à personne cette auberge, par contre je vous conseil le sandbar pour faire la fete.
