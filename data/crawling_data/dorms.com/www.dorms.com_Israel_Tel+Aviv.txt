Océane

Nous avons passé un très bon moment dans cette auberge. L'ambiance est très cool, un peu bohème, très détendue, mais aussi énergique.

L'équipe est très sympa, et de bons conseils. Ils organisent des soirées de tous types, auxquelles on est libres de participer ou pas. Le rooftop est juste incroyable.

Les ventilos, la clim et la piscine ont été d'une grande aide (nous y sommes allées la première semaine d'août).

Le petit déj est top, et les lits sont réglos. Tout est propre.

On accède à la ville en 10min, et les vélos en location (à prix très abordables) permettent d'accéder au centre très rapidement. La plage est tout près.

Bref, grosse recommandation !
