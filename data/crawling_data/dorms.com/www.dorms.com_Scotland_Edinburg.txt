Welcome to Edinburgh


‘Auld Reekie’ is crammed with a volcanic amount of things to do. Literally. With ancient volcano and modern architecture rubbing along side by side and the iconic Edinburgh Castle watching out across the city, the ‘Athens of the North’ has something for groups and backpackers, culture-vultures and comedy diehards alike.
One of the most desirable cities to live in the UK, Edinburgh will tempt you out of your dorm and lead you on a merry dance around a city centre overflowing with things to do.  And with grand-but-cheap and gloriously shabby-chic hostels downtown, you can properly live the Edinburgh experience without breaking the bank.
Just a hop, skip and jump from the city centre youth hostels are bars and shops, museums and the great outdoors that will help you work up a non-too-wee appetite.  Time to jump into the Scotland’s beating heart and have a mense time youth hostelling in Scotland’s capital.

Essential information





















Hike up to Arthur’s Seat































Leave the hostel behind and spend a day cavorting in what some think was Camelot. Rising 250m out of the grasslands of Holyrood Park, the extinct volcano will appeal to the rugged adventurer and give you a cracking view across the city. In a May Day tradition, young women wash their faces in the hills morning dew to make themselves beautiful – but it’s pretty refreshing for anyone at any time of year.


District:
Holyrood

Window Shopping on Victoria Street































Even backpackers have an inner fashion freak. Indulge yours on the gloriously curvy Victoria Street. Start at George IV Bridge and pretend-spend all the way to Grassmarket. It’s all there: on-trend fashion in Swish to timeless tweeds in Walker Slater, sniffable tomes in The Old Town Bookshop and stinky cheeses in Ij Mellis.

Old Town

The Meadow






























Absorb the Edinburgh sun or shelter in the dappled shade of the trees alongside Edinburgh University students taking a break from lectures. A grassy bridge between the Old Town and Southside, it’s a great place to stop on the way for a wander around the calmer suburban village.

With so many festivals in summer, Edinburgh costs a fortune at that time of year, so visit at another time of year. Or book really early!

Get off the beaten track:

Airport

Edinburgh Airport is 8 miles (12km) west of the city. There are several ways into the city. The Airlink 100service is a 24-hour shuttle bus between Edinburgh Airport and Waverley Bridge (near Princes Street and the main rail and bus stations). It leaves from Stop D and runs every 10 minutes at peak times, taking about 30 minutes to reach Waverley Bridge. A single costs £4.50. Tickets are available from the driver, the bus stop, the airport information desk or online at www.flybybus.com.

If you get in out of hours (between 00:47 and 04:17, 7 nights a week), the N22 night bus heads into the city and Ocean Terminal in Leith via South Gyle. It runs every 30 minutes and takes 28 minutes to get to Waverley Steps, with a £3 flat fare that gives you unlimited travel for one night.

For a more round-the-houses drive in, going by RBS World Headquarters, the Scottish Parliament and the Palace of Holyroodhouse, take the number 35 bus. It leaves from Stop F and runs every 15 minutes Monday to Saturday daytime and every 30 minutes evenings and Sundays. The journey takes about an hour, and a single is just £1.50.

Tram

The tram is a quick way in from the airport to the city centre and the hostels. Pick up a ticket from a vending machine at the airport tram stop. A single ticket to the city costs £5, but that rises to £10 if you buy on board. Trams take about 20 mins to reach the city centre.

Rail

Edinburgh Waverley Station is getting a face-lift, but it still has all the usual cafes and services and car hire places you expect from a large rail hub. There are some lovely train journeys along the west coast and to St Andrews, which takes you over the Forth Bridge. Or for a quick jaunt, hop on a train out to Berwick-upon-Tweed for a bit of coastal action.

Getting around

Tram

The tram, with its 15 stops, is a quick way to get around town – and you can now take a bike on the tram too. Single tickets within the City Zone (excluding the Airport Zone) cost £1.50, and 24-hour DAYticket passes covering tram and bus cost £4 (or £9 including the Airport Zone).

Bus

Download the
Transport for Edinburgh app
from the Apple App Store or Google Play to make paying bus fares super easy. Load your phone with m-tickets and the app will let you know when the next bus or tram will be with you.

Buses (except Airlink) are exact-fare only, so you must have the exact change or use an m-ticket. Drivers have no change, so the m-ticket is the way to go if you don’t think you’ll be able to keep the correct change.

Bike

A great way to get around, especially when the weather is good. Bike rental can cost between £15 and £20 a day or £70 and £90 a week. The Cycle Scotland shop is just a 7-minute walk from the station, in the heart of the Old Town. They can also recommend some cycle paths or hook you up with a guide.

Taxis

You can flag down a taxi if it has its light on. At night, going to a taxi rank is the best option (if you call a cab, you’re likely charged about 80p extra). Marshalls at taxi ranks will help you out. Be aware, though, that if you’ve had one too many and the driver doesn’t fancy having you in the car, he or she can refuse to drive you.

Good stay and I loved the "code" concept.   The day before they send me a code and I could enter the property and the room with no problem, no need to bring keys everywhere you go and it is a cozy and clean place.  What else can i ask for?

La division en appartements semble toutefois faire en sorte que les clients se sentent moins concernés par la propreté. Par exemple, il serait pertinent d'exiger que les aliments conservés au réfrigérateur soient étiquetés (nom, numéro de chambre, date de départ) afin d'assurer un suivi.

Fue una estancia maravillosa a pesar de que la chica rubia que nos atendió en el desayuno era bastante borde, y su conducta fue innecesaria ya que no nos atendía por estar desayunando con sus amigos o iba en pijama a la hora del trabajo.

Je suis satisfaite de cette auberge

L'auberge est calme, propre et le personnel à disposition et arrangeant.

Les installations sont de qualité

Située à 20 min du centre ville, la distance est correcte puisque des magasins se situent sur le chemin (courses, vêtements ...)

Je regrette seulement le manque d'une salle de vie digne de ce nom. Il y avait une simple petite pièce avec 3 tables, 1 tv et un ordinateur ... Très peu convivial. La cuisine juste à côté est grande est fonctionnelle

Je recommande

The room (dorm for 8) was alright, quite standard hostel room with bunk beds. The hallway on the other hand looked more like a proper hotel, as did the entrance. Reception was a bit strange, located in a bar. Kitchen and tv room were nice. Price was super cheap, so it was really good value. Location was good as well, 5min walk from the Haymarket.

Tout était parfait, mis à part que l'auberge est un peu décentralisé du centre d'attraction de la ville (+/- 25min de marche de plus) et le personnel est aussi celui qui gère le resto-bar au rez-de-chaussé, donc manque de qualifications si vous voulez des informations plus touristiques sur la ville. Sinon, très bon auberge à recommander !

Bien placé

Personnel agréable

Nous avions réservé un dortoir complet pour nous mais cela n'a pas été le cas, dommage!

Un vol a été commis dans la salle de bains (maquillage et parfum) lorsque la personne prenait sa douche!

une seule personne pour le ménage, c'est insuffisant. Il faut mettre du chauffage. les photos de chambre ne correspondent pas à la réalité. Pour une étape d'une nuit, ça va. mais  sinon, la promiscuité est difficile dans des chambres à 14 lits, pas de place pour les bagages.

Le staff est très agréable et présent. L'emplacement de l'hôtel est bien. La cuisine et les salles de bains sont fonctionnelles et propres. Vraiment sympa seul(e) ou avec des ami(e)s

Je revenais d'une auberge très peu chère... Mais beaucoup moins bien entretenue et avec beaucoup moins d'équipements ! Donc, j'ai de suite été emballée en voyant des douches et des toilettes modernes et propres (bon, le lendemain ils ne l'étaient plus trop...).  Peut-être mon avis est-il donc un peu biaisé. Je le recommande néanmoins à ceux qui voudraient comme moi passer une nuit et recherche un endroit où se poser après avoir visité la ville. Au niveau de la sécurité, je ne pourrai pas trop dire. Je n'ai pas vu de casiers, je n'en ai pas demandé n'en n'ayant pas l'utilité, mais l'entrée est sécurisée.

Chambre très propre mais salle de bain sale : douches qui ne fonctionnent pas où dont la température ne marche pas, toilettes et lavabos sales...

Nuit assez calme malgré les dortoirs.

Prix bas très intéressant.

Ebergement pratique

That's perfect for travellers with low to moderated budgets, or willing to spend money for something else. Dormitories, so ear plugs and eye mask welcomed. Breakfast is basic, you may want to take it outside. All the most sufficient comfort you can expect from a youth hostel, I personnally advise it if you are aware and experienced with this concept.

The room was quiet and locked with a magnetic card system. Friendly staff, clean hostel. I stayed 3 nights.

I recommend for young people.

Habitué des auberges de jeunesse. Je met une note de 3/10.

(+) L'accueil est Bon et son emplacement correct (environ 20minutes pour rejoindre le centre ou bus ou tram en face de l'auberge).

(-) Chambre petite. Les prises électriques ne fonctionne pas. La cuisine est juste immonde. (manque de propreté). Le four n'a pas du être nettoyé depuis son installation. Il n'y a pas d'espace convivial. Il est impossible de manger à plus de 5. (3 micro table sous l'escalier). Difficile quand il y a au moins 50 personnes.

Ils manquent de sanitaires. ( 3 toilettes pour un étage, 2 douches pour un étage de 4 chambres pouvant accueillir 32 personnes). Le papier toilette n'est pas systématiquement remis.

It was quieter than some hostels, but the rooms and facilities were very cramped. There was an obvious effort to keep the place clean but unfortunately our room happened to smell of bad socks and one of the windows wouldn't open. The facilities are mixed i.e. unisex showers and toilets, this plus the small size of them made them off putting to use. It has an ok outdoor sitting bit and the staff were really friendly, also them being up for storing your luggage whilst you went around was good too. Unfortunately though I don't think I would want to stay here again.





















Ho soggiornato presso il THE HOSTEL per 3 giorni. Le caratteristiche corrispondono a quanto scritto su Internet. Camere e servizi accoglienti e puliti, personale disponibile e molto cortese.

Se dovessi tornare a Edimburgo opterei sempre per questo ostello per l'ottima qualità/prezzo.





















Auberge propre et pratique, cuisine équipée, salle de bain petite pour plusieurs chambres.

Accueil très sympathique, tarifs intéressants, lits assez larges et confortables.

Pas tout à fait à côté de la gare néanmoins (1,5km à pied), mais accès pratique pour le centre ville.





















Buena localizacion para el precio, mal wifi, solo en el area comun pero por el precio no puedes pedir mas, si viajas y solo quieres dormir es bueno y punto..!!!!





















Friendly staff, nice price, but only one thing bad.... the toilets are not very clean and the water in the shower wasn´t hot enough.
