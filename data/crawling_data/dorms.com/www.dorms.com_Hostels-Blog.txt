Backpacker jobs: ideas for making money on the road


Good, honest work…
Even when you’re staying in cheap hostels to keep your costs down, there’ll be times when money gets tight. How can you make enough cash to keep up your travel? Nobody wants to go to the Bank of Mum And Dad too often, and travel writing and photography – the dream careers for many travellers – can be brutally tough to make money from if you don’t already have a reputation or a few good contacts.
Thankfully, those aren’t the only two options. While the bloggers who’ve ‘made it’ have a high media profile, the reality is that most travellers earn a buck through fairly ordinary jobs. The work may not always be glamorous, but it’ll expose you to new people and another side of life in your chosen destination ...

Four active hostel breaks for 2017


With a new year stretching ahead of us, we aren’t just thinking about travel: we’re also thinking about how to set some new personal goals and shed some of the pounds we put on over Christmas and New Year. With that in mind, we’ve thought up a few inspiring active backpacking breaks that’ll get you into a new sport, introduce you to a new one or push your performance to a new level. And because they’re in places with plenty of cheap hostels, they won’t break the bank either…
A kayak tour of Stockholm (and beyond)

An active break in a major European city? No, we haven’t lost it – Stockholm, remember, is one of several cities that claim to be the ‘Venice of the North’. There’s water everywhere ...

4 local breweries to visit when you’re in Melbourne


Like America, Australia has traditionally been the butt of the rest of the world’s jokes when it comes to beer. The long-standing (and unfair) stereotype sees Aussie beer culture as a bunch of guys swilling lager from ‘stubbies’ - and the beer they’re drinking is probably Victoria Bitter, brewed in Melbourne since the mid-19th century.
Thankfully, beer drinkers have wised up. Just as we’ve learned that there’s more to the US scene than Bud and Coors ...

5 of the world’s best towns for outdoor activities


Every backpacker has their own reason for hitting the road, but for many, adventure and activities are a big part of the mix. If you think that means basing yourself out in the wild, think again: there are loads of cities around the world that have outdoor adventure right on the doorstep, allowing you to stay in a buzzing city-centre hostel and still get your adrenaline fix. What’s more, a cheap dorm space means you spend less on accommodation ...

4 great souvenir ideas for a backpacking trip


Picking up souvenirs while backpacking is half the fun, right? Rooting around off the beaten track often turns up some proper little must-haves that will get friends talking when you get home.
There’s a slight hitch, though: clearly, when you’re backpacking, there’s not a whole of room to cram in souvenirs. And on top of that, money’s often tight. So it helps to set a few ground rules before you go shopping.
First, keep it small. That one’s obvious. Second ...

How to get a good night’s sleep in a hostel


Sharing a dorm in a city centre hostel? Here’s how to make sure you get some solid rest whatever your fellow backpackers get up to…
1. Get a private (or nearly private) room
Pretty obviously, private rooms give you a touch more control over noise, lighting and so on - though unless you’ve managed to find a hostel with soundproof walls, you’ll still be able to hear what’s going on outside. Going private is less expensive than you might think ...

Newbie tip: 4 destinations that are great for finding travel companions


If you’re heading out on a solo backpacking trip, meeting travelling companions is probably going to be high on your agenda. As we’ve said here many times, companions are indispensable when you’re on a long hostelling trip: they offer fun, support, and ideas about what to do and where to go next. They don’t have to become BFFs, but they often do.
When it comes to actually finding like-minded travellers, not all backpacker destinations are created equal. Sure ...

Health basics: first aid essentials to pack for your backpacking trip


While it’s good to be prepared, you can go overboard with your travel meds pack - some backpackers rock up to their hostel with a whole pharmacy in tow, including nice-to-have but non-essential items like vitamin tablets and cough lozenges. We think the six items below are the foundation of a travel first aid kit, obviously supplemented by any regular medicines you’ve been prescribed and any destination-specific items you need, such as antimalarials and altitude sickness pills ...

Six-and-a-half tips on experiencing cities like a local


Want to avoid being these guys? Of course you do. Read on…
1. Read local media
If there’s local media available in your language, devour it in advance of your backpacking trip. Hit up newspaper or magazine websites and social feeds. Look at the lifestyle sections for the latest top spots for food and drink, entertainment and shopping. Check the news sections to make yourself aware of any important news stories or events.
You may not come across anything need-to-know ...

‘Done’ London and Edinburgh? These are your new favourite British cities


When you’ve planning a backpacking trip around Britain, it’s easy to focus on the big two: London and Edinburgh. And why wouldn’t you? They’re both amazing places packed with culture, nightlife and super-cheap hostels. But smart backpackers know you can’t get a handle on a country from its capital alone. One of travel’s great pleasures is discovering regional cities – those often-overlooked places that mix big-city buzz with distinctive vibes and compact ...

Guidebooks are back: a welcome return for the ultimate backpacker accessory


This is what a WINNER’S bookshelf looks like
Once upon a time, travel books – Lonely Planet, Rough Guide, Fodor’s – took the world on holiday. They were the backpacker’s compass, the hosteller’s tour guide, and the sofa-traveller’s inspiration. Any time you walked into a hostel dorm, they were there.
Travel books ruled the world at the end of the 20th century, and anyone who was anyone had a bashed up, dogged-eared copy of Indonesia, Canada, Australia ...

The seven people you ALWAYS meet hostelling


1. The lifer

 
He seems to have been in the hostel forever. Was he born here? Is he secretly the owner? Where does his money come from? Nobody knows, and he has such an aura of wisdom and experience that it seems rude to ask. Slightly older than the rest of the dorm crowd – though not so much that it’s, y’know, weird – he claims to have lived all over the world, and has the dishevelled hair and weathered complexion to prove it ...
