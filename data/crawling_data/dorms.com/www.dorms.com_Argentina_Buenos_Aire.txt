I had a really good Christmas Eve there with a multinational group of really nice people: obviously that was mostly down to them but the hostel environment, especially the nice back yard, probably helped. It&apos;s modern and stylish, and the view up or down all of the landings is quite striking. There are two lifts, which I know from experience are far better than one in a seven-floor hostel. It was spotlessly clean all the time and the friendly cleaners were even there on Christmas Day. (I think they could have been allowed the day off, to be honest.) The receptionists are all very professional and knowledgable, although there are quite a few of them so when you are first there it is hard to tell who is staff. The best one was the guy who worked overnight from Christmas Eve into Christmas Day. The beds have individual lights and sockets, although a small shelf for the upper ones would help.

Liked everything about this hostel!

A great common area + outside courtyard for many opportunities to meet people and hang out. Great selection of activities planned for guests - multiple options every day such as horseback riding, tango shows, city tours, football, etc (though it is seasonal so check what is on before going)

Very friendly and helpful - everyone speaks English if your Spanish happens to be weak (like mine). Also, great knowledge of tourist and not-so-touristy areas. Helpful with booking shuttle to the airport, 24 hour security etc. 

Wifi is a little sketchy in the rooms but overall sufficient. 

Would highly recommend this hostel

Customer

Lovely rooms, secure lockers, good mirror space outside the bathrooms & great showers. Super clean & breakfast was nice (although heavy on sugar & low on fruit but that&apos;s the Argentinian way). Wifi was slow at best and didn&apos;t work in the rooms unfortunately so this was a bit annoying when trying to make further plans. Staff super friendly and eager to help although they would get very distracted with helping everyone at once and forget a lot (didn&apos;t book our taxi, asked numerous times for a reservation in sister hostel & we had to leave before they got round to printing a flight confirmation). They also gave a lot of bizarre advice on things to do (high end shopping mall, pricey bars etc) but they know where everything is and are great if you know exactly what you want. It&apos;s a good base and very comfortable so I&apos;d recommend it and while you are paying for the good bits, it is worth it. 

On a side note, the El Calafate hostel is amazing! Charming, well located and brilliant staff. Book this one in advance as it&apos;s very popular.

Rating 54%




El hostal Sol de Oro cuenta con una calificación muy elevada para lo que ofrece. Un servicio básico como la cocina no cuenta con las herramientas necesarias para poder preparar alimentos, hay que pedirlas y es muy difícil que las entreguen y si las entregan es de mala manera. El personal se comporta de manera tosca y nunca nos sentimos bien recibidos o atendidos, tanto así que al siguiente día salimos huyendo de aquel lugar a pesar de tener reserva de tres noches. El señor encargado de cobrar no tenia ni idea que a través de la página se había hecho un abono sobre el costo de la habitación así que, a pesar de comentarle como funcionaba el sistema, decidió cobrar la noche con tarifa plena. Recomiendo que verifiquen la forma como se califican estos lugares ya que es la única guía con la que contamos los viajeros para escoger un hostal. Definitivamente una muy mala experiencia.

Lieu très bien situé pour se déplacer dans la ville.

A part ça, une catastrophe, endroit dégueulasse, dégradé, mal entretenu...: crasse dans la baignoire, traces sur les murs et les portes, draps pas clean, couverture et oreillers maculés de sang, vraiment tout y passe.

PAS DE WIFI dans les chambres, d'ailleurs pas de chauffage non plus en plein hivers.

Personnel particulièrement désagréable.

Terriblement bruyant, absolument aucune isolation: on dort dans la rue (connue pour être "la rue qui ne dort jamais"...)



Hors de prix pour un taudis, à ce prix là prenez un hôtel!

Petite parenthèse, on tente de vous forcer à payer en dollars où euros... assez scandaleux et même frauduleux... bref

* * * * *

Resumen rapido en castellano, un lugar muyyy bien situado en la ciudad, perfecto para moverse, pero los cuartos son asquerosos e inseguros, no hay wifi en las habitaciones (y tampoco calefaccion en invierno). Un solo ejemplo: las manchas de sangre en las sabanas y los almohones + suiciedad del baño.

Personal muyyyyy desagradable que intenta cobrarte el € o $, que verguenza!!!!!!

En cuanto al ruido, es como dormir en la calle.

La estadía super cómoda, dormitorio con aire acondicionado agradable, y la atención en el piso EP ningún problema.

El  único conflicto se generaba con el baño del cual salía un olor desagrabable, probablemente vinculado a las aguas servidas de este, y este problema lamentablemente no era solucionable con el extractor que poseía el baño.

Latest Reviews


























Die Wohnung ist sehr gut gelegen, in einem schönen Mietshaus.

Leider muss man für den Schlüssel durch die halbe Stadt fahren.

Sollte man nicht mit eigener Bettwäsche reisen, empfielt es sich, bei den Laken, die man auch durch die halbe Stadt transportiren muss, auf die Größe zu achten. Unsere waren zu klein, so dass wir uns neue kaufen mussten.

Mit ein paar Handgriffen könnte die Wohnung wirklich super sein, da leider ein paar Möbel kaputt waren.
