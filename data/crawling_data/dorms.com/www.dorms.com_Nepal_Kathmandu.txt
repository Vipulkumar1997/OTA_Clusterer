Shangrila Boutique Hostel, Kathmandu




Hostel








Shangri-La Boutique Hostel, although located in Thamel is tucked well away from the hustle and bustle of the busy streets. Along with the refreshing and relaxing peace and quiet, the air is fresh with the surrounding greenery. The Jakranta tree right next to the hostel is open for guests to roam around for an evening stroll or to sit under, with a book in hand.
