Auberge très sympathique, bien qu'en travaux lors de mon passage. Elle est un peu excentrée mais le chemin à pied vers la vielle ville se fait facilement et passe près ou à travers (au choix) d'un joli parc. Le personnel est très sympathique et très serviable. Le petit déjeuner (en supp.) est parfait !

There is space for parking. In the yard is a fun bar running almost all night and prevent hacking cars. In just a few meters from the zoo and the park. For beer lovers around the corner shop is open until late. The room was quiet and peaceful. All furniture from IKEA. That in itself speaks of quality. Clean linen.

That can be the coolest place in Warsaw.  Located in amazing, interesting area, not directly in the city centre - it makes your trip to Warsaw not typical and boring but really extraordinary, you can feel the spirit of Warsaw nightlife (some of the really best places to have a drink are exactly there) and see real life Praga district next morning. "Tacheles"-like building or a little Kreuzberg atmosphere outside but absolutely clean and new inside. Definitely will be back!!

Good place cuz the owner also runs the Bar outside so you can get in for free. Common room was pretty basic but easy to meet people, if any would be there, and fun place to chill n drink if you dont want to go out. The rooms were very nice and clean, bathrooms were decent. Staff were super helpful and friendly

Located at 11 Listapoda 22, a famous bar and club district in Warsaw&apos;s up and coming Praga district, this hostel is perfect for young travelers who want to see more than just the touristic Old Town.  Don&apos;t let the graffitied walls deceive you: inside is decked out with brand new fittings and furniture.   The staff member was extremely helpful as I arrived quite late, and also filled me in on the area.  The showers are some of the best I&apos;ve used, clean and new.  The location is full of great galleries, as well as  cheap places to eat and drink.  I only wish I was staying in Warsaw for longer to experience this side more.  Also, own locker in room is included, which gives peace of mind.

El hostal esta muy bien ubicado, es fácil de encontrar, la atención de las chicas es excelente, y el precio esta muy bien en relación a lo que ofrece. Es un lugar limpio, y bien organizado. Recomendaría modificar la ubicación de los tomacorrientes, al menos de la habitación en la que estuve. Las camas son antiguas, pero están en buen estado y lo mas importante es que son limpias. Es un buen lugar para conocer gente, puesto que es muy grande y según me contaron siempre permanece lleno de viajeros.
