PLUS Prague Hostel raises the standards for hostels all over Europe, located just a quick three stops on the metro from Prague’s historic and stunning city centre.

The rooms in this enormous 540-bed hostel are big, bright and airy with huge windows to let in the Czech sunshine.  Better yet, all the rooms have an ensuite shower and a separate WC – a true luxury with which any backpacker will agree.

You can also find:

- an onsite family-run Italian restaurant serving delicious and affordable meals (even on a backpacker’s budget), and an awesome bar to party with people from around the world;
an amazing chill-out area with big comfy couches & large screen TV;
an indoor swimming pool and sauna;
- a gorgeous and friendly travel desk staff can tell you all about walking tours, pub crawls, haunted castles and spooky cemeteries, brewery tours, trips on the river, bike rental, a good park to stop for a picnic and even a trip to a church filled with bone sculptures;
- the Plus Girls Zone. This ‘girls-only’ space allows you to forget you’re a backpacker and be a girl again. There are big bathrooms, cosmetic tables with large mirrors and hairdryers. When you check in you’ll receive a nice fluffy towel to use during your stay with us and a complimentary cosmetics bag stuffed with goodies for you to take along.

See what they mean by luxury?

Prague is an incredible city that you’ll never forget, and your visit will only be enhanced by a stay at Plus Prague – an indulging retreat for any budget traveller.
