Privacy and Security policies




Your personal and credit card information is fully encrypted and protected (SSL). This information will never be shared, rented or sold to any third party individual or company.



How and what information do we collect from our users?

We only collect personal information from users when they register online and purchase online. Generally, this information includes a name, an e-mail address, a mailing address and the information contained in the credit card transaction when purchasing products.

How do we use this information?

This information is used solely for internal marketing purposes. We do not sell, exchange, or disclose your personal information (name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card data, etc.). The information that you provide us, and identifies you personally, is not shared with third parties other than for billing and mailing purpose.

We only contact people who specifically have requested or opted to receive our free newsletters or who have purchased one of our products.

What are cookies, clear GIFs and how do we use them?

Like many other commercial sites, our site uses standard technology called “cookies” and “clear GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format) to collect information about how our website is used.

A cookie is a small data text file that a website saves on the hard drive of your computer (if your browser allows it), which can be found later to identify yourself to the website. Cookies are designed to help the website recognize a user’s browser as a previous visitor, and to save and remember any preferences that may have been selected while navigating their site.

A cookie cannot be read by any site other than the one that placed the cookie in the first place.  Also, a cookie cannot transmit computer viruses or capture personal information that may reside in your computer.

Sometimes we work with external partner service companies that employ clear GIFs to help us measure the effectiveness of advertising. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics (the size of a punctuation mark) that contain unique identifiers that help us monitor online activity. The main difference between cookies and clear GIFs is that the latter do not use or bear personal data, but merely track the traffic and behaviour of visitors to, from and within multiple websites.

How do we protect your information?

Your personal information is stored in a fully secured server.  This information is only accessible to associates who manage our distribution list of customers who wish to receive our newsletter emails.

The newsletters that we send you contain an unsubscribe link. You can remove yourself from our newsletter distribution list anytime by clicking on the unsubscribe link.

This charter may be amended any time at our discretion.  We will post updates to this page accordingly. The last revision to this charter was March 5, 2010.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us.
