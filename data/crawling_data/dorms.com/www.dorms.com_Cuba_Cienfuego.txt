Propre et réglo, bonne auberge de jeunesse malgrè la distance au centre. L'accueil très professionnel, agréable et arrangeant! Les prx sont très raisonnables!





















Une bonne auberge, propre et conviviale (du fait de sa taille), avec des pièces communes agréables et spacieuses. Le seul bémol est pour les salles de bains qui sont assez réduites (deux toilettes et deux douches pour celle des hommes par exemple). Mais comme person n'a le même emploi du temps ce n'est pas un problème ultra important.

Pour ce qui est des prix, pas mal, même si on peut trouver moins cher et plus proche. Mais satisfaisant en conclusion !

Alojamento simples e prático. Muito limpo e com pessoal muito atencioso quando é solicitado (cozinha, recepção, pessoal de limpeza dos quartos). Pequeno almoço com muita variedade. Piscina com água bem tratada e vigilância. Transporte regular para o centro o que evita usar o nosso carro quando se quer visitar a rede de museus e o centro. Continuem!
