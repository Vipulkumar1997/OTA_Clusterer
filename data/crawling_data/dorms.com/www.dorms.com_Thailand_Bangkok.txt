Born Free Hostel - Vista, Bangkok




Hostel








The hostel is in a unique part of Bangkok, within the Rattanakosin island area and close to both the Chao Phraya river and the many canals flowing through this 'island'. You'll see traditional chinese / thai families living and making a living in all the streets around us. You are able to visit the many historical sites by foot from the hostel or even take a canal boat or river boat and explore the city through the water ways. For those seeking nightlife, we are 5min away from KaoSa

The Overstay Hostel, Bangkok




Hostel








We are located on the other river side of Bangkok (the real Bangkok) local, rural and cheap. Street Food on every  corner, local shops and Bangkok how it used to be before the skyscrapers came. More important away from Khao san - the dark side of backpacking in Bangkok. But if you want to see it with a taxi you are there in 5 min.

this is really laid back hostel, you feel living with group of friends in squat, but they provide all you need, extra points are free pool and great roof terrace and great price, getting there is pretty easy once you figure it out,...street name can be confusing cause our taxi driver did not now, and we were 20 meters from hostel in clse by street,...se print outg the map or something, after you check in you just need a 203 bus to khao san road, or even can walk 20 minutes

Lub  d  Bangkok Silom Hostel, Bangkok

Our hostel located direct at the city center of Bangkok; restaurants all around.  Near to BTS sky train Chongnonsri, and managed to explore all places within. Morning and night market near Silom Street (10 mins walk) provided us with local foods. 
15-min walk to the pier (to catch a boat to the Grand Palace and other sites).

Though a bit of walk from the place but once you get to the skytrain.  Bangkok is just in reach.  BTS  is fast and most convenient during rush hour in bangkok. (E9 station)
7-11, Tesco Lotus (supermarket) where they provide telephone cards, budget airticket booth, food court, Hop on BTS, and everything necessary stuff you need.

The staff was super helpful and you have pretty much everything you could possibly need.  The beds were comfortable, kitchen is open from 6 am until midnight, there&apos;s a tv and a small book exchange, power points and lights by the beds.  They gave me a ride to the main street when I left, which was totally unnecessary but very much appreciated!  Also, one of the guys looked everywhere for a sync cable for me because I didn&apos;t have one.  Very kind and accommodating staff, great place to relax and just chill out for a couple of days.  Roof top pool!

The rooms were clean with very comfy bunk beds and as a group of four we were very happy to have our own private room!! Our room also had air con which was very nice after a humid walk back.The pool on the roof terrace was a very welcome addition to cool off in.

It was quiet, very clean and the beds very comfy. Wifi in the common room is very fast. The huge washing machine for 60 baht allowed me to wash the entire contents of my bag and the rooftop pool area is really nice to hang out on. A water filter purifier on the kitchen tap is an added bonus to save the heaps of plastic you sometimes have to use.

The property was very clean and the staff were very helpful. The gym consists of two machines near the roof, but you get what you pay for.

Avec une amie nous sommes restées 3 nuits à Link Corner dans un dortoir pour femmes. L'auberge est bien placée près de la station de Sky Train Ratchaprarop (direct en venant de l'aéroport). Chambres et parties communes très propres. Il faut se déchausser pour circuler dans l'auberge ce qui est agréable étant donnée la chaleur. Air-conditionné dans les dortoirs. Casiers pour ranger ses affaires. Possibilité de laisser ses bagages dans le local fermé si on libère la chambre avant de reprendre la route. Personnel charmant et très serviable parlant bien anglais. Petit point négatif si l'on n'a pas l'habitude des grandes villes : la circulation agitée du boulevard est bruyante.





















Good hotel, great location just a few minutes walk from the beach and restaurants. Staff are very friendly and helpful, always a plus when you are females travellling alone. Nothing was too much trouble. Rooms are basic, but clean with tv, fan and/or aircon options. Only let down was the bathroom, but gives all you need and not bad for the price. Would stay again at Villa Anjuna.

bonjour, j'étais prêt à mettre 10 /10 ,car toutes les prestations étaient exceptionnelles et le rapport qualité prix inégalable. j’étais cet été le responsable d'un groupe d'adolescent en itinérance dans l'ouest américain et sur votre site vous m'avez proposé des chambres dortoirs à 6 lits, alors que dans l’hôtel casino , il n'y avait que des chambres à deux lits doubles valable pour 4 personnes .Le gros soucis que j'ai rencontré a été la réceptionniste lorsqu'elle m'a annoncé que sur les trois chambres de quatre places chacunes et les 2 dortoirs de 6 lits seule les 3 chambres étaient viables. Il me manquait 2 chambres (heureusement il restait des chambres de libre). en deux mots  il faut absolument que vous vérifiez l'exactitude de vos propositions surtout en ce qui concerne la présence de dortoir.

merci encore pour votre professionnalisme et pour les prix discount que vous proposez. à bientôt pour de nouvelles réservations, vous gardez toute ma confiance. merci
