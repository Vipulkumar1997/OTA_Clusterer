This hostel is well located with clean rooms.

I loved the Fijian people who worked at the hostel. Always a smile on their faces, and happy to help you with anything you might need. The beach location was nice, some great hammocks and lounges to relax on during the day.

Mama was friendly but could have been more helpful at times. There is not really any atmosphere, much more of an older crowd while I stayed here but its right next door to smugglers hostel which has a busy bar if that&apos;s more your thing. I was in the dorm room which was very clean and tidy with a bathroom. I felt I was just overcharged for my stay on Mana Island which I booked through this hostel....try elsewhere first. I would recommend staying here over smugglers as I felt the rooms were nicer and cheaper but use the facilities of the other bars along the beach.

Mama is the best host I&apos;ve ever had! We got a big hug on arrival haha!
The atmosphere is good there and attracts good people.
Mamas burgers were some of the most delicious I&apos;ve ever had.
The communication prior to our stay was great and Mama was very helpful.

The warmth & friendliness of Mama & her staff, nothing was too much trouble for them, and the location is excellent on the beach and next to other hotels so plenty of lively activities especially for backpackers.
Bed was very comfortable, and the sound of the waves was very therapeutic for me at least.

We really enjoyed our stay at mamas. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The food was really good in the restaurant and Kele came to pick us up from the airport for free. We stayed for 3 nights in total, one when we first arrived and then we went to the Yasawa islands for 6 nights and stayed there for 2 on the way back. When we arrived the second time the room we had reserved was not available so we got a free upgrade to the seaview room which was lovely. The location is great, right on the beach. The price is very reasonable. The people are friendly, mama is hilarious! We had a great time! Would come back again next time without a doubt.

Stayed at Mamas for 2 nights after travelling from the UK was a great place to chill out and get over our jet lag! Everyone was so friendly and helpful, they booked us a trip to the islands which worked out alot cheaper than going through a package deal and we got twice as long! they also let us keep our big luggage in the storage room so only had to carry around our smaller bags so less hassle. Great food and prices, Dorms clean & comfy! Felt like home and would return.

Mama&apos;s is excellent.  Family run.  Mama is larger than life, so lovely and caring. I arrived on her birthday and was included in her birthday celebrations.  Free drinks and gorgeous food for this special occasion.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.  Perfect for couples, families and singles.

Quiet, clean and amazingly confortable beds. Mama and her staff were very welcoming and extremely helpful. I ate the free breakfast, a lunch and 2 dinners here.  Bella quickly whipped up a gorgeous meal for me, piping hot and plentiful.
I think would be easy to stay at Mamas for an extended period

Mama is the quintessential Fijian mother. She treats all guests as if she was their mother. Awesome feeling of belonging in such a commercially dominated business. Mamma is great.







Sarah

Mama was great! so welcoming and knew that I was coming and welcomed me.  Loved the free airport pick up so less hassel.  Beach right on the door step with beach lounges.  I had a night flight and after a day on the beach were more than happy to let me have a shower and gave me a towel to use for free so I wouldnt get mine wet.  Loved Manas and will be back - see you soon bella jerry and mama!!!!!!! x

Mamas was great. Stayed here the night before and after our stay on the Yasawas. They are quite humble hosts and you must try their dinner menu. They dont advertise themselves that well but the food was delicious. A great experience here.
