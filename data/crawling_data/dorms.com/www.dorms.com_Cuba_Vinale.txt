It was a private house and we spent our first stay in scotland there. The host lady was very nice and introduced some worth-to-visit places to us. Nice sitting room but bed room was a bit cold. Unforgettably I had a very cold shower after 4 of us had it, so the hot water supply is not that enough for more than 4 persons during a night maybe. overall, it is ok;)

a minor problem with the key card lead to constant wake-ups in order to open the dorm's door several times in the middle of the night








Margarida

O Hostel está muito bem situado. As instalações são, de um modo geral, bastante asseadas, o Pessoal bastante prestavel e simpatico. O ambiente é muito acolhedor, o convívio fácil, independentemente da idade, muito variável, dos hóspedes.

Pelo que atrás ficou dito, não só recomendo este Hostel, como não hesitarei em lá ficar, se voltar a Copenhague.

Superbe auberge avec une jolie déco, de la bonne musique, un très bon emplacement dans Copenhague malgré une petite cuisine commune.

Les chambres sont correctes mais il manque des emplacements pour ranger les affaires.








Mathieu

Auberge très agréable, en plain centre. Elle offre de nombreux services très sympas, notamment le "free dinner" qui m'a permis, au-delà de faire des économies, de rencontrer et de discuter avec beaucoup d'étrangers qui utilisaient ce service.

C'est un très bon moyen de sociabilité !

Super ambiance & Personnel sympa

Emplacement impec', locaux très chouettes et très propres!

Je recommande 1000fois!








Christophe

Belle auberge de jeunesse au centre de Copenhague. Il n'y a pas de rangements dans les chambres ni moyens d'enfermer ses objets de valeur. C'est un peu cher comparé au prix en France mais c'est dans la moyenne des prix au Danemark. Les lits sont plutôt confortables et les douches sont neuves et propres.

Nos quedamos una noche en dormitorio compartido. El personal es serviable y habla bien inglés. Tiene wifi privado por lo que permite revisar gmail y otros sitios prohibidos en china. El lugar es limpio. Sólo encontré que los baños y duchas compartidos son muy escasos y demasiado chicos para las gente que se aloja ahí. Nos ayudaron a reservar el bus para Lijiang del día siguiente. Está un poco apartado del centro, pero a pie se llega igual.
