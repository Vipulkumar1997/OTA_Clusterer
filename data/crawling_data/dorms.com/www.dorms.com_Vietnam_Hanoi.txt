Etablissement très propre et personnels très accueillants.

L'hôtel se trouve très prêt d'une station de métro, ce qui facilitent les déplacements.

Vous avez à 3 min à pieds un petit "supermarket" pour les courses et possibilité de faire à manger dans une cuisine simple mais fonctionnelle.

Les endroits communs sont nettoyés plusieurs fois par jour.

Grand merci, moi et mes deux fils avons passé un excellent séjour!








Aurélie







Rating 57%




Les chambres sont propres et spacieuses.

Les gens à l'accueil sont très sympas.

Les sanitaires sont corrects mais peu nombreux, il faut parfois faire la file le matin.

Il y a une cuisine avec un strict minimum.

L'auberge est située pas loin de la gare et près du métro.








Florian







Rating 40%




L'établissement est bien situé et se présente plus comme un passage d'une nuit, de transit.

Il y a par contre des puces de lit. Ce qui est extrêmement mauvais signe pour ce genre d'établissement.








Lili







Rating 67%




Les dortoirs sont biens, le ventilateur et le balcon sont les bienvenus ! Dommage que la salle de bains soit aussi minuscule. Il manque peut-être un endroit pour manger, personnellement nous nous installions sur le toit (y installer une ou deux tables et quelques chaises pourrait faire un coin sympa). Le personnel était agréable et attentif !





















Propriétaires très accueillants; ont eu la gentillesse de nous donner toutes les infos importantes concernant la ville d'Athènes. Services proposés corrects dans l'ensemble.

























The only good point of this hostel is the location.

The kitchen is unusable, the bath is horrible.

Rooms are nice if only there were the double glazing (all night you hear cars).

Bed are nice, but they give you only 1 sheet, 1 quilt and 1

cushion cover.

If you need towels you need to pay, there is only friedge for 20 people...

If you need to stay here just a night, it could be ok, otherwise change place as soon as possible.

Fiz a reserva para um quarto para 6 pessoas, uma noite dormiram 10 e em todas as outras 8. A cozinha é inutilizável, uma bagunça, fora o fato de que a pia está estragada, e as pessoas tinham que limpar sua louça no banheiro, o que pra mim nao parece nada higienico. O serviço para guardar bagagem nao existe e tambem nao é fornecido toalhas, voce precisa pagar por elas. Realmente a localização é boa, pode ir de a pé até o coliseu e tambem tem uma estação me metro que você consegue ir para todos os outros lugares muito perto.
