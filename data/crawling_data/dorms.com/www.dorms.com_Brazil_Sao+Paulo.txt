Nuestra estadia fue corta pero muy buena, lamentablemente tuvimos dos inconvenientes como el ruido horrible por una fiesta en el bar y la mala ubicación de nuestro cuarto que no nos dejó dormir nada y la falta de información turística del hostel, ni un mapa pudimos conseguir.

Por otro lado la atención fue muy buena y las instalaciones muy lindas!!

Hotel accueillant, aimable, parfait pour un week end a moindre coût





















Bonne auberge pour dépannage. Chambres correctes, literie propre, sanitaires propres, accueil de la patronne agréable, elle raconte meme l'histoire de la ville à ceux qui le veulent.

Par contre, ils semblent un peu perdus dans cette histoire de booking par internet : en arrivant, ils ne trouvaient plus notre réservation et nous ont mis dans une chambre qui, clairement, n'était pas prévu pour nous (salle de bain privée, nous n'en avions pas demandé). Dans la journée du lendemain, en notre absence, toutes nos affaires ont été transferrées dans une autre chambre. C'est un peu désagréable que quelqu'un fouille dans nos sacs.

Autre inconvénient, pas d'eau chaude aux heures de pointe.

Awful - avoid at all costs.

Arrived at the hostel - not bad - cleanish rooms - nice kitchen in common area.

Arrived back at the hostel in the early hours of the morning - we were hounded by two male members of staff who were intoxicated on something.

One member of staff repeatedly asked me to go to my room - when the only thing stopping me was his colleague ranting. They then waited outside the bathroom until I got into bed. It was like being on a school trip. This behaviour might be acceptable if we were a group of drunken youths ranting and raging in the corridors of a peaceful hostel. In reality we were a group for 25yr old ladies trying to go to the one bathroom (shared between at least 30+ people) quietly before hitting the sack.

To top it all off they had put extra people on the floor of our dorm - making it difficult to negotiate at 3am.

Would not reccomend at all.
