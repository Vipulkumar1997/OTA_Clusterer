Whether you have been on dozens of cruises, or this is your first one, you always can learn more about how to make your cruise experience fabulous!  If you are still deciding whether or not to try a cruise, remember, if you watch for great deals your entire cruise can cost less than staying in a hotel for three days.

Whether you care to save a few dollars or not (because only travel agents get the really great rates), here are some ideas that are often overlooked to help you book your new venture.

When should you book a cruise?  During the off-season if you can.  If you live anywhere in the north where you get to experience cold, long winters, winter time is when you should go.  Not only do you get a break from your cold country, you generally get good fares.  The general population take their vacations in the summer months (May-September), even though some of the summer locations they visit are blisteringly hot.  Generally speaking, cruises are discounted in winter times, depending upon location.  Avoid the over popular locations, such as the Caribbean, since winter (Nov-March) is their most pleasant time to visit.  (Sweating constantly, especially in the dead of night, is an uncomfortable thing to experience!)


If you are booking a short cruise (3-7 days; recommended for first time cruisers), book about 3 months in advance.  If you are going longer (7-21 days), book 5 months in advance.  If you have ample time, money, and freedom and are going on a world cruise (usually over 100 days) you need to book 1 year in advance, as those tours occur less frequently than your short excursions and, surprisingly, fill quickly.

To save money, book your flight and cruise together.  If you booked a flight outside of your cruise package, be sure to allow extra time to get to your ship because they are not obliged to wait for you if your flight is delayed.  If you find you missed the ship, it is possible to fly to their next port of entry and join your cruise at that location.  That is a headache and a stress to arrange, so just get there in time.  If you are embarking on a cruise overseas, arrive 1-2 days early so you definitely will not miss your cruise, also giving you an opportunity to get rested and adjusted to the time and climate change.

If you are concerned about what your room is like, be sure to ask so that your fabulous view from your window is not obscured by people on the promenade or by a lifeboat.  Most cruise ships have websites where you can research the layout and class of your room.


Be sure to ask everything that is included in the price of your cruise: tips, drinks (usually reimburses to water and maybe juice), taxes and fees, are usually included;  shore excursions, spa treatments, massages, alcoholic drinks and soda pop are usually extra.

There is one last note.  If you think you might be prone to motion sickness, be sure to get a prescription or medication to combat this unpleasant, and often times, debilitating sensation.  Cruise ships have a medical doctor on board, but their charge is usually extra and may not be covered by your health insurance.  If you have medical conditions, be prepared ahead of time by knowing what your insurance covers so you know whether or not to pull out extra insurance for your voyage.
