Living alone is the dream for so many people in their mid-twenties, but it is often not feasible.  With the cost of rent going up and up and jobs scarce, people are taking on roommates well into their thirties and beyond.  It's becoming a common fact of life, as people leave home at 18 still but are not ready to be financially independent enough to have their own household for at least a couple more decades.

Whether you're picking a roommate for the first time or the thousandth, there is always room for improvement.  After all, so many people have bad roommate stories – ranging from home security issues to psychological trouble – that it seems the world would be a much better place if there was a better screening process involved.  So here are some simple tips for picking out a roommate – and knowing what to watch out for.


Learn the language.  Just like a "cute" apartment often one means so small you can touch all walls at once, you should be fluent in the language of strangers trying to convince you that they are fun to live with.  Someone who is really "outgoing and energetic" and "does not mind parties" is likely to be throwing them a whole lot.  Someone who "really tries to avoid drama" but "has it following them" is going to be in the living room crying, or throwing plates at their boyfriend or girlfriend.  Pay attention to how people say things, not what they are actually saying, and you can save yourself a whole lot of heartache.

Make things clear.  If you have a home alarm system and expect it to be set every day by the last person in the house, say so.  If you do not want there to be overnight guests except a couple of times a week, make that clear.  If you are not sharing your food, tell someone immediately.  Especially if you are looking to fill vacant rooms in an apartment or house where your name is on the lease, keeping things like this clear are absolutely critical.  They will also make it clear to someone from the start that you mean business, so you might be able to avoid flakes.

Get it in writing.  This is practically the most important piece of advice for anyone who is not yet 40 and jaded.  If you have not experienced it yet, someone is always going to take advantage of you in a situation where something is not in writing.  Avoid this by actually signing contracts.  This is just as much a part of home security as locking your doors.  And be sure to get a security deposit from anyone who is renting a room in a property where your name is on the lease.  Likewise,


Do not put your name on the utilities.  Do not do this.  It's a bad move, because if you are the person on the lease and the person on all of the bills, that is a huge liability for you if people stop paying things on time.  Try to spread it out so at least if there is going to be a problem, it is not going to be related to your name.  This is especially important for people who are renting during college to realize, as a number of aspiring scam artist twenty-somethings are fond of playing the game where they pretended they could not have utilities in their name, only to stiff you for rent, cable, and electric.
