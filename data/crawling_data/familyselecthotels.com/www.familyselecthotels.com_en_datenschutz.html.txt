Cookie Guidelines

What are cookies and why do websites use them?
To ensure the most efficient use and presentation of a website, so-called cookies are used when the website is visited. Cookies are small data packages that are sent to the user’s browser and saved there during visits of the website. When the website is visited again, this information can be sent back to the web server.

Cookies are used to save personal page settings because websites themselves cannot store data. They are also used to identify users and to analyse their usage behaviour. Cookies serve many different purposes and are therefore differentiated according to their function, life span and source. There are for example temporary and permanent cookies. Temporary cookies are deleted either after a certain time defined in the cookie or at the end of a browser session. Permanent cookies are permanently stored in the browser.

How to delete and block cookies

In this process, advertising partners do not collect any personal information such as names, e-mail addresses, post addresses or phone numbers. Users of the website can deactivate the use of cookies via Google by clicking the link Interest-based advertising on websites beyond Google and deactivate the feature.

Functional cookies:

Functional cookies can be used to improve the usability of a website. These cookies are not essential for the function of a website but improve the usability during the visit of the website.

Not only visited pages, referring pages and exit pages, but also information on the length of stay and clicks can be stored.

Commercial cookies:

Moreover, cookies can be used during marketing campaigns to show advertisements on other websites. For this purpose cookies and retargeting tags are used for interest-based advertising by online advertising providers on one’s own website.

Cookies by social networks

In order to like and share elements such as pages, pictures and videos in social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Pinterest, Instagram etc., social plug-ins are integrated on a website.
