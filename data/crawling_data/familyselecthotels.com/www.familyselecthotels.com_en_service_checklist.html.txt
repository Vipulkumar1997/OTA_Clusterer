Checklist


Even if our FamilySelectHotels provide everything you could wish for in terms of facilities, your personal items are also very important whilst on holiday. Often it’s the little things that you’ve forgotten that can really spoil a holiday. If you’ve forgotten your medication it’s not always easy to get a repeat prescription or to find the right batteries for your camera, because you’ve stupidly left yours at home. Make a checklist beforehand. It doesn’t matter whether it’s on paper, your computer, or mobile phone – a checklist can make all the difference to your holiday, even before you’ve left home. Below we’ve listed the things we most often forget.












Who’s travelling?

Your checklist will be governed by who’s in your party. A baby has completely different needs to your dog. Make a separate list for each person, so you don’t forget anyone.



Documents:

Identity papers such as a student card or proof of a child’s age (discounts!), driving licences, passports and ski passes are essential luggage, for everyone in your party, even if you’re not going on a round-the-world trip. Make a list. It’s a very good idea to take copies of important documents with you, possibly in electronic form.



Money:

Even if you’re not planning to use traveller’s cheques or credit cards, take them with you. Better to be safe than sorry. Please bear in mind that in Austria debit cards are a popular payment method; credit cards are not widely accepted, whereas in other countries they are.



Health:

Make a list of all the medicines your family needs. A first aid kit, with pain killers, throat lozenges and cough mixture is an essential luggage item. Because children sometimes hurt themselves too, don’t forget plasters, antiseptic cream and disinfectant spray. Irrespective of whether you’re going on a skiing or beach holiday, sunscreen is another essential (at least factor 20 for babies). N.B. Sunscreens have best-by dates – check yours is not out of date.























Clothes:

Well-fitting shoes for young and old (not new shoes, but ones which have been well broken in!) with thick socks are the be-all and end-all for a successful hiking holiday, or even long walks. A change of clothes can save the day when children get dirtier or wetter than planned. Consider a beach shoe for beach holidays – not all sand is soft and fine – or it can be too hot to walk on! Ties for long hair are also a luggage must – nothing is more annoying than hair that sticks to a suncreamed back.



Babies and toddlers:

Take nappies with you, better too many than too few, even if you can buy some locally. Wet wipes, antiseptic cream, changing bag, flannel and spare dummy are key items to pack for baby’s holiday. Toys, food and items such as bottles are also essential. A baby sling is easy to stow away and makes travelling around with baby easier.



Electronics:

Check that you have packed batteries and chargers for all your electrical items, e.g. mobile phone, camera, video camera, iPod or MP3 player, laptop, etc.  Remember to copy or delete everything you have stored on the memory card or memory stick before you travel, so that you will have plenty of space for your photos and videos. If you’re travelling abroad, think about the right adapter plug and find out about roaming tariffs from your mobile provider. Deactivate the web browser on your mobile phone to avoid unexpectedly high charges.



Useful tools:

Don’t forget an umbrella, rainwear or rubber boots so that you can have fun in the rain too! A drinks bottle for your bag or belt is also practical. You can top it up and it’s always there. A pocket knife is always handy, if you want to slice fruit while out and about, for example. Don’t forget an air pump for your beach holiday, otherwise you won’t find blowing up a lilo and inflatable toys every day very restful! A sand-proof bag will protect your mobile phone and camera whilst on the beach. An appropriately sized rucksack for each member of the family is extremely practical for any trip.






All ready for your next holiday? Have a good trip!
Safe trip!
