Unlike when you’re renting internationally -- perhaps in places where driving on the left is the norm, or road signs are written an unfamiliar language, or gestures you thought were universal turn out not to be -- renting domestically is a snap. Just pick up your car, type in your destination and go!

Car Rentals

Now that your phone is essentially your navigator (no map-reading or -folding skills required), getting yourself around in a rental is a whole new level of easy. Of course, if for some reason you can’t use your phone for directions, most agencies give you the option of in-car GPS.

Alaska Cruises

Though it’s the nation’s largest state -- at more than twice the landmass of the next in line -- Alaska is as much about what you see on the water as on terra firma. Think Glacier Bay, the Inside Passage -- and orcas, humpbacks and belugas. Put otherwise: A cruise here is one continual mind-blowing eye feast.
