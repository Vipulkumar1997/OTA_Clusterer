TRENDY SHORES

CULTURAL ENCLAVES

EXOTIC FLAVORS

ARTS & CULTURE

THE EVERGLADES






























South Beach is known worldwide for its party atmosphere and people-watching, but Miami's lesser-known beaches cater to a wide variety of interests. Hobie Beach is dog-friendly, while Sunny Isles Beach welcomes fishing. Crandon Park Beach has a family amusement center, and North Beach has a bandshell that hosts concerts and events.

Learn More















Miami is a cultural melting pot and exploring its more than 20 diverse neighborhoods is the best way to experience this. Little Haiti is home to art galleries and Haitian music and book stores. Wynwood has become an arts hub, with street art, murals by internationally acclaimed artists and more than 70 galleries and museums.

Travel + Leisure says that “Miami has become one of America’s most dynamic restaurant cities.” With new options popping up every month, visitors will be spoiled for choice. While Cuban fare is still king, expect to taste trendy fusions of Asian, French, American and Latin cuisines as well.

Learn More















A fixture of Miami’s robust arts and culture scene is the annual Art Basel in America (Dec. 7-10), when global galleries showcase contemporary works around the city. Art is available year-round -- tour the Wynwood Arts District with an Art Walk (second Saturday, monthly) or check out Pérez Art Museum Miami.

Learn More















Less than an hour southwest of Miami is Everglades National Park, the largest subtropical wilderness in the U.S. and an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Visitors can glide over the water on an airboat tour in the hopes of spying native wildlife, including threatened and endangered species like manatees, crocodiles and Florida panthers.
