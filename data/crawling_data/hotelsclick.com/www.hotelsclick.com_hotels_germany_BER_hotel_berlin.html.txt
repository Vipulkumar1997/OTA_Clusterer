Discover Berlin

Berlin
is located in the north-west of
Germany
and is the capital of the country.
The German capital, which today is one of the most artistically and culturally lively cities in Europe, during the last century has been greatly affected by the World Wars. In particular, during the Second World War, Berlin was severely damaged by the bombing of the allied troops. After the war, the city has become the symbol of the division of the country into two zones, the west part and east one. The latter was under the control of the Soviet government, and in 1961 was erected the infamous
Berlin Wall
, which, until its demolition in 1989, was the emblem of the Cold War.

What To See And Do in Berlin

Well aware of its past, today’s Berlin is one of the most interesting European capitals and it is surely worth a visit. Full of tourist attractions of any kind, from museums to art galleries, theatre and trendy class, it is surely a must.
The famous
Brandeburg Gate
is one of the most famous city’s symbols. A living witness of the past division into two Germanies, now the Brandeburg Gate epitomizes the reunification of the country. A few steps from attraction lies the
Holocaust Memorial
, a monument dedicated to the victims of the shoah.
The
Reichstag
, home of the German federal Parliament, deserves to be among the things you absolutely must see in Berlin, mostly for its
glass dome
, which can be visited for free and which offers a breathtaking view of the city.

Tiergarten Park
is the ideal place to relax. This former game reserve is the city’s green lung, an oasis of paradise made of woods, meadows, streams and ponds.
In Berlin there are over 170 museums; here is the famous
Museum Island
, located in the northern part of the Spree island (the main river of the city). This cultural and architectural collection of museums is part of the
Unesco World Heritage
, and consists of 5 different structures: The
Pergamon Museum
, which houses some collections of ancient Greek and Middle Eastern art, the
Bode-Museum
, inside which you can find many Byzantine artworks, the
Old Museum
and the
New Museum
, where you can admire the famous bust of Nefertiti, and the
Old National Gallery
, with its collection of German artworks.
At the entrance of the
Museum Island
is the
Pleasure Garden
, an ancient square now covered with grass, in which lie both the Old Museum and the
Berlin Cathedral
, built here between the nineteenth and the twentieth century. In the city there are a lot of art galleries; the most famous of them is the
Gemaldegalerie
(the picture gallery), which contains many masterpieces of the European art between the thirteenth and the nineteenth centuries. It is located within the complex of the
Kulturforum
, which also houses the
New National Gallery
and the
National Library
.
Art and history merge at the
East Side Gallery
, an
outdoor gallery
. Murals from artists all over the world can be seen along Mühlenstraße, on what remains of the Berlin Wall.
Besides the East Side Gallery, lovers of art should not miss a visit to the
Hamburger Bahnhof
, a museum of
contemporary art
hosted in a former railway station from the nineteenth century, with words of artists the like Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol.
The city is really creative: in fact in 2006 it was appointed
Unesco City of Design
, and it has more than 1,300 companies including agencies, studios for product and furnityre design. In Berlin you can also find a lot of fashion designers and shops.
Berlin is a cosmopolitan and extremely vivid city: its artistic and nightlife centre is
Prenzlauer Berg
,a trendy district full of restaurants and pubs, very popular in summer for young Berliners and tourists.
The capital is also closely linked to the world of music: in the city there are three big opera houses andBerlin musical trends affect the entire European musical scene today.

How To Reach the German Capital
Berlin is a very well connected town. A very efficient
network of public transportation
makes it easy to be reached from all over Germany.
Those willing to reach by plane can land in one of the
two city airports
-
Tegel
, linked to town via a shuttle bus service, and
Schoenefeld
, close to the railway station and where many low cost companies land.
The town can also easily be reached by
train
: Berlin main stations also serve high speed trains from Italy and all over Europe.
For those willing to use their
car
, is it important to know German highways are free and for long traits have no speed limit. The centre of Berlin can be reached only by vehicles meeting serious pollution standards: it is necessary to exhibit a
special badge
listing the exhausted substances of your car.
The Best Time To Visit Berlin
Berlin has a
mild continental climate
, with cold winters with an average temperature around zero degrees, and not so warm summers, with daily temperatures around 24 °C / 75.2 °F. The
best time to visit
this town, avoiding the weather to play a bad trick, is
from May to July
.
For those who do not fear winter, our advice is to visit Berlin in December, to watch the Christmas lights and the traditional Christmas markets, celebrate New Year’s Day outside while watching many live shows.
