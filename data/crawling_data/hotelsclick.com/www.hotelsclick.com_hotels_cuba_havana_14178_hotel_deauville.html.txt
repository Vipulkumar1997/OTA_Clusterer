Pésimo lugar y pésima atención

No es un hotel 3 estrellas, sino un lugar en un hotel muy mal cuidado (un ejemplo paradigmático: hay una gotera que cae justo en donde se sirve uno el café del desayuno y a nadie del lugar parece importarle), con un servicio al cliente bastante deficiente (te tratan con indiferencia o de mal modo en la recepción; el tipo encargado de regular la entrada al salón del desayuno te trata muy mal). lo único bueno que tiene es la vista al malecón y al mar. hay moscas paradas en las frutas y el pan. nadie las quita. no les importa. no hay correspondencia entre la calidad y el precio.

Worst hotel ever

Hotel in bad conditions , staff hungry for money, reception staff lazy, i was in front of them to ask a question and the staff behind the counter she acknowledge my presence but kept her private conversation in her cellular talking and laughing i had to wait like 5 minutes before she could asked me what i needed.security officer by the door told me if i wanted to bring a girl i can do it but only in his shift late at night and that will cost me 20 dollars.will never go back there and definitely not advising my friends nor family to go there.

Great value for money & helpful, friendly staff

The hotel is located in a very good, convenient area, easy to find. it is a little outdated, but rooms are cleaned every day. staff very friendly and helpful. a bit noisy, even we stay on the 10th floor, but if you are in this kind of location what you expect. the lift was switched off during the night, i believe this was for security reason, so only guests can access it, no strangers from the streets. hotel has the security people too. the breakfast was included to the price and a very good choice, very tasty! we will more than definitely recommend this hotel! they have everything you need during your stay in havana, including an open-air swimming pool & bar on the 6th floor.

Do not stay here!!

After traveling through cuba and staying at an all inclusive hotel, hostels and casa particulars, i thought i would stay my last few nights here as it seemed to offer affordable luxury, but wow was i wrong.  staff everywhere made us feel like we were an inconvenience to them, some were just straight up rude.  rooms were extremely tired and generally grubby, though we did have clean sheets. (there were stains on walls and floor as well as brown tape holding the cracked window together.  if you have children do not stay here as windows open fully so that anyone can jump out!)  the hotel was being fumigated on arrival so i was shocked by the amount of flies while sitting in reception and everyday at breakfast.  in our room i found many small cockroaches in the bathroom and 3 larger ones in the bedroom (2 in my bed), when i requested to change to another room i was told there was none but they would change the bed sheets!  breakfast food was ok.  you may well be thinking that i'm overreacting but after staying in several places in cuba and having not one problem in cheaper accommodation (including previous havanna accomodation) i feel that the price for this hotel is much more than it is worth.  once again do not waste your money in this place!
