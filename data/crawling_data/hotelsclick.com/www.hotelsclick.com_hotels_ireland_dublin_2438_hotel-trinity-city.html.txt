Capital stay

Really nice hotel right in the middle of dublin.
you may spend a little more money to book the place but you don't waste time on getting to the city centre or you don't need to spend money on taxis.
nice bar always full of people.

Excellent experience until the wait for the taxi

Polite, helpful staff and an impressive lobby with a range of comfortable seats create a very welcoming atmosphere.
the room was very comfortable, wifi worked very well and the double-glazing prevented noise disturbance from the road (i was at the front on the first floor).
and with breakfast well up to standard i was very pleased with my choice...however it was spoiled right at the end when i ordered a taxi from the reception staff.
apparently the hotel use one company and after waiting 15 minutes (as vacant taxis were passing in the street outside) the receptionist called the company and i was told it would be three minutes more. after eight more minutes i was told it would be another three minutes. i then gave up and immediately hailed a passing taxi for the airport.
i'm not complaining about the staff, they were doing their best, but the hotel restricting its service to one taxi company may serve them and the company but it doesn't serve the customer.

Best located hotel in dublin

Stayed for a very pleasant weekend with friends, all of whom approved of the hotel. friendly and efficient staff, good service, and good breakfast choice.
location is away from temple bar - but still only 5 minutes away - found some excellent pubs nearby, away from the centre and the crowds.

Central clean hotel

We stayed 3 nights here and the rooms are very spacious and clean.  the lighting is quite dim in the rooms.  big breakfast with lots of choice, groceries next door and the hotel is very centrally located so walking distance to everything including hire car. would stay again.

Diasppointed

Although we had booked trinity capital 3 weeks in advance, we were advised on arrival that their computer systen was "down" and that they were overbooked that evening.  alternative 4 star accommodation was offered but it was much more austere than that at tc.
reason didn't seem too convincing as others arriving after us appeared to be booked in without difficulty.

Special birthday in dublin

I'm loath to overstate how much we enjoyed our stay at trinity capital to celebrate my wife's xxth birthday in case we can't get in next time we visit
dublin
!
however, what a great find. superb location, 'quirky' décor, friendly and helpful staff, very comfortable and quiet rooms, despite being next to the fire station. no dublin call outs when we were there and help immediately on hand should there be a fire in the hotel.....
