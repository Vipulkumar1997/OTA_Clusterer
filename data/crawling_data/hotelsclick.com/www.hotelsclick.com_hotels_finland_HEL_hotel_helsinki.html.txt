Discover Helsinki

There are lots of reasons to visit
Helsinki
, the capital
of Finland
and one of the greenest cities in the world. Surrounded by an
uncontaminated landscape
of lakes and forests and more than 300 islands, Helsinki is a heaven on earth for those loving nature.
The city has more than 600,000 inhabitants, the most populated and important place in Finland. Not only is it the political and administrative
capital of the country
, it is also its cultural and religious centre. The most representative religious authorities and seven universities can be found there. The city has a tight relationship with the Baltic Sea, and many islands are linked together to form the heart of the city. Hundreds of other islands are linked to the mainland with bridges or ferries.

The Best Things To Do and See in Helsinki

Natural Landscapes

The city main attraction is without a doubt its
landscape
. An extraordinary, typical Nordic landscape lies right behind this industrial city, full of
Arctic lakes
and
green forests
. It is worth to spend an entire day trying to discover the typical Finnish landscape, something that leaves you breathtaking throughout the year.
Helsinki is also a very sought after destination for those loving the
Northern Lights
. This fascinating phenomenon can be seen in the Finnish skies for almost 200 days a year. The
best moments to see
it are between the end of autumn and the end of winter. Lights can be seen from Helsinki or its outskirts, where the phenomenon can be better enjoyed because of less light pollution.

Skying in Helsinki

It would be a big mistake thinking there are not many things to do in the winter because of the cold weather. The thick layer of snow is the idea place for those
loving ski
: Finland offers uncontaminated sloes and landscapes.
Around
Helsinki and Turku
are many structures and tracks for cross-country sk, many of which are free. Compared to the rest of the country, the ski season starts late in the year, usually around December and lasts for at least two or three months.
The
biggest ski resorts
can be found North of Helsinki, in
Lapland
, where other activities such as running on a dog drawn sledge and ice fishing.    
Here the skying season goes from December to April and in the winter months the sloes are lit whilst in spring the light of the day lasts until late in the evening.

Finnish Sauna

There's nothing better than a sauna for the cold weather.
Sauna
is actually much more than a relaxing break: it is something Finnish people cannot waive, like a
mystical ritual
. For people all ages, entering a sauna is a way to regenerate mind and body.

Historical and Artistic Buildings

Helsinki also offers historical and art buildings. Among those we recommend:
•
Suomenlinna Fortress
A sea fortress built in the seventeenth century on an archipelago of several islands. It became a UNESCO World Heritage in 1991 and it can be reached with a 15 minute trip from the centre of the city on a ferry;

•
Market Square
Kauppatori square is home of a
characteristic market
where both Finnish and tourists hang out. In this authentic and bright market overlooking the sea you can find food, traditional items and souvenirs. The market also offers food;
•
Uzpenski Orthodox Cathedral
This orthodox cathedral is the biggest one from outside Russia;
•
The Curch carved in the stone

Temppeliaukion kirkko
is undoubtedly the most original church in Finland. This Lutheran church is in the Töölö quarter and is carved in the stone, surmounted by a dome from which the sunlight gets in;

•
The Finnish parliament Palace
The palace dates back to 1930 and is home of the country's parliament.

When To Visit Helsinki: the Best Time

Helsinki can be enjoyed throughout the year.  Between
October and April
you can enjoy the
Northern lights
and a snowy landscape, from
May to September
you can enjoy warmer temperatures, the best way to spend the day in the outside.
It is no coincidence concerts, summer festivals and boat rides all happen in the summer. During the warmest months people can take advantage of the
long days
and warm temperatures. June has an average
19 hours of light per day
. Although there is no real
midnight sun
, he wonderful show of the sun hiding for just a very few hours behind the horizon is really worth it.

How To Reach Helsinki and How To Move There

All flights land at
Helsinki-Vantaa Airport
. The structure is located approximately 20 kilometres from the city centre. The city can be easily reached through public transportations operated by
Helsinki Region Transport
. You can choose between train or bus. Both solutions are convenient, as departures are very frequent and easy up until late at night. The national air carrier is
Finnair
.
In the centre of Helsinki it is
easy to move on foot
or, if the weather allows it, by
bicycle
. Moving from one quarter to another in the city or reaching the outskirts can be done using
bus
or
underground
.

Underground in Helsinki
has only one line reaching 17 stations, most of which are on the surface level. You need only one ticket for the entire public transportation system in Helsinki: the standard ticket has an hour validity and can be used on any mean of transportation.
Just remember that there are about 300 islands in Helsinki:
ferries and boats
ensure a quick connection between the islands and the mainland.
