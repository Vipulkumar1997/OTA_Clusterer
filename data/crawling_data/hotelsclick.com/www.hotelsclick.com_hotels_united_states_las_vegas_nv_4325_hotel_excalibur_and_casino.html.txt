Hotel & casino stay

This would have to be the worst hotel & casino i have visited.

if you love. the smell of old cigarettes then this is the place for you. as soon as the doors or lifts open you are hit by the rancid smell. the air is thick and unclean.

no where to buy anything remotely healthy to eat.

long line to check in & out.
