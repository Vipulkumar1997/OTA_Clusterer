Discover Manchester
Manchester is one of the main cities in
Great Britain
, situated in the north-west of England, in the county of Greater Manchester, more or less half way between
Leeds
and
Liverpool
.        
Manchester, which now has about half a million inhabitants, was originally a Roman colony, founded in 79 AD.        
The city was once one of the main centres of the
Industrial Revolution
in England, but in the twentieth century it was severely affected by the crisis of the textile industry. Nevertheless in recent years it has been able to recover , investing huge sums in the regeneration of the neighborhoods hit by the crisis and on the development of new activities related to art and culture. In this way Manchester has become a very attractive tourist destination.

Historical and cultural Manchester.
Manchester is now a modern and vibrant city, offering several attractions.        
Among the more traditional attractions is
Castlelfield
, the place where was located the ancient Roman settlement of Manucium that gave rise to the city, and the
University of Manchester
, in Oxford Road, which is really famous for some important innovations like the experiments on the atom made by Rutherford.        
The
Manchester Cathedral
, located in the central area called
Millennium Quarter
and built in Gothic style, is dedicated to St Mary, St Denys and St George.

In Manchester there is also the
Chetam's Library
, the oldest England's library, once frequented by Marx and Engels.

Modern and cosmopolitan Manchester.
