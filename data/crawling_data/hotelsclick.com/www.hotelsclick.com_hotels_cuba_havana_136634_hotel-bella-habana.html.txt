Good budget hotel

If you need a place to stay and you need a decent price, this is a good bet. basic, no frills, but worked well for our visit. staff is helpful and follows policies to ensure safety. no complaints and was able to accomodate us on a last minute booking around new year's so the hotel was a real life saver.
