Pleasant & good value

This is my fourth stay at the mespil and as ever the hotel was clean, the staff friendly and the room large. perhasp some rooms are a little tired - especially in the bathrooms. however, overall for me as a business user this hotel fits the bill. the breakfast is good but the evening menu is perhaps limited and of average quality but quite nearby there are a few nearby pubs and restaraunts.

Enjoyable short stay

We have stayed at this hotel for several years and the stays have always been pleasant. the location is good and the hotel is conveniently located for places that we visit, including st stephens green and the rds. these are maybe 12 to 25 minutes away when walking.

the rooms are comfortable and clean, the foyer is bright, the staff very friendly and helpful and the breakfast is fine, with quite a range of foods available.

Nice hotel

We have stayed at the mespil hotel for several years now. i run in the dublin marathon and the hotel is very well situated for it. many other runners stay there also.

the hotel is clean and comfortable, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. for example, on marathon day, providing breakfast at 6:30 a.m. instead of 7 a.m. to cater for participants.
