A diamond in the rough

This hotel was quite reasonable in the price and that's really what i wanted.  i only wanted a shower and a clean room.  i like spending my money on snacks in the park and other things than hotel rooms. i stay in a lot of inexpensive hotels. this one seems like they are just getting started.  refurbishing, painting, fixing, etc.  the staff was really nice, very friendly.  the room was clean, bed sheets and pillows were clean.
room was large enough for the four of us.  there was a refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker.  all were clean.  my daughter brought her computer to do her homework, the internet in the room kind of faded out and we used the days inn internet came through.  then she just went down to the lobby to finish the work.  no problem. the lobby is very pretty, marble floors, walls nice paint almost old world appearance like france or europe.  there was a continental breakfast. it was very good for a continental breakfast.  just enough to get the day started. coffee, juice, toast or plain bread, butter, peanut butter and jelly, 3 types of cereal and milk.  **hotel is near everything!!
