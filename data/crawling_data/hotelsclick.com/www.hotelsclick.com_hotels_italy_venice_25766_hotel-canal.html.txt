Perfectly placed for touring Venice, the 3-star Hotel Canal overlooks the Grand Canal, opposite to the Venice train station, close to Piazzale Roma. This hotel was built on 15th century; it is one of the few gothic Venetian houses that still conserve its own secluded garden. Doesn’t matter if you travel by plane, car or train or even by ship, due to its location, it's a breeze reach the Hotel Canal, without get lost walking around Venice with luggage. The en-suite rooms have air conditioning, Wi-Fi Internet connection, TV, safe box and mini bar. Some rooms have view on the Grand Canal. The continental breakfast is served during the morning; guests can also relax at the bar or in the garden. Being in Venice centre and very close to the main transports stations, the Hotel Canal is a great base from which to explore not only the city of Venice, but also its Lagoon and the Venice’s neighbourhood. The Gondolas station, the waterbus, the bus and the train station are just few steps away from the hotel. By waterbus, it takes about 15 minutes to reach Rialto Bridge and other 15 minutes to Saint Mark Square.

Great location

It is a great location.

but staff can do better with a smile on their faces.  especially the lady who serves the breakfast.

when guests come with heavy luggage, any help to carry those many steps will go a long way to get a higher rating.  i had bad experience, with no help from a gruffy front desk.  they could have handled saying no to help a little more gracefully.

Ok, but only just.

This hotel needs major renovations; peeling paint, ceiling sagging, etc. very clean though. room very dark due to a brick wall just outside the window. fairly good size. close to the station (but those steps on the bridge are murder in the heat with a heavy suitcase!) and the ferries, and lots of restaurants in the vicinity.
no fresh fruit at breakfast.

Awful hotel!

The only good thing about this hotel is the location.  there is no elevator, so we had to drag suitcases up 2 flights of stairs.  staff were not particurarly helpful or friendly and the room was cramped and depressing.  glad i was only staying for one night.
