Venice is one of the most important art cites in Italy. Besides its unique art heritage, it is famous for its natural setting. The town, and its lagoon, were awarded
Unesco World Heritage in 1987
.

,
gondolas
across the canals at sunset and tourists screaming will conquer you for its beauty. It is really impossible to remain insensitive to it.

Main Attractions

Lots of
museums and galleries
attract millions of visitors every year.
The
Peggy Guggenheim Collection
stands out. Located in Guggenheim’s wife house, it collects the artworks the lady had purchased or received as a gift from the many artists to whom she gave hospitality. Brancusi and Calder’s sculptures stand next to paintings byChagall and Mondrian, in a very enchanting and charming atmosphere.
If you want to make a step back in time, the
Eighteenth Century Museum
, inside the mighty Ca' Rezzonico is absolutely a must. In it eleven rooms you will find furnitures, pieces of clothings, jewels, Tintoretto’s paintings and Tiepolo’s frescoes, a real taste of the luxury of the old Venice.
A special mention goes to the
Museum of Natural History
. Enlarged in 2003, the museum features a historical section with more than two million pieces and an incomparable collection of fossils and birds, one of the biggest in the entire world, a section for Giancarlo Ligabue’s scientific expeditions in Niger and an aquarium.
Venice is also spirituality and power.
St Mark's Basilica
, named after the town’s patron saint, is a clear tribute to the Byzantine art. It will soon conquer its visitors with its gold-coloured ceilings and mosaics.
Not far from the church is the
Doge's Palace
, once home of the local political power of the Republic of Venice.
Worth a look are the diplomatic rooms, the prisons and the world famous
Bridge of Sighs
, the last piece of liberty prisoners experienced before being locked into jail. Another attractive points in Venice are the
Arsenal
, the old centre of the shipbuilding industry, and the
Santa Maria della Salute
.
Taking a
vaporetto
heading outside the heart of Venice, you can reach the
Murano Island
, with its coloured houses and the charming small waterways, where you could hang around its narrow streets or visit the
Museum of Glass
, to learn something new about the manufacturing of glass.
A few minutes from
Murano is

Burano
with its
Museum of Lace
and its typical restaurants. Inaugurated in 1981, Burano’s museum of Lace is located in the old school of lace. It shows the typical local working tools for this fabric.
Smaller, and less known, is
Torcello
, an island with only 17 inhabitants. What makes this place an interesting one is the Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta and the Church of Saint Fosca.

Events You Should Not Miss

Those loving social events will find their perfect destination in Venice.
A must event, a unique experience for those willing to take a bite to the real Venetian climate is
the Carnival
: the opening ceremony, with the the angel’s flight, is only the beginning. The parades of the masks, the award for the most beautiful costume and the feast of the Marys will draw the visitors and their curiosity.
A very international event is the
Biennale
, one of the most important international events of contemporary art in the entire world.
Biennale, as it is called in Italian, features some special sections (art, dance, cinema, architecture, music, theatre) and also organizes world famous events such as the
Venice International Film Festival
and the International Architecture Exhibition.
An absolute must is the
Historical Regatta
, which takes place every year along the city’s main channel on the first week of September.
Even if you do not love sports, you will be captured by the parade of old vessels before the race where
gondolini
and
caorline
(small gondolas and small boats) will race together.

Shopping In Venice

Walking along the city streets, called
Calli
, you can still find the old craftsmen working with glass, especially in Murano, or with lace in Burano, or those carving masks.
The
Venetian Masks
are some of the most sought after souvenirs. Beautiful items for parties, they can also be hung asdecorative piece in your house instead of a painting.

Where To Eat In Venice

Venice has a strong culinary identity.
The favourite hanging around spots for Venetian are called
bacari
, small inns where it is possible to enjoy traditional meals and snacks of meat and fish with a nice glass of wine.
Some of the most famous ones are Il Paradiso Perduto, near the Fodamenta della Misericordia, and Alla Vedova in Cannareggio, famous for its meatballs, creamed codfish and the
sarde in saòr
How To Reach Venice And How To Move In The City
One of the most interesting facets of Venice is the possibility to discover the town by simply walking down its
calli
. As even the less expert traveller knows, there is no way to use taxis or bus in Venice. The best means of transportation is the
vaporetto
.
The closest airports are the Marco Polo and the Antonio Canova airports
, respectively in Venice and Treviso.
Alternatively, you can reach Venice by train, getting of at Saint Lucia station.
Best Time Of The Year To Visit The City
The best time of the year to visit Venice is surely
spring
. The mild climate encourages long and the queues for the museums and restaurant are not so bad.
On the contrary, the months to avoid are the hot ones: places like the Doge's Palace or the Saint Mark's Basilica may need queuing up for two or three hours, which is not the best option under the summer sun.
