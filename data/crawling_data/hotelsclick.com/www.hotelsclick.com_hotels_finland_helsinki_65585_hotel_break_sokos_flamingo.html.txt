First rate hotel

Excellent hotel and near vantaa airport and is located in a busy shopping centre it is ideal for last minute items before flying out.  we have stopped there before  and have never been disappointed.   the only downside is that there is nowhere to get a hot meal meal when arriving  late at night from the airport
