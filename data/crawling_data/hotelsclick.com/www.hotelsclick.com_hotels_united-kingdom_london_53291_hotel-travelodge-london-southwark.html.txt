Good

The room was big, with a large size bed. was basic, which you expect from a travelodge but they provided a tv, a kettle (with tea/coffee, sugar/sweetener and milk) and breakfast. the tap in my room didn't work properly, and basic toiletries like toothpaste was not provided. however, the breakfast was good, staff were nice and they kindly let me store my bags in their staff room on the day that i checked out.

October break

We stayed at the travelodge london southwark in october 2013. the hotel is a couple of minutes' walk from southwark station and within walking distance of the thames. the bedroom was clean and comfortable and the self-service breakfast offered lots of choice. we got discounted reservations which made this stay excellent value for money - would definitely stay here again.
