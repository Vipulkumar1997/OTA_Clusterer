Hotel Details


General
Welcome to our restaurant Park Aveny Café, restaurant Locatelli and our pub The Bishop´s Arms. Our conference- and banqueting rooms has been equipped with state of the art technology for lighting, sound and presentation aids. Elite Park Avenue Hotel is a non-smoking hotel.

Lobby
Medium in size, decorated in marble and dark wood, and the reception is a satellite style, incorporating a group of smaller check-in desks.
Exterior
The hotel is a fairly non-descript white stone building from the outside, although this does bely the quality of the product within.
Rooms
The hotel offers rooms with cable TV with premium channels. The rooms are equipped with minibar, trouser press, and turndown service.
Restaurant
Meals are taken in the hotel's restaurant which adjoins the lobby on the ground floor. The decor here is bright, welcoming and informal, with peach and yellow colours to the fore. The breakfast room, by contrast, is more business like, with grey tables and chairs overlooking the avenue outside.

Location
The hotel enjoys a prime central location in the heart of Gothenburg on the famous main avenue, where most of the city's shops are found.
