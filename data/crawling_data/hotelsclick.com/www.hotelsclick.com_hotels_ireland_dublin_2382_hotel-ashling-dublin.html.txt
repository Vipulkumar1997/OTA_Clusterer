A night in the ashling

We usually stay in the ashling if we can get a booking there, it's just about the best hotel in dublin, in our opinion. the rooms are always spotless and comfortable and the beds are heavenly. i should know, i have a bad back! the service is always excellent but their piece de resistance is the buffet breakfast. i've never seen one like it anywhere. anything you could possibly require in terms of breakfast fare is available and is always fresh and delicious. the management staff are always very helpful if you happen to have any unexpected minor medical issues, something which happened to me recently, they couldn't have been kinder about it. we got a good bargain through hotelsclick too.
