Outstanding hotel!!

This hotel far exceeded our expectation, the price was really good considering the location and the facilities available.
the 'standard' room was really big with a king size bed and a really good size shower.
we were unaware of a swimming pool, had we have known we would have brought swimming stuff with us.
the service was excellent, staff were very friendly & helpful.

Great location and price but let down on service and food

The room was great, the view was great, the location was excellent.

issues:
1) queued nearly an hour to check in as there were insufficient staff to cater for all the people who's seminar at the excel had just finished
2) it took another 30 minutes to get my bag bag from storage
3) there was almost no food left at the food shop and the queue took about 20 minutes to serve 10 people.

in a city location this hotel might be great, but they need to cater for the fact that when you have 7,000 people in a seminar 30 seconds walk away.

Not 4 star service

From check-in to check - out this very attractive hotel was let down by complete lack of service which you expect to find in a 4 start hotel.

there was no room-service at all and the restaurant as well as bar was closed until 5pm.  i had to go to the nearby novotel for lunch which meant walking the entire length of the excel convention centre and out the other side.  aloft claims to be best located for excel convention but future guests should look at which end of excel their event is at because we would have been much closer to our event had we stayed at novotel or crowne plaza where guest facilities such as food, drink and spa exist.  finally, the unusual attire of denim jeans and blue poloshirt worn by reception staff would be ok if they were not rude.  i had 2 experiences of rudeness and witnessed another which involved a guest looking for help.
