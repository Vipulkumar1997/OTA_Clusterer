The rooms of Hotel Giorgione are small gems furnished with good taste and an eye for detail.

Satellite television, radio, minibar, safety deposit box, independent air conditioning and heating system, telephone, bathtub/shower stall, hairdryer, personalized complimentary items for the guests of Hotel Giorgione and umbrella in every room ensure the most pleasant of stays in a hotel in Venice’s historic center. Some of the rooms have a charming covered roof-terrace (characteristic Venetian terrace), others have a small private terrace, where guests can enjoy an unforgettable view of the rooftops, belltowers and domes of Cannaregio and all of Venice.
Restaurant
Hotel Giorgione suggests you try the flavorful platters of traditional Venetian food, masterly prepared by the chef of ‘Osteria Giorgione’ restaurant (the ex-Inn), under separate management, and a wine bar with a rich selection of select wines from the best Italian and international cantinas.

Location
In a central and peaceful location in Venice, in the Cannaregio district (called by this name from Canal Regio that connects the Canal Grande to the Laguna), heart of authentic  Venice, the Hotel Giorgione is close to Rialto and to Cà d'Oro and extremely close to piazza San Marco. From the hotel you can reach the Ponte di Rialto in only 5 minutes, the lively commercial heart of Venice, with typical gold-making and souvenir shops under the arches. The colorful fruit and vegetable markets are held at the foot of the bridge along with fish shops. Piazza San Marco is only a 10 minute pleasant walk along narrow streets and small squares, filled with shops and boutiques for both elegant and typical shopping. The heart of faith and once the heart of power of the Serenissima (the old Republic of Venice), piazza San Marco has always given great emotions. The Basilica of San Marco, framed by arcades of the Procuratoria and the Basin of San Marco, wonderful fifth perspective between Palazzo Ducale (Doges’ Palace) and Libreria Marciana (Marciana Library), is a sight to behold.

Great place to stay

We were welcomed by the front desk attendants and especially one gentleman who was very efficient and cordial to our group of 7 who needed 3 rooms. easy place to get to from the boat bus and close to all the touristy points as well as far away from the hustle and bustle. great bar next door and a couple of great restaurants nearby(50 yds).
