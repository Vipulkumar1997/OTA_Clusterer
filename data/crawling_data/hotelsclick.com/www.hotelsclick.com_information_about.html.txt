Our beginnings

The business was established in
2006
based on the experience of our founding partners. The combination of a sound knowledge of this sector of the tourist market coupled with ICT skills, has allowed HotelsClick to situate itself within the principal online reservation sites in very few years.

Looking ahead to the future

The statistics are clear: more and more people are reservingtheir own holidays online.

For this reason, we want to continue to
grow
in terms of
visibility, popularity
and
recognition
, disseminating our brand on different search engines, hotel comparison sites and affiliated websites.

At the same time, we are committed to offering our users
new hotels and destinations
. In particular, in the last few years, we have invested a great deal in researching facilities by the sea and in the mountains, although European cities, first of all
London
,
Paris
and
Rome
remain our flagship product.
