Love this place!

3rd time we have stayed here as this place not only looks great inside and out but it makes you feel great as soon as you enter.
the deal at hotels click was unbeatable against other sites for the same hotel but also unbeatable against the cheaper chains where no breakfast is provided.
the hotel breakfast is great value if you indulge and set yourself up for the day, obviously if you only want for example, toast and coffee, then it may pay to have the room only and drink the hot drinks supplied. it is possible to bring some croissants etc with you and eat in your room. that goes for supper. not that i did. it was interesting to note that the in house menu includes a section of microwavable food to cook in the room, yes there is a microwave. the kitchen area is designed really well and altogether the design of the room is excellent. i would like the lighting to be improved as there is no natural light due to tinted windows and although there is a facility to dim the lighting , the brightest is not bright enough.

Very comfortable, great location

Park plaza westminster bridge is very comfortable and well located close to the south bank and waterloo station, with a car park right next door. the room was very comfortable if a bit dark due to its position.
