Great location

I stayed here for one night the weekend before christmas. it was the perfect location for shopping. the hotel was very busy, which was to be expected, given the size of the hotel and the time of year. however, it meant the bar was too busy to get a seat in so we left for a nearby pub. breakfast was a buffet. i thought it would be waitress service but i think the hotel is just too large to offer this. the room was adequate but it was a 'standard' room so it was small. i did think it was odd to have the bed behind the door but it was very quiet despite being on the first floor and there being wedding on at the hotel.

Overnight stay for xmas shopping

Last minute trip to london for xmas shopping.  perfect location for transport links north (kings cross and euston), and for covent garden/west end shopping.  good price on a very nice room - we were upgraded to a junior suite. all the services you need to a really nice stay, in a good hotel with a bit of history.  what more do you want?!  the only thing i could come up with was nicer coffee at breakfast.  a minor quibble.

Business dec 01 2015

The hotel has seen better days and is a little bit tired.
reception is efficient and breakfast substantial.
i would recommend that you ask for a room at the back of the
building as the front and side can be noisy with traffic.
the bar is open late but is very expensive, and there is a pub
round the back.
overall decent value for the price in london.

Luxurious facade but poor room

I have stayed at this hotel a number of times and it is a very fine building with a grand feel. this time however i was very disappointed with my room which was small, dingy and very dark. it was impossible to work in that room as there was no light that allowed one to read etc.

Hotel russell, russell square - 27th nov

My mother & i stayed here 27/28th nov.  not a pleasant experience.  could have been time of year, wedding party etc., but our twin room was substituted with 2 singles, no where near each other, so i complained.  we got another 2 singles, next door to each other, very small and slightly drab.  previous guests completed "questionnaire" propped up on my bed!!! room very noisey from street below.
lounge area chaotic because of wedding party (very drunk).
breakfast ok, but alot of food just "luke-warm" although staff very pleasant and helpful.

to behonest for a 4* i expected better, and wont be returning here!
