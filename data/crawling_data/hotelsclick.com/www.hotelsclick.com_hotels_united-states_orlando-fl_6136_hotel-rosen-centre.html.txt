Great hotel and location

We were attending a volleyball tournament at the orange county convention center and couldn't ask for a better location and price.  it was within walking distance and no parking fees.  staff was friendly and helpful, the elevator system was quick, beds comfortable, and pool very relaxing.  they have many amenities available,  a nice restaurant, deli, pizza and grocery, plus spa and hair services!
