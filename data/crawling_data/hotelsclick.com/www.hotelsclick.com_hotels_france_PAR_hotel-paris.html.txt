Discover Paris

Paris is the capital of
France
and it is located in the north of the country, in the Region of Île de France.  The city is crossed by the
Seine river
, that divides it into two parts: the
rive droite
, or right bank, which is the economic, financial and political centre of Paris, and the
rive gauche
or left bank, which represents its cultural and artistic heart.
Paris is shared into 20
arrondissements
; each of them is an autonomous administrative district, with its own municipality and mayor.

The Main Parisian Quarters

If the division in
arrondissement
responds to a peculiar administrative need, the division in quarters is far more interesting for their historical and cultural identity. Amongst the main quarters in Paris are:

Montmartre
: the artists' district, where some painters such as Renoir, Picasso, Toulouse-Lautrec and Maurice Utrillo lived. In this area there are many little restaurants, and you can see the beautiful
Basilica of the Sacred Heart
.

Pigalle
: here is located the famous
Moulin Rouge
, and also several restaurants and trendy bars.

Latin Quarter
: this is the student's quarter, in which there is the
Sorbonne University
, and also otherattractions like the
Panthéon
and Rue Mouffetard, a picturesque street full of shops, bookstores and cafes.

Opéra
: here you can experience the commercial and financial soul of the city; in fact in the district there are numerous banks and some big historical stores of Paris, like
Galeries Lafayette
and
Printemps
, where sometimes you can enjoy special offers. Moreover, in this area you can admire the beautiful
Opera House
.

Montparnasse
: the district, which once hosted celebrities such as Modigliani, since the '70s hasdramatically changed its face. A symbol of this mutation is probably the
Tour Montparnasse
, a 210 meter high tower.

Marais
: the ancient Jewish quarter boasts attractions such as
Place de Vosges
, surrounded by arcades and cafes, art galleries and antique shops, and the
Pompidou Centre
. This was built in the 70s, and now houses an incredible collection of modern and contemporary artworks.

Saint Germain des près
: it was frequented by some offbeat intellectuals like Jean-Paul Sartre, but it has now changed its face; inside this area you can however find out some of the cafes in which those people met.

Islands of the Seine
: in the Île de la Cité, there is the magnificent
Cathedral of Notre Dame
, the
Sainte Chapelle
and the
Conciergerie prison
, in which Marie Antoinette was imprisoned during the French Revolution. The streets of the Île Saint-Louis are full of restaurants and antique shops.
Paris is full of attractions and places to visit, so that it would be impossible to develop a comprehensive list. Some of them, however, must be mentioned: the
Eiffel Tower
, that is the undisputed symbol of the city, the
Champs-Elysées
, which branch out from the Arc de Triomphe, whose construction was ordered by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806.
Among the tourism attractions of Paris, that you can visit, we also mention
Place Vendôme
, one of the most elegant squares of the city, which was built in the seventeenth century, the
Louvre
, undoubtedly one of the greatest museums in the world, and the
Musée d'Orsay
, where you can admire some of the paintings of the leading exponents of Impressionism, as Renoir, Cezanne, Degas and Monet.

A Small Guide to the Nightlife in Paris

Cabarets and clubs are some of the most important hangout spots for those loving nightlife. Besides the world famous
Moulin Rouge
, you can spend a nice, different evening at
Crazy Horse
,
Lido
or at
Paradis Latin
. All these clubs offer live shows, champagne or table dining while watching the show.

How To Reach Paris

The
best way to reach Paris
is surely the
plane
. The French capital has three airports:
-
Charles De Gaulle
, the main one, about 25 kilometres (15 miles) north of Paris. It is served by the world’s main carriers;
-
Orly
, mostly used for domestic and mid length flights towards European and North African countries. It is about 15 kilometres (9,5 miles) from the centre;
-
Beauvais-Tillé
, about 80 kilometres (50 miles) North of Paris. The airport hosts four low cost companies wih flights connecting european and North African destinations, even seasonal ones.
A good alternative is the
train
. Train is a nice and cheap way to reach the centre of Paris. Unlike airplanes, it brings travellers directly to the centre of the city, saving time and money.

How to Move in Paris

The most practical way to visit the town is the
underground
. The 16 lines allow to easily reach every part of the city, also linking the outskirts of town to the centre.
If you want to move quicker from ad to the most peripheral quarters you can use RER, the
urban ad suburban railway system
linking all the metropolitan area of the French capital. Those willing to move on the ground level can use
tram
or
bus
. There are four tram lines, travelling every 5-7 minutes. Buses reach every part of the city. Bus is also the best choice at night: there are 47 lines of night buses in Paris, serving the city until 5 AM.

Best Time To Visit Paris

The Parisian climate has rainy and mild winters, with bed weather bringing cold and snow. Rain is generally concentrated in autumn, while in spring and summer the weather is nice and temperatures are mild. The
best time to visit Paris
is between May and September. Not only are temperatures ideal in spring ad summer. The most interesting events occur in that time of the year.
