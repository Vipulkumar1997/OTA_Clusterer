Clean and comfortable hotel

The hotel is perfectly situated in a quiet street near to the vaporetto stop, the shops, restaurants and cafes of the gran viale, and the beach. the staff were friendly and helpfull, rooms spotless, the free wifi worked perfectly, but for me best of all was the patio and garden area where you can enjoy a relaxing breakfast or drink.
