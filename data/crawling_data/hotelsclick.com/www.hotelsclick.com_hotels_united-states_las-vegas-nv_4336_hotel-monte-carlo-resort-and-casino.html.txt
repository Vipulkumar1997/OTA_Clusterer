Monte carlo

This is not the first time ive stayed at the monte carlo.  every time we go i do the research on price and location and we always seem to come back to the monte carlo...there are cheaper places but this is a good price for what you get...only complaint was that the pool was under construction which i did not see (if it was posted, it wasnt very obvious) when i made the reservation...all in all, we had a great time!!
