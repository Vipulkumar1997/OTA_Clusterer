Brilliant base

I have stayed at the st giles hotel now 3 or 4 times over the last couple of years and i can honestly say i have not been let down once. the staff are very friendly and willing to help, rooms of a decent stand for what i was looking for with a well equipped breakfast bar to choose from.

the hotel is in the perfect location for anything you need in london, oxford st literally round the corner for the shoppers and other tourist attractions with easy walking distance not to mention tottenham court road station 2 seconds away.

Theatre weekend

For a central location this hotel is great, no more than a 10 minute walk from theatres bars and shops and right on top of oxford st the down side to this hotel is it is dated and could do with freshening up, the room we stayed in (basic double ) was small but clean and again could do with a facelift
