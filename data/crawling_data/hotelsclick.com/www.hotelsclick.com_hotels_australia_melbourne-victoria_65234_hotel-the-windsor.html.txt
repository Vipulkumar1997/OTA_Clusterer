Excellent

All in all it was a good experience, the room, was spacious and comfortable and a nice surprise to have a bath as well as a shower in the room.  the restaurant (one eleven) was disappointing for evening dinner but the breakfast was great.

Pleasure from the past

It was a real treat to stay at the historic hotel windsor. we were delighted to read about its past and see the paintings by earnest buckmaster. the staff were warm and welcoming. we thoroughly enjoyed the excellent harpist.  our upgrade was very much appreciated. the spacious rooms were spotless and filled with wonderful curtains, carpet and antiques. it was super quiet and we had a great view of parliament house.  the bed was so comfortable and the late checkout was a real treat. we did not have to rush. we would highly recommend this hotel to our friends.

Heritage hotel

The windsor is the perfect hotel for celebrating a special occasion. although it is a heritage property, it has all the mod cons that you need. the decor was lovely and the staff were friendly and professional. we stayed in a superior room, which had lots of space and facilities. we asked for a quiet room, so had a room with no view from the windows, but no traffic noise. in a major city, this is a bonus. we would highly recommend this hotel.
