Woken three times

A saga of room lights not working, engineer visiting and mending, bedside light going off 10 minutes after engineer left, bedside light coming back on again in the night and waking me up - switched it off, went back to sleep and it came on and woke me up again.  nice enineer came after 11pm (i was having an early night) and disabled the switch of the bedside light - then, unbelievably, the telephone started ringing - no-one there.  went back to sleep and was woken a third time by the telephone; took receiver off and buried phone under a pillow.  got to sleep eventually.

Perfect location

The hotel is perfectly placed for a visit to london and the staff were very helpful.  we arrived early and while we couldn't check in there was a facility to leave our bags which allowed us to explore the area.  the hotel is a bit dated but is very clean and the beds are very comfortable.  the hotel is very busy so if you want to get breakfast you need to get us early

Recent stay

We loved the location of the hotel, breakfast was excellent and we managed to miss the long queues that we saw on leaving the breakfast room. standards rooms are basic and in need of some modernising but are clean. extra pillows would have been useful in the room to sit up and watch tv. as we stayed 3 nights a better view should have been an option for staying longer but we were given a brick wall and offered a better view if we paid for a club room. the room above us we heard high heels for about 1/2 hr at 3.30 am each early morning -- must have been in the bathroom as the rooms were carpeted. lots of airline staff staying here after flights.

Great hotel with fantastic staff

We had a very pleasant stay here, not least because we were given a free upgrade to a club room when we mentioned it was our wedding anniversary.  the staff were all really helpful and friendly and the location worked well for us.

Sadly not a happy guest

When arriving to check in, the hotel had no reservation for me on their system even though i had booked 6 weeks prior and had received my confirmation email. the receptionist (poonam i think) was very friendly however, and gave us a complimentary drinks voucher while we waited. all this though had a knock on affect for us getting ready for an event we were attending that night. the room it's was disappointing. no air con, no fan in the bathroom and the shower was little more than a dribble. i was almost tempted to go to sleep that night with the hotel door propped open just to keep some more air coming through the room. we then had the chambermaids entering our room at 7am and again at 8.30am wanting to clean it when we were still in bed. not impressed at having them walk in!!! will definitely not be going back again and wish i'd book the holiday inn opposite!

Many good points

Good overall value. the central position, with an underground station less than 5 minutes away make it easy to get around london. the hotel restaurant served some lovely asian food for a very reasonable price and the staff were helpful.
the rooms are fairly basic but comfortable and our initial room had a gap between the window frame and wall creating a whistling sound but we were moved to another room once we pointed this out. intermittent wireless reception in room.
have stayed here before and no doubt will again.

Tara

Cosidering the comparatively low price compared to other london hotels, i was pleasantly surprised with all aspects of this hotel, from the pleasant and helpful msnner of commissionaires and front of house staff to the decor and cleanliness of the hotel generally. the room was of generous proportions and contained everything we needed. the breakfast was probably as good as one would find anywhere. top notch!
