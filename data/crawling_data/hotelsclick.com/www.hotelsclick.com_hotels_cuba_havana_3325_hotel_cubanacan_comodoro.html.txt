Not so good

Room was not clean and the hot water was hit or miss. the sheets had a very weird smell. we requested the sheets be changed, apparently sheets were changed but they had the same smell. the breakfast buffet did not have a good variety and the food was ok.

A basic hotel with unreliable hot water

The comodoro is moderately priced.  the rooms need upgrading, but not unusual for cuban hotels in this price range.  the basics are all there.  we usually had hot water in the very early morning, but not later.
