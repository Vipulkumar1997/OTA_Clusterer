Don't go if you are planning to sleep anytime between 11 pm until 03:00 am!

Every single night, there were people at the bar downstairs yelling and singing songs and playing drinking games (most of them were part of the contiki tours) the whole night. when you call the staff they don't do anything about it. in fact they tell u that they will see what they can do but watching from the window we didn't see anyone going up to the noisy people. we were not light sleepers but believe it or not nobody can sleep in that amount of noise. so unless u are not planning on sleeping all night don't even think about going there. you will regret it, guaranteed!

A weekend in london

Clean hotel, friendly staff excellent location for getting around sightseeing, close to tube station and a bus route right outside the hotel what more could you ask for.  there was a queue for breakfast on the saturday, however it is a big hotel and it was full, to us this was not a problem you just have to be patient.   there is a great choice available for breakfast.  the meals in the restaurant although a small choice are very good value for money.  overall a pleasant stay good value for money and we will definitely stay again

Old but comfy

At first glance the lobby is nice, the staff is friendly and helpful. we did notice a lot of litter around the floor of the bar area. the hotel is old and needs a facelift but the rooms are very clean. there is no air conditioning and you won't get the normal items in your room of hair dryers, shampoo and washcloths so plan appropriately. we did enjoy our stay though and would go back again.

Royal national hotel in bloomsbury london

This is our eigth stay in the royal national which speaks for itself. whilst the hotel as a whole is pretty awful, the rooms are ok, the breakfast, so so but the location is really good.  the price for a
london
central hotel isn't bad and for my wife and i, this together with the location is the draw.
