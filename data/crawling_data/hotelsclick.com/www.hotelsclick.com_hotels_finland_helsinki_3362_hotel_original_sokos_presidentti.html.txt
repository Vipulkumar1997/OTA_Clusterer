Sokos presidentti helsinki

This was our second year staying at the presidentti during pre christmas week. it is located just 10 minutes walk from the main shopping centres and both bus & rail terminals. all of the staff that we encountered were very helpful & friendly. the cold / hot buffet breakfast was awesome. bedrooms had flat screen tv, phone, mini bar/fridge air-con and were well served by 4 efficient elevators. oh and nearly forgot to mention the excellent sauna & pool & free internet.
