Lovely stay - again

I have stayed here before and am always impressed by the cleanliness and standard of the hotel. i always email before and usually end up in my favourite room. the stay was again very good, the weather was great so i was able to enjoy the outdoor pool. walk to disneyland takes 20 mins to the parks and 15 to the village, nice easy walk and frequent shuttle busses too.

only gripe is that check in seems to get slower and slower each time, despite the fact that they have all my details. this time i was forgotton about and several other people checked in whilst i was still stood there asking for my key.
