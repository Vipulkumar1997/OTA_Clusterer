Problem with my booking

Said the hotel was full, fortunately was offered a room in nearby hotel. they used the language barrier to not properly explain and the nearby hotel wasn't as good, no refund or compensation offered.

Wonderful stay!

We used the dream castle hotel for our trip to disneyland parks. we had a wonderful room with a great view on the 5th floor. i'm a bit of neat freak and our room was cleaned very well and well stocked. everyday we received room service and new toiletries/towels. the beds were very comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well. the staff was friendly and helpful. we used the buffet breakfast everyday, it was good as long as you arrived prior to 10:30 (closes at 11, food was running low). we were able to park our car and use the bus to travel to disneyland. it worked great and we never waited longer than 10-15 mins. we were also able to purchase our tickets (2 parks, 2 days) at the hotel. the swimming pool is great! i loved that it had a section for younger kids since my daughter is 2. we were very comfortable during our stay and had no problems. i will recommend this hotel and website for booking and will return! thank you!

The magic land

Generally had a great stay and the most important is the children were happy.
found reception aloof, and very unhlepful, esp.the staff that originated from asia. the receptionists used the shuttle bus as well as the guests and did not give their seats up for paying guests.
hk ok, lounge bar the service was not excitant, just look at the cleanliness of the tables on the terrace.
food quality excellent and service in the restaurant
