Pleasant return visit

I first stayed in this hotel 45 years ago, coincidently in the same room,  when it was called capellis. while it has been extensively remodelled and modernised over the years, and has changed its name, i was please to find the staff as friendly and helpful as back then, the rooms maintained to a high standard of cleanliness, the breakfast tasty and varied. my only disappointment, remembering the old lively american terrace bar, was the bar, which was empty and unmanned when i looked in.

Perfect getaway for a mere vaporetta ride from venice!

Having never been to venice, i was so pleased to have "accidentally" booked a trip on lido. off season, it is the perfect, quiet place to stroll the back streets and beach area without a tourist in sight! the hotel was charming and the staff helpful and friendly. the delicious, full breakfast buffet was a wonderful addition and perfect way to start the day. thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend this lovely hotel!

Le boulevard

After reading reviews we were a little apprehensive about the small rooms the lift was slow etc.
yes this is correct but it is value for money we have no
complaints so if you want large rooms etc in venice go and pay 100-200euros a night then you will have something to moan about
