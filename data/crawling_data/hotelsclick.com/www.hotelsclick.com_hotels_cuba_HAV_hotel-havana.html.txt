Best Things To See in Havana

Havana, with its Spanish colonial architecture, its quaint restaurants, museums and lively streets, is definitely a unique tourist destination, where you can fully appreciate Cuban history and traditions.
The colonial buildings are concentrated in
Habana Vieja
, or Old Havana, which has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Here there is the
Palacio de Los Marqueses de Aguas Claras
, an old palace dating from the eighteenth century, which was restored in 1980 and became a famous restaurant in Cuba, called
El Patio
.  Near the palace is the Cathedral Square, surrounded by important buildings as the
Cathedral
, dedicated to St Mary and St Christopher, also built in the eighteenth century, and the
Colonial Art Museum
with its collection of furniture dating back to colonial times. Around the square there are also a lot of bars and restaurants where you can sample Cuban specialties. Two other important squares of Habana Vieja are
Plaza de las Armas
(Arms Square) and
Plaza Vieja
(Old Square); in these district there is also the
Bodeguita del Medio
, which is one of two historical pubs , along with the Floridita, once frequented by the writer
Ernest Hemingway
, who spent some years of his life in Havana.
Through the avenue Malecon Habana Vieja is connected to many other districts of the city as Centro Habana, which is the historical centre of the town where you can stroll along the
Paseo del Prado
, which is the main avenue of Havana. In this district there is the
National Capitol
, where was based the Cuban Parliament before the Revolution, the Opera House and the
Museum of the Revolution
, located in the former Presidential Palace. Another historical district in Havana is the Vedado, where there is the
Revolution Square
, one of the places in this city that you cannot miss a visit.
Other attractions are the
University of Havana
, that was the centre of the revolutionary movement, and the National Academy of Fine Arts, located in a monumental building dating back to 1940. If you visit Havana, you can not in any case avoid walking through its streets, maybe stopping for tasting a Mojito or a Daiquiri as Hemingway did, and enjoying the unique atmosphere of the Cuban capital.

How To Reach Havana

Havana can be reached on one of the many
international flights
landing at
José Martí International Airport
, Cuba most important airport, about 18 km (11 miles) from the city centre.
From José Martí International Airport, reaching the city centre takes about 45 minutes. To reach Havana you can take an
official taxi
(the regular fare is around 20-25 CUC),
rent a car
directly at the airport or alternatively take a
bus
. Buses for Havana leave every 30 minutes but they must be paid with the local currency. Our advice is to opt for private transportation.

The Best Way To Go Around Havana

In general, visiting Havana is neither hard nor expensive. For small distances the
best way is to go on foot
.
Another comfortable way are
taxis
. They are very cheap and can reach every part of the city. There are different types of taxis in Havana: the classical tourist taxis and
colectivos
(vintage cars), as well as yellow cabs or coco-taxi. What should be avoided are illegal taxis. Official ones are operated by a driver whose id can be seen on his shirt.
As far as public transportation are concerned, it is best not to rely on
local buses
, often overcrowded, slow and often not on time. New urban buses are more expensive but reliable. They also cover the entire city and are the best way to move inside it. But the best option to be efficient and independent is
renting a car
, even a vintage one, to better enjoy the climate of the city. The only negative thing are roads, not very well equipped and in bad state.

When To Visit Havana

Being a tropical country, Cuba has a
rainy season
. The most humid, sultry and rainy months are those from May to October, during which it rains a lot and there is often the risk of hurricanes which often hit the Eastern side of the island.
Winter, corresponding to the tourist season, goes from December to April. These are the
best months to visit Havana
, when days a re longer and the temperature is between 25 and 28 °C (77-82.4 °F) on average.
The
water of the sea
is warm throughout the year and is perfect for immersions and snorkelling.
