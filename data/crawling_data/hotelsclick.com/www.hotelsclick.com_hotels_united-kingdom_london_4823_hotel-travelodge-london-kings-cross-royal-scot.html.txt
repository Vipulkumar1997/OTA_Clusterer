Currently this hotel is not fit for purpose

This is usually a good hotel to stay at for the budget conscious and those who want to be close to good transport links as well as shops and restaurants. however the hotel is currently being renovated whilst remaining open so it is in a state of disarray. additionally they have damaged the water system and there is no a wailing banshee sound whenever anyone gets a shower. people were getting showers at 5am so it was difficult to get to sleep after being woken. currently i cannot recommend staying here.

Budget - you get what you pay for

Walking distance to king's cross is a huge bonus at this hotel. additionally, it's located adjacent to finsbury, an up and coming hip little neighborhood. for london, this seems to be the best located and affordable comfort.

london break

Travelodge is a well known budget accommodation brand and as such we have used their hotels at various times for short breaks. this particular hotel is well situated if you are using king's cross or st pancrass railway stations.
it is also on the number 63 bus route from king's cross.
the room we had was somewhat tired,ie well used, but it was clean and the bed was fine. the full english breakfast was exceptionally good. we did not use the restaurant in the evening but the menu was varied and reasonable priced.

Better than expected

Overall my stay here was pretty good which for a large part was to do with the friendly staff, comfortable bed and good breakfast. it is an easy 10 min walk to the main kings cross / st pancras train and underground stations which also means that the area is relatively quite compared to the main kings cross area. this is most definitely a budget hotel and there is nothing in any way sophisticated or luxurious about it however look past the drab building and small rooms it is a perfectly clean, comfortable, secure and friendly environment to be in. the rooms are basic but have everything you need with extremely comfortable beds, strong showers with plentiful hot water and towels, good mirrors, tv and kettle etc.  the real surprise was that there was an excellent breakfast included in my price. the only thing missing in the rooms was a hair dryer and the only criticisms i have are that all the internal sides of the windows needed cleaning and there was a strange and intrusive whirring noise in my room ( 407 ) every night between 1100 and 1130. otherwise i was pleasantly surprised.

Tired space

Couple of lifts not working, vending machines broken on our arrival, both fixed by morning though. tatty battered furniture, but a clean room and comfy bed. for the price i paid i'm not really surprised. it's fine for a crash pad after a party. breakfast was plentiful and included in the price.
