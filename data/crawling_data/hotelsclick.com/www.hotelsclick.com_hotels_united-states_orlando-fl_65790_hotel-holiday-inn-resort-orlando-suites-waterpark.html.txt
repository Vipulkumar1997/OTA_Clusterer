Not very impressed

We mainly booked this hotel so that the kids could enjoy the pool. well, the bedroom smelled so bad that we had to leave the door opened for a while, but didn't help much. the water in the slides were freezing, but the water in the pool was nice and warm. there were life guards around the pool and there were not many people there. i think the expensive resort fee was paying the life guards. we stayed in the pool for 3 hours and it said that some events would take place by the pool, but nothing happened. we were disappointed and i will never go back again. the hotel is old, expensive and besides the pool everything else you have to pay separately to enjoy.
