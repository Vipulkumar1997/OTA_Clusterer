Australia - Search and Book Hotel





Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia,is a country in the Southern Hemisphere comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. Neighbouring countries include
Indonesia
, East Timor and Papua New Guinea to the north; the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and
New Caledonia
to the north-east; and
New Zealand
to the south-east. Australia's size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with subtropical rain forests in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east areas, and a dry desert in its centre. It is the flattest continent, with the oldest and least fertile soils; desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land. The driest inhabited continent, only its south-east and south-west corners have a temperate climate. Although most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, it includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests, and is recognised as a megadiverse country. The center of the island is dominated by
Ayers Rock
, a massive rock that changes color depending on the season thanks to a special mineral of which is done, the
feldspar
. Another natural wonder is the
Kakadu National Park
, where you can admire the beautiful cave paintings of the Aborigines and the Australian rainforest that covers 80% of the area of the park that is home to many species of animals. But Australia is not only made of rock and forest, but also beautiful coastline bordering the Pacific, such as the East Coast where there is the famous
Great Barrier Reef
, the largest conglomeration reef of the planet populated by tropical fish of every color and shape. A region not well known is that of the
Kimberley
where you can admire the unspoiled landscapes and natural beauties such as waterfalls, canyons and baobab trees.
