Not for the faint hearted!

The facilities within this hotel is for people with young families.  however it does seem to attract hen/stag weekends which then results in the rowdy drunken adults screaming at each other at 4am!!
both nights of our stay, we were woken up this and had to get up and speak to the other guests and ask them to keep the noise down.

because of the large number of children staying at the hotel, we found breakfast was more like feeding time at the zoo!!

it certainly is not the place for persons looking a quiet civilised weekend.

after saying that, it is well priced which is probably what attracts young families1

One night stay in may 2013.

We have used this hotel a number of times and will use it agin in the future; at the right price. we had tried to book direct and were quoted a price 20 euro more expensive than two months ago. we actually got it even cheaper than before by booking online.
it's a large hotel with very friendly, helpful staff. the rooms are clean, comfortable and a good size. there was a good choice at breakfast and you could have as much as you liked, which definitely suited some of our group!

Idublin adventure

We weren't disappointed with our choice of hotel. from the moment we walked through the door of our room we knew we had got it right.  we weren't sure if we would be to far away from the city but the peace and quiet at night was very welcomed.  we are sure if we had stayed in the city we would have been listening to traffic and noise from people enjoying themselves over night. however the taxi fares into the city and to and from the airport were costly!  there is a bus service at the liffy valley shopping centre which runs every 6 mins and cost less than 2euros per person which takes you into the city.  if you are over sixty and hold a bus pass this cost you nothing. the only negative point is because of the number of guests at the hotel you were kept waiting to be seated for breakfast.
