Great staff, two min drive to disney!

Great hotel. we parked in their under ground car park which is secure and only cost €10 per night. we only stayed one night but the staff suggested we leave the car in the car park and they would shuttle is to disney land. it was a two minture car journey in they new mini bus and they collected us at the end of the day when we called to request a pick up and we got back to the hotel and go straight in our car to drive back to calais. the staff were great and nothing was too much trouble. very friendly and lovely with our two young children. we were in a suite which was clean. the bed was really comfortable and we had a lovely balcony. the pull out bed was quite firm but fine for our two children. the little kitchen was fab, we bought our own breakfast and tea/coffee etc so it was perfect. there was even a mini dishwasher! we didn't eat in the hotel but the restaurant looked lovely. it's a short stroll to a local shopping mall which houses a sea life centre and lots of restaurants inside and outside. the local area is very clean and appears safe. all purpose built, very nice surroundings and close to the motorway so easy to find. would definitely recommend this hotel! we will stay here again!
