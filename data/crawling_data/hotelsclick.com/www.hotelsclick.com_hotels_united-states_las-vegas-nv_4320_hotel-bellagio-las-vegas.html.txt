The hotel has a wide parking area and offers transfer services from and to the airport. Casinos, shows and nightlife are featured in the main block of the hotel sets side by side with the impressive Spa Tower. Focused on leisure and entertainment, the Bellagio offers every day plenty of activities and events. At the Bellagio Las Vegas, food is another highlight; top quality dishes are served in twelve restaurants. From Italian cuisine to Japanese fresh dishes, from Mediterranean to American classic, guests can really enjoy any type of food from all parts of the world, offered in very exclusive ambiences.

Best location in las vegas

Beautiful hotel in the best location in las vegas. room and service were excellent. lots of  lovely restaurants and cafes within the hotel. this hotel is huge and very, very busy. the pool area is gorgeous but despite its size the loungers fill up quickly when the weather is good.

Average

Was expecting great things from this hotel and sadly it was only ok. i  specifically booked this hotel as it gave me the option of booking a twin room rather that  a double. when we checked in the receptionist said there were only doubles available at the time, if i wanted a twin i would have to wait, she couldn't say how long. she did offer us a twin smoking room which was available straight away, however when we went to look at the room it did smell very strongly of smoke. so we went back to reception and waited for a non smoking twin room. the decor in the room was average, we previously had two nights across the road in the paris, which was much nicer. the foyer area in the hotel was nice, but i wasn't blown away. the bellagio buffet however was fantastic, would really recommend it, lots to choose from and the quality was definitely 5 star.
