About Adventures for 20s & 30s

Clients travelling on Adventure tours for 20's & 30's must be 18 – 39 years old. Our Adventures aim to unite you with other like-minded adventure seekers from all over the world. You can rest assured that on a Adventures for 20s & 30s tour, you’ll be with a great bunch of people who are near the same age and on the same wavelength as you, all geared up for the experience of a lifetime. Many of our tours are 2 to 3 weeks in length, designed for the young professionals that do not have lots of annual leave to take.

These itineraries are all about choice and flexibility. We want you to pay as little as possible for the tour so you have more to spend when you are out there so that you can create a trip that suits your personality and budget. We do not include many excursions meaning you only have to budget for the optional excursions that you really want to do. You can see a full list of excursions on your detailed itinerary.
