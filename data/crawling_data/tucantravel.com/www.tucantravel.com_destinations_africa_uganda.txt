Uganda Tours

Take a Uganda adventure tour and discover this fascinating country packed with wonderful sights and things to do. Uganda boasts massive Lake Victoria plus the source of the Nile River, the rare lowland mountain gorilla and the highest mountain range in Africa, the Ruwenzori’s. Kampala is Uganda's bustling capital city, boasting plenty of markets as well as some lively restaurants and bars.

Tranquil Lake Bunyoni is visited on our Uganda adventure tours, where we will take a cruise on the lake and enjoy a guided visit to a local pygmy village. Jinja is where you will find the source of the White Nile river which flows all the way to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. This is also Uganda's extreme sports hub, so it's time to get into some adrenaline-fuelled optional activities like white water rafting on the longest river in the world, quad biking to local villages along riverbanks, and bungee jumping. Don’t miss out on one of our Uganda adventure tours!

Uganda Travel Articles, Inspiration & Information






Searching for the Gorillas : Sarah’s Adventure

As cheesy as it sounds, I think after watching ‘Gorillas in the Mist’ when I was little I had always had in mind that one day I would try to see gorillas for myself. When I found out that I was moving to tour lead for Tucan Travel in Africa I really started looking into what trekking the gorillas in Uganda involved and it then became top of my list of things to do..

Visiting the Pygmy Village

Whilst on the lovely Lake Bunyonyi we have an opportunity to visit the Pygmy village on the other side of the lake.  The pygmy village is something that we have been involved with since I started working with Tucan in Africa, and it has been exciting to see the progress. The pygmy’s traditionally live in the forest, feeding on berries and fruits..

Silverbacks and baby gorillas

After three hours of trekking through the wet and slippery undergrowth we take a breath, “we are close” the ranger whispers and motions for us to place our walking poles on the ground. We had been instructed to do this back at the base, the sticks reminding the gorillas of the poachers and hunters who used to roam the dense forest in search of trophies.

Uganda Travel Guide

Brief history

Nilotic and Bantu people moved in to the region during the 1st  millennium AD and Swahili, a Bantu language, is the main language today.  Arab traders moved inland from the Indian Ocean coast in the 1830s and  were followed by British explorers in the 1860s, searching for the  source if the Nile. The United Kingdom first placed Uganda under the  charter of the British East Africa Company in 1888, then ruled it as a  protectorate from 1894. Independence came in 1962 but there were coups  and counter-coups which lasted until the mid 1980s. Idi Amin took power  in 1971, ruling the country with military force, decimating the economy  and with his abuse of human rights and ethnic cleansing, killed an  estimated 500,000 Ugandan people. His reign was ended in 1979 by  Tanzanian forces aided by Ugandan exiles. The current President is Yowery  Musevini.

Geography and weather

Uganda is a landlocked country of a comparable size to twice that of  England. The country is located on the East African plateau, averaging  about 900m above sea level and although generally tropical, the climate  does vary in different parts of the country. Lakes are an important part  of the country’s geography with access to Lake Victoria, Lake Albert,  Lake Kyoga and Lake Edward. The source of the Nile, one of the longest  rivers in the world, is also found at Jinja.

Most of Uganda has the typical double rainy season found in the Kenya  Highlands – the long rains from April to June and the short rains from  October to December - but towards the north these two rainy seasons tend  to merge into a single long wet period with a single dry period.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

EU, US, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand citizens all need a visa to enter Uganda. For many nationalities visas must be obtained before travel for US$50 however you should contact the embassy for further information.

It may be cheaper for you to obtain an East Africa Visa which covers Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda

Visa services like
www.travcour.com
can be very helpful.

Important: Pounds Sterling are not accepted at border crossings so bring US dollars cash for any visa expenses at the border.

Border Crossings

To Uganda from Kenya: Malaba
From Rwanda to Uganda: Katuna

Money

Please note
: It can be very difficult to obtain US  dollars in Africa, even in major cities  like Cape Town. Many places  will not accept any notes that are marked,  torn or older than the year  2002, and you may have difficulty exchanging  these notes elsewhere in  Africa, so please check your cash carefully at  the point of purchase.

The monetary unit in Uganda is the Ugandan shilling. For up-to-date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

In general, Visa is the only credit card that will work everywhere in   Africa. Master Card, AMEX and Cirrus will work in some countries but   not in others.

We recommend that you bring cash in US dollars   only. When changing money, it is a good idea if at all possible, to get   small denomination notes and coins in the local currency as often there   is a lack of change when you are making purchases and no-one in Africa   ever seems to have change.

On arrival at Entebbe International Airport we suggest that you  withdraw some Ugandan Shillings at the ATM or change some money at the  bank if you only have US dollars or travellers cheques. Change enough  money to see you through the first few days of your trip – particularly  if it is a weekend.

Please note that it is not possible to withdraw US dollars from ATMs in Africa, only local currency.

Shopping

Haggling is expected in Uganda and hunting for bargains can be a real highlight.

Your best buys are wooden carvings (especially around the Western  side of the country as they come from Congo), as well as batiks (wall  hangings), cane baskets, and of course tee shirts. Uganda is also well  known for drum making, although as these are covered with cow hide, most  countries outside of Africa will not allow them in.

Tipping

In most Ugandan restaurants all taxes (including VAT) and service  charges are included in the menu prices and bill. However it is always  prudent to ask and unless you get exceptional service, it is not  necessary to give a further tip. You should take both of these charges  into account when reading the menu and check that all taxes are  included. You do not need to tip taxi drivers but if you have just taken  a push bike taxi  on an uphill route your bike rider will always  appreciate one!

Tipping guides at the end of excursions and treks etc is always appreciated and your tour leader will advise you on the amount for this.

Local transport

Shared Taxis (small mini vans) are by far the most common means of  transportation in Uganda and work in the same way as the Matatus in  Kenya. They leave from designated places called stages but only when the  taxi is full. They can also be caught from the road if one is passing  by sticking out your arm with your palm down. This is the sign you want  to be picked up. If the vehicle is not full, the driver will pull over  to let you in.

There are at least two people that run every shared Taxi, a driver  and a tout. Touts can be very aggressive and rude. Don't let a tout take  your bag from you, and make your own decision about which vehicle to  take. Never pay for a ticket before you get on – always board first and  ask other customers what they are paying so you don’t get ripped off. It  is not recommended to take a shared Taxi at night.

Also a good way to get around is by motorbike taxi (known as a Boda  Boda) these are registred taxis and will provide you with a helmet, or if you are not in a hurry - pushbike taxi. These are ideal for  short journeys around  town and are inexpensive and great fun. There are  always fixed prices for these within a town for both one way and return  journeys so arrange the price first. They will generally wait for you  at no extra cost if you are only going to be a short while and then take  you back again.

Security

Crime is not a great problem in Uganda, but you still need to take  care and act sensibly. Don’t walk around lonely back streets, especially  on your own, don’t wear expensive looking jewellery or a classy watch  and don’t carry a wallet in your back pocket. Don’t carry your camera  openly; always have it in a small day pack which is firmly attached to  your body, preferably in the front in crowded places. Always wear a  money belt or leave your valuables, including your passport, in the  hotel security box.

Photography

Caution should be taken when taking photos in and around the city.  Locals should always be asked prior to taking a photo and it is not  uncommon for them to ask for a small donation. Never take photos of  police, military personal or buildings. The same goes for any government  buildings, banks, post offices or the railway station.

Local food and drink

Some meals are included when camping and lunch is usually included on  traveling days in the truck. When staying in hotels or hostels, all  meals are at your own expense.

In Uganda the basic diet is very much like Kenya and focuses around  chicken, beef, pork and fresh water fish, mostly served with rice,  boiled potatoes, Matoke (cooked plantain bananas), Posho (same as Ugali  made from maize flour) and possibly chips. Around the shores of Lake  Victoria and at the source of the Nile River in Jinja, fresh water fish  such as Tilapia and Nile Perch are common, both in the markets and  restaurants.  In the west of the country at Lake Bunyoni, a local  specialty is the fresh water crayfish. Once they are shelled they  resemble a small prawn and are delicious either fried in garlic butter  or on a bed of rice with a tomato and onion relish. On the road side a  lunch time local special is the famous Ugandan BBQ Chicken on a stick.  For a quick snack, meat or veggie samosas and chapattis are widely  available

Maize, potatoes, local spinach, carrots, peas, yams, and cooked  plantain bananas (technically a fruit but cooked and served with stews)  are Uganda’s main vegetables.

If you are a strict vegetarian you may experience a distinct lack of variety in the food available, especially in small towns. You might   find  that you are eating a lot of omelettes and other egg dishes. Our   tour  leaders will do their best to provide interesting vegetarian alternatives when arranging group meals in the campsite, but your    patience and understanding is requested.

All drinks such as water, soft or alcoholic drinks are at your own expense at all times.

(All glass bottles taken away from shops in Uganda will have a deposit added on which varies.)

You should be wary of drinking the local tap water. Bottled water, carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices are widely available and are   generally safe to drink. Please note however that fruit juices are   sometimes made with un-boiled tap water and could upset your stomach.

There are various brands of beers found only in Uganda including ESB (Extra Strong Brew), Club and Nile Export. Primus can also be bought in the far west of the country and is imported from Congo and Rwanda.
