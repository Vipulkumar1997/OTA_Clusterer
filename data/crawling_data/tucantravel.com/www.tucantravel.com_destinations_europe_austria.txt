Austria Tours

Austria, draws people to its jaw-droppingly beautiful landscapes and culturally rich cities. Flanked by gorgeous alpine scenery and nestled within the Alps, it is a treasure box of delights and diverse in it’s offerings. A German speaking country, Austria has had many famous residents from Sigmund Freud to Amadeus Mozart, both of whom are mmortalised in Austria's capital, Vienna's landmarks.

We travel to the capital city of Vienna, one of the most musical cities in the world, and sprinkled with opulent beauty from the Habsburg Empire. Rich in culture and home to some of the most stunning Baroque architecture, it was also where Beethoven and many other composers called home and you can still hear the famous classical symphonies playing in this magical city.

Austria Travel Articles, Inspiration & Information






Things to do in Vienna

The city of culture, classical music and of course cake, Vienna is a jewel in Central Europe. It’s not hard to image the imperial Habsburg family calling it home, as the whole city looks like something straight out of a fairy tale. Each building, even if it was a just a basic shop front warranted a photo. I have culminated a list of some of the best things to do when visiting Vienna.

Austria Travel Guide

History

Austria was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of World War I when Austria adopted the name the Republic of German-Austria in a bid to unite with Germany. In 1938 Austria was occupied by the Nazis, which lasted until the end of World War II. Democracy was restored and now there are 9 federal states. It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and part of the EU & United Nations

Money

The monetary unit in Austria is the Euro (€). For up-to-date exchange rates with your own currency visit www.oanda.com or www.xe.com. The easiest way to obtain money in Austria is to draw it out of an ATM (cash machine) on a credit or debit card (e.g. visa or cirrus). ATMs are widely available throughout Europe and credit cards are accepted in many restaurants and shops. Another option is to bring cash, in either US dollars or euros (pounds sterling and other currencies cannot always be easily changed) but we advise against bringing all your money in this form, in case of theft. In all of the cities that we visit there are many places to change money and your tour leader will be able to show you where to get the best rates of exchange. Please note: Travellers cheques are not recommended for travel anywhere in Europe as these can be difficult to change and attract poor exchange rates or exorbitant commission.

Major Cities and Towns in Austria

Our tours stop in the capital, Vienna. It is known for its huge musical atmosphere, having been the residence of many famous composers. It is a very clean city, with extremely beautiful architecture and quite easy get around by foot.

Electricty
The voltage in Austria is 230-240V. Sockets are of European two pronged round pin variety.
Geography and climate
Located in the Alps, Austria is a landlocked, mountainous country bordered by the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Italy, Switzerland & Liechtenstein. It has an alpine climate, and whilst cold in winter, summer temperatures are relatively high. Check the weather chart on our website or visit www.worldclimate.com to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your trip.
Food
Austrian specialties include Krapfen (doughnuts filled with apricot jam), Apfelstrudel (filled with apple) and Topfenstrudel (filled with cheese). Other typical dishes include Wiener Schnitzel, a veal cutlet which is breaded and fried and also Knodel, which are dumplings often served on the side of a meal.
Visas
Many nationalities (including citizens of the UK, Australia, Canada, Japan, the US and EU citizens) do not need a visa to enter Austria when staying in the country for less than 90 days. However, visitors must hold an onward ticket, all documents required for their next destination and sufficient funds. If your nationality is not listed please consult your nearest Austrian consulate before you travel
Time Difference
Austria's time difference is GMT/UTC + 1. For other time differences please visit
