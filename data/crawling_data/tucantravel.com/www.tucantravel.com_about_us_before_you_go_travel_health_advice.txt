Health Advice










Travel Health Advice

Stay healthy while you travel

Keeping well on tour isn't difficult - for the most part it requires a little bit of common sense. Most of the problems you'll face are easily preventable, for example putting on sunscreen, drinking bottled or treated water, washing your hands properly before eating and avoiding insect bites will save you a great deal of hassle.

However, if you have other concerns like exposure to malaria or other tropical diseases, altitude sickness, sea sickness or other issues, it is best to visit your doctor. We recommend that you see your travel health centre in person at least eight weeks before you travel, as you may need a course of medications or more than one vaccination.

A travel health professional can give you specific advice according to your unique medical needs and tour itinerary. If you're travelling for a long period of time, it's also a good idea to get a check up at the dentist and sort out your glasses prescription if you think it's changing.

Please note:
The information available in the health advice websites listed below is intended as a guide only. Tucan Travel is not responsible for the content of any of the travel health websites listed below.
