Day Trek to Machu Picchu









Day Trek to Machu Picchu

On some of our tours that include Machu Picchu, there is not enough time to hike the Inca Trail Trek or Lares Trek. In this instance, you can take the train or enjoy a one day hike following a portion of the Inca Trek to Machu Picchu. It is the perfect option for people wanting to sample the hiking experience, but who don't have the time to try the full four day experience. You will arrive at Machu Picchu in the late afternoon, giving you time to enjoy the World Heritage Site with less people around, as most Inca Trekkers will arrive first thing in the morning!

Day Trek Itinerary

You will wake early having breakfast in Ollantaytambo before getting the 06.10 train to km104, the start of the trail.
Hike down, crossing the River Vilcanota until you reach the ruins of Chachabama. This is your first taste of Incan ruins, located on an old Inca road that ran alongside the Urubamba River. As well as being a religious site, these ruins acted as a gate house, guarding the entrance to Machu Picchu.
We continue on, following the Inca Trail south, hiking through woodlands and crossing small streams. Enjoy a 2-3 hour hike, until you arrive at the foot of the Wi√±ay Wayna ruins.
The trail continues up the mountainside, and you will reach a flight of 50 steps that leads up to the final pass known as the Sun Gate. Your efforts will now be rewarded, as it is here you can enjoy spectacular views of Machu Picchu. Walk slowly down, and arrive at this world wonder in the afternoon. After enjoying some time at this site, and getting lots of photos we will take the bus down to Aguas Calientes where we will get a train back to Ollantaytambo. Remember to pick up some snacks for the journey home! We will arrive back in the evening, where a transfer will take us to Cuzco so we can go straight to bed.

Please note: This is a long day, with an arrival time in Cuzco at 10pm.
