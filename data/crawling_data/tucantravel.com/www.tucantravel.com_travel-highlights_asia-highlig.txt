Asia Highlights



Angkor Wat

Discover the other-worldly ruins of Angkor Wat

Within the forested park of Angkor lie the spectacular and mysterious temple ruins of Angkor Wat. The Angkor Archaeological Park stretches over some 400 square kilometers of forested area and houses the magnificent remains from different capitals during the Khmer Empire between the 9th and 15th centuries.



Halong Bay

The Bay of Descending Dragons

Explore the natural wonder that is Halong Bay, with its vast limestone cliffs and intricate subterranean cave systems. Its natural beauty is enhanced by the communities that live among the limestone karsts including floating villages and island settlements.



The Great Wall of China

Walk along the Great Wall of China

Discover China's biggest highlight, The Great Wall of China. This huge man-made structure runs from the east all the way to west of China, making it one of the largest ever structures ever built.



Chiang Mai, Thailand

Explore the vibrant markets of Chiang Mai

Set your senses alive exploring Chiang Mai. Situated in the north of Thailand, this city offers an enchanting Thai experience, that differs from the chaotic energy of Bangkok. Browse the vibrant night market, try a Thai cooking class or visit ornate temples.



The Golden Triangle

Compare spectacular temples at the Golden Triangle

Previously the location for South East Asia's opium trade, the Golden Triangle refers to the crossing where Thailand, Laos and Myanmar meet. It now offers a range of attractions for travellers, from the fascinating Opium Museum to the nearby White Temple in Chiang Rai.



Hanoi

Vietnam's bustling, exotic capital city

Wander the historic streets of Hanoi, in equal parts romantic and hectic. Browse street-side markets and soak in the crumbling grandeur of the Old Quarter. Vietnam's capital city has so much to offer, from parks, museums and galleries, to traditional theatre and music.



Annapurna Trek

Enjoy a unique trekking experience.
Pass through remote Nepalese villages on this trek to Annapurna Base Camp. Assisted by porters you will enjoy views of the snow-covered Himalayas as you conquer this breath-taking ascent.



Taj Mahal

The most romantic building in the world

It's a building that is known by all, but understood by few. A towering mausoleum whose history is as exciting and romantic as its delicate minarets and bulbous domes. To help better appreciate this history, we have compiled a list of the 10 most interesting facts about Taj Mahal.
