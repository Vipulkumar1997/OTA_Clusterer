What you need to know


We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.



Most temples require you to wear modest clothing and walk around barefoot. Remember to pack shoes that you can slip on and off easily and clothes that cover the knees and shoulders.



The first day of your tour is simply an arrival day with no pre-organised activities. You will meet your Tour Leader at 18.00 for the pre-departure meeting. In order to allow time to relax and see some of the sights you may wish to add pre-tour accommodation.





Itinerary

Day 1 to 1 - Arrive Negombo



Negombo is situated by the shores of a lagoon by the same name. Once a Portuguese and Dutch trading port, popular attractions here include the Old Dutch fort gate built in 1672, the Dutch Canal, and the old churches and fishing villages which surround the area. It also has a huge and rather inviting white sandy beach.
The Kotchchikade area comes to life at dusk with many handicrafts for sale, boutiques, shops, gem shops and restaurants for you to explore.

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Camelot Beach Hotel or similar




Day 2 to 3 - Anuradhapura



We make our way to Anuradhapura after taking a morning city tour of Negombo and visiting the fish market.  Anuradhapura, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site was founded in the 4th century BC and was the capital of the Anuradhapura Kingdom until the beginning of the 11th century AD. Today the extensive ruins are well preserved and are an important site for Buddhists, Tamils and Hindus alike and we take a guided tour of them, learning about the fascinating history and the restoration efforts.
We also explore the site of Mihintale. Here you can discover the ruins of a hospital, a large monastry and ancient carvings. Climb the rock of Mihintale and discover an aerial view of ancient city of Anuradhapura.

After two nights in Anuradhapura, we leave and begin out drive for the ancient city of Polonnaruwa. On the way we stop at Aukana Buddha, one of the reservoirs constructed during the reign of King Dathusena, where we can see a magnificent 12 metre high statue of the Buddha. Polonnaruwa remains one of the best planned archaeological relic sites in the country. Built in the 11th and 12th centuries AD, Polonnaruwa is a listed World Heritage site. Here you can see the ruins of the Royal Palace, the Gal Viharaya, and four statues of the Buddha in 'Upright', 'Sedentary' and 'Recumbent' postures carved out of rock. Polonnaruwa is laid out over a large distance therefore the best way to explore the area is by bicycle. We take a guided tour of the ruins. You may have time to explore the ruins by bike (optional).

Day 6 to 7 - Kandy



Our next stop is Kandy but first we will have a couple of stops along the way. In Dabulla, we visit the most impressive of Sri Lanka's cave temples which were used by the monks as meditation locations and places of worship. Some contain statues, paintings of the Buddha and detailed frescoes. We will also make a stop at a Spice and Herbal Garden where you will get shown the locally grown flora and some of its uses in medicine and cooking.
We then introduce you to Kandy with a brief orientation tour. Kandy was the last capital of the Sri Lankan kings of the central hill regions, and of course is World Heritage listed. We will take a drive around the Kandy Lake, built by the last Sinhala king Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe in 1798, visit the Kandy town and Bazaar, the arts & crafts centre, a gem museum and a lapidary. In the afternoon you will have some free time to enjoy the city. You will find that Kandy is probably the best place to buy most of the handicrafts produced in Sri Lanka. Tonight we will take a sunset tour of the Temple of the Tooth (where legend has it Buddha's tooth is kept) and watch a cultural show featuring traditional Sri Lankan dancing.

Early in the morning you leave  for visiting the impressive Horton Plains National Park. Once a haven for elephants they no longer inhabit this area, however it is possible to witness many other species of wildlife. The area is surrounded by the country's highest mountains, shrouded in cloud and rivers. This is the only National Park in Sri Lanka in which visitors are allowed to walk around freely so we will take the opportunity for a trek through the high mountain vegetation and lakes.
Our goal is 'Worlds End' where the 2000 metre plateau comes to an abrupt end, plunging 700-1000 meters to the valley floor. On the way we will see a great deal of wildlife, including with purple­faced langurs, wild boar and barking deer as well as a small number of leopards. We board a train from Nuwara Eliya and enjoy the slow pace through the mountain scenery as we head to Ella. Ella is a sleepy village in Sri Lanka's Hill Country.

Day 11 to 11 - Yala National Park



Leaving Ella we stop at the Ella and Ravana Waterfalls before reaching Yala National Park where we will spend a night just outside of the park.  We will take a game drive for your best chances to see elephants, leopards and bears. Yala National Park was established in 1900 and has one of the densest populations of wildlife in Asia. The park has two important pilgrimage sites, Sithulpahuwa and Magul Vilhara and has been the center of past civilisations.
