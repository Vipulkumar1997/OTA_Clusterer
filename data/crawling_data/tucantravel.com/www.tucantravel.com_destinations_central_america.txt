Central America









Central America Adventure Tours

In Central America discover atmospheric colonial cities and explore temples of ancient civilisations like Tikal, Palenque and Copán. Central America’s colourful culture varies from region to region from the Caribbean feel of Belize to the Mayan cultures of Guatemala and Mexico. Bask on the broad white sands of Caribbean beaches, shop in colourful highland markets, salsa the night away in Old Havana and delve into the wild green areas of Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Panama. Search for Jaguars and climb volcanoes, swim with turtles and watch glorious sunsets from colourful hammocks and quiet secluded islands. Soar the world’s first zip-lines and sail across one of the seven engineering wonders of the world. Enjoy the coffee from Costa Rica, chocolate from Guatemala, tequila from Mexico and seafood throughout.
