Semana Santa










Semana Santa

South and Central America are two of the most religious Christian Regions in the world. Celebrations begin around Shrove Tuesday and much of South America lead up to Semana Santa with Carnivals, the most famous being Rio Carnival. In the week leading up to Easter Sunday, the region explodes in to colourful parades, religious processions and parties. It is one of the best and most exciting times of year to travel to Latin America and is an excellent time to enjoy the atmosphere and celebrations.

Browse our selection of tours which depart over Easter 2018.
