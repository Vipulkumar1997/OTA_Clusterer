Holi Festival (India)










Holi Festival

Observed in India and Nepal, the Holi Festival is celebrated on the Full Moon in March.

Dates for 2018:
Friday March 1st
Dates for 2019:
Thursday March 21st

The festival celebrates the beginning of spring and commemorates good harvests. The throwing of the powders symbolises a goodbye to winter using vibrant colours to celebrate. The atmosphere is one of excitement, joy and fun as typical social norms are relaxed and communities mix together. Bonfires are lit remembering the escape of Prahlada who was carried in to the file by Demoness Kacy, sister of Hiranyakashipu.
