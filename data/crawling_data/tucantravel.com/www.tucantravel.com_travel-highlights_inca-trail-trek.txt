Inca Trail Trek to Machu Picchu



Inca Trail Trek Overview

Hike the Inca Trail Trek to Machu Picchu

There are many Inca paths through the Andes, but the most famous is known simply as 'The Inca Trail Trek', the royal route to Machu Picchu. During this classic 4-day trek over 44 kilometres, we cross three high passes and encounter several ancient sites, ending at the famous Lost City of the Incas.



Guaranteeing Inca Trail Permits

How to book an Inca Trail permit with confidence

In order to preserve the Inca Trail Trek and its surrounds, the Peruvian authorities currently cap the number of Inca Trail trekking permits to 500 per day. Because Tucan Travel has a team based in Cuzco who collect your permit in person, you are guaranteed to trek the Inca Trail as soon your permit is confirmed.To help ensure you get a permit for when you want to do the trek, we encourage you to book as early in advance as possible.



Inca Trail Trek Packing List

What you should take on the Inca Trail Trek

During the Inca Trail Trek your main luggage will be stored in Cuzco and you will receive a small duffle bag at your Inca Trail briefing (which will be held the evening before you start the trek) to pack clothes and sleeping bag for 3-4 days. Your team of porters will carry these bags together with the food and equipment for the trail.



Trekking the Inca Trail Independently

Book an Inca Trail Trek package

You don't have to join a group tour in order to hike the famous Inca Trail. We sell an Inca Trail package which combines a four-day trek along the traditional Inca Trail with a visit to Machu Picchu.



Inca Trail Itinerary & Route Map

Four days trekking supported by local guides, porters and cooks

The Inca Trail Trek to Machu Picchu follows a four-day, 44-kilometre trail through the Andes and crosses three stunning high-altitude passes, encountering many fascinating archaeological sites. The trail can be demanding at times, but you certainly don't need to be an expert or an athlete to complete it. The trek is led by a local guide and supported by a team of porters and cooks and you are free to walk at your own pace.



Inca Trail Trek on Group Tours

Choose from 90 different group tours to hike the Inca Trail Trek

All group tours which include time to complete the Inca Trail Trek are easily identified by the 'Inca Trail Trek' icon found on the tour maps on this website and in our brochures. If there are no permits available for the Inca Trail Trail Trek or the trail is closed (i.e. in February) the Inca Trail Trek will be substituted for the Lares Trek.
