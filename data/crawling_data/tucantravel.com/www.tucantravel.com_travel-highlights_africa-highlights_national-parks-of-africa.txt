National Parks of Africa









Other National Parks of Africa

Africa's national parks and game reserves offer sanctuary to diverse and abundant wildlife. Experience the daily drama of life and death as predators track their prey across the savannah and witness the natural beauty of vast grasslands, mountain rainforests, lush waterways and bushveld. Your visit will support the conservation of some of the world's most precious flora and fauna, as well as their pristine habitats.


Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania

The jewel in the crown of the Ngorongoro Conservation Area is the Ngorongoro Volcano. Today, it is one of the most stunning natural wonders in the world with an enclosed area of about 260 square kilometres. Swampy wetlands, open savannah, woodlands and a lake are all set within steep, rocky, forest-clad walls which climb 610 metres to the crater rim.

Because the sides of the crater are very steep, the area has become a natural enclosure for a wide variety of wildlife which can be seen in their natural habitats. Flamingos, hippos, black rhino, Cape buffalo, zebra, eland and warthogs graze the plains while predators such as lions, cheetah, leopards and scavenging hyenas can all be easily spotted and photographed.

Masai tribesman - easily visible in their traditional scarlet robes - can also be seen guiding their cattle down the steep crater walls.

Best time to visit Ngorongoro Crater

The crater is a fantastic year-round wildlife viewing destination. It is less frequented by tourists in the rainy season of April/May but roads can be slippery at this time.

Victoria Falls, Zambia

Victoria Falls, part of the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park, is one of the seven natural wonders of the world. The falls are the widest sheet of falling water on earth and have been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With cascades pouring along its 1.7 kilometre length it is hard to imagine its grandeur so you really have to see it to believe it.

Be prepared to get wet with adrenaline-pumping adventure options. Rafting, bungy jumping and canoe trips can be organised locally (seasonal).

Best time to visit Victoria Falls

The falls are at their most spectacular from February to April when the Zambezi River is at its most powerful and it can be more difficult to photograph in the wet season of May to June. Rafting and swimming in Devil's Armchair are safest when the river recedes around July through to December.


Kruger National Park, South Africa

The world-renowned Kruger National Park (also known simply as The Kruger) offers an experience that ranks with the best in Africa. Among the wildlife here are 1,982 types of plants and trees, 34 amphibians, 114 reptiles, 507 birds and 147 mammal species. The Big 5 are well represented, with around 1,500 lions, 12,000 elephants, 2,500 Cape buffalos, 1,000 leopards and 5,000 rhinos (black and white) roaming the park. Hippopotami, giraffes, zebras, various antelope species and endangered wild dogs can also be seen here.

Best time to visit Kruger National Park

The dry winter season of May through September offers near unobstructed views of wildlife as grass is low, the bushes and trees are bare and wildlife congregates around water sources. The spring brings newborn animals and the summer brings lush vegetation, though it is harder to see animals.

Addo Elephant National Park, South Africa

The Addo Elephant National Park stands as a true conservation success story. In 1931 when the park was inaugurated only eleven elephants remained. Today the 164,000 hectare sanctuary is home to 450 elephants as well as about 48 endangered black rhinos, Cape buffalos, a variety of antelope species and the unique flightless dung beetle which is found almost exclusively in Addo. The park is also famous for having the largest coastal dune field in the southern hemisphere.

Best time to visit Addo Elephant National Park

During the dry winter season of June to August there is less rainfall, more animals near water sources and the shorter grass makes them easier to spot.

Chobe National Park, Botswana

Renowned for its massive elephant population, Chobe National Park has an estimated 70,000 to 120,000 individuals roaming across its 11,000 square kilometre area. The park offers extreme contrasts in terms of landscape and vegetation, which varies from almost tropical swamplands to severe desert-like spaces, vast grasslands to sandy woodlands and Acacia scrub. Take a safari into the pristine wilderness and watch the world's largest land animals moving slowly across the plains in search of food.

Best time to visit Chobe National Park

There is great wildlife viewing all year round but the best time to visit is the drier, cooler winter months from June to October.


Okavango Delta, Botswana

The Okavango Delta is a network of waterways, lagoons, swamps and wooded islands, fed by the Okavango River. Ranging over 15,000 square kilometres, the wetlands sustain a diverse array of wildlife as the water fans out to empty into the dry yellow sands of the Kalahari Desert.

The best way to explore this natural wonder is by mokoro, a shallow boat fashioned from a single tree trunk. There is plenty of wildlife to see, with tens of thousands of elephants, several thousand hippos, aquatic antelope species and migratory birds inhabiting the delta. After an active day on the water, there is time to relax with a sundowner and enjoy the sounds of Africa around you.

Best time to visit the Okavango Delta

The best game viewing occurs in the drier period of May to October, but for lush vegetation and bird populations, visit in November to April.

Etosha National Park, Namibia

Etosha, meaning "great white place" was declared a national park in 1907 and covers an area of 22,270 square kilometres in the far north of Namibia. The park is dominated by a massive mineral pan which covers about 25% of the park and provides a silver-white backdrop to an area of semiarid savannah grassland and thorn scrub.

The reserve is home to some 114 mammal species, 340 bird species, 110 reptile species, 16 amphibian species and surprisingly, one species of fish. Most visitors will see many antelope species, elephant, giraffe, rhino and lions and a few visitors may see elusive leopard, black rhinos and cheetahs. Many of the park's waterholes are floodlit at night, offering visitors the chance to see a lot of game in once place.

Best time to visit Etosha National Park

You'll find it easier to spot larger concentrations of animals during the dry season from May to September when animals congregate around the waterholes.
