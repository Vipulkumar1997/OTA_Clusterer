Europe Adventure Tours

Eastern Europe’s diversity truly offers something for everyone, from its well-known attractions to its newly emerging destinations. By day you can visit sophisticated cities and quiet villages, art galleries and museums, cathedrals and castles, Roman ruins, historic monuments, varied architecture and street cafés. By night you can enjoy lively bars and excellent restaurants, then dance the night away in vibrant night clubs. For those who can’t resist the lure of nature, the idyllic sunlit coastline of Croatia or the breath-taking alpine scenery of Slovakia will not disappoint. From a brief trip to an extensive adventure through 21 countries in 66 days, there is a Europe adventure for everyone.
