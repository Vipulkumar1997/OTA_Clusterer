Romania Tours

One of Eastern Europe’s more enigmatic destinations, a Romania adventure tour reveals a land of alpine mountains and medieval traditions, deserted beaches and fantastic hospitality… and of course, a vampire myth or two. Braşov in the heart of Transylvania is a charming medieval city. Wander the cobbled lanes past Baroque façades, Old Saxon architecture, visit the fortress of Cetăţuia Braşovului and wander up Rope Street, the narrowest in Europe or visit Rasnov Castle.

Our Romania adventure tours visit Braşov, an excellent base for exploring the surrounding Carpathian Mountains where the air is fresh and the people friendly. Even if you don’t believe in vampires, a visit to nearby Bran Castle is worth it just to explore the Gothic fairy-tale structure. Bran is (incorrectly) said to have been the home of 15th century Walachian Prince Vlad Tepes, also known as Vlad the Impaler or Dracula. A Romania adventure tour is the best way to explore it’s largest city and capital Bucharest and wander along Calea Victoriei to Piata Revolutiei, site of the Romanian Athenaeum and the former Royal Palace. Visit the French old centre with its own Arc de Triomphe and enjoy the world’s second biggest building, the Palace of Parliament and the open air Village Museum if you have time.

Romania Travel Articles, Inspiration & Information






Charming Transylvania

When you think of Romania the first thing that comes to a lot of peoples’ minds is Transylvania and Dracula. It is true that there is plenty of myth around the infamous vampire, however Romania is much more than this one story. It is a world of quaint wooden villages, horse drawn carts, rolling fields and magnificent churches, with a rich history of invasions, battles for land, knights and of course castles..

Maramures and the Merry Cemetery, Romania

Transylvania Tale
tour. This addition enables us to explore the traditional rural lifestyle of the Maramures villages

Geography and weather

Our tours mostly operate from late spring (April/May) to early Autumn (in Eastern Europe) when the weather is generally at its best. Temperatures will vary but will still be cool in April/May and again in October. The warmest months tend to be July/August. The further south you are the higher the average temperatures. You can expect snow from December to late March.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

Citizens of the EU, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the US citizens can enter Romania visa-free for 30-90 days (depending on nationality). All other nationalities need a visa to enter, which must be purchased in advance.

Money

The monetary unit in Romania lei (ROL). For up to date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

Changing money, credit cards & ATMs

The easiest way to obtain money in Eastern Europe is to draw it out of an ATM (cash machine) on a credit or debit card (e.g. visa or cirrus). ATMs are widely available throughout Eastern Europe. Another option is to bring cash, in either US Dollars or Euros (pounds sterling and other currencies cannot always be easily changed) but we advise against bringing all your money in this form, in case of theft. In all of the cities that we visit there are many places to change money and your tour leader will be able to show you where to get the best rates of exchange.

Please note: Travellers cheques are not recommended for travel anywhere in Eastern Europe as these can be difficult to change and attract poor exchange rates or exorbitant commission. In some countries it may not be possible to change travellers cheques at all. If possible make sure that you bring crisp new banknotes as some exchange offices will not accept old or dirty notes (US$ notes issued before 1990 are not generally accepted).

Tipping

If there is no service fee, a general rule of thumb is to add 10 to 15 percent of the bill for a tip.

Security

Generally people find Eastern Europe to be safe and feel confident wandering alone during the day. However if you are unfamiliar with an area it is recommended that you exercise more caution at night and taxi taxis rather than walk, especially if you are a lone female traveller. In some cities bag snatching can occur so always keep a firm hand/eye on your personal items. If there is a safe available in your hotel it is recommended you use it.

Local food and drink

Some breakfasts are included in your tour. Breakfasts can be basic so if you tend to get hungry it may be a good idea to buy some fruit or snacks to eat during the day. All other meals, extra snacks and drinks on the tour are at your own expense.

Ask your tour leader if they can recommend any restaurants in the area to suit your taste or budget or have fun exploring independently.

Food offered in much of Eastern Europe is delicious, hearty, and often (but not always) meat orientated. You may well find yourself smoked or salted fish, pickled cabbage stew, beef stroganoff, goulash, meat stews, game meats, and many varieties of dumplings. Your tour leader will be able to advise you on all the best places to eat and the various specialities of each country.

All drinks such as bottled water or soft drinks are at your own expense at all times and are fairly inexpensive. Alcoholic drinks vary in price, with wine and beer generally being the cheapest options. The legal drinking age is 18.

Time Difference

The time difference in Romania is GMT/UTC + 2. For other time differences please visit
www.timeanddate.com

Voltage

220-240V. Sockets are of European two pronged round pin variety.
