Slovakia Travel Guide

Brief history

After settlements by Celtic tribes, the region where Slovakia now  lies was conquered by the Romans, before the land passed into the hands  of the Great Moravia Empire. The city of Bratislava came into being in  1919 and was known before then as Pressburg (for German speakers) and  Pozsony (for Hungarians).  Under Hungarian rule, Bratislava became the  Coronation city and capital of the Kingdom of Hungary and the city was  well patronised by wealthy aristocrats and businessmen who built grand  palaces. Great musicians and composers such as Haydn, Mozart and  Beethoven lived in the city and added to its cultural flavour. The  Czechoslovak Republic was first formed when Slovak and Czech nations  sought to unite and repel the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During World War I the leaders set the country up as a fascist state, however this was not  popular, leading to an ill-fated political uprising. Hitler annexed the  country just before World War II and the Russians invaded shortly after  the war, taking Czechoslovakia under the Soviet Unionâs wing. After the  fall of communism in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

the  Slovak Republic peacefully parted from its neighbour the Czech Republic  in what is famously known as the 'Velvet Divorce' of 1993 and became  known as Slovakia. Slovakia joined the European Union and the NATO in  2004, and finally the euro zone on 1 January, 2009.

Geography and weather

The Slovak Republic is situated in central Europe, landlocked by the  Czech Republic, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Ukraine. The republic is  famous for its year-round natural beauty owing to a combination of  mountains, lowlands, canyons, lakes, cave formations, forests and  meadows. Much of the country is dominated by the Carpathian Arc - a  range of mountains stretching across the north, the Lesser Carpathians,  White Carpathians, MalÃ¡ (Lesser) Fatra, Vel'kÃ¡ (Greater) Fatra, High and  Low Tatras and the Slovak Ore Mountains.

Slovakia has a damp continental climate making the weather  changeable. Summers are often warm but interrupted by sudden  thunderstorms. The warmest month is often July with the driest regions  being the southern lowlands

Visit

to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

A valid passport (a minimum of 3 months) is required for entry.  Non-EU nationals may need to provide proof of funds for the duration of their stay and this may be checked by customs. You should  also be able to show a copy of your return ticket if requested. US  citizens staying overnight in Slovakia must register with the local  police within three working days. When staying at hotels you are  registered automatically. The Slovak Republic joined the Schengen  Agreement for overland entry points, seaports and airports.

Most other nationalities do not require a visa. However visa  regulations change frequently so it is important you consult with the  embassy prior to travelling to ensure you have the correct visas. In  some cases you will be crossing the borders on overnight trains and  without the correct visa for your nationality you will not be allowed to  enter the country and will be asked to leave the train. It is the  responsibility of the traveller to obtain all correct visas needed prior  to departure.

Visa services like
www.travcour.com
can be very helpful.

Money

Slovakia is in the euro zone. For up  to date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

ATMs are widely available in most towns and cities. Most major currencies can be exchanged at banks and bureaux de  change, hotels and in travel agencies. Major Credit cards are widely  accepted. Traveller's cheques are accepted in banks and at bureaux de  change. To avoid additional exchange rate charges, travellers are advised to take traveller's cheques in US dollars or pounds sterling.

Tipping

It is customary to give a 5-10 % tip if you are happy with the  service. (If you are unsure your tour leader will advise a suitable  amount). Tipping guides at the end of excursions is always appreciated  and your tour leader will advise you on the amount for this.

Local transport

In Bratislava and other towns you will find buses, trolleybuses and  trams. Tickets are sold from kiosks. One of the most popular and  reliable ways of getting around on your own in large cities in is by  taxi. Try to find out what the going rate for journeys is before you hop  in to ensure you are not being overcharged â only some taxis will have  meters. You will also find that fares increase at night. Your tour  leader will be able to provide advice on this in each major city.

In the Tatras Mountains you will find an electric tram/railway  network and one major road connecting many of the villages. Other  excellent ways to get around are the funicular railway, cable car and of  course you can experience the amazing scenery on foot.

Security

Generally people find Slovakia to be safe and feel confident wandering alone during the day.  However if you are unfamiliar with an   area it is recommended that you exercise more caution at night and taxi   taxis rather than walk, especially if you are a lone female traveller. In some cities bag snatching can occur so always keep a firm hand/eye  on  your personal items.

Local food and drink

Slovak food is similar to Czech fare but Hungarian influences are  also strong.  Keep a look out for the Slovak national dish bryndzovÃ©  haluisky which is gnocchi with a thick sheep's-cheese sauce and crumbled  grilled bacon. Other specialities include mutton with sauerkraut,  flavored with prunes, mushrooms and apples, cabbage leaves filled with  minced meat, served with a milky sauce, sulance (potato dough turnovers  filled with plum jam). Goulash is popular (although a mild stew rather  than the authentic spicy soup), langose is a deep-fried dough smothered  in a variety of toppings.

Cake shops can be found throughout Slovakia and are considered an  important part of the country's social life. Coffee is drunk black -  espresso style. Icecream is also popular and can be purchased from  window kiosks in the sides of buildings.

Keep a look out for Slovakian white wine and borovicka (strong gin).  The home production of brandy is a popular national pastime; the most  famous is a plum brandy (slivovice). Locally made beers and lagers are  served in most bars and cafes.

All drinks such as bottled water or soft drinks are at your own  expense at all times and are fairly inexpensive. Alcoholic drinks vary  in price, with wine and beer generally being the cheapest options. The  legal drinking age is 18. You should avoid drinking in the street unless at a festival or you will be fined.
