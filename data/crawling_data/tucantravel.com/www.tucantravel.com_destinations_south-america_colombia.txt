Colombia Tours




On a Colombia adventure tour you will discover the Andes mountain range running from north to south through the length of the country. Warmed year-round by the equatorial sun, the mountains are green and lush providing fertile land for farming and of course Colombian coffee beans, renowned throughout the world.

Cosmopolitan cities like Bogotá with its famous gold museum and sultry Cali, home of salsa dancing, plus charming Spanish colonial towns like well-preserved Villa de Leiva and the ancient walled city of Cartagena are all gems to be explored on a Colombia adventure tour. Why not relax on the white sands of the Caribbean coastline in Tayrona National Park and trek to explore ancient ruins from lost civilisations at Ciudad Perdida (Lost City) nearby. Our Colombia adventure tours will also reveal how friendly and welcoming the local people are and you are bound to come away with fond memories of this fascinating country on your adventure holiday.

Colombia Travel Articles, Inspiration & Information






8 reasons you don't want to visit Colombia

There’s not 5, not 10 but 8 (yes, we went there) reasons you really shouldn’t save up your hard earned cash to visit what was once voted the happiest country in the world. I mean, why would you want to put up with the loud salsa dancing on the streets of Cali, endless mountains and all that coffee?
Read more







The Spectacular Cocora Trek

On a map, the Zona Cafetera (“Coffee Zone”) of Colombia is relatively small, however the extremely hilly landscape of the region helps the Andean country to be the second largest coffee producer in the world. This very same landscape, recently declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, also allows for some incredible hiking.

Making the most out of Bogotá

From the old preserved neighbourhood of La Candalaria to the thriving fashion-driven district of Chapinero, the centre of Bogotá gives its visitor a unique experience of contrasts in what is often referred to as
South America’s Athens.
The name comes from the high number of universities in the city and the level of education found here.

Colombia Travel Guide

Brief history

Colombia’s Pre-European cultures existed in scattered pockets in the  Andes and Pacific and Atlantic coasts. Among the most notable were  the Tayrona, Sinú, Muisca, Quimbaya, Tierradentro and San Agustín.  Alonso de Ojeda, a companion of Christopher Columbus, landed on the  Guajira Peninsula in 1499. Colombia won its independence in 1819 with  the appearance of Venezuelan liberator Simon Bolívar and his army. Ten  years of uneasy confederation with Venezuela and Ecuador followed in the  form of Gran Colombia. In the course of the 19th century, the country  experienced no less than 50 rebellions and eight civil wars, culminating  in the bloody War of a Thousand Days in 1899. After a period of  relative peace, the struggle between the Conservatives and the Liberals  broke out again in 1948 with La Violencia, the cruelest and most  destructive of Colombia's many civil wars and left 300,000 died. Modern day  history has been a continual run of violence from left-wing guerrilla  groups and drug traffickers, but since the election of the former President Uribe things have improved considerably.

Geography and weather

Colombia has an equatorial climate and therefore does not have  dramatic seasonal changes. The best time for the country as a whole is  December-March as it rains the least then.

The rainy season is May-July and October-December, when heavy rains  can fall (though they're usually followed by bright sunshine). The  elevation in the country ranges from sea level to 3,050 metres, so  temperatures can vary greatly. Coastal cities have day temperatures from  23-32°C, with nights at about17-27°C year-round. The inland cities'  year-round day temperatures are generally around 17-27°C (nights can get  down to 5-16°C in the winter). A sweater is needed along the coast at  night and a jacket in the mountains (this includes Bogota, which lies at  2,650 metres).

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

Most nationals of Europe, Australasia and North America do not need a  visa to enter Colombia, however many Asians do (it is important to  check the rules for your nationality with your nearest embassy,  consulate or travel agent). Entry for those not requiring a visa is  granted on production of a passport valid for more than six months and  proof of funds to support yourself (although this proof not usually  requested). As a tourist you are entitled to 90 days, however depending  on the immigration official you may be allocated 30, 60 or 90 days.

Important
: you will have to fill out an immigration form on  arrival which will be checked, stamped and left in your passport for the  duration of your stay.
Do not lose this piece of paper.

Money

Important
:  In Latin America you will have problems changing   the US$100 CB B2 2001 series notes and it is important you do not to  bring them.  In some countries banks won't even take them. The serial  number is located in the top left hand corner and bottom  right hand  corner on the side with the President’s face. This serial  number starts  with CB and then a few more numbers and then directly  under that B2.  At the bottom of the note near the signature of the  Treasurer it says  which series of notes it is and it is there that it  says 2001 series.

The monetary unit in Colombia is the Colombian peso, which is divided into 100 centavos. For up-to-date exchange  rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

US dollars (cash) are rarely accepted for  purchases in Colombia  and you will need pesos for  most purchases. Even if you have the choice of paying for things in US dollars  it will be in your favour to use the local currency. Often the easiest way to obtain local currency is to use the ATMs (‘cajeros automaticos’) located in every city throughout the country. Visa, Plus, MasterCard and Cirrus/Maestro are accepted in most Colombian ATMs, as long as you have a four-digit pin number. Although bank cards are often the easiest way to go, there are times where they will not work for you even if your bank at home tells you it will! Do not rely on your card as your only source of money. Always have a few back-ups with you.

US dollars and travellers cheques can be changed at casas de cambio (exchange bureau), banks and border crossings. Your tour leader will  give you details of when and where best to change money. Casas de cambio  are privately owned, usually have longer opening hours and attend to  you faster than banks. The rate may be slightly lower but you must weigh  this up against the convenience of not having to queue. In Colombia you  get the best exchange rates in the cities of Bogotá and Cartagena where  the casas de cambio offer about the same rate as the banks. Also, these  places will quite often exchange other currencies and cheques.  Hotels/restaurants will sometimes change US dollars, but at a much poorer  rate.

You should also be able to get a cash advance at the bank (usually  only possible for Visa and sometimes Mastercard) although most banks  will require a copy of your passport and quite often take your photo.

In Colombia they can be very particular about the condition of the  US dollar bank notes. You will quite often NOT be able to use notes  which are torn or marked even slightly. If your notes are at all damaged  you may use them in Ecuador, but probably NOT in Colombia, so save them  until then.

Remember that once you leave Colombia you will generally not be able to use or exchange pesos (so please change all left over pesos at the border).

Entrance fees

Generally speaking most museums in Colombia cost between US$2 and  US$5. There are many interesting museums to visit, but please bear in  mind that many museums close on Mondays.

The many beautiful churches and cathedrals of Colombia are always  free to enter, but flash photography is strictly forbidden, and opening  hours vary greatly. There are sometimes cultural events going on and  galleries/exhibitions which are free to enter. Your tour leader will  give you more details on these.

Shopping

Shop for hand-worked silver, emeralds, pottery, “chiva” pottery  buses, leather, textiles, hammocks, wall hangings, gold, large mobiles  (not the phone variety) and ponchos.

Each different region has its own regional handicrafts/ jewellery  etc. so if you like something, buy it! You may never see it again (or if  you do it will probably be more expensive). Bargaining is expected  while shopping in the markets, but in shops it is usually considered  rude to bargain. You may however ask for a ‘discount’ (“descuento” in  Spanish).

Bear in mind that it can be very expensive and not always reliable to  send packages home so try to buy only what you can carry home!

Tipping

A 10% service charge is added on to the restaurant bill throughout  most of Colombia. If it is not added on, it is still expected  (especially in the more expensive restaurants). There should be no other  charge on top of this. However, if IVA is said to be included on the  menu then it should NOT be added onto the end of the bill. You are not  expected to tip taxi drivers unless they go out of their way for you  although you should tip anyone who helps with your luggage, approx 50  cents. Tipping guides at the end of tours/excursions is always  appreciated and your tour leader will advise you on this.

Local transport

Taxis are recommended for all journeys within cities. Most taxis have  meters if not you may have to haggle with the driver to agree upon the  fare. This can be fun, but it is a good idea to find out in advance,  from your tour leader or the hotel receptionist, approximately how much  the fare should be. It will also help if you can speak a few words of  Spanish. You will almost certainly have to accept that you will pay more  than the Colombians do.

Local buses are interesting and usually very crowded. The new  TransMilenio buses that ply back and forth on dedicated lanes from south  to north are good and regular, like an outdoor metro system using  buses.

One of the most fun ways to explore Colombia’s cities is by “Chiva”  bus, which is a truck chassis with brightly coloured wooden open-sided  body with bench seating (these are the old typical type buses which are  still used in many places in the countryside today for the locals –  chicken buses, as we call them). Most cities have these tours, mostly in  the evening where they will have a band/group on board playing live  music and take you to many of the night spots plus hand out drinks  en-route, mostly “aguadiente” (firewater, a kind of ouzo which is quite  delicious once you’ve had one or two).

Security

Crime in Latin America is not as bad as its reputation as long as you  are sensible and alert. Like anywhere in the world, you can be in the  wrong place at the wrong time. Care should be taken, especially whilst  walking around the larger cities. Try to keep away from dark quiet areas  if on your own, particularly late at night and try to always take a  taxi. It is usually better to get a taxi by phone if you can, especially  at night, as there are a lot of bogus taxi-drivers around. We suggest  that whenever possible you leave all of your important documents in the  safe (“caja fuertes”). However you should always carry some form of ID  or a photocopy of your passport.

Some areas in Colombia may be affected by current adverse political or economic situations which may disrupt the smooth running of your tour. Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel, amend or continue the operation of a tour based on, but not solely restricted to, the advice of the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Advice Service (FCO)
www.fco.gov.uk
, these decisions will be made with our travellers safety and best interests in mind. These situations can frequently change so if you have any questions please don't hesitate to get in touch with an Adventure Specialist.

Local food and drink

You will find a range of international and local cuisine to suit  every budget. Excellent seafood is available along all coastal regions  and chicken, pork and beef are available throughout.

In Colombia the basic diet focuses around chicken, beef or seafood,  mostly with french fries or rice (or both) and possibly a little salad.  Some of the most popular and typical dishes are: “
frijoles
” (kidney  beans in a delicious sauce with lumps of pork), “
ajiaco
” (lovely soup  type dish with chicken breast, maize, potato and is served with avocado,  rice), “
bandeja paisa
” (minced beef with beans, egg, fried plantain,  chorizo sausage, rice, manioc, huge meal), tomales (which is like a  boiled corn dumpling filled with chicken and wrapped in banana leaf).  These are just a few of the local favourites, there are many more.

Typical snacks are “
empanadas
” (little fried pasties usually filled  with meat, chicken, cheese or even prawns) and “
patacones
” (fried  vegetable banana chips, served as a side dish).

Much of Colombia’s food is not hot and spicy but you will find a bowl  of “
aji
” (which is a chilli or hot pepper sauce) on most tables which  can be added to spice things up.

If you are a strict vegetarian you may experience a distinct lack of   variety in the food available, especially in small towns. You might  find  that you are eating a lot of omelettes and other egg dishes. Our  tour  leaders will do their best to provide interesting vegetarian   alternatives when arranging group meals in the campsite, but your   patience and understanding is requested.

All drinks such as water, soft or alcoholic drinks are at your own   expense at all times.

You should be wary of drinking the local tap water. Bottled water,  carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices are widely available and are  generally safe to drink. Please note however that fruit juices are  sometimes made with unboiled tap water and could upset your stomach. An  easy way around this is to order juice “
con leche
” (with milk) instead.  The choice of different juices in Colombia is incredible e.g.
mora
(blackberry),
piña
(pineapple),
naranjilla
(mixture between mandarin and  orange),
maracuya
(passion fruit),
tomato de arbol
(tamirillo or 'tree tomato'), guanabana (a soursop, like acustard apple) and curuba (which has a  great taste).

In Colombia some of the hotels we use have bars or serve alcoholic  drinks. If there is not a bar in the hotel then there is sure to be a  bar within walking distance. In more up-market hotels, imported beers  and spirits are available but usually at a high price. If you are happy  to drink the local spirits then there is an array of rums, aguadiente (a  kind of ouzo) and you can get imported Chilean wine can sometimes be  found quite cheaply at supermarkets. There are various brands of beers  including Costeña, Aguila, Bavaria and Leona. Please don’t forget the  coffee, some of the best in the world but pick a nice café style  establishment with an espresso machine.
