Our Prices

How our prices work

Our philosophy is to give you the best possible adventure holiday. We have set high standards for our itineraries and we take great care to ensure that all of the ingredients are right, not just the price. Our accommodation is tried and tested, our expedition vehicles are the best on the road and our staff is second to none for enthusiasm and experience. Many of the included excursions in our tours are the result of years of careful research to get the right balance of quality and value. This focus on excellence is the backbone of our reputation and is the reason why travellers return to us year after year.

Local Payments on Adventures for 20s & 30s tours

Travellers on Adventures for 20s & 30s tours will continue to pay a local payment to their tour leader on arrival in South America.
These tours are divided into two separate payments. The first amount is paid directly to your travel consultant before you depart for your tour and the second amount is the local payment, which is paid locally. The local payment is a portion of the total tour cost and must be paid directly to your tour leader in US dollars cash. The local payment is not optional and if failure to pay this money in cash may result in you being excluded from starting the tour.
The local payment ensures your tour leader has a supply of cash to run the tour if access to banking facilities is limited or nonexistent. This helps to save operational and administrative costs, which in turn helps to keep the cost of our tours competitive so we can pass the savings on to you. The local payment also helps us get cash directly into local businesses to provide communities with an immediate economic benefit.
Learn more about the local payment here
(applies to Adventures for 20s & 30s only).

Guide prices

The tour prices shown in the brochure are a guide only. These prices represent the basic per person cost of the tour, cruise or add-on package at the time of publication of the brochure. Due to changes in costs, the tour price at the time you book could be different to that shown in the brochure and you should refer to our website or to our reservations teams for up-to-date prices.

Fuel surcharges

New or increased fuel surcharges imposed by cruise operators will be passed on to clients. The latest fuel surcharges will be shown on our website.

Surcharges after booking

We work hard to price our tours accurately. When costs rise, we will absorb them as much as possible. The price of your holiday will not generally change after you have booked. However, in certain rare and unusual circumstances such as extreme currency fluctuations, we may be forced to pass on additional costs in the form of a surcharge or price increase.

Read the booking conditions
for further information.
