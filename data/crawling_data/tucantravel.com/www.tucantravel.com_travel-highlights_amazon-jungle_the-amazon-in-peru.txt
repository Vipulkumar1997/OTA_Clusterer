The Amazon in Peru

Group Tours to the Peruvian Amazon

Some of our Worldwide Adventures to Peru include a 3 day / 2 night excursion to the Tambopata National Reserve in the Madre de Dios region of Peru, staying at the Eco Amazonia lodge approximately 1 and a half hours motorised canoe ride from Puerto Maldonado. Part of this journey may be undertaken in a land vehicle, depending on the season. There are also Discovery packages available to this lodge. This excursion is available as an optional extra on Overland Tours and Adventures for 20s and 30s.

Eco Amazonia is unique in that it owns and protects an animal sanctuary called Monkey Island, 5 minutes from the lodge and located in the heart of the Madre de Dios river. In one location on the island, there is a feeding spot where your naturalist guide will put out food to attract the monkeys to come down and eat. As a result you will be able to see the various types of monkeys such as maquisapa, martin, little lions, frailes, achué and ronsocos at quite close range.

The guide will also show and tell the group about different type of trees and medicinal plants that can be found in the area. During your visit you have the opportunity to take a trek into the jungle, exploring marsh areas, dense vegetation and giant trees. You also have the chance to enjoy panoramic views from an observation point near the Apu Victor Lake and take a boat ride to look for giant otters and other unique wildlife. You may spot parrots, guacamayos, toucans, camungo, shanshos, herons, and other animals like caimans, turtles, butterflies and a vast variety of birds.

Accommodation is on a twin or multi-share basis, with all bedding and towels, mosquito nets and candles or oil lamps provided. Most cabins have ensuite bathrooms with cold or tepid running water, a toilet and shower. Electricity is only available for a short period in the morning and evening. All meals are provided and there is a bar onsite selling alcohol and soft drinks.

Best time to visit the Peruvian Amazon

Although it is generally easier to travel to the Peruvian Amazon during the dry season, there is very little variation in temperature throughout the year, so the best time to travel is whenever it suits your schedule best. It rains all year round so make sure you bring a rain jacket or poncho and perhaps waterproof trousers no matter when you travel.

During the dry season, generally June to September, sudden friajes (cold fronts) bring rain and cold weather to Tambopata / Madre de Dios, especially in July, so it pays to be prepared for the worst. Temperatures can drop from 32°C (90°F) to 10°C (50°F) overnight. However, there are fewer mosquitoes and that can make the experience more comfortable.

The jungle experiences its wettest months in the period of December through May, but even then the rain rarely falls for more than a few hours at a time. However, many people prefer to visit during the wet season due to the higher water levels of jungle rivers.
