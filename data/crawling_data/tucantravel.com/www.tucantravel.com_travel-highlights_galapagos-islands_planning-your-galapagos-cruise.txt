Galapagos Cruise Planning









Planning your Galapagos Tour

When planning a big trip like one to the Galapagos Islands, it is important that every detail is perfect for you. That is why we have put together a guide to help you decide which route to take, the different islands and even which cabin type you might prefer. Here you will find pictures of the different cabin styles and information on the type and kind of wildlife you will see on each island. For any questions, don't hesitate to contact a member of our Reservations Team for more information.

We use two ships that operate in the Galapagos, running alongside each other - the Coral I & II.

Routes and Islands


Planning your Galapagos tour can be a complicated business and it is essential that you see all that you wish to see on your visit. Now that we have explained the the facilities on our ships and the cabin types available, we are here to help you decide what route to take and which islands you wish to visit.

North Islands

Santiago Island

Deep pools and caves are carved along the lava shoreline and iguanas, sea lions, fur seals, land and sea turtles, flamingoes, dolphins and sharks can be found in the waters and on the beaches. Darwin finches and hawks can be seen in the sky. Some of our cruises will stop at Sullivan Bay where you can view a pahoehoe lava flow.

Bartolome Island

A volcanic island, Bartolome is where you can find the Galapagos penguin, the only penguin species to live on the equator. The green turtle can also be found on the island. Off the shore, there is excellent snorkelling opportunities with penguins and sea lions.

North Seymour

This island is one of the best places to see the birds of the Galapagos Islands. From blue-footed boobies to swallow-tailed gulls, here you can witness intimate courtship, breeding and nesting.

Baltra

Also known as South Seymour, Baltra has the Galapagos Islands largest airport.

Santa Cruz

Santa Cruz hosts the largest town on the islands called Puerto Ayora. In this town you can visit the Charles Darwin Research Station where you can learn about the tortoise breeding programs. Across the island there are opportunities to see tortoises in their natural habitat. In the highlands of the island there are magnificient lava tunnels while in the waters around Black Turtle Cove sea turtles, rays and small sharks mate.

East Islands

San Cristobal

Charles Darwin's first landing spot, on this island is Puerto Baquerizo Moreno, the Galapagos' capital. It is also home to one of the Galapagos' two airports of which some Expedition Cruises fly in and out of. Here you can see frigate birds, sea lions, giant tortoises, blue and red footed boobies, tropic birds, marine iguanas, dolphins and swallow-tailed gulls. There is diverse vegetation across the island and a large freshwater lake in the highlands.

Santa Fe

Santa Fe is one of the most beautiful of the Galapagos' islands. Galapagos hawk, Darwin's finches and land iguanas habituate in sheltered coves. There is a forest of cactus on the island.

South Islands

Santa Maria (Floreana)

Floreana Island is one of the most fascinating in terms of its human history. Due to the flat landscape, supply of water, plants and animals, this island was the favourite stop for whalers, merchants and shipmen. For some time there was a post office on the island. Floreana suffered the most and it is here that the native tortoise to the island became extinct. Today, you can see penguins and flamingoes and at Devil's Crown, you can swim with sting rays, sea turtle and sharks.

Espanola Island

Spot the waved albatross and blue-footed booby on this island as well as the Punta Suarez blowhole. Espanola is the oldest of the Galapagos islands and has a large number of endemic species including the lava lizard, mockingbird, and tortoise. The islands marine iguanas have a distinct red colouring while it is the only place in the Galapagos where the waved albatross nests.

West Islands

Fernandina

The youngest of the islands, in 2005 ash and water vapour rose above the island while lava flows ran down the slopes of the volcano. It is the only island in the world where no species have been introduced whether accidentally or not and the landscape is often described as a 'land without time'. Here you can see the flightless cormorants, galapagos penguins, pelicans, sea lions and fur seals. A dense mangrove forest can be found on the island.

Isabela

The largest island in the Galapagos, the island is shaped like a seahorse due to the merging of six large volcanoes. Here you can find mangrove forests, lava crevices and tidal pools. Here you can see penguins, flamingos, sea turtles, marine iguanas and the flightless cormorant.

Browse our Galapagos Tours

Our Galapagos tours range from 7 to 12 days. While the boats take slightly different routes, the experts on board will make sure you see as much of the wildlife as possible.

To make the most of what that region has to offer, why not consider combining your Galapagos tour with Ecuador.
