Travel Insurance










Travel Insurance

All clients must have comprehensive travel insurance cover while travelling with us. Failure to secure adequate cover may result in clients being prevented from joining the tour until Travel Insurance is purchased without a refund as per our
booking conditions.

Where can I get travel insurance?

UK Travel Insurance

We recommend clients use
Campbell Irvine
for Travel Insurance cover.  Tucan Travel is an Introducer Appointed Representative of Campbell Irvine Ltd who are authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority. These details may be checked on the Financial Services Authority’s register at www.fsa.gov.uk or by contacting them on (+44)845 606 1234.

Australia Travel Insurance

We recommend clients use
CoverMore
for Travel Insurance cover. The issuer of insurance is Great Lakes Australia ARBN 127 740 532, ABN 18 964 580 576, AFSL No. 318603.

Other

There are many travel insurance companies available outside of the UK and Australia. When choosing a travel insurance provider, look for one that offers a minimum of £100,000 (or equivalent currency
)
emergency medical cover.

Why do I need travel insurance?

Travel insurance is an essential 'must-have' when you travel - it is a necessity, not a luxury. You need it for protection against the unexpected, to protect yourself against financial losses and for peace of mind. Still, many people think purchasing travel insurance isn't that important, that they're prepared to take a risk and think they can save money by avoiding it. In reality, if you can't afford travel insurance, you really can't afford to travel.

It is important that you know that travel insurance is mandatory for all clients whilst on a tour organised by Tucan Travel. You and your personal property including baggage are at all times solely at your own risk and you are wholly responsible for arranging your own insurance.

How much cover do I need?

A suitable insurance policy should provide adequate cover for medical expenses arising through illness or accident prior to or during the holiday and loss of holiday monies through cancellation or curtailment of the holiday for insurable reasons. If you are travelling on a Tucan Travel tour you must be in possession of a travel insurance policy that includes a minimum of £100,000 (or equivalent currency) in cover for any medical expenses that you might incur when travelling, and for repatriation to your home country in the event of a medical emergency. Tucan Travel is able to assist clients in obtaining a suitable insurance policy from our Sydney office only.

Learn more about buying travel insurance

If you are making your own arrangements you should ensure that there are no exclusion clauses limiting protection for the type of activities in your tour, including optional excursions. Many insurance companies will allow you to arrange extra cover for activities not covered by a particular policy. You should also satisfy yourself that any travel insurance arranged through Tucan Travel is what you require and you should arrange supplementary insurance if need be. In addition to cover for medical expenses and repatriation, we strongly recommend that policies should include cover for personal accident, cancellation and curtailment, and loss of baggage and valuables. It is also advisable to cover yourself for personal liability in case you are sued for causing injury or damage to property. Tucan Travel will not be held liable for any claim arising out of failure to take out sufficiently comprehensive insurance.

You may be asked to present the tour leader with your insurance policy and provide the 24 hour emergency contact number and the policy number, on arrival. Any client who does not have a policy or is unable to provide this information will be obliged to purchase one before they can join the tour. All clients who have purchased travel insurance policies from a company other than Tucan Travel will be obliged to sign a waiver on arrival in the destination to absolve Tucan Travel of any responsibility in the case that the travel insurance policy is not sufficiently comprehensive.

Residents of the United Kingdom should note that although a European Health Insurance Card can cover the cost of some medical treatment in European Union countries, it will not cover the cost of you returning to the UK after an accident or medical emergency. We strongly recommend that you carry a copy of your full policy document with you at all times, together with any certificate showing the policy number and emergency contact details. Please remember: no two travel insurance policies are alike. Make sure you read your policy thoroughly before purchase and make sure that it covers you for medical expenses, repatriation and other criteria described above.

Will I be covered by my credit card?

The travel insurance cover automatically provided with credit card purchases does not provide adequate cover as standard. Proof of adequate insurance will be requested at the start of your tour and failure to provide this will result you being prevented from joining the tour. There are essentially three different kinds of credit card insurance policies:


The standard 'free' cover provided when someone takes a basic credit card - this generally provides insurance for all travel that has been paid for with the credit card, for the time between when the client leaves home and when the client arrives in their destination. Once they arrive, the insurance ends. So, basically the insurance covers almost nothing and is not acceptable for our tours.

Travel insurance that can be 'purchased' through a credit card company – generally most credit card companies offer very comprehensive travel insurance policies to their clients for payment of a fee. These policies are generally very similar to those provided by travel agents and are acceptable for our tours.

'Free' comprehensive travel insurance that may be provided to people with gold or platinum type credit cards - basically as per (2). Again these policies are generally very similar to those provided by travel agents and are acceptable for our tours. In order to ensure that clients do not join our tours with the inadequate cover provided under (1), if you wish to use your credit card insurance you must be able to prove to the tour leader that our minimum requirement has been met. That is, you must be able to prove to the tour leader that the policy includes a minimum of £100,000 (or equivalent) in cover for any medical expenses that you might incur when travelling and for repatriation to your home country in the event of a medical emergency.


The easiest way for you to prove this is to produce a copy of the detailed insurance policy, in which this cover will be specified. If you are unable to prove this you will be obliged to purchase an acceptable insurance policy before being allowed to join the tour. We strongly recommend that you carry a copy of your full policy document with you at all times, together with any certificate showing the policy number and emergency contact details. If you are unsure about whether your policy provides you enough cover, contact your credit card company directly or for further information, please contact us.

Travel insurance tips


Shop around for a good price, but make sure that the policy covers you for all the activities you want to do rather than opting for the cheapest policy. What if you arrive in Peru and decide you really do want to try sandboarding after all? Or you decide you're brave enough to go skydiving in Jinja? Save yourself the hassle and try to make those key decisions in advance.

Consider annual or multi-trip insurance if you make several trips a year - it's an easy way to save time and money. It can also be cheaper to purchase a policy with your partner / spouse.

Make sure your policy will refund the full cost of your holiday.

Bear in mind that most policies will not cover you for drink or drug related incidents.

Be honest with your insurer - are you pregnant? Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions? For example if you fail to tell your insurer that you are asthmatic and then have an attack that you need treatment for, you will probably not be covered.

Make sure your policy covers you realistically for loss of your valuable items. Reconsider whether you need to take those items on holiday with you if your policy will be too expensive to cover them. If you don't take enough care of your personal items, the insurance policy may not cover them in the event of loss or theft, so be careful! In the event something is stolen, report it to the police within 24 hours and get a report.

Your flights may be covered by your credit card, but be careful who you purchase them from. Is your travel agent / airline in good financial shape / financially protected? Will you be covered by your insurance if your airline fails and you need to get home a different way?

Don't assume that your airline will cover you for loss of baggage - by law they only have to pay a minimum value and it may not cover you for the loss of your expensive gadgets, clothes or souvenirs.

Check your dates - make sure your policy will cover you for the entire time you're away.

Redundancy - are you covered by your insurance if you lose your job? In these unsettled times it's important to check, even if you think it's highly unlikely to happen.
