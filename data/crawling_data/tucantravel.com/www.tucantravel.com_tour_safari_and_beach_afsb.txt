What you need to know


We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.



If you visit the Masai Mara and Serengeti between July - September you may witness the great Wildebeest Migration as they cross the Mara River. Please note that the migration is dependant on weather and vegetation requirements for the animals.



The first day of your tour is simply an arrival day with no pre-organised activities. You will meet your Tour Leader at 18.00 for the pre-departure meeting. In order to allow time to relax and see some of the sights you may wish to add pre-tour accommodation.



A yellow fever vaccination is required if you are travelling to/from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission in Africa; this includes transiting through a yellow fever risk country. The majority of our tours in Africa aside from Morocco, require a yellow fever certificate therefore we highly recommend that you obtain this prior to travel. Please make sure that on arrival you have a valid yellow fever certificate ready for inspection by local customs or health authorities, otherwise you could be refused entry or quarantined





Itinerary


Expand all

Collapse all




Day 1 to 1 - Arrive Nairobi



Many travellers use Nairobi as a stop off point on their way to other parts of Eastern Africa, but there are many activities in the city that may appeal such as visiting orphaned baby elephants or the giraffe centre where endangered Rothschild giraffes are protected and bred.

Optional Excursions

Giraffe centre- KES1000pp (excluding transportation), The Flip Flop Recycling Company – free (excluding transportation) • Karen Blixen Museum, coffee garden & cottages – KES2000 and free entrance to the bar (excluding transportation). • David Sheldick Elephant Centre - KES500 (excluding transportation). Only open 11am -12pm when feeding.

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Kenya Comfort Hotel or similar




Day 2 to 3 - Masai Mara National Reserve



We depart Nairobi early, after breakfast and drive to our lunch spot where we will exchange our expedition truck for 4WD safari vehicles before continuing on to the Masai Mara Nature Reserve. On arrival we get straight into our first game drive in one of the world's most famous and expansive wildlife reserves.
Covering over 1,500 square kilometres and providing habitat for thousands of animals, the Masai Mara Nature Reserve is deservedly one of Kenya’s most popular safari spots. Animals present in the reserve include the big five (lions, elephants, Cape buffaloes, leopards and rhinoceros), various grazing mammals which attract carnivores such as cheetahs, hyenas and jackals, and over 500 recorded species of birds. We stay just outside the park in permanent tents, enjoying a buffet dinner in the evening.
The following morning we leave camp early for a second game drive, visiting the mighty Mara River. During the annual Great Migration, this is the setting for the thunderous display of thousands of wildebeest crossing the river while canny crocodiles lie in wait. At any time of year, the river is vitally important to the ecosystem and a good spot to view animals. You will also have the opportunity to visit a local Masai village, learning about the vibrant, semi-nomadic herders’ way of life and join them in a local dance.

Game Drives in the Masai Mara Nature Reserve,Masai Village

Hot air balloon over the Masai Mara National Reserve – US$450 per person

Day 4 to 5 - Nairobi



Today we leave the incredible Masai Mara behind and head back to Nairobi. We will arrive back mid-late afternoon and you have the evening free to relax and reflect on the incredible experiences you have had over the last few days.
Returning to Nairobi gives you the chance to experience some of the activities around the capital city you may have missed first time around. You may wish to enjoy a meal at the famous African buffet restaurant called Carnivores, where meat is served from Masai spears until you can eat no more and raise your flag in surrender!
Approximate Travel Time:
Four hours to Nairobi

Day 7 to 8 - Serengeti National Park & Ngorongoro Crater



A place that needs no introduction, the Serengeti National Park is the most famous safari destination in Africa. We’re picked up after breakfast and taken by 4WD to the national park. The afternoon is spent game driving to our lodge, located
inside
the national park to maximise our time and wildlife viewing opportunities. Before we reach the Serengeti plains, we’ll stop for a stunning vista overlooking the Ngorongoro Crater, the largest unbroken, unflooded caldera in the world. The vast 300 square kilometre crater stretches out in front of you in a kaleidoscope of blues and greens and it’s not until you spot the barely discernible grey speck of an elephant that you truly grasp its scale.
Every safari is unique and you will never know what’s in store for you until you arrive. Among the hundreds of species in the park, you may encounter zebra, giraffe, wildebeest, buffalo, lion, cheetah, leopard, hippopotamus, hyena, elephant, vulture, monkey, warthog, gazelle and impala. Each season offers a different highlight.
Our second day in the park is a full day of game driving, trying to spot the more elusive members of the animal kingdom before heading to our lodge in the Ngorongoro Crater.

Game Drives in the Serengeti National Park

Day 10 to 11 - Nungwi Beaches



Today we are bound for the enigmatic, intoxicating Isles of Zanzibar. After breakfast we will transfer to Arusha Airport to take our flight to the paradise island. Arriving in Zanzibar we head to the idyllic beaches of Nungwi where we will spend the next two nights.
Indulge in a cocktail or two while we watch the sun set over the crystal clear Indian Ocean. The next day you have free. Snorkel with colourful marine life or simply kick back and soak up the sun. This beautiful setting will certainly provide you with a chance to relax and unwind!

Day 12 to 12 - Stone Town



Today we head to Stone Town. On the way we will stop at one of the many spice plantations where we can discover the abundant plants that flourish in this verdant, tropical environment and sample spices picked straight from the source. We will also visit a small village, having the chance to interact with the locals and experience their kind hospitality; here we will enjoy a traditional lunch cooked by community.
On arrival at our hotel in Stone Town you are free to explore the labyrinth of walled streets, winding alleys, bustling markets and grand crumbling architecture. This UNESCO-listed Stone Town has changed little over the past 200 years. If you enjoy shopping then there are plenty of crafts and colourful souvenirs to be purchased here. Admire the intriguingly decorated elephant-proof doors before sitting down to watch the sun set with a fresh juice, cold beer or cocktail. If the thought of fresh seafood gets the taste buds tingling, make sure you check out the excellent night market on the promenade which serves a feast not to be missed!
