Croatia Tours

With its 1,778 kilometres of spectacular Mediterranean coastline, it is no surprise that Croatia is one of Europe’s most popular summer destinations. But in taking a Croatia adventure tour you’ll find that there’s much more to this amazing country than sun, sand and beautiful places to dip your toes in the sea. Roman, Venetian, Italian and Austro-Hungarian rulers have left their mark on the architecture and you’ll discover a strong Eastern European influence in the baroque architecture of Zagreb, Croatia’s capital.

On a Croatia adventure tour you’ll discover stunning fortified coastal cities like Dubrovnik and Split, which offer beautiful buildings and magnificent sea views. Meanwhile, the elegant Venetian-era settlement of Hvar Town on the Dalmatian islands present excellent celebrity spotting opportunities and wonderful restaurants. But Croatia is not without its natural delights. Join a Croatia adventure tour to enjoy the cooling spray of a ‘slap’ - the Croatian word for waterfall - on your face at Plitvice Lakes National Park and admire the spectacular multi-hued lakes pouring one by one into each other in a dazzling cascade.

Croatia Travel Articles, Inspiration & Information






Three days in Dubrovnik

You may have heard the ancient city of Dubrovnik referred to as the Pearl of the Adriatic. This expression only became truly clear to me, however, when I rounded the bend of the Croatian coastline and saw the city tumbling below me: iridescent in the dying rays of the sun, the Adriatic sea perfectly mirroring the sky’s brilliant display of..

Croatia Travel Guide

Brief History

Croatia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the end of World War I. In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal independent Communist state under the strong hand of Marshal TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before occupying Serb armies were mostly cleared from Croatian lands. Under UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998.

Geography and weather

Croatia is situated in southeastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea, between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia. Geographically diverse, the country has flat plains along the Hungarian border, low mountains and highlands near Adriatic coastline and islands. The climate is predominantly continental with hot summers and cold winters, although the coast is more Mediterranean with mild winters and dry summers.

Visas

Many nationalities (including citizens of the UK, Australia, Canada, the US and EU citizens) do not need a visa to enter Croatia or Slovenia. However, visitors must hold an onward ticket, all documents required for their next destination and sufficient funds. If your nationality is not listed please consult your nearest Croatian consulate before you travel.

Money

The monetary unit in Croatia is the kuna (HRK). For up to date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
. You might find kuna difficult to obtain overseas, however it should be no problem to change currency on arrival

The easiest way to obtain money in Croatia is to draw it out of an ATM (cash machine) on a credit or debit card (e.g. visa or cirrus). ATMs are widely available throughout Eastern Europe and credit cards are accepted in many restaurants and shops. Another option is to bring cash, in either US dollars or euros (pounds sterling and other currencies cannot always be easily changed) but we advise against bringing all your money in this form, in case of theft. In all of the cities that we visit there are many places to change money and your tour leader will be able to show you where to get the best rates of exchange.

Please note: Travellers cheques are not recommended for travel anywhere in Eastern Europe as these can be difficult to change and attract poor exchange rates or exorbitant commission.

Tipping

In a restaurant, round up the bill unless a service charge has already been added or the service was not up to standard. You should also round up bar bills and taxi fares.

Security

Most people find Croatia a very friendly and safe and feel quite comfortable wandering around alone during the day. However, as with any area you are not familiar with (particularly in the capital cities) it is recommended that you exercise more caution at night especially if you are a lone female.

Local food and drink

Some breakfasts are included in your tour. Breakfasts can be basic so if you tend to get hungry it may be a good idea to buy some fruit or snacks to eat during the day. All other meals, extra snacks and drinks on the tour are at your own expense.

Ask your tour leader if they can recommend any restaurants in the area to suit your taste or budget or have fun exploring independently.

Croatian specialties include Dalmatian or Istrian prosciutto, Pag or Lika cheese, sheep's cheese, Slavonian paprika-flavoured salami ("kulen" and Samobor or Zagorje garlic sausages ("èešnjovka"). There is also a wide selection of meat dishes, including turkey with a special pasta known as "mlinci", roast lamb, roast suckling pig, and boiled or baked "štrukli" (pasta with cheese). Croatian vineyards produce reasonable wine – particularly red and you will almost certainly come across plum brandy, a national favourite.

All drinks such as bottled water or soft drinks are at your own expense at all times and are fairly inexpensive. Alcoholic drinks vary in price, with wine and beer generally being the cheapest options.

Time Difference

The time difference in Croatia is GMT/UTC + 1. For other time differences please visit
