Tour Suitability










Tour Suitability

Are you ready for an adventure of a lifetime?

We are delighted that you are considering jumping on a Group Tour with us. In order to ensure that you have the best possible experience, we would like to draw your attention to some aspects of our group tours to make sure that you are fully aware of the nature of the travel which you will be participating in.

Alongside the below information, we highly recommend you read your Tour Notes carefully and ask an Adventure Specialist if you have any questions.

If after reading this information, you don't think this particular tour is right for you, remember Tucan Travel has a large range of tours, products and services which can be tailor-made to suit your requirements. Please don’t hesitate to contact our offices to discuss alternative or if you require more information.

Experience the path less travelled

Our tours are designed to let you get under the skin of a destination, so you receive an authentic experience. If you enjoy meeting and interacting with local people and are willing to occasionally encounter basic infrastructure and facilities in order to experience the path less travelled, then our group tours will be just what you’re looking for.

There may be long travel days

Our tours travel great distances, sometimes from one end of a continent to another. Our tours have been designed to allow you to make the most of your time in each destination and while we include lots of flights to make the transfer process faster, every tour experiences some long travel days in varying levels of comfort. Public buses might be quite cramped, hot and stuffy while private vehicles may not have the same health and safety standards of a vehicle back at home. Toilet stops may be spread out and road conditions can mean that you are in for a bumpy ride.

A recommended age range applies

Our tours are perfectly designed for those aged between 18 and 65 years old. They are fast-paced, arduous and often, tiring, while packed with adventure, new experiences and feel-good moments. With customers from around the world, of different ages, background and nationality, some groups can be more boisterous than others.

As a result, we ask that anyone wanting to travel under the age of 18 or over 65 carefully consider whether a group tour is right for them.

Minimum Age Restrictions:
Due to the fast-paced nature of our group tours, we don't allow children under the age of 16 to join them. The accommodation, transport or excursions offered may not be suitable for children under this age and the dynamics of the group may not be appropriate for young children. For children aged 16 and 17, we ask that each child is accompanied by a parent or legal guardian.

If you wish to take your family on an adventure and you have found a group tour online that is perfect for you, we can create a tailor-made tour. Contact an Adventure Specialist for more information.

Our tours are modular

Think of your trip as a tiny piece of a puzzle. Most of our tours are shorter sections of much longer trips and they can all be combined to form an extended adventure in your region of choice. This means that throughout your tour, some people may join or leave in different cities so you get to meet more people from different backgrounds and nationalities. If you want to travel for longer, contact an Adventure Specialist.

Embrace the nature of Group Travel

To get the most out of your tour, pack a positive attitude and an open mind. These are most certainly invaluable when travelling in a group. Despite the very best intentions and planning, things can and do go wrong and occasionally we encounter problems beyond our control, such as delayed public transport and adverse weather conditions. In such situations we ask for your patience and we will endeavor to keep as close to your scheduled itinerary as possible.

Our hotels are locally owned

We use a huge variety of accommodation on our tours, mainly locally owned and chosen for their proximity to local attractions, their cleanliness and customer service. In some of our more remote destinations you may encounter more basic facilities for instance you may not have the luxury of hot water, laundry facilities, local shops or amenities and on some tours, there may be limited access to electricity. Our guides and leaders will do their best to forewarn you if this should occur.

Pack light as you are responsible for carrying your luggage

Participation on our tours requires a moderate level of fitness. The tours are fast paced, packing in plenty of sights into short periods of time. You will be responsible for carrying your luggage on travel days whether it is on a short walk to a bus station, on and off various forms of transport, down crowded cobbled streets or up flights of stairs in a hotel when no lifts are available. Some of our tours also include short hikes or orientation walks and it is important that you are able to keep up with the rest of the group.

Visit your doctor and get fit

As some of our tours operate at high altitudes or in malarial zones, we would recommend you consult with your doctor prior to travel. If you have any pre existing medical conditions, travel in these regions may be difficult and it is important that we know about them before you make a booking as we may require a doctors note.  Furthermore, we recommend consulting with your doctor at least 6 weeks before your departure date regardless of your present health to make sure that you are up to date with your vaccinations.

If you have any preexisting conditions that may require extra support while on tour, it is important that you let us know in advance. We will require you to fill out a Tour Suitability form found
here.
Due to the fast pace of our tours, we may also request this if you are over the age of 65.

Participatory camping & cooking (When travelling by truck)

On all tours that travel by Expedition Vehicle, you will be required to participate in the successful running of the group. This means that to ensure the happy continuation of the tour you will all be expected to help the tour leader and driver with the setting up of camping equipment, the cooking of meals, pitching of tents, washing up and packing up the vehicle when leaving a campsite facility. It may also be necessary to stop off at a supermarket on the way to your next destination to pick up supplies. Here you will have some time to do your own personal shopping.
