Tanzania Tours

A Tanzania adventure tour takes you to one of Africa’s most diverse countries - see the ice-capped Mount Kilimanjaro with its lower lying rainforests, Zanzibar’s sandy beaches, the Serengeti’s savannah plains and the Ngorongoro’s mopane woodlands and salt pans. It is not just the environment, but the cultural diversity, which is one of Tanzania’s most pleasant and refreshing surprises like Arabic and Indian influences in Dar Es Salaam and Zanzibar. Wander through the labyrinth streets of Stone Town on Zanzibar, the ‘Spice Island’, barter for spices or visit Prison Island to learn more about the slave trade.

Alternatively, while away your day on picture postcard beaches, swim in the clear blue waters and gorge yourself on fresh fruits. Back on the mainland, our Tanzania adventure tour takes in the Serengeti National Park which protects the highest concentration of large mammals on Earth and is home to nature’s greatest spectacle - the Great Migration, where millions of wildebeest, zebra and gazelle follow the rains in a life or death quest for nutritious grasses. The nearby Ngorongoro Conservation area is home to the Ngorongoro Crater, a collapsed volcano two million years old, and one of the world’s finest natural wonders. Dense populations of game live in this naturally formed enclosure and there are ample opportunities to capture that perfect shot on camera. This Tanzania adventure tour is a fantastic opportunity to appreciate the cultural and natural diversity Africa has on offer.

Tanzania Travel Articles, Inspiration & Information






Camping in the Serengeti

As we arrive in Tanzania from Kenya the scenery changes becoming (in my opinion) more mountainous and less green. It also seems to have gotten hotter. We drive from Nairobi to Arusha crossing the Tanzanian border. As the drive days are getting a little longer we’ve all gotten quite good at playing Uno. I now also have a little truck routine which is roughly as follows..

Markets of Stone Town

Zanzibar Spice Island; the name itself throws forward images of an exotic and chaotic scene of sailors, traders and pirates. Prior to arrival, I had a preconceived notion of Zanzibar that would not be that far removed from a scene in Treasure Island. This says that 1. I have an overactive imagination and 2. Zanzibar has a fascinating and colourful culture and history that cannot help but fire the imagination..

Foods of South and Eastern Africa

For most people when deciding to visit Africa, food doesn’t come in to it. They want to see the big five, meet the Maasai, ride the rapids, trek the gorillas and dive with sharks. For some people African food is nothing special, just something that gives you energy for their next exciting African experience, “they all just cornmeal porridge and stew anyway don’t they?”

Tanzania Travel Guide

Brief history

Some of the oldest human settlements have been found in Tanzania  around the Olduvai Gorge in northern Tanzania – an area often referred  to as “the cradle of mankind”. Bantu people moved in to the region  during the 1st millennium AD with Swahili, a Bantu language, being the  main language of today. Trade of gold and ivory with Arabia and Persia  during the first century made the whole of the East coast, Zanzibar in  particular, into major trading destinations.

In 1498, the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama reached the coast and  by 1525, Portugal had the entire region under their control. In the  early 18th century, the Arabs dominated once more and Zanzibar became  the most important centre for slave trading with the Arabs. The slave  trade was officially abolished in 1873 but an illegal slave trade  continued to flourish for many years afterwards.

The Germans then ruled from the 1880’s until 1919 when the area became a British Mandate until 1961 and was known as Tanganyika.

Tanganyika declared independence in December 1961, followed by  Zanzibar in 1963. The two then merged to form Tanzania on 26th April  1964.

Geography and weather

Tanzania is a very varied country which boasts the highest mountain  in Africa – Mount Kilimanjaro, (at a height of 5895m at Uhuru Peak on  the Kibo summit) found in the mountainous north east region of the  country. It also has shores on Lake Victoria (the largest lake in  Africa) and Lake Tanganyika (the deepest lake in Africa), which also  forms the border with Congo. North and central Tanzania is a large  plateau of plains - the Serengeti in the north being the most well known  of these, while the eastern shores are very hot and humid, with the  island of Zanzibar just off the coast.

Tanzania has a tropical climate with the hottest period being between  November and February when temperatures stick between 25-31 degrees and  the coolest period being May to August with temperatures ranging from  15-20 degrees celsius.

The long rains are roughly from March to May and the short rainy  season is from October to December. The annual migration usually occurs  between June and September.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

Currently EU, US, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand citizens all  need a visa to enter Tanzania. It is your own responsibility to check  all visa requirements before travelling and obtain them in advance as  required. For many nationalities visas can be obtained on the borders  however you should contact the embassy for further information. Please  bear in mind that as of December 2007 the Tanzanian visa starts from the  date of issue not the date on entry which makes it trickier to organise.

Important: pounds sterling are not accepted at border crossings so bring US dollars cash for any visa expenses at the border.

Border Crossings
Into Tanzania from Kenya: Namanga
From Tanzania into Malawi: Kasumulu
Money
The monetary unit in Tanzania is the Tanzanian shilling. For up-to-date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.
In general, Visa is the only credit card that will work everywhere in   Africa. Master Card, AMEX and Cirrus will work in some countries but   not in others.
We recommend that you bring cash in US dollars   only. When changing money, it is a good idea if at all possible, to get   small denomination notes and coins in the local currency as often there   is a lack of change when you are making purchases and no-one in Africa   ever seems to have change.
If you are joining the tour in Dar es Salaam, on arrival at Tanzania  International Airport we suggest that you withdraw some Tanzanian shillings at the ATM or change some money at the bank if you only have  US dollars or travellers cheques. Change enough money to see you through  the first few days of your trip – particularly if it is a weekend.
Please note that it is not possible to withdraw US dollars from ATMs in Africa, only local currency.
Shopping
Haggling is expected in Tanzania and hunting for bargains can be a  real highlight.Your best buys are soap stone and hard wooden carvings as  well as batiks (wall hangings), sarongs, hats, and of course tee  shirts.
Zanzibar has many bazaars throughout the maze of narrow streets in  Stone Town and here you can bargain for chess sets, statues, masks,  batiks, paintings etc although many are brought over from the mainland.  True Zanzibar souvenirs are the intricate jewel boxes, incense and  burners and of course spices which are often sold in attractive packs.
Tipping
Tipping in Tanzania and on Zanzibar especially, is fast becoming  expected in restaurants. However in most cases, it is just a matter of  rounding the bill up and you should never pay more than a dollar or two  for the tip if the service was good.
Local guides in Tanzania do appreciate a tip.
Local transport
Taxis are recommended for all journeys within a city. In Tanzania,  taxi meters are not normally in evidence, so you will find yourself  engaging in a bit of haggling with the driver to agree upon the fare.  This can be fun, but it is a good idea to find out in advance, from your  tour leader or the hotel receptionist, approximately how much the fare  should be. You will almost certainly have to accept that you will pay  more than the locals do.
Security
Overall, crime is not a great problem in Tanzania, but parts of Dar  es Salaam do have a reputation for muggings and pick pockets. This does  not mean that you should be afraid to leave your hotel, but it does mean  that in certain areas of the city and around the city beaches, you need  to exercise caution or avoid them altogether and try to avoid  travelling alone after dark. Don’t walk around lonely back streets,  especially on your own, don’t wear expensive looking jewellery or watch  and don’t carry a wallet in your back pocket. Don’t carry your camera  openly; always have it in a small day pack which is firmly attached to  your body, preferably in the front in crowded places. Always wear a  money belt or leave your valuables locked up where possible.
Photography
Caution should be taken when taking photos in and around the city.  Locals should always be asked prior to taking a photo and it is not  uncommon for them to ask for a small donation. Never take photos of  police, military personal or buildings. The same goes for any government  buildings, banks, post offices or the railway station.
Local food and drink
Most meals are included when camping and lunch is usually included on  travelling days in the truck. When staying in hotels or hostels, all  meals are at your own expense.
Your tour leader will be able to recommend restaurants.
Tanzanian dishes are very similar to those you will find in  Kenya. Mainly beef and chicken stews and Nama Choma away from the coast,  with seafood on the coast. One delicious difference is that they do  tend to serve really good coconut rice with a curry.
On Zanzibar, the night seafood market in Stone Town is not to be  missed. Freshly caught and cooked seafood of all varieties, washed down  with freshly squeezed sugar cane juice. “Zanzibar Pizza” is a local  speciality. Finely chopped tomato and onion (chilli optional), mixed  with beef mince and egg, wrapped up a wafer thin dough parcel and fried -  not like a pizza you would know at home, but well worth trying.
In Dar es Salaam, you can find western style take-aways but if you  feel like a splurge, then throw on some clean clothes and head for one  of the larger hotels who all do a buffet style lunch. Also the ice cream  parlour near the Zanzibar ferry port is an icon that has been there  longer than anyone can remember and a “must do” if you like ice-cream.
If you are a strict vegetarian you may experience a distinct lack of    variety in the food available, especially in small towns. You might   find  that you are eating a lot of omelettes and other egg dishes. Our   tour  leaders will do their best to provide interesting vegetarian    alternatives when arranging group meals in the campsite, but your    patience and understanding is requested.
All drinks such as water, soft or alcoholic drinks are at your own   expense at all times.
(All glass bottles taken away from shops in Tanzania will have a deposit added on which varies.)
You should be wary of drinking the local tap water. Bottled water,   carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices are widely available and are   generally safe to drink. Please note however that fruit juices are   sometimes made with un-boiled tap water and could upset your stomach.
There are various brands of beers found only in Tanzania including Kilimanjaro, Castle, Safari, Serengeti and Ndovo.
Most of the campsites / hostels that we use have bars or serve  alcoholic drinks. If there is not a bar in the campsite / hostel then  there is sure to be one within walking distance. Beware imported spirit  prices as they are very expensive so always ask for the local equivalent  spirit if you want to remain within your budget!
