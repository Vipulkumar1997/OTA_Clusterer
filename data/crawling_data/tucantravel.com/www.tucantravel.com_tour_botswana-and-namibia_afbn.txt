What you need to know


We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.



The first day of your tour is simply an arrival day with no pre-organised activities. You will meet your Tour Leader at 18.00 for the pre-departure meeting. In order to allow time to relax and see some of the sights you may wish to add pre-tour accommodation.



A yellow fever vaccination is required if you are travelling to/from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission in Africa; this includes transiting through a yellow fever risk country. The majority of our tours in Africa aside from Morocco, require a yellow fever certificate therefore we highly recommend that you obtain this prior to travel. Please make sure that on arrival you have a valid yellow fever certificate ready for inspection by local customs or health authorities, otherwise you could be refused entry or quarantined

Day 1 to 1 - Arrive Livingstone



Welcome to Livingstone, the town, named after the great 19th century Scottish missionary explorer Dr David Livingstone.  Once the bustling capital of Northern Rhodesia, Livingstone changed it face and became a quiet town following the Capital’s relocation to Lusaka in 1935.
Wonder the craft markets and pick up some unique souvenirs or chose from one of the many optional activities available in this area. Whether it be sunset cruises down the Zambezi, a visit to the Mukuni Cultural Village, riverboarding, white water rafting, canoeing, horse riding, abseiling, quad biking, kayaking, helicopter or microlight flights over the falls there is something for everyone.

Optional Excursions

Half/full day white water rafting – US$160-185 (Zambezi rafting is generally possible between June and January and is closed throughout the rest of the year) • Half/full day river boarding – US$165-175 • Chobe National Park day trip – US$190 (excluding visas) • Bungee jumping – US$157 • Abseiling – US$162 • Gorge swing – US$95 • Livingstone Island – US£150 • Microlight ride - 15 mins – US$174 • Helicopter ride over Victoria Falls (15 mins) – US$185.60 • Visit the Zimbabwean side of Victoria Falls entrance fee – US$70 per person (plus individual visa fees) • Horse riding, 2.5 hours – US$75 • Canoeing - full day – US$155 • Jet boat – US$95 • Zambezi boat cruise – US$60. Enjoy a beer on this sunset cruise along the Zambezi to watch the animals at the end of their day.

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Fawlty Towers Hotel or similar




Day 2 to 2 - Kasane & Chobe National Park



From Zambia we head to Botswana to continue our adventure. We stay close to Chobe National Park which is home to the most diverse wildlife in Botswana. 11,000 square kilometres of wilderness, floodplains, forests and swamps support all manners of animal and birdlife. To gain a different perspective on of the animals we embark on a sunset cruise along the Chobe River. Wildlife is plentiful and common along the water’s edge; as we glide by you may see elephants, buffalos, kudu, bushback, hippo, giraffe and sable.
Located in north west Botswana, Chobe is a diverse area spanning from the border at the Chobe River, to the now dry Savute Channel and beyond to the borders of the Moremi Game Reserve and Okavango Delta. The park is divided into four distinctly different eco systems: Serondela with its lush plains and dense forests in the Chobe River area, the Savuti Marsh, the Linyanti Swamps and the dry hinterland and it is famous for having one of the largest game concentrations in the African continent.
Please note:
You will be required to pay a Tourism Levy of U$30 when entering Botswana. This is payable by cash or credit card.
Approximate Travel Time:
Four hours depending on border

Included Excursions

Sunset game cruise down the Chobe River in Chobe National Park

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Thebe River Safari Lodge or similar


Meals

1 Basic Breakfast(s), 1 Lunch(es), 1 Dinner(s)



Day 3 to 3 - Elephant Sands



Our next stop is spent in a very unique location. You will be staying at Elephant Sands, a bush lodge set on private conservancy in the north-east part of Botswana. It is home to a huge amount of wildlife that roams free, especially elephants. You can enjoy the swimming pool and if you are lucky catch a sighting of one of these gentle giants! Elephant Sands is located near two waterholes which are only a few feet away.
You will be staying in stilted tented camps and can enjoy a cocktail or two in the Elephant Sands bar.

Accommodation

1 night(s) in tented camps at Elephant Sands or similar


Meals

1 Breakfast(s), 1 Lunch(es)



Day 4 to 4 - Maun



Driving across the top edge of the Kalahari Desert we reach the town of Maun, which will be our gateway for visiting the Okavango Delta, Africa's largest freshwater wetland.
Approximate Travel Time:
A full day drive

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Sedia Hotel or similar


Meals

1 Breakfast(s), 1 Lunch(es)



Day 5 to 5 - Maun & Okavango Delta



The Okavango Delta is a huge area of very slow flowing water fed by the Kavango River. The water fans out from the river into a labyrinth of channels, lagoons and palm-covered islands before evaporating over the sands of the Kalahari Desert.
Today we will take a day trip to the small islands in the bush.  We will travel by hand-crafted mokoros (small boats with shallow drafts similar to canoes) through the delta. The canoes glide silently along the reed-fringed waterways, steered by stealthy polers who earn their living transporting travellers along the delta. We will also have walking safaris through the bush and a chance for a swim before returning to the hotel in Maun.

Included Excursions

Day trip to the Okavango Delta with walking safaris and a mokoro ride included

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Sedia Hotel or similar


Meals

1 Buffet Breakfast(s)



Day 6 to 6 - Divundu



Departing Maun we drive through Botswana towards Namibia and cross the border through a narrow strip of land known as the Caprivi Strip. Keep your eyes peeled as we drive through Mahongo Game Reserve as you may be lucky enough to spot zebra, giraffe, gazelle and elephants among other wildlife.
Please note:
A yellow fever vaccination is required for travellers arriving to Namibia from countries with risk of yellow fever transmission; this includes transiting through a yellow fever risk country. Please make sure you have a valid yellow fever certificate with you for inspection by Namibian customs or health authorities, otherwise you could be refused entry or quarantined
Approximate Travel Time:
Six hours depending on the border

Accommodation

1 night(s) in basic huts at Rainbow River Lodge or similar


Meals

1 Buffet Breakfast(s), 1 Lunch(es)



Day 7 to 8 - Etosha National Park



We will spend two nights staying in or around Etosha National Park. Where possible we try to stay at the lodges inside the park for one or more nights. Etosha National Park is one of the most memorable places you will visit on this trip with huge amounts of wildlife visiting the waterholes to drink. We have a full game drive to make the most of the fantastic wildlife-spotting opportunities.
Etosha National Park is one of the best places in Africa to spot cheetah and the endangered black rhino. Keep your camera lens ready for rare antelope species, the Burchell's zebra and black-faced impalas which roam the wild savannah. You may spot the odd giraffe or two chewing through thorny acacia trees in the woodland areas. Etosha National Park is a bird watcher's paradise with some 340 species inhabiting the park at different times of the year. For a short period after seasonal rains Etosha's vast salt pan is covered by a layer of water which attracts massive flocks of pelicans, flamingoes and other wading birds. While the pan is dry it is notable for the way it dramatically changes colour during the early morning and late afternoon sun.

From the coast we head inland again, making our way east towards Windhoek, Namibia’s capital city.

This is the only city in Namibia and is home to a population over 250,000 inhabitants.
Like in Swakopmund there is a noticeable German influence here. German is still widely spoken and it is common to find traditional breads, sausage, and other delicacies, they even hold annual beer festivals.
No tourists visit to Windhoek is complete without paying a visit to Joe’s Beerhouse, a bar and restaurant providing a mix of warm Namibian and German hospitality. This place is full of old relics from ‘Joe’s’ travels and creates a great atmosphere for socialising and reminiscing about your journey so far. Here you can also opt to sample some delicious game meats or try out one of the many craft beers on offer.
