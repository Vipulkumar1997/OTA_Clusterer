Czech Republic Tours

On a Czech Republic adventure tour discover the beating heart of Central Europe, which has played an important part in the history of the region with influence over architecture, politics, art, music, science and literature. However, as you will discover on a Czech Republic adventure tour, the country only officially came into being in 1993 after the ‘Velvet Divorce’ which divided Czechoslovakia into two separate republics. Prague, the country’s attractive capital and ‘City of 1,000 Spires’ is a fascinating blend of Gothic churches, Renaissance and baroque buildings as well as neoclassical, art nouveau and Cubist structures.

Take an early morning walk across Charles Bridge and kiss the feet of the saints of your choice, visit Wenceslas Square and see the world’s only Cubist lamppost just around the corner. Delve into the medieval lanes of the Old Town and watch the hour strike at the 15th century Astronomical Clock, then head for the Castle District for spectacular views. Active adventure holidays can be busy, so when you need to relax, jump on a tram and head to a park, or perhaps to a local restaurant and try traditional dumplings followed by a frothy pilsner during your exciting Czech Republic adventure tour.

Czech Republic Guide

Brief history

Following the First World War, the closely related Czechs and Slovaks of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire merged to form Czechoslovakia. During the interwar years, the new country's leaders were frequently preoccupied with meeting the demands of other ethnic minorities within the republic, most notably the Sudeten Germans and the Ruthenians (Ukrainians). After World War II, a truncated Czechoslovakia fell within the Soviet sphere of influence. In 1968, an invasion by Warsaw Pact troops ended the efforts of the country's leaders to liberalize Communist party rule and create "socialism with a human face." Anti-Soviet demonstrations the following year ushered in a period of harsh repression. With the collapse of Soviet authority in 1989, Czechoslovakia regained its freedom through a peaceful "Velvet Revolution." On 1 January 1993, the country underwent a "velvet divorce" into its two national components, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

Geography and weather

The Czech Republic is situated approximately in the geographical centre of Europe. It is a landlocked country 326 km from the Baltic and 322 km from the Adriatic. It shares borders with Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia. The highest point of elevation is the peak of Mt. Snezka (1,602 metres above sea level) and the lowest point of elevation is near Hrensko where the River Labe leaves Czech territory (117 metres above sea level). The climate is temperate with cool sunny summers and cold, cloudy, humid winters.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your trip.

Visas

Most nationalities (including citizens of the EU, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US) do not need a visa to enter the Czech Republic. If your nationality is not listed please consult your nearest Czech embassy or consulate before you travel.

Money

The monetary unit in the Czech Republic is the Czech crown or koruna (Kc). For up to date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

The best place to change money in the Czech Republic is at banks and they are normally open Monday – Friday 8am – 5pm. There are many ATM’s where you can obtain Czech crowns cash using credit and debit cards.

Tipping

A service charge is rarely added to restaurant bills. Give a tip for good service directly to the waiter when you pay your bill. As a rule of thumb, round up to the next multiple of 10Kc.

Security

Most people find the Czech Republic very friendly and safe and feel quite comfortable wandering around alone during the day. However, as with any area you are not familiar with it is recommended that you exercise more caution at night especially if you are a lone female.

Local food and drink

Most meals are included when camping (please see your tour dossier for a complete breakdown of meals included). Breakfasts can be basic so if you tend to get hungry it may be a good idea to buy some fruit or snacks to eat during the day. All other meals, extra snacks and drinks on the tour are at your own expense.

Ask your tour leader if they can recommend any restaurants in the area to suit your taste or budget or have fun exploring independently.

Food in the Czech Republic tends to revolve around pork, gravy, dumplings and pickled cabbage. Popular street snacks include bramborak, a potato pancake with flecks of bacon and smazeny syr – a slab of melted cheese fried in breadcrumbs and served in a toll with tartar sauce. Most pubs serve a menu of basic hot dishes. Most lunch time menus start with soup, one of the country’s culinary strong points. Main course are generally based on pork (veprovy) or beef (hovezi), you could also sample wild boar (kanci maso) or duck (kachna) which are usually delicious. Main course are served with different varieties of dumpling (knedilky) or vegetables.

The Czech Republic tops the world in the beer consumption league tables, and there are many delicious brands to try at cheap prices.

Vegetarians will find no shortage of fresh salads on offer.

Time Difference

The time difference in Czech Republic is GMT/UTC + 1. For other time differences please visit

Voltage

230v sockets that differ to the rest of Europe. The grounding is accomplished with a round male pin permanently mounted in the socket and therefore although the plugs are two pronged they must have the corresponding female contact to accept the grounding.
