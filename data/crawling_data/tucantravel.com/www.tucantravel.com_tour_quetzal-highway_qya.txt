What you need to know


We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.



This tour has some long travel days to get you from A to B. We believe these days make the adventure but make sure you pack a book or two.



The first day of your tour is simply an arrival day with no pre-organised activities. You will meet your Tour Leader at 18.00 for the pre-departure meeting. In order to allow time to relax and see some of the sights you may wish to add pre-tour accommodation.





Itinerary

Collapse all




Day 1 to 1 - Arrive Playa del Carmen



Welcome to Mexico! The first night of this tour will be spent at Playa del Carmen, a beachside paradise only one hour away from Cancún. We recommend booking extra nights to enjoy the paradise beaches as well as the optional activities including the Maya ruins at Tulúm.

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Playa del Carmen or similar




Day 2 to 4 - Caye Caulker



After breakfast in Playa del Carmen, we take a short walk to the terminal we begin our full day journey to beautiful Belize using a combination of buses, taxis and a ferry. When leaving Mexico you will have to pay a small departure fee of approximately MXN500. Belizeans know how to relax, and hopefully the locals' expertise on relaxation will be contagious during your stay on Caye Caulker. If not, there are signs to remind you to "Go Slow", "Take it easy", and even "No shirt, no shoes, no problem". We spend a couple of very laid back nights on Caye Caulker, where you can throw away your shoes to wander the sand filled streets, spend the evenings eating seafood, drinking cocktails, and listening to reggae music in one of the bars.
During the day we can organise a range of different optional snorkelling trips for you, such as to Shark and Ray Alley, where you can swim within a few feet of nurse sharks and majestic sting rays, or weather dependent, you may have the opportunity to swim with sea-cows! Another optional snorkelling tour takes you out to Hol-Chan Marine Reserve where you are guaranteed to see lots of colourful fish and interesting reef formations. Qualified divers can explore the so-called bottomless "Blue Hole", made famous by the explorer Jacques Cousteau (please note: this optional excursion does not go every day, check locally for availability). Other options include sunning yourself, riding a bike around the island, or trying your luck at fishing. If you are lucky, you can take your catch to one of the local restaurants so they can BBQ it for you.

Included Excursions

Caye Caulker

Optional Excursions

Half/full day Caye Caulker snorkelling – US$45-80 • Scuba diving in the Blue Hole – US$290 • Night Snorkelling – US$70 • Flight over the Blue Hole – US$200pp (min 3 people)

Accommodation

3 night(s) in hotels at Hotel China Town or similar


Meals

1 Breakfast(s)



Day 5 to 6 - San Ignacio



We continue on to San Ignacio referred to as "Cayo" by the locals, this agricultural centre is also known to be the 'adventure' and 'nature' capital of Belize. The surrounding jungle, wildlife, waterfalls, rivers and caves, have created the ideal location for the numerous optional excursions that are available, from canoeing downriver and tubing through caves, to visiting the famous caves Actun Tunichil Muknal, where they found untouched Mayan ceremonial and sacrificial remains.

Optional Excursions

Tubing – US$100 • ATM Caves – US$95 • Canoeing – US$85 • Caracol Ruins, the largest and most important Mayan ruin site in Belize – US$95 • Mountain Pine Ridge Reserve – US$85

Accommodation

2 night(s) in hotels at The Aguada Hotel or similar


Meals

1 Breakfast(s)



Day 7 to 7 - Flores



Waving goodbye to Belize we cross into Guatemala to the charming island-town of Flores. When departing Belize you will be required to pay a small fee of $40.00BZD, and on arrival in Guatemala another small payment of 10q is required. Flores was the last town to be conquered by the Spanish and situated in the centre of Lake Peten Itzá. On the way to Flores we stop at the breathtaking Maya site of Tikal, it is regarded as the greatest city of the Maya world and is nestled deep in the jungle. This complex is one of the biggest Maya sites discovered, and you will have most of the day to explore and learn about the flora, fauna, and amazing Mayan history with our knowledgeable local guide.
The area around Tikal has been declared as the Tikal National Park and the preserved area covers 570 square kilometres. The ancient city has been completely mapped and at its height covered an area greater than 16 square kilometres, with more than 3000 structures. Today the main centre covers an area of approximately two and a half square kilometres, As you wander the site, you will see several tall mounds which are temples that have not yet been excavated, and you will have the opportunity to climb some of the tallest Mayan temples.
The emphasis was on height when creating these imposing structures because the Maya believed the higher the building, the closer they were to the gods. Around Tikal there is a lot of animal life, and if you're lucky, you will have the chance to spot the noisy howler monkeys, pizotes (a racoon-like animal), exotic birds such as toucans, and much more!

Included Excursions

Guided tour of Tikal ruins

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Sabana or similar


Meals

1 Breakfast Box



Day 8 to 8 - Rio Dulce



We carry on to the river town of Rio Dulce where we overnight in cabins right on the water. In the afternoon the boat tour along the 23 kilometre stretch of waterway to Livingston allows you to experience one of the most scenic areas of Guatemala. Livingston is situated at the mouth of the Rio Dulce, where it joins the Bay of Amatique, and is inhabited by the Garifuna people. This lively little town has a Caribbean atmosphere different to the rest of Guatemala and is a great place to try the delicious local specialty tapado (seafood coconut soup) and listen to the local African-style punta music.

Included Excursions

Rio Dulce boat tour to Livingston

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Catamaran or similar




Day 9 to 9 - Antigua



A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Antigua is one of the most delightful colonial towns in Central America. To fully explore this beautiful town, we recommend booking post-tour accommodation at the end of your tour.
The local indigenous can be seen throughout the cobbled streets and plazas of the city in their colourful costumes, selling their crafts and textiles. As the cultural centre of Guatemala, Antigua is an ideal place to experience the traditional music, architecture and art of the country. Rich in ornate churches, convents, parks, plazas, cafés, restaurants, bars and colourful street markets and surrounded by awe-inspiring volcanoes, Antigua is one place you will never forget.

Optional Excursions

Pacaya volcano climb – US$20 • Walking tour – US$30 • Chocolate making class - US$30 •  Coffee farm tour - US$25
