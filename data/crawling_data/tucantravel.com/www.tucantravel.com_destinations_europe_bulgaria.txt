Bulgaria Tours

A Bulgaria adventure tour offers a fascinating insight into the culture and traditions of South Eastern Europe. Located on the north eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula, with a history shaped primarily by Thracians, Greeks and Romans, followed by Ottoman and Russian rule, Bulgaria has emerged from behind the Iron Curtain of Communism with a vibrant modern culture, attractive cities and a welcoming attitude. Sofia, the country’s young, dynamic capital offers a spectacular skyline with superb medieval monasteries, onion-domed churches, mosques and Red Army monuments.

Highlights of a Bulgaria adventure tour include the gold-domed Aleksander Nevski Church and Crypt, the Archaeological Museum with Thracian treasures on display, the red brick minaret of Banya Bashi Mosque, the Ethnographical Museum in the Royal Palace where you can learn about Bulgaria’s rich folkloric traditions, the amazing murals at medieval Boyana Church and the Monument to the Soviet Army. The tree-lined boulevards and verdant public parks of Sofia offer a chance to slow down and catch your breath after a big day of sightseeing and shopping during your Bulgaria adventure tour.

Bulgaria Travel Guide

Geography and weather

Our tours only operate from late spring to early autumn, when the weather is generally at its best. Temperatures will generally still be cool in May and again in October. The warmest (and busiest) months tend to be July/August. The further south you are the higher the average temperatures. Rainfall is at its lowest from June to August but it can rain at any time of year.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your trip.

Visas

Citizens of the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US and EU citizens can enter Bulgaria viisa-free for 30-90 days (depending on nationality). If your nationality is not listed above please consult your nearest local embassy or consulate before you travel.

Money

The monetary unit in Bulgaria is the lev (BGN)

You might find these difficult to obtain overseas, however it should be no problem to change currency on arrival. For up to date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

The easiest way to obtain money in Eastern Europe is to draw it out of an ATM (cash machine) on a credit or debit card (e.g. visa or cirrus). ATMs are widely available throughout Bulgaria. Another option is to bring cash, in either US dollars or euros (pounds sterling and other currencies cannot always be easily changed) but we advise against bringing all your money in this form, in case of theft. In all of the cities that we visit there are many places to change money and your tour leader will be able to show you where to get the best rates of exchange.

Please note:
Travellers cheques are not recommended for travel anywhere in Eastern Europe as these can be difficult to change and attract poor exchange rates or exorbitant commission. In some countries it may not be possible to change travellers cheques at all. If possible make sure that you bring crisp new banknotes as some exchange offices will not accept old or dirty notes (US$ notes issued before 1990 are not generally accepted)

Tipping

If there is no service fee, a general rule of thumb is to add 10 to 15 percent of the bill for a tip.

Security

Most people find Bulgaria very friendly and safe and feel quite comfortable wandering around alone during the day. However, as with any area you are not familiar with (particularly in bigger cities) it is recommended that you exercise more caution at night especially if you are a lone female.

Local Food and Drink

One of the great joys of Bulgaria is sampling the wide selection of different dishes available. Food offered in much of Bulgaria is delicious, hearty, and often meat orientated. You may well find yourself smoked or salted fish, pickled cabbage stew, beef stroganoff, goulash, meat stews, game meats, and many varieties of dumplings.

Vodka is very common throughout Bulgaria but beer is the main alcoholic drink and Bulgaria is proud of its national beers.

All drinks such as bottled water or soft drinks are at your own expense at all times and are fairly inexpensive. Alcoholic drinks vary in price, with beer generally being the cheapest option.

Time Difference

The time difference in Bulgaria is GMT/UTC + 2. For other time differences please visit
www.timeanddate.com

Voltage

220-240V. Sockets are of European two pronged round pin variety.
