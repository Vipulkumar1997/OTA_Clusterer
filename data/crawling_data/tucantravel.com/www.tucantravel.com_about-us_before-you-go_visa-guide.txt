Visa Guide

Information on Obtaining Visas

It is essential that you check visa requirements for your trip before you depart. While we make every effort to offer advice on visas, it is ultimately the responsibility of the traveller to arrange and research their own visas. If you do not comply with visa requirements you may be refused entry into a country and miss all or a portion of you tour. If you are refused entry into a country, it is your own responsibility and Tucan Travel will not be liable for any inconvenience or expense incurred as a result.

If you need to arrange a visa in advance, you can do so either directly with a country’s embassy, or through a visa agency. Although visa agencies are more expensive, many people choose this option for the convenience and comfort of knowing the details are being taken care of by professionals. We suggest the following companies should you choose to arrange your visas through an agency.

Visa Services:


United Kingdom, Ireland & Australia:



Canada & the USA:


Citizens from countries other than the ones listed above please
contact your
reservations consultant

Arranging Your Own Visas:


We have compiled a brief summary of visa requirements for Tucan Travel’s destinations below.

Customers entitled to a free visa on arrival and joining a Worldwide tour but not travelling though Vietnam will be issued a free visa on arrival so long as any pre or post tour time spent in Vietnam does not exceed 15 days.





5. Multiple Entry visas - If you are entering Vietnam more than once within a short period of time, we recommend obtaining a multiple entry standard visa or multiple e-visas.



IMPORTANT
If flying into Vietnam to either join a tour in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, or during a Tucan Travel tour you must have obtained either a Standard Visa, an e-VISA or a Letter of Approval for a VISA on arrival. Failure to show either of these at check-in may result in a refusal to board your flight. Letters of approval for visas on arrival can only be used for arrivals at International Airports and cannot be used at land border entry points.

South African passport holders do not need a visa to enter Zambia. Most other nationalities including Canada, USA, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and most continental European countries can obtain a visa on the border for $50 (single entry).

If you wish to apply for a multiple-entry visa, you should do so prior to travel. If your country is listed under the 'referred visa' category on the Zambian Department of Immigration website you will need to apply for a visa in advance.

Please ensure you have enough US dollars in the correct denominations if you are applying for your visa on the border. British pounds are not accepted at Africa land border crossings.



All nationalities are required to obtain a visa prior to travel which can be obtained from your nearest Burmese consulate or embassy. Visitors from 41 countries currently can apply the visa through http://www.evisa.moip.gov.mm/. The processing time is about (5) working days for granting an E-Visa. Passengers with E-Visa are permitted to enter at Yangon International Airport or Mandalay International Airport and some land borders.

If your nationality is not on the list, you can apply for this visa at a Myanmar embassy in or near your country. Please contact the embassy for more details. Different embassies have different rules to apply for a tourist visa. Generally you will need 2 or 3 photos and enough cash to pay for your visa (at most embassies it’s 30 USD). Some embassies will ask you to come in person to apply for the visa or they will ask for your CV (to check where you have been working in the past) and they might ask for your planned travel itinerary. It usually takes about 3 days to get your visa.

The visa for Myanmar is valid for 28 days and occupies a full page in your passport – the visa expires 90 days after it is issued so don’t apply too early. Please make sure you have enough pages in your passport. The passport has to be valid for at least 6 more months.



South African passport holders do not need a visa to enter Zimbabwe. Most other nationalities including Canada, USA, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and most continental European countries can obtain a visa on the border.



Important Information for those Transiting Via the USA

The US Department of Homeland Security has issued a statement to remind travellers from all Visa Waiver Programme (VWP) countries that they are now required to obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) prior to travelling to the United States. This requirement, effective from January 2009, applies to all eligible citizens or nationals travelling under the Visa Waiver Programme.

The ESTA, a web-based system, determines the eligibility of a person to enter the United States prior to boarding their flight. Travellers without an approved ESTA may be denied boarding, experience delayed processing, or be denied admission at a US port of entry. To apply for the ESTA, visitors must hold an e-passport. Without one, you will have to get a visa at the embassy. Visitors to the USA, and those travelling via the USA to other destinations should apply for travel authorisation at
https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov

General Advice on Travel Documents and Visas

Regardless of visa requirements for specific countries, we recommend doing the following when travelling abroad to minimise difficulties at borders. The better prepared you are prior to travelling, the easier and smoother your travel experience will be.


Carry spare passport photos when you travel for visa and entry permit applications.

Make sure you have enough time to apply for visas before you travel. Some visas may take several weeks to obtain, so don’t leave it to the last minute.

Check your tour dossier to see if you require a single or multi-entry visa for your destination(s)

Photocopy and scan the photo page of your passport, visas, cards and any other important travel documents and ensure you have a paper copy and a digital copy in case you lose the originals.

Double check all visa information on official embassy websites. Wikipedia and travel blogs are not sufficiently authoritative sources when researching country entry requirements.

Ensure your passport is valid for a sufficient length of time after you have travelled. Many countries require your passport to be valid for at least six months beyond your travel dates, and some ask for longer.

Check you have enough spare pages in your passport if you are applying for visas on arrival.

Print off proof of onward travel (flight ticket) and have it with you when approaching immigration desks.

Print off travel insurance certificate and have it with you when travelling.

If your tour arrives into a country via a land border and you wish to apply for a visa on arrival, ensure that it is possible to apply at that border crossing. Border crossings are listed in the country dossiers on your tour dossier page.

Print a copy of your tour itinerary, tour and hotel vouchers and have them with you when approaching immigration desks.
