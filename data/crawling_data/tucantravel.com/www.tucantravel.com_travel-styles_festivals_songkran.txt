Songkran (Thailand)










Songkran

Celebrated in Thailand every year in April, the festivities are marked by throwing water on others. Streets are full with people holding water balloons and water pistols. The throwing of water is seen as a symbol of washing away the bad sins in preparation for the following year. Traditionally it is a time to pay respect to your elders and pray with the images of Buddha being taken from the temples and wats and paraded down the street.

If you are heading to Thailand in time for Songkran, remember to wish people "สวัสดีปีใหม่" (sawatdi pi mai)
