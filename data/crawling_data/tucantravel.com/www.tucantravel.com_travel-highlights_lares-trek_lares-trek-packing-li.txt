Lares Trek Packing List









Packing List for the Lares Trek

Luggage storage and load limits

During the trek your main luggage will be stored at your hotel in Cuzco and you will receive a small duffle bag at your briefing (which will be held the evening before you start the trek) to pack clothes for 3-4 days. Your team of porters will carry these bags together with the food and equipment for the trail. Please note that you will not have access to these items until the end of each day as the porters will always be ahead of the group. You should therefore bring a day pack in which you can carry personal belongings such as your camera, water and sun screen etc. By Peruvian law the duffle bag must not weigh more than 7 kilograms (15lbs) which is to include your sleeping bag. All bags will be weighed before being accepted. If you require more than 7 kilograms, it will then be your responsibility to carry the extra amount together with your day pack.

Packing List for the Lares Trek

Please note:
During the Lares trek even daytime temperatures can become extremely cold with a wind chill factor, especially on day 2 crossing the high passes.




Sleeping bag
- You will need a good warm sleeping bag. Where possible we recommend you bring your own sleeping bag, however adequate ones can be hired locally (for approx US$12) but we can take no responsibility for the standard. If you are planning to hire a bag it is a good idea to bring a silk sleeping bag liner to use inside for added warmth and comfort. A four season (or -10) bag is recommended for the winter months. At other times you will probably be fine in a 3 season (or -4/-5) bag although this depends on how much you feel the cold and is given as a guideline only. Roll mats are provided however for greater comfort and warmth, Thermorest style mattresses can also be hired in Cuzco for US$10. If you are travelling in winter and you do not wish to invest in a 4 season bag you may want to consider purchasing a 3 season bag plus a sleeping bag liner and bringing additional clothing.



Silk sleeping bag liner
- Especially recommended if you plan to hire a sleeping bag but can also give your own bag added warmth



Well worn-in waterproof walking boots
- Good quality, comfortable footwear is essential. Whatever you wear on your feet the most important thing is comfort. It is vital to ensure your boots are well worn in and lightweight. Ankle support and waterproofing is recommended but if you already have something comfortable with good grip on rocks then don't go rushing out to buy new boots - you are better off with your well worn in pair!



Waterproof clothing
- A plastic poncho is recommended and can be purchased easily for approx US$1.



Plastic bags
- to keep your belongings & clothes dry (wrap everything in plastic bags).



Toilet paper
- Most important!



Small towel and basic personal toiletries



Water bottle
- bring 1 large (1.5 litre) or 2/3 small water bottles which can be refilled on the trek with boiled water which will be supplied when it is possible to make camp.



Warm clothing for nights
- Fleece, long pants, woollen hat, gloves



Walking clothing in layers
– e.g. zip off trousers, fleece, T-shirts



Thermal underwear
– If trekking in winter or you feel the cold



Personal medication and first aid kit
- Band-aids, Imodium, Panadol, rehydration sachets



Camera and spare batteries, memory cards and/or film
- there are no electrical outlets on the trek so make sure you fully charge or/and have spare batteries!



Snacks
- Chocolates, chips, biscuits, energy bars



Torch (flash-light)
- this is very important, and spare batteries



Sunscreen, sunglasses and sunhat



Tropical strength insect repellant



Swimwear
- for hot pools at Aguas Calientes - towels can be hired there for 3 soles



Antiseptic hand gel



Swimwear
for Aguas Calientes hot pools - Towels can be hired there for 3 soles



Flip flops / thongs / sandals / jandals
– good to change into at camp
