Emma Nelson
0 Comments







Trying out the local cuisine might just be one of the best parts of exploring a new country. With so much on offer to tickle your taste buds it can be difficult to narrow it down and you might just come home 10 pounds heavier (but that’s the joy of holidays right?) Traveling as a vegetarian can be challenging at times, especially when the waiter gives you that confused look when you tell them "no, you also don’t eat chicken, it’s meat too" (we’ve all...

Emma Nelson
0 Comments







Medieval buildings, cobbled streets, terracotta rooftops, quaint cafes and...smoked fish on the breakfast buffet? Welcome to Tallin! The capital of Estonia, Tallinn lies on the coast of the Gulf of Finland and is one of the must see destinations in the Baltics. Like stepping back in time, the city is home to one of the most well preserved Old Towns in Eastern Europe. Since making the list of UNESCO world heritage sites in 1997, Tallinn has slowly been...

Rosanna Neophytou
0 Comments







Machu Picchu is easily one of the most coveted highlights on every avid adventurer’s list. Located high in the Andes, thousands flock to the ancient Inca city to explore the legendary ruins. Getting to Machu Picchu is a huge part of the experience. Many follow the well-trodden Inca Trail, a four day trek which includes camping en route. Others may prefer the quieter Lares Trek, four days travelling through traditional Andean villages along the way. But what if you don’t have time to do...

After touring the country for over 2 weeks last year, here are a few of my top tips not to be missed when you make a visit to Sri Lanka.

Eating my way around Sri Lanka


June 22nd, 2017
Kris Hadwin
0 Comments







After spending two weeks exploring Sri Lanka it’s hard not to indulge in the culture and subliminal food, which you will notice are made with fresh ingredients. One of the main ingredients used in various dishes was coconut and this often would reduce the heat factor in curries or anything containing chillies which is great for those that aren’t keen on hot foods.
