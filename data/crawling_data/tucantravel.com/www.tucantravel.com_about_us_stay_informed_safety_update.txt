Safety Updates

At Tucan Travel your safety is our paramount concern. If you have any particular safety concerns about your tour, cruise or travel option, please refer to our FAQs, or contact us.

Zimbabwe - 15 November 2017

We are aware of the political military unrest in Zimbabwe's capital Harare. Our tours do not go here and our itineraries in Zimbabwe have not been affected. We are monitoring the situation closely and liaising with our ground staff to ensure that we are kept up to date with the current situation and we will take any
necessary action to safeguardÂ our clients and crew. If you would like to speak to someone about your tour please contact our Adventure Specialists who will be more than happy to help.

Detailed information about what you can do to keep yourself, and your travelling companions safe on tour is included in our individual country dossiers, and regional pre departure information pages.

General Safety Advice


One of the benefits of travelling with a group is the increased level of safety. However, any travel has risks attached so it is important to
be prepared
to ensure a safe and problem-free trip.

Do your research
about your destination - get a guide book, go online, read our country dossiers and pre departure information. Your country's foreign affairs ministry should also have a website dedicated to keeping travellers safe overseas - this can be a very good source of information, tips and advice.

Sign up for email or SMS
travel alerts
for destinations you'll be travelling for.

Get travel insurance - if you can't afford insurance, you can't afford to travel. Obtaining comprehensive
travel insurance is a mandatory requirement
if travelling with Tucan Travel. Visit our travel insurance page for information about how much cover you need and where you can buy travel insurance. Check your policy carefully and make sure it covers you for all the activities you want to do on your tour.

Make sure you
budget enough for fun and a buffer for emergencies.
Bear in mind you may need a contingency fund for things not covered by your travel insurance.

Make copies of all your travel documents
(passport, vouchers, itineraries, insurance) and leave it at home with someone you trust in case of emergency. Scan the documents and keep electronic copies in a web based email account like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail etc.

You may like to
register your journey
with your local government travel advisory service so they can contact you in case of emergency. This is usually fairly straightforward to do online.

Take a copy of the
emergency contact details
for Tucan Travel, for your joining hotel, local embassies and consulates.

Take care of your health
needs in advance of travel - consider prescriptions, vaccinations, dental care, medical certificates, mosquito repellent, glasses/contact lenses and any other ongoing issues you may need to deal with as you travel.

Avoid all demonstrations and protests
given their potential to turn violent.

Pay close attention to your personal security and
monitor the media for information
about any possible new safety or security risks. Your adventure travel tour leader will always be there to provide advice about your personal safety.

If you are ever in doubt, always
ask for further information from our crew
as they have a wealth of local knowledge at their disposal - take advantage!

Carry a
copy of your passport
with you wherever you go and keep your passport in a safe place, such as a hotel safe at reception.

We advise you to exercise a
reasonable degree of caution
when you travel, in the same way you would anywhere else in the world. You should be aware that all nations have both petty crime and sometimes more serious crime, but you should not be paranoid.

Remember to
be very careful with your personal belongings
(ie: passport, tickets, excess money, iPods etc), and only take them out with you if it is necessary - otherwise you can leave them in the hotel safe deposit box.

If you are venturing out alone,
let someone at your hotel know where you'll be going
and when you can be expected to return.
