Zambia Tours

Our Zambia adventure tours take you to the home of the breathtaking Victoria Falls and the wild Zambezi River. Zambia is the adrenaline capital and adventure playground of Southern Africa. Livingstone, named after the explorer David Livingstone, is just 10 kilometres south of the Victoria Falls and is the perfect place to cast aside your inhibitions with white water rafting (graded 3 to 5) on the lower Zambezi, bungee jumping, river boarding or jet boating. If you prefer a slower paced activity, why not try a game drive, canoeing or a helicopter ride to admire the raging Victoria Falls from above.

Mosi-oa-Tunya, as the Falls are known to local tribes, is a 1,700 metre-wide water sheet that crashes 110 metres into the Zambezi River below, and is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. David Livingstone described his first sight of the Falls as, “scenes so lovely (they) must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight”, a sight you will enjoy on your Zambia adventure tour. Lusaka is Zambia’s capital city and an ideal place to visit a market to soak up the colourful and lively atmosphere. In Chipata, ornate mosques are an unexpected surprise and an ideal last stop to stock up on local crafts to remind you of your Zambia adventure tour.

Zanzibar to Zambezi

There is so much more to Africa than wildlife safaris (although visiting the Masai Mara and Serengeti is a breath-taking experience in itself.) Steve Burke recently came back from our
Zanzibar to Zambezi
adventure and couldn’t wait to share his experience! Read his interview below to get an insider’s knowledge of travelling...

Zambia Travel Guide

Brief history

In the 12th century, the Bantu people settled in what is nowadays  known as Zambia. They were joined in the 17th ,18th  and 19th  centuries  by the Luba and Lundu tribes of Southern Congo and Northern Angola and  the Ngoni people of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.

In 1852-1856, David Livingstone was the first and most famous European explorer to see

“Mosi-o-Tunya” (the smoke that thunders) which he renamed  Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria. The township closest to these falls  in Zambia is named after him.

The country was initially split and known as Northern and Southern  Rhodesia. Northern Rhodesia was controlled by the British from the 19th  century until independence in 1964 when it became known as the Republic  of Zambia. (Southern Rhodesia went on to become Zimbabwe).

Geography and weather

Zambia is a land locked country with borders to eight other  African countries. It has large plains in the west of the country which  flood during the rainy season but consists mostly of high plateaus,  hills and mountains in the rest of the country. The Zambezi River falls a  total of 100 metres over the mile-wide Victoria Falls before flowing into  Lake Kariba.

The climate is tropical  with the  cool, dry 'winter' period being  from May – August. August to mid-November is very hot with  temperatures often sitting at about 40 degrees Celsius before the rains start.  This is the best time to view game if you can cope with high  temperatures and humidity. From November through to the end of April is  the warm, rainy season and away form the touristy areas, many of  Zambia’s roads become impassable during this time.

Visas

Currently EU, US, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand citizens all   need a visa to enter Zambia. It is your own responsibility to check all   visa requirements before travelling and obtain them in advance as   required. For many nationalities visas can be obtained on the borders,   however you should contact the embassy for further information.

Visa services like
www.travcour.com
can be very helpful.

Important: pounds sterling are not accepted at border crossings so bring US dollars cash for any visa expenses at the border.

Visas are valid for three months

Note
: US citizens can only purchase single-entry visas at the border.

Important
: If you are going to buy your visa on arrival at the  airport then a top tip is to try and get a seat as close to the front of  the plane as possible so you get into the arrivals hall and immigration  at the head of the queue. Also, if you intend to visit the Zimbabwe side of Victoria Falls then  you will need to get a double entry visa on arrival in Zambia.

Border Crossings

Into Zambia from Malawi: Mwami
From Zambia into Botswana: Kazungula

Money

Please note
: It can be very difficult to obtain US   dollars in Africa, even in major cities  like Cape Town. Many places   will not accept any notes that are marked,  torn or older than the year   2002, and you may have difficulty exchanging  these notes elsewhere in   Africa, so please check your cash carefully at  the point of purchase.

The monetary unit in Zambia is the Zambian kwacha. For up-to-date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

In general, Visa is the only credit card that will work everywhere in    Africa. Master Card, AMEX and Cirrus will work in some countries but    not in others.

We recommend that you bring cash in US dollars    only. When changing money, it is a good idea if at all possible, to get    small denomination notes and coins in the local currency as often  there   is a lack of change when you are making purchases and no-one in  Africa   ever seems to have change.

Please note that it is not possible to withdraw US dollars from ATMs in Africa, only local currency.

Shopping

Haggling is expected in Zambia and hunting for bargains can be a real  highlight. Your best buys are serpentine stone and hard wooden carvings  as well as hand crafted textiles, hats and of course tee  shirts.Livingstone is expensive as it is such a popular tourist  destination so you will need to bargain hard for your purchases here,  but with persistence and good humour you can still get some good prices.

Tipping

Tipping in restaurants is fast becoming the norm in Livingstone but  again only if you get good service, and no more than 10%. All taxes are  normally included in the menu prices.

Local transport

Taxis are recommended for most journeys in and around Livingstone,  although if you are doing an activity that starts some distance away, a  pick up and drop off is usually included in the price.

Security

Crime is not a great problem in Zambia, but you should still be  careful and not become complacent. Don’t walk around lonely back  streets, especially on your own, don’t wear expensive looking jewellery  or a classy watch and don’t carry a wallet in your back pocket. Don’t  carry your camera openly; always have it in a small day pack which is  firmly attached to your body, preferably in the front in crowded places.  Always wear a money belt or leave your valuables, including your  passport, in the hotel security box. Please remember that at certain  times of year when visiting the Falls, there is a lot of spray and  anything you don’t want to get wet, you will need to put in plastic bags  although make sure that it is not a supermarket bag (usually yellow) as  the baboons will  think that there is food in it and will try and  snatch it!

Photography

Caution should be taken when taking photos in and around the city.   Locals should always be asked prior to taking a photo and it is not   uncommon for them to ask for a small donation. Never take photos of   police, military personal or buildings. The same goes for any government   buildings, banks, post offices or the railway station.

Local food and drink

Most meals are included when camping and lunch is usually included on  travelling days in the truck. When staying in hotels or hostels, all  meals are at your own expense.

Your tour leader will be able to recommend restaurants.

Nsima and Relish is the staple in most areas of Zambia. Nsima is the  same maize flour that you find everywhere in Africa and is prepared in  the same way as well. Relish is normally made from tomato and onion but  other veg such as beans or peas etc will be added if available.  Sometimes beef or goat meat will be also  be added to the relish as well  so be aware if you are vegetarian.

In the larger towns bbq chicken, Russian sausages and meat pies are  all popular takeaways. In Lusaka and Livingstone there are western style  takeaways, bars and restaurants including Indian and Chinese.

If you are a strict vegetarian you may experience a distinct lack of     variety in the food available, especially in small towns. You might    find  that you are eating a lot of omelettes and other egg dishes. Our    tour  leaders will do their best to provide interesting vegetarian     alternatives when arranging group meals in the campsite, but your     patience and understanding is requested.

All drinks such as water, soft or alcoholic drinks are at your own    expense at all times.

(All glass bottles taken away from shops in Zambia will have a deposit added on which varies.)

You should be wary of drinking the local tap water. Bottled water,    carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices are widely available and are    generally safe to drink. Please note however that fruit juices are    sometimes made with un-boiled tap water and could upset your stomach.

There are various brands of beers found only in Zambia including  Mosi, Castle and Rhino lager. All of the campsites / hostels that we use  have bars or serve alcoholic drinks. If you want to venture into town  there are plenty of bars and restaurants to cater to everyone’s taste  but beware imported spirit prices as they are very expensive so always  ask for the local equivalent spirit if you want to remain within your  budget!
