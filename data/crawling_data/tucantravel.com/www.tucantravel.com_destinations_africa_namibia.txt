Namibia Tours




Our Namibia adventure tours take in all the highlights of this vast desolate country which offers an amazing array of things to see and do. Etosha National Park, one of Africa's largest wildlife sanctuaries, is dominated by a vast white shimmering salt pan. Africa's familiar ‘big 5’ of lions, leopards, elephants, buffalos and rhinos can be seen and the park is one of the best places in Africa to spot cheetah and the endangered black rhino. At Kamanjab we visit the famous Otjitotongwe Cheetah Park, where you'll have the chance to get up close and personal with these beautiful animals.

Swakopmund is an historic German colonial town surrounded by desert which is situated on the Atlantic Ocean coast and has a range of optional excursions, such as sandboarding, quadbiking, tandem skydiving, game fishing and many more. Cape Cross has a large colony of around 100,000 Cape Cross fur seals. Our Namibia adventure tours also enjoy a scenic drive on our overland truck through some beautiful mountainous areas and through the Namib-Naukluft National Park, famous for its giant sand dunes, on our way to Seseriem Canyon. Fish River Canyon, one of the world's largest, is also seen on a Namibia adventure tour.

Namibia Travel Articles, Inspiration & Information






Why Travel? Four Reasons to Go

Why travel the world? Tucan Traveller, Mark Douglas toured with us through Africa. His short article contains some of the main reasons why you should go on that adventure you're yearning for.  It’s only in recent times that people are coming around to the idea that you don’t have to wait until you’re ‘a responsible adult’ to travel far and wide..

The Namib Desert: A highlight of Namibia

One of my favourite places on Planet Earth is the Namib desert, and its highlight is a visit to Dune 45 and Deadvlei.  I am a keen photographer and the colours this desert gives you makes it easy for everyone to get an impressive shot, the red dunes, the blue skies ,and in Dead Vlei the beautiful silhouettes of the Camel thorn trees...

Sunrise over the Namib Desert

Working at Tucan Travel, I have been fortunate to see many countries but Namibia definitely has to be one of my favourites. It is packed full of wonderful things to see and do. One of the best places we visit on our journey from Victoria Falls to Cape Town along the Western coastline of Namibia is Sesriem.

Namibia Travel Guide

Brief history

Namibia was initially inhabited by the San (or Basarwa) Bushmen who communicate by clicking tongues; the Damara and Namaqua and later the Bantu when their expansion reached the area. Europeans did not arrive until the 19th century and Namibia was then South West Africa. The Germans controlled all of what is now Namibia (apart from Walvis Bay which was under British control until 1994) until South Africa administered rule during both world wars up to independence in 1990.

Geography and weather

After Mongolia, Namibia is the least densely populated country in the world with an average of 2.5 people per square kilometre. It shares the Kalahari Desert with Botswana and South Africa and also has the Namib Desert which stretches along the entire coastline, making the majority of the country very dry, hot and arid. The Skeleton Coast is a part of this area, so called due to the many shipwrecks that lie littered inland in the desert caused by the inhospitable conditions and dangerous coastline of this area.

Through the centre of the country runs the central plateau reaching a height of just over 2,500 metres and is where the capital Windhoek is to be found. This is also where almost all of the agriculture of the country is found.

In the north east of the country is the bushveld - the area where the most rain occurs and the temperatures are much less severe. Adjacent to this is the Etosha Pan – home to the national park of the same name. For the most part of the year, it is a dry saline wasteland with a few watering holes dotted around its vast area that the animals must visit to stay alive – thus providing excellent game viewing opportunities. However, during the wet season (November to April with the main rains starting in January) it becomes a huge shallow lake of over 6000 square kms. At this time, it can also be almost unbearably hot and humid.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

Currently EU, US, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand citizens do not need a visa to enter Namibia. However, it is your own responsibility to check all visa requirements before travelling.

It is compulsory for all visitors to Namibia to have at least two blank pages in their passport for entry/departure endorsements by the Namibian Immigration Service. Travellers who are arriving overland from South Africa will also require two blank pages for their South African entry and exit. Please check your passport before travel to ensure that you can meet these requirements.

Visa services like
www.travcour.com
can be very helpful.

Important: pounds sterling are not accepted at border crossings so bring US dollars cash for any visa expenses at the border.

Money

The monetary unit in Namibia is the Namibian dollar. For up-to-date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

In general, Visa is the only credit card that will work everywhere in Africa. Master Card, AMEX and Cirrus will work in some countries but not in others.

On arrival at Windhoek International Airport we suggest that you withdraw some Namibian dollars at the ATM or change some money at the bank if you only have US dollars or travellers cheques. Change enough money to see you through the first few days of your trip – particularly if it is a weekend.

We recommend that you bring cash in US dollars only. When changing money, it is a good idea if at all possible, to get small denomination notes and coins in the local currency as often there is a lack of change when you are making purchases and no-one in Africa ever seems to have change.

Please note that it is not possible to withdraw US dollars from ATMs in Africa, only local currency.

Tipping

Service charges and local taxes are almost always included but a tip for good service of around 10% is common practice.

Security

Crime is not a great problem in Namibia, but you should still be careful and not become complacent. Don’t walk around lonely back streets, especially on your own, don’t wear expensive looking jewellery or a classy watch and don’t carry a wallet in your back pocket. Don’t carry your camera openly; always have it in a small day pack which is firmly attached to your body, preferably in the front in crowded places. Always wear a money belt or leave your valuables, including your passport, in the hostel / campsite security box.

Photography

Caution should be taken when taking photos in and around the towns and cities. Locals should always be asked prior to taking a photo and it is not uncommon for them to ask for a small donation. Never take photos of police, military personal or buildings. The same goes for any government buildings, banks, post offices or the railway station.

Local food and drink

Most meals are included when camping and lunch is usually included on travelling days in the truck. When staying in hotels or hostels, all meals are at your own expense. Your tour leader will be able to recommend restaurants.

In the villages and rural areas, the food differs little to that found in Botswana. Traditional food includes porridge and a soup made from cornmeal, millet or cassava, supplemented by fish or meat. This together with stew, vegetables and milk products make up the staple diet. However once you leave the rural areas the similarity stops. In the larger cities and towns such as Windhoek and especially Swakopmund, there is a definite Germanic flavour to the menu. German style bakeries, restaurants and bars are common and dishes such as Eisbien (roasted pork shank) with dumplings and sauerkraut will be sure to fill the emptiest of stomachs.

When on the coast seafood is the main thing on the menu and is very good. The fresh oysters and mussels when in season are delicious and a wide selection of fresh fish is available all year round. A couple of locally found line fish are Kabeljou and Steenbras both of which are worth keeping an eye out for. Game meat makes a regular appearance on the menus in large towns and cities with ostrich as well as Kudu and Eland all being very good.

If you are a strict vegetarian you may experience a distinct lack of variety in the food available, especially in small towns. You might find that you are eating a lot of omelettes and other egg dishes. Our tour leaders will do their best to provide interesting vegetarian alternatives when arranging group meals in the campsite, but your patience and understanding is requested.

All drinks such as water, soft or alcoholic drinks are at your own expense at all times. There is no deposit on bottles in Namibia.

You should be wary of drinking the local tap water. Bottled water, carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices are widely available and are generally safe to drink. Please note however that fruit juices are sometimes made with un-boiled tap water and could upset your stomach.

There are various brands of beers found only in Namibia including Windhoek, Tafel and Holsten. Most of the campsites / hostels that we use have bars or serve alcoholic drinks. If there is not a bar in the campsite / hostel then there is sure to be one within walking distance. Beware imported spirit prices as they are very expensive so always ask for the local equivalent spirit if you want to remain within your budget!
