Chiang Mai Tours

The historic walled city of Chiang Mai, known as the 'Rose of the North', has recently become a popular tourist destination. Those undertaking tours in Chiang Mai will experience the city's beautiful scenery, extremely friendly people and incredible food. There are mountains, forests, national parks and waterfalls in abundance.

With just 170,000 people living in the city, it presents those on Chiang Mai tours with authentic Thai experience which is very different from Bangkok. With more than 300 temples, it is the mystical capital of the North, surrounded by mountains filled with remote and historical ruins and colourful wildlife. Located on the Ping River, Chiang Mai is the former capital of the Kingdom of Lanna, resulting in the unusual and intricate architecture that decorates many of this city's buildings. The famous Night Bazaar is the most popular tourist attraction within the city walls.

Misty hills, local tribes and ancient temples

Our tours in Chiang Mai offer plenty to do on the outskirts of the city. On a clear day, Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep Temple is visible from the city. This gold-plated chedi, which is a cable car or short hike away, offers magnificent views of the city. You can also visit the beautiful Chiang Dao caves, with their amazing limestone stalactites and stalagmites, and trek through the jungle to visit local hill tribes that have lived traditionally for hundreds of years in this remote corner of Northern Thailand.

Food. Mmmmmm!

Chiang Mai is also the learning capital of Thailand with classes available in many aspects of Thai culture including Buddhism, Thai massage and cooking. In a country famous for its delicious and varied cuisine, Chiang Mai stands out as a city renowned for its sumptuous dishes. A Chiang Mai tour offers the best chance you will have to learn to make some local dishes, so why not team up with a local chef and head to the markets to pick out some fresh ingredients that you will use in your cooking class that day? During a class you may be taught some of the local secrets and, best yet, you get to enjoy the fruits of your labour for lunch!
