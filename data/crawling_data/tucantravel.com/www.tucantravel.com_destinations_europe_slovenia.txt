Slovenia Tours

Set deep in the heart of Central Europe, our Slovenia adventure tours will show you a country blessed with natural beauty, from its mighty alpine peaks, stunning lakes to lush rolling farmlands, plains covered in sunflowers, grapevines strung across the fields and vast forests which cover 60% of the country. Bordered by Italy, Austria, Hungary, Croatia and the Adriatic Sea, Slovenia is seen by many as a miniature version of Europe.

Enjoy the capital Ljubljana on a Slovenia adventure tour which has a large student population and benefits from a young, fun vibe and popular culture, which provide a vibrant contrast to the Old Town in the historical centre. Highlights of the city include Križanke or French Revolution Square, Tivoli Park, Ljubljana City Museum, Ljubljana Castle (Ljubljanski Grad) on Castle Hill and the Viewing Tower in the castle courtyard for views across the Old Town. Ljubljana also features lovely promenades where you can enjoy the views from a café and take a stroll along the river, lined with willow trees. During a Slovenia adventure tour you can explore the picturesque town of Bled, about an hour from Ljubljana, set near an emerald green lake. Perched on a cliff high above the lake on a bluff is the Bled Castle, dramatically framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Julian Alps.

Slovenia Travel Articles, Inspiration & Information






Feeling at peace in Lake Bled

‘After you’ve finished we can take a pletna out to Bled Island.’ She said smiling.
‘There’s no rush is there?’ I replied, snapping out of my reverie.
‘No, no. You savour your kremna rezina. No-one rushes at Lake Bled.’
I skewered another piece of delicate pastry on the end of my fork and gestured towards the lake.
‘So those boats are called pletnas?’
‘Yes, think of them as the gondola of Slovenia. Just like Venice, no?’
‘They’re larger than gondola’s though.’
‘They’re cheaper too.’ She laughed..

Slovenia Travel Guide

Brief history

Slovenia was part of the Holy Roman Empire and then the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918,  when the Slovenes joined the Serbs and Croats in forming a new  multinational state, renamed Yugoslavia. After World War II, Slovenia  became a republic of the renewed Yugoslavia, and although Communist,  distanced itself from Moscow's rule. The Slovenes succeeded in  establishing their independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 after a short 10-day war.  Historical ties to Western Europe, a strong economy, and a stable  democracy have assisted in Slovenia's transformation to a modern state.  Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the EU in the spring of 2004.

Geography and weather

Slovenia is wedged between Austria and Croatia.  Often refered to as a microcosim of European geography as a whole, the geography varies from a short coastal strip on the Adriatic, an  alpine mountain region adjacent to Italy and Austria and mixed mountains  and valleys with numerous rivers to the east. Slovenia experiences a  Mediterranean climate on the coast and a continental climate with mild  to hot summers and cold winters in the plateaus and valleys to the east.

Our tours mostly operate from late spring (April/May) to early Autumn   (in Eastern Europe) when the weather is generally at its best.    Temperatures will vary but will still be cool in April/May and again in   October.  The warmest months tend to be July/August.  The further south   you are the higher the average temperatures. You can expect snow from   December to late March.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

Many nationalities (including citizens of the UK, Australia, Canada,  the US and most of continental Europe) do not need a visa to enter Slovenia. However, visitors must hold an onward ticket, all  documents required for their next destination and sufficient funds. If  your nationality is not listed please consult your nearest Slovenian embassy or consulate before you travel.

Money

Slovenia is in the euro zone. For up  to date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

Changing money, credit cards & ATMs

The easiest way to obtain money in Slovenia is to draw it  out of an ATM (cash machine) on a credit or debit card (e.g. visa or  cirrus). ATMs are widely available throughout Eastern Europe and credit  cards are accepted in many restaurants and shops. Another option is to  bring cash in euros but we advise against  bringing all your money in this form, in case of theft.

Tipping

In a restaurant, round up the bill unless a service charge has  already been added or the service was not up to standard. You should  also round up bar bills and taxi fares. In Slovenia tipping is not  compulsory, but a 10% gratuity in restaurants will always be  appreciated.

Security

Generally people find Eastern Europe to be safe and feel confident   wandering alone during the day.  However if you are unfamiliar with an   area it is recommended that you exercise more caution at night and taxi   taxis rather than walk, especially if you are a lone female traveller.    In some cities bag snatching can occur so always keep a firm hand/eye  on  your personal items.

Local food and drink

In Slovenia food is heavily based on fish, venison and the dumpling  although popular everyday dishes also include cabbage, beans and  potatoes. Every Slovenian region has its own various types of bread.  Traditional dishes are best tried at an inn (gostilna).

Slovenia has been making wine since the time of the Romans, and it now produces many high quality varieties.

All drinks such as bottled water or soft drinks are at your own  expense at all times and are fairly inexpensive. Alcoholic drinks vary  in price, with wine and beer generally being the cheapest options. The  legal drinking age is 18.
