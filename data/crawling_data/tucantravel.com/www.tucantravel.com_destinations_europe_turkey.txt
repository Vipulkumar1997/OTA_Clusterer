Turkey Tours

Straddling two continents, Turkey offers a fascinating blend of European and Asian cultures. Steeped in Christian and Islamic history and shining with modern energy, our Turkey adventure tours offer access to some of the world’s most important ancient monuments and historic sites as well as some of the most exciting contemporary cities. You will also be able to discover the poignant Anzac battlefields of the Gallipoli Peninsula rank among the many highlights of a Turkey adventure tour. Cosmopolitan Istanbul is the jewel in the crown, numbering the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, the Church of Divine Wisdom, Sultanahmet mosque and Topkapi Palace among its star attractions.

When you need to unwind and be pampered during your Turkey adventure tour, find a hamam and enjoy a massage, take a relaxing cruise on the Bosphorous or dip your toes in the Mediterranean Sea on the Turquoise Coast where you’ll also find some fantastic nightlife. Of course a Turkey adventure tour will also show you the country’s warm hospitality and one of the world’s most aromatic cuisines.

Turkey Travel Guide

Brief history

Present-day Turkey was created in 1923 from the Turkish remnants of  the Ottoman Empire. In 1945 Turkey joined the UN, and in 1952 it became a  member of NATO. Turkey intervened militarily on Cyprus in 1974 to  protect Turkish Cypriots and prevent a Greek takeover of the island; the  northern 37 percent of the island remains under Turkish Cypriot  control. Relations between Turkey and Greece have improved greatly  over the past few years. Politically, modern Turkey was almost entirely  the creation of one man, Mustafa Ataturk.

Geography and weather

Turkey has borders with Greece, Bulgaria, Armenia, Georgia, Iran,  Iraq and Syria with easy land and sea access to the Gulf States, Levant  and North Africa. It is the ninth largest country in the Middle East and  the third largest in Europe. Turkey only consists of 23,000 sq. km in  Europe: the remainder is in Asia. The Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorus  and Dardanelles straits separate the European (Thrace) and Asian  (Anatolian) parts of Turkey. Anatolia is a high plateau region, rising  progressively towards the east and broken by the valleys of some 15  rivers, including the Tigris and the Euphrates. There are numerous lakes  including Lake Van, which is really an inland sea. In the north the  chain of the Ponitine Mountains runs parallel to the Black Sea; in the  south, the Taurus Mountains almost touch the narrow, fertile coastal  plain. The climate is temperate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet  winters (harsher in interior).

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

Most nationalities (including citizens of the UK, Australia, Canada  and the US) need a visa to enter Turkey. Citizens of these countries must  obtain an electronic visa before arriving in Turkey which is valid for three months. The costs of the visa varies. Citizens of New Zealand  currently are not required to purchase a visa on entry. We recommend you contact your local  Turkish embassy or consulate near to your planned date of travel to  obtain the latest information on your specific requirements.

Visa services like
www.travcour.com
can be very helpful.

Money

The monetary unit in Turkey is the lira, TL. For up  to date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

Changing money, credit cards & ATMs

Rates for foreign currency are always better inside Turkey. Private exchange offices have competitive rates and no  commission. Banks are generally open Monday – Friday 8.30am – noon and  1.30pm -5pm. Most charge a commission of US$2.50 for travellers cheques. ATMs are widely available in cities.

Tipping

Many workers in Turkey are poorly paid and depend on tips for their  main income. As tips are a normal part of everyday culture in Turkey we  operate a compulsory tipping kitty to save you money and embarrassment.  Each member of the group contributes to the kitty (approx US$15 per  person per week) and this is then used to pay tips to any people who  provide services to the group as a whole e.g. guides, porters, drivers,  housekeeping staff in hotels etc.

Except at the cheapest restaurants, a 10%-15% charge is added to the  bill. As the money does not necessarily find its way to the waiter, you  may want to leave an additional 10% on the table or hand it to the  waiter.

Local transport

In Istanbul many of the sights are within walking distance of each  other and the best way to get to know the area is on foot. However, it’s  easy and relatively cheap to jump in a taxi and criss-crossing the Bosporus by ferry is great fun.

Security

Most people find that Turkey is a safe and friendly country but as in any foreign place you should exercise a reasonable degree of caution. Don’t walk around lonely back streets at night (particularly in Istanbul), don’t wear expensive looking jewellery or a classy watch and don’t carry a wallet in your     back pocket. Don’t carry your camera openly; always have it in a small day pack which is firmly attached to your body, preferably in the  front    in crowded places. Take particular care not to become too  relaxed if   you  have had a few drinks and are returning to your hotel  at night –  it  is  best to always take a taxi. Always wear a money belt  or leave  your   valuables, including your passport, in the hotel  security box.

Local food and drink

Lots of tasty treats are available in Turkey. Snacks include borek or  poca (small pastries filled with meat, cheese or potato) sold from  snack carts in the street, also simit (sesame-seed bread rings). Other  snacks are lahmacun (small pizzas with meat based toppings) and in  coastal cities midye tave (deep fried mussels). Main meals include  several variations of the kebab, fish and seafood are good, but usually  pricey and sold by the weight rather than by the item. Most budget  restaurants are alcohol free. A useful exception is a meyhane (tavern)  which usually serves mezes, an extensive array of cold appetisers as  well as grilled kebabs and fish. Most common mezes are dolma (pepper or  vine leaves stuffed with rice) and patlican salata (aubergine in tomato  sauce). The best dessert is undoubtedly the honey soaked baklava.  Turkish delight - solidified sugar and pectin, flavoured with rose water  or pistachios, and sprinkled with powdered sugar - is another popular  sweet.

Drink

All drinks such as bottled water or soft drinks are at your own expense at all times and are fairly inexpensive. Water from a tap or well should not be considered safe to drink. Bottled water, carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices are widely available throughout the     country. Alcoholic drinks vary in price, with beer generally being the cheapest option.

1l of water - $0.50
30cl bottle of soft drink - $0.50-$1
40cl bottle of beer - $2-$3

Turkish coffee is served in tiny cups, and can be very strong. The same can be said for the tea (chai) which is served in delightful tulip-shaped glassesThe  local firewater is anis-flavoured raki, stronger than Greek Ouzo.  Alcoholic drinks are available in most places, but in smaller towns it  is not as widely obtainable.
