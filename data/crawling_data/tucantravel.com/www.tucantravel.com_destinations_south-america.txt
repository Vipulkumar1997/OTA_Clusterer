South America Adventure Tours

With group tours and trips to over 10 destinations in South America, discover everything from the atmosphere at Rio Carnival to the calm on the Uyuni Salt Flats. A highlight is the Inca Trek to Machu Picchu - not to be missed!

South America is filled with mystery, tradition and outdoor adventures in abundance. Explore ancient Inca ruins, hike the challenging Inca Trail, view the Nazca Lines, meet local people in rural villages and bargain for hand-made crafts in bustling markets. Over such a large continent, there is so much to see from the windswept national parks of Patagonia, only accessible in winter to the tropical beaches of Colombia which bask in warmth year round. Nature lovers will thrill at the diversity of wildlife in the Amazon Jungle, Pantanal wetlands, the Galápagos Islands, Los Llanos plains, Colca Canyon and Lake Titicaca, not forgetting the national parks of Patagonia. Colonial Spanish towns are nestled deep in the mountains while Inca ruins sit on the beaches. The great white continent of Antarctica is considered the last frontier of travel by many adventure seekers. We offer group tours in South America or you can create your own adventure with our Tailor-made tours.



Why do a group tour in South America with Tucan Travel?



We have over 30 years experience

That's right! Our first group tour departed from Bogota, Colombia in 1987. The decades of experience has allowed us to carve out the most efficient routes and find the best activities the continent has to offer



No Compulsory Single Supplements

There are no extra costs on any of our most popular group tours in South America so South America is the perfect place to travel solo with us. You will be sharing with another traveller of the same gender, looking for similar experiences as you.



We have two offices in Peru!

After 30 years operating tours in South America, we stopped being content with just one office in Peru but opened up our second. This means that you will be in the safest of hands on your journey through South America as there is always an office-based staff member close at hand.



Travel for as little or as long as you like

In South America, our tours range from 6 to 76 days long. Many of our short tours can be combined to form longer sections and with other travellers always joining you on your adventure, your tour will be filled with constant surprises.



Trips created by travellers

Each one of our tours has been designed by people with extensive knowledge of South America and the trips are often improved and tweaked to keep them fresh. Our staff are also some of the most passionate adventure travellers around and can answer questions on all things South America.
