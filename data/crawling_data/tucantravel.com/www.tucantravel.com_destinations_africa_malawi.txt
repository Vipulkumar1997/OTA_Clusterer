Malawi Tours

Our Malawi adventure tours take in the splendour of Lake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa, a freshwater lake about 560 kilometres long and 75 kilometres wide covering 25% of Malawi’s land area. A great place to visit is Kande, one of the many beautiful beaches situated along Lake Malawi’s stunning shoreline.

There is a lively atmosphere here and with Kande Beach being one of the big overland tour havens, you will likely be in for a party or two! Enjoy options like diving, snorkelling, windsurfing, kayaking, swimming and horse riding but if you’d prefer to just relax in the sun, the velvety-smooth beach is a perfect spot for sunbathing. You can also visit nearby local villages which are famous for their markets and traditional woodcarvings. Our Malawi adventure tours also visit the small lakeside camp of Chitimba where you can choose to go on a range of fun optional excursions such as abseiling and hiking in the mountains in the beautiful area near Livingstonia. Why not enjoy an included visit to a local village, where you enjoy the friendliness of the people who gave Malawi its reputation as the ‘warm heart of Africa’.

Malawi Travel Guide



Travel Guide



Malawi Travel Guide

Brief history

Malawi was first settled in the 10th century by Bantus that come down from the north. Prior to this it was home to a small number of hunter-gatherer communities. The British colonised the country (then called Nyasaland - named after what was then called Lake Nyasa and today is known as Lake Malawi) in 1891 and ruled until Malawi gained its independence in 1964.

Geography and weather

Landlocked between Zambia, Tanzania and Mozambique, Malawi's significant geographic features are the wonderful Lake Malawi (sometimes called the calendar lake becuase it is roughly 365 miles long and 52 miles wide) and the Great Rift Valley which runs through the country from north to south. The mountainous highlands surround the Rift Valley and can reach 1,200 metres above sea level.

The climate is generally hot in the lower-lying areas, while more temperate up in the highlands. Between November and April is the rainy season, with heavy rain and thunderstorms. From May to September there is almost no rain.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

Currently nationals from most Western countries do not require a visa to enter Malawi.

See visa services like
www.travcour.com
for more details about which countries require a visa.

Money

The monetary unit in Malawi is the Malawian kwacha. For up-to-date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

US dollars are accepted for most purchases in Malawi, particularly large purchases.

In general, Visa is the only credit card that will work everywhere in Africa.

We recommend that you bring cash in US dollars only. When changing money, it is a good idea if at all possible, to get small denomination notes and coins in the local currency as often there is a lack of change when you are making purchases and no-one in Africa ever seems to have change.

ATMs are becoming increasingly common.

Please note that it is not possible to withdraw US dollars from ATMs in Africa, only local currency.

Tipping

Service charges and local taxes are almost always included but a tip for good service of around 10% is common practice.

Security

Crime is not a great problem in Malawi, but you should still be careful and not become complacent. Don’t walk around lonely back streets, especially on your own, don’t wear expensive looking jewellery or a classy watch and don’t carry a wallet in your back pocket. Don’t carry your camera openly; always have it in a small day pack which is firmly attached to your body, preferably in the front in crowded places. Always wear a money belt or leave your valuables, including your passport, in the hostel / campsite security box.

Photography

Caution should be taken when taking photos in and around the towns and cities. Locals should always be asked prior to taking a photo and it is not uncommon for them to ask for a small donation. Never take photos of police, military personal or buildings. The same goes for any government buildings, banks, post offices or the railway station.

Local food and drink

Most meals are included when camping and lunch is usually included on travelling days in the truck. When staying in hotels or hostels, all meals are at your own expense.

Your tour leader will be able to recommend restaurants.

Traditional Malawian food revolves around maize (corn) based 'nsim.' This is basically a type of thick porridge, which you roll into balls and dipped in a variety of stews called 'relishes'. For those who can afford meat they will make their relishes with beef chicken of fish. Otherwise it consists of mainly beans and other vegetables, including pumkin leaves.

If you are a strict vegetarian you may experience a distinct lack of variety in the food available, especially in small towns. You might find that you are eating a lot of omelettes and other egg dishes. Our tour leaders will do their best to provide interesting vegetarian alternatives when arranging group meals in the campsite, but your patience and understanding is requested.

All drinks such as water, soft or alcoholic drinks are at your own expense at all times.

You should be wary of drinking the local tap water. Bottled water, carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices are widely available and are generally safe to drink. Please note however that fruit juices are sometimes made with un-boiled tap water and could upset your stomach.

There are few brands of beers found in Malawi and are all brewed by Calsberg.
