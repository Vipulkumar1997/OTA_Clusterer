Golden Triangle Tours

Our tours in South East Asia are highly recommended for tourists and travellers wanting to discover this remote and undiscovered region, which was originally a site for opium production. The name Golden Triangle refers to the meeting point of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos. It is an area of the world, not to be confused with the Golden Triangle in India which refers to Delhi, Agra and Jaipur, that stands out for its idyllic beauty and authentic way of life.

Discover the Golden Triangle with Tucan Travel and explore the dense and tropical jungles where the Mekong River meets the Ruak River. Once only permeable by elephants or boats, this was the perfect cover for the growth of the world’s supply of poppies. Now with production shifted to Afghanistan, Golden Triangle tours fascinate travellers, especially as the communities in this vast expanse of land have grown up with poppy production.

Those lucky enough to experience the Golden Triangle on a tour will marvel at the giant golden Buddha and the stone elephants – some paying a small fee to climb on top for their photos to be taken. For a more cultural experience, some passing through the region visit the old Opium Museum to understand this region's destructive but fascinating history.

To reach the region, most travellers enter from the Thailand side, with the nearest town being Chiang Rai. With a selection of beautiful temples and magnificent views over the city and with waterfalls and hot springs nearby, taking the Golden Triangle tour with Tucan Travel is an excellent opportunity to relax and explore South-East Asia.
