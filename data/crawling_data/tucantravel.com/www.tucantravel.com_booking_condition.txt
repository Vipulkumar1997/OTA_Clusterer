Booking Conditions










Booking Conditions

Tucan Travel accepts bookings subject to the following conditions:

1. Your Contract with Tucan Travel











a) Terminology

A Component refers to any one of the following: Group Tour, Tailor-made Tour, Cruises to the Galapagos and Antarctica or Extra Services (pre and post tour hotels or transfers; additional flights; excursions; I’d like my own room; supplements etc.). A Package refers to any one or more of the above listed Components.

i) Deposits

For Group Tours:

Up to 27 days per person per tour: CHF500

28 days or more per person per tour: CHF1000

For cruises to the Galapagos Islands and Antarctica per person:

30% of total booking amount or a minimum spend / deposit of: CHF1000

For Tailor-made Tours per person:

30% of total booking amount or a minimum spend / deposit of: CHF1900

For Excursions:

Gorilla Trek, Inca Trail Trek, Lares Trek, Train to Machu Picchu, Amazon Jungle in Peru (if optional) per person: CHF400

ii) Full Payment

Required within 60 days of departure. This increases to 90 days for cruises to the Galapagos and Antarctica or Tailor-made Tours however during high seasons or high occupancy this deadline may be brought forward even after you have booked.

iii) Local Payment

Required in "USD cash only" in full on the Component departure date as advertised on our website.

iv) Supplement

Lares Trek for solo person booking within 60 days: CHF600

v) Charges

A change of departure date and/or Component per person per Component: CHF125. See Clause 3a.

A change to Extra Services per booking: CHF65. Extra Services may be added up to 30 days before departure without charge if available.

c) Flights

All flights purchased in addition to or in conjunction with any Component must be paid in full at the time of booking and are non-refundable.

d) Contract

The contract is made between Tucan Ltd in the United Kingdom trading as Tucan Travel (hereinafter "Tucan Travel"- for details, see Clause 20) and the client, being all persons named on the booking as travelling or intending to travel through Tucan Travel. The person making the booking (which is subject to these terms) warrants that they have full authority to do so on behalf of all persons named, and confirms that all such persons are fully aware of and accept these conditions.

To secure a booking and contract, Tucan Travel requires a non-refundable deposit or full payment as required priced as above per person per Component. This payment is deemed to be confirmation that the client has read and accepts the Tucan Travel booking conditions. Clients booking through a travel agent or telephone, email or online will be deemed to have read the booking conditions and accepted them. A booking is confirmed when Tucan Travel issues an invoice. Errors or omissions on the invoice may be subsequently amended after advising the client in writing and Tucan Travel reserves the right to decline any booking at our discretion. The contract is subject to and governed by English law. Any claim, dispute or other matter arising from or in connection with the contract shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.

2. Payment of Components

The balance of all monies due, including any surcharges applicable at that time, must be paid according to Clause 1b. In the case of non-payment of the balance by the due date, Tucan Travel will treat the booking as cancelled by the client and apply the appropriate cancellation charges.

Local Payment plus any local surcharges must be paid on Day 1 in "USD cash only" in the destination of travel or as instructed in the documentation or by local staff. Failure to pay will result in the client being excluded from the Component without refund. These payments are non-refundable for any unused elements of the Component. Refer to Clause 6 for further details.

Monies paid to a travel agent are held on behalf of Tucan Travel who is bound by these booking conditions in full.

3. Changes

a) Changes by You

Any request by the client to change from one Component to another or change the departure date of their chosen Component must be made in writing by the person who made the original booking. The Client will forgo any previous price promotions they may have attained when making the new booking. The new Component price will be based on the current published price found on our website on the date the change was requested. The client may qualify for current price promotions should they apply. Administration Charges as in Clause 1b will apply and any additional deposits. Should the change be requested once full payment is due, cancellation charges apply as in Clause 4.

b) Changes by Us

While Tucan Travel will use its best endeavours to operate all Components as advertised, by entering into this contract the client accepts that it may prove necessary or advisable to vary or modify a Component itinerary or its contents due to prevailing local conditions. Tucan Travel reserves the right at any time either before or during a Component to cancel or change any of the facilities, services or prices described (including flights, transport, accommodation or other arrangements) and to substitute alternative arrangements of comparable monetary value without compensation and accepts no liability for loss of enjoyment as a result of these changes. Occasionally, Group Tours clients may be separated into different transport and hotels depending on local conditions and availability at the time of booking.

Some Components are operated by trusted partners on our behalf while Components in Iceland, China, Morocco, North America and some in Romania and Bulgaria are operated by trusted tour operators and are not branded as Tucan Travel. You will be notified of the trusted tour operator with final documentation approximately 30 days before the departure date. The Tucan Travel booking conditions still apply.

If a major change is known to us, the client will be told at the time of booking. If a major change becomes necessary, Tucan Travel will inform the client as soon as reasonably possible if there is time before departure. The definition of a major change will depend on the individual Component and circumstances and is at the sole discretion of Tucan Travel. When a major change is made the client will have the choice of accepting the change of arrangements, or within seven days of notification of the change, purchasing another available Component or cancelling the Component and obtaining a full refund, provided that the major change is not because of Force Majeure.

Force Majeure is war, threat of war, terrorist activity, riot, civil strife or industrial dispute; natural or nuclear disaster, disease, fire or adverse road, river or weather conditions; technical, maintenance or compliance problems with local transport or Tucan Travel vehicles; changes imposed by cancellation or rescheduling of flights by an airline or main charterer, the alteration of airline or aircraft type; or any other similar events beyond the control of Tucan Travel. Tucan Travel is not liable for any penalty charges associated with non-refundable airfares, in the event of a change to a Component departure time, date or airport. All costs incurred due to Force Majeure, such as transport, communication, accommodation, food or other similar items will be passed to the client by way of local surcharges. See Clause 6.

4. Cancellation

a) Cancellation by You

The client may cancel the booking at any time provided that the cancellation is communicated to Tucan Travel in writing even if verbal notification of an intention to cancel has been given. Cancellation charges will be applied as shown below calculated from the day written notification is received. Cancellation charges are in addition to any insurance, flight or similar service provided plus any additional charges in Clauses 1 & 6. If the reason for cancellation is covered by your insurance policy, you may be able to reclaim these charges. No refunds will be made for any services not utilised.

The date used for calculating cancellation charges is the date from which the first Component within the Package commences regardless of the number of Components.

Group Tours or Extra Services;


60 days or more: forfeit of all deposits.

59 - 28 days: 50% of total cost.

27 days or less: 100% of full payment.


Cruises to the Galapagos and Antarctica or Tailor-made Tours;


90 days or more or as advised in Clause 1b: forfeit of all deposits.

89 days or less: 100% of full payment.


b) Cancellation by Us

Tucan Travel reserves the right to cancel a Component in any circumstances but, except for Force Majeure or the client’s failure to pay the final balance or one of the conditions detailed in Clause 5, will not cancel a Component less than 28 days before departure. Unless the client fails to pay the final balance Tucan Travel will, upon cancellation, return all monies paid excluding payment for travel insurance, flights, similar services and administration charges or offer an alternative Component of comparable standard.

5. Guaranteed Departures and Minimum Numbers

Tucan Travel sets its own minimum numbers for Group Tours based on logistics and will operate tours once minimum numbers have been reached. A number of departure dates are guaranteed to depart and will generally operate regardless of whether minimum numbers have been achieved unless it is for safety or operational reasons. Where minimum numbers have not been achieved, Tucan Travel may choose to either operate the Group Tour or cancel the Group Tour and pay compensation to the client as follows:


If cancelling more than 28 days before departure: A full refund of monies paid but no further compensation.

If cancelling between 27 - 14 days before departure: A full refund of monies paid and a 5% discount on the current price published online (excluding Local Payment) of a similar replacement Group Tour (see below).

If cancelling within 13 days of departure: A full refund of monies paid and a 10% discount on the current price published online (excluding Local Payment) of a similar replacement Group Tour (see below).


Notes: Refunds and discounts referred to here apply only to Group Tours cancelled within 28 days as a result of failure to achieve minimum numbers. A replacement may be any Group Tour operated by Tucan Travel up to the value of the original Group Tour booked. Refunds and discounts apply to the cost paid for the land component only and exclude Local Payments, surcharges, Extra Services, insurance premiums and administration charges.

6. Prices and Surcharges

All prices published in printed brochures and other printed media are “from” prices. Tucan Travel sells Components with variable pricing based on availability, exchange rates, operational costs, travel seasons and years. Correct prices are published on the Tucan Travel website and are valid at the booking date. Any promotions cannot be backdated and are only available when the client makes the booking and pays the deposit.

Loyalty Discount - The 5% Loyalty Discount is not valid on any tour codes beginning with R or Tailor-made tours.

Local Payments (and tipping kitties on some Components) are also variable and subject to change. Correct prices are published on our website and are valid at the date of departure.

Tucan Travel reserves the right to impose surcharges on any Component if the increase in price is more than 2% for reasons arising from but not exclusive to changes in entrance fees, government action, currency exchange rates, operations and transport costs, flight changes, airport charges and increased airfares. If the surcharge is equal to or greater than 10% (7% in Canada) clients will be given the option to cancel the booking with a full refund within seven days of being notified of the charge.

The above conditions do not apply in the following circumstances:

a) In the event of local flight cancellations, overbooking or rescheduling of departure days and times, Tucan Travel reserves the right to pass on any extra costs to the client. In such cases, the client will have the choice to wait for the next available scheduled flight and miss some tour services included or pay any additional costs associated with upgrades or chartering aircraft as a substitute by way of local surcharges.

b) Increased costs of permits or entry charges for the Inca Trail Trek, Machu Picchu, Lares Trek, Gorilla Trek, Game Park, National Parks or similar entrance charges to tourist sites and associated operating costs will be passed to the client by way of local surcharges as the increases occur.

c) Fuel surcharges due to increases in fuel costs for Flights, Cruises to the Galapagos and Antarctica or Tucan Travel vehicles may be applied and invoiced in advance of your departure if there is adequate time to do so. Fuel surcharges may only be known within a limited time before the departure date and are dependent on world and local fuel prices. Any fuel surcharge applied must be paid in full either in advance or by way of local surcharges as advised, failure to pay will result in the client being prevented from joining the Component without refund.

7. Travel Insurance

Travel insurance is mandatory for all clients travelling with Tucan Travel. Clients together with their personal property including baggage are at all times solely at their own risk. Clients are wholly responsible for arranging their own insurance. A suitable insurance policy should provide adequate cover for medical expenses arising through illness or accident prior to or during the Component and loss of Component monies through cancellation or curtailment of the Component for insurable reasons. Tucan Travel is able to assist clients in obtaining a suitable insurance policy. Clients making their own arrangements should ensure that there are no exclusion clauses limiting protection for the type of activities available during their Component whether included in the cost by Tucan Travel or otherwise. Clients should satisfy themselves that any travel insurance arranged through Tucan Travel is what they require and should arrange supplementary insurance if need be. The travel insurance cover automatically provided with credit card purchases does not provide adequate cover as standard. Proof of adequate insurance will be requested at the start of your Component, failure to provide this will result in the client being prevented from joining the Component without refund.

8. Passports, Visas and Vaccinations

It is the responsibility of the client to be in possession of a valid passport, visa permits, vaccinations and preventative medicines as may be required for the duration of the Component. Information about these matters or related items is given in good faith but without responsibility on the part of Tucan Travel.

9. Age, Fitness and Participation

All clients are expected to satisfy themselves prior to booking that they are ﬁt and able to complete the itinerary of their chosen Component as described by Tucan Travel. At the least, clients are expected to be able to carry their own luggage over short distances of up to 15 minutes walk and up several flights of stairs if required. Our hotels generally do not have concierge or porter services. Clients are also expected to accept that the Components described are “Adventure Travel” and that travel around and facilities in developing countries will not be of similar standards which they may be accustomed to at home. We do not provide luxury travel. Those aged 16 and 17 years are accepted on some Group Tours and most Tailor-made Tours, Cruises to the Galapagos and Antarctica and Extra Services operated by Tucan Travel at our discretion provided they are accompanied by a parent or guardian who accepts full responsibility for them. Some excursions including but not limited to the Inca Trek, Lares Trek and Gorilla Trek have other age limits set by companies or bodies separate to Tucan Travel. The “Adventures for 20's to 30's” tours are limited to those aged between 18 and 39 years, however occasionally Tucan Travel may authorise clients outside these ages to travel if they meet certain criteria. Tucan Travel reserves the absolute right to decline a booking at our discretion.

Clients agree to accept the authority and decisions of employees, tour leaders and agents whilst on Components with Tucan Travel and our trusted partners. If in the opinion of such person the health or conduct of a client before or after departure appears likely to endanger the safe, comfortable or happy progress of a Component the client may be excluded from all or part of the Package. In the case of ill health, Tucan Travel may make such arrangements as it sees ﬁt and the associated total costs of these arrangements including expenses of Tucan Travel must be paid for by the client.

If a client is excluded as above or chooses to leave of their own free will or leaves due to ill health or any other reason there will be no refund of the Package price, Extra Services, surcharges, Local Payment or any local surcharges. All services forming part of the whole Package booked will be forfeit though may be recoverable through the client's travel insurance in some circumstances.

10. Local Laws

All participants in Components operated by Tucan Travel and our trusted partners are expected to obey the laws and regulations of the countries visited and any failure to do so will relieve Tucan Travel and its suppliers of all obligations that they may otherwise have under these booking conditions.

11. Illness or Disability

Anyone suffering from illness or disability or undergoing treatment for any physical or medical condition must declare the true nature of such condition at the time of booking and make arrangements for the provision of any medication or other treatment which may be required during the Package. Failure to make such disclosure will constitute a breach of these booking conditions and result in such persons being excluded from the Package in which case all monies paid will be forfeit. See Clause 9 for further information.

12. If you have a Complaint

If the client has a complaint about any of the Component arrangements the client must bring it to the attention of the tour leader or other representative of Tucan Travel or its suppliers at the time so that they may use their best endeavours to rectify the situation. It is only if Tucan Travel is made aware of any problems that there will be the opportunity to put things right. Failure to complain on the spot will result in the client’s ability to claim compensation from Tucan Travel or its suppliers being extinguished or at least reduced. Should the problem remain unresolved a complaint must be made in writing to feedback@tucantravel.com within 28 days of the completion of the Component or all claims for compensation will be forfeit. Tucan Travel will endeavour to acknowledge correspondence within 14 days of receipt, and to provide a detailed response to any letter of complaint within 28 days of receipt.

Arbitration: If we are unable to mutually resolve your complaint you can call upon the AITO Arbitration Service on www.aito.com or the ABTA Arbitration Scheme on www.abta.com.

13. Our Responsibilities

The Components operated or supplied by Tucan Travel have been designed to provide participants with an exposure to the true nature of the environment visited and therefore involve an element of personal risk and exposure to potential hazards over and above those associated with normal “package travel”. All bookings are accepted on the understanding that such risks and hazards are understood by the client and that they undertake all Components, services, treks, optional excursions and other activities at their own volition. These conditions are issued on the sole responsibility of Tucan Travel, but they are not issued on behalf of, and do not commit, any airline whose flights form part of the arrangements. Where air travel as an inclusive Component of the holiday is provided by a scheduled carrier, the responsibility of that carrier will be limited in accordance with its own conditions of carriage.

a) Where the client does not suffer personal injury, Tucan Travel accepts liability should any part of the Component arrangements booked with Tucan Travel not be supplied as described and not be of a reasonable standard. In such a case, Tucan Travel will pay reasonable compensation if the Component arrangements had been adversely affected but will pay no compensation if there has been no fault on the part of Tucan Travel or its suppliers and the reason for the failure in the Component arrangements was due to Force Majeure, the client’s fault, the actions of someone unconnected with the Component arrangements or could not have been foreseen or avoided by Tucan Travel or its suppliers even if all due care had been exercised.

b) Where the client suffers personal injury or death as a result of an activity forming part of the Component arrangements booked with Tucan Travel, Tucan Travel accepts responsibility unless there has been no fault on Tucan Travel’s part or its suppliers and the cause was due to Force Majeure, the client’s fault, the actions of someone unconnected with the Component arrangements or one which neither Tucan Travel nor its suppliers could have anticipated or avoided even if all due care had been exercised.

14. Optional Excursions and Activities

Tucan Travel and our tour leaders and representatives may provide you with information (before departure and/or on tour) about optional activities and excursions which do not form part of your pre-booked Package and which are available in the region you are visiting. Tucan Travel has no involvement in any such activities or excursions which are not run, supervised or controlled in any way by us. They are provided by local operators or other providers who are entirely independent and they may or may not have their own public liability insurance. They do not form any part of your contract with Tucan Travel even where we suggest particular operators / providers and / or assist you in booking such activities or excursions in any way. Where a tour leader or representative collects payment for, attends and / or completes, or otherwise assists in booking any such activity or excursion for you, we and the tour leader or representative act solely as a booking agent for the local operator or provider of the activity or excursion with whom you will have a direct contract. The local operator / provider’s terms and conditions will apply. We cannot accept any liability on any basis in relation to such activities or excursions and the acceptance of liability contained in Clause 13 of our booking conditions will not apply to them. We do not guarantee that any optional activity or excursion mentioned in our brochure, on our website or elsewhere will be available to book during your Component and / or will operate as advertised as these services do not form part of our contract and are not under our control. They may not be available for various reasons. Any prices given in advance are indicative only. We will not be liable if you cannot, for whatever reason, book any such activity or excursion or if the activity or excursion does not operate as advertised.

15. Flight Bookings

Tucan Travel will use its best endeavours to ensure that all flight prices and pre-paid taxes are correct at the time that they are quoted. Airlines reserve the right to amend or withdraw fares without prior notice. The fare can only be guaranteed when the flight booking has been paid for in full by Tucan Travel and a ticket has been issued. Flight bookings are non transferable. Occasionally airlines cancel or reschedule flights and we may need to contact you to advise the changes or make alternative arrangements. This is beyond the control of Tucan Travel and any additional charges must be paid by the client.

Tucan Travel tours have a checked luggage restriction of up to 20kg in total. Some tours in Latin America which include domestic flights are also subject to the local carrier conditions of booking and have their own luggage restrictions which may be a maximum of 15kg. Any excess luggage charges on tour or on flights must be paid by the client. Hand luggage allowance will, vary from airline to airline.

Due to variances in airline regulations and for your own comfort while travelling, Tucan Travel recommend a luggage weight of no more than 15kg checked luggage and 5kg hand luggage.

16. Brochure / Website / Advertising Material Accuracy

The information contained in our brochure, on our website and in other advertising material is believed correct to the best of our knowledge at the time of publication. Errors may occasionally occur and information may subsequently change, therefore please ensure you check all details of your chosen Component (including the price) with us or your travel agent at the time of booking. Tucan Travel cannot be held responsible for any error, omission or unintentional misrepresentation that may appear in the brochure, on our website or in other advertising material.

17. Privacy Policy

In order to process bookings Tucan Travel is required to collect certain personal details from you. These details will usually include the names and addresses of party members along with passport details, credit / debit or other payment details and special requirements such as those relating to any disability or medical condition that may affect the holiday arrangements. We take full responsibility for ensuring that proper security measures are in place to protect your information.

We must pass some information on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements (airlines, hotels, transport companies etc.). Such suppliers may be outside continental Europe if your holiday is to take place or involve suppliers outside these countries. The information may also be provided to security or credit checking companies, public authorities such as customs / immigration if required by them, or as required by law.

Personal and insurance information will be collected from all clients at the onset of your Component. Once you have travelled with Tucan Travel, you will be asked to complete a client questionnaire where we will collect further details about you and the tour you travelled on. You may also be asked to review your tour on trusted review websites or we may share these reviews with trusted review websites on your behalf.

Social Media: If you make use of any Tucan Travel social media features, either on our website, an App or otherwise through a social media provider, we may access information about you via that social media provider in accordance with their policies. When using a social media feature and if you have chosen to include it in your social media account, we may access information such as your name, profile picture, gender, birthday, email address, town or district and any other information you have chosen to make available. Depending on the privacy settings of you and your friends, we may access information that you provide to a social media provider regarding your respective locations (“Location Data”) to provide you with relevant content. Please note that your Location Data may also be shared with your friends on a social media provider in accordance with your privacy settings for that social media provider. We may also access information from social media providers about your use of an App that we run on their website.

18. Your Financial Protection



A. Clients (excluding Australia, New Zealand and Canada) are ﬁnancially protected by the UK when booking directly with Tucan Travel.


The Association of Bonded Travel Organisers Trust Limited (ABTOT) provides financial protection under ABTOT Combined and the Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992 for Tucan Travel, and in the event of their insolvency, protection is provided for the following:





1. non-flight packages commencing in and returning to the UK;



2. non-flight packages commencing and returning to a country other than the UK; and



3. flight inclusive packages that commence outside of the UK, which are sold to customers outside of the UK.



4. flight inclusive packages, flight only and flight plus sold as a principal under ATOL number 6855.





1, 2 3 and 4 provides for a refund in the event you have not yet travelled. 1, 3 and 4 provides for repatriation. Please note that bookings made outside the UK are only protected by ABTOT when purchased directly with Tucan Travel.



When you buy an ATOL protected flight or flight inclusive holiday from us, you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This applies to International and/or National flight inclusive tours or components for clients based in the UK. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong.



The price of our air Trip Packages includes the amount of £2.50 per person as part of the ATOL Protection Contribution (APC) we pay to the CAA. This charge is included in our advertised prices.



We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate or holiday itinerary, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate or itinerary (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder or supplier may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder or supplier will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder or supplier. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder or supplier, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ABTOT Combined scheme.



If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL certificate or holiday itinerary, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder, alternative supplier or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, ABTOT Limited may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ABTOT Combined scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to ABTOT Limited any claims which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ABTOT Combined scheme.
