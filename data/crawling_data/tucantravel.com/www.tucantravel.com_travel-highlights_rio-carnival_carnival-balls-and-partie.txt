Carnival Balls and Parties









Carnival Balls and Parties

Rio Carnival balls are a highlight of many travellers' experience of the festival and you don't have to spend a fortune to have a great time. Tickets to most balls will cost you around US$70 to US$150 per person and you can book in advance online or with the help of your hotel.

Magic Ball at Copacabana Palace

Usually held on the Saturday.

The Magic Ball is the most famous, glamorous and sophisticated of all the carnival balls. Luxury costume or black tie/evening dress is required and a number of international and local VIPs will be among the guests. This event is very popular so it's important to book well in advance.

Bal Masqu√©

Usually held on the Friday.

The masked ball is a carnival favourite for many revellers. There's live music, a DJ and the drummers of one of the best samba schools. Dress formally or wear fancy-dress.

Scala Balls

Held Every night during Carnival.

The Scala nightclub in Leblon offers themed dances every night during carnival. These parties are known being the grandest indoor carnival parties of the city.

Gay Gala Ball

Usually held on the Tuesday.

One of the most famous balls of carnival, the Gay Costume Ball attracts the most colourful, exotic and flamboyant gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transsexuals, drag queens, and transvestites from all over the world. Located at Scala and broadcast live to the whole of Brazil, this event is extremely popular and welcoming to everyone, LBGT or straight.

Mangueira Carnival Ball

Usually on the Saturday.

Experience the music and atmosphere of one of the most traditional and well-known samba schools. Dance all night to the beat of Mangueira's drummer group with the principal samba dancers, the flag bearer and her escort. This is a traditional event which happens every year at Scala.

The Red and Black Ball

Held on the Friday

Dedicated to the colours of Rio de Janeiro's favourite football team, Flamengo, this ball has developed a particular reputation as a no-holds-barred event. TV cameras record the event, scanning the crowd for celebrity faces.

Party in Arcos da Lapa

Every carnival night 8pm till dawn

Near the Arches of Lapa not far from our Rio Carnival hotels, you can attend free concerts offering a range of entertainment from traditional Brazilian music to the latest trendy bands. There is also a popular eating area with small drink and barbecue stands.
