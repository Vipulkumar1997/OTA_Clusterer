Patagonia Tours

Located in southern Argentina and Chile, Patagonia is a large windswept region, relatively untouched and remote. The region is difficult to access during the winter months.

Patagonia is known for its rugged terrain, breathtaking views and magnificent mountains. Keen hikers flock here in the summer months when Patagonia is at its best. The warmest months are December, January and February, while the coldest are in June, July and August. Highlights of Patagonia include Torres del Paine National Park, the Perito Moreno Glacier and the most southerly point of South America, Ushuaia.
