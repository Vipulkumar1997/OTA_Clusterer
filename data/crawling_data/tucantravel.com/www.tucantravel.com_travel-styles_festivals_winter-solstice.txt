Winter Solstice










Winter Solstice

The Winter Solistice is celebrated more popularly than the summer and falls on 21st December. The Winter Solistice takes place on the shortest day and longest night of the year. Celebrated in many countries, each culture observes the solistice differently, interpreting different meanings from the sun.

Inti Raymi

Inti Raymi was a religious festival, celebrated every year until the Spanish reconquest tragically prevented the celebrations from continuing. Since 1944, a theatrical representation of Inti Raymi has been taking place in Cuzco, attracting thousands of people from Peru and around the world. Celebrations involve music, colourful costumes, dancing and, as in all cultures, authentic meals cooked and shared around the family.

Dongzhi Festival

Celebrated in China, Japan and Vietnam on December 21st, the Dongzhi Festival is a time for the family to get together, eating tangyuan symbolizing reunion. Families and clans gather at temples to worship. The festival has origins as far back as yin and yang and creates a balance of harmony and an increase of positive energy.

We Tripantu

Celebrating the New Year for indigenous communities across south Chile and Argentina, this small festival takes place between the 21st and 24th of June. It developed out of a fear that the new day would not come as the nights got longer and longer. The Mapuch celebrate the solistice once it becomes clear that the days are getting longer believing that Mother Earth has been fertilised by the sun. The world begins to bloom again.
