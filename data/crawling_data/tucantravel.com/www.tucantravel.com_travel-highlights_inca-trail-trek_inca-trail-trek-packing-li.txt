Inca Trail Trek Packing List









Inca Trail Trek Packing List

Luggage storage and load limits

During the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu your main luggage will be stored in Cuzco and you will receive a small duffle bag at your Inca Trail briefing (which will be held the evening before you start the trek) to pack clothes and sleeping bag for 3-4 days. Your team of porters will carry these bags together with the food and equipment for the trail. Please note that you will not have access to these items until the end of each day as the porters will always be ahead of the group. You should therefore bring a day pack in which you can carry personal belongings such as your camera, water and sun screen etc. By Peruvian law the duffle bag must not weigh more than 5 kilograms (10lbs) which is to include your sleeping bag - this limit is set to protect the health of porters and animals. All bags will be weighed before being accepted. If you require more than 5 kilograms, it will then be your responsibility to carry the extra amount together with your day pack.

Packing List for the Inca Trail Trek




Passport
â€“ You MUST take your passport and a photocopy is not sufficient. (Keep it in a plastic bag in case of rain)



Sleeping bag
- You will need a good warm sleeping bag for the Inca Trail trek. Where possible we recommend you bring your own sleeping bag, however adequate ones can be hired locally (for approx US$10) but we can take no responsibility for the standard. If you are planning to hire a bag it is a good idea to bring a silk sleeping bag liner to use inside for added warmth and comfort. A four season (or -10) bag is recommended for the winter months. At other times you will probably be fine in a 3 season (or -4/-5) bag although this depends on how much you feel the cold and is given as a guideline only. Roll mats are provided on the Inca Trail however for greater comfort and warmth, Thermorest style mattresses can also be hired in Cuzco for US$10. If you are travelling in winter and you do not wish to invest in a 4 season bag you may want to consider purchasing a 3 season bag plus a sleeping bag liner and bringing additional clothing



Silk sleeping bag liner
â€“ Especially recommended if you plan to hire a sleeping bag but can also give your own bag added warmth



Waterproof, well worn-in walking boots
- Good quality, comfortable footwear is essential. Whatever you wear on your feet the most important thing is comfort. It is vital to ensure your boots are well worn in and lightweight. Ankle support and waterproofing is recommended but if you already have something comfortable with good grip on rocks then donâ€™t go rushing out to buy new boots â€“ you are better off with your well worn in pair



Waterproof clothing
- A plastic poncho is recommended and can be purchased locally for approximately US$1. Some trekkers also like to bring waterproof trousers, however a poncho will usually be sufficient if it covers your bag, body and most of your legs



Plastic bags
- to keep your belongings and clothes dry (wrap everything in plastic bags)



Toilet paper
- Most important! Also small plastic bags for rubbish which can then be thrown in the main rubbish bag provided by the porters



Small towel and basic personal toiletries
- there is an opportunity for a shower at the campsite on the third night so bring travel size shampoo and shower gel if you would like to use it, plus wetwipes for the rest of the trek



Water bottle
- bring one large (1.5 litre) or two or three small water bottles that can be refilled on the trail with boiled water, which will be supplied when possible



Warm clothing for night time
- Fleece, long pants, woollen hat, gloves



Thermal underwear
â€“ If trekking in winter or you feel the cold



Walking clothing in layers
â€“ e.g. zip off trousers, fleece, T-shirts



Personal medication and basic first aid kit
- Bandaids, Imodium, Panadol, rehydration sachets



Camera and spare batteries, memory cards or film
- Please note: there are no electrical outlets on the Inca Trail so make sure you fully charge or/and have spare batteries



Snacks
- Chocolates, chips, biscuits, energy bars. Snacks are provided during the trek but you may like to bring one or two extras just in case



Torch
(flash-light) - (Very Important) and spare batteries



Sunscreen, sunglasses and sunhat



Tropical strength insect repellant



Antiseptic hand gel



Swimwear
for Aguas Calientes hot pools - Towels can be hired there for 3 soles



Flipflops / thongs / jandals
â€“ If you wish to have a shower on the third night
