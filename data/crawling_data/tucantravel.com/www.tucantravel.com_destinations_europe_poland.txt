Poland Tours

There’s no better way than a Poland adventure tour to experience first-hand this country as it shakes off a long history of invasion and subjugation and moves at speed into the 21st century; though always taking its culture and identity with it. Poland’s continued resilience to more than its fair share of unfavourable history is proudly visible in every city. Whether it’s the centuries of history protected in the World Heritage city of Krakow; the chilling reminder of Nazism preserved at Auschwitz; or the ongoing modernisation of Warsaw, sometimes called the ‘phoenix city’ after it emerged from near total destruction in World War II, a Poland adventure tour captures it all.

Though the cities modernise around it, Poland’s countryside retains its unique cultural charm. Throughout its vast interior, traditional villages with onion-domed churches pepper the landscape and horse-drawn carts still trundle down the roads between them. While many of Poland’s delicacies are increasingly available the world over, what better way than to experience the real deal and get stuck into the country’s fabulous cured meats, dumplings and plethora of pastries from source as you pass through each region on a Poland adventure tour.

Poland Travel Articles, Inspiration & Information






A day in Krakow

Place yourself in the walled city of Krakow in the 13th Century. Unbeknown to you or the rest of the population of Poland’s walled capital at the time, the Mongols, led by the brilliant military strategist Subutai, were planning a surprise attack to raze the city to the ground. Their plans, however, were to be thwarted.

Poland Travel Guide

Brief history

Poland was one of the largest states in Europe throughout much of its history.

By the 18th century, Poland was reduced to a territory which was argued over by Austria, Prussia and Russia. The country was eventually divided between the three leaving a small area around Warsaw to remain independent. Poland did not regain its independence until 1918 but by 1926 it was again divided by its powerful neighbours, Germany and the Soviet Union, followed by occupation during both world wars.

In 1948, the Polish Workers' Party merged with the Polish Socialist Party to form Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza (Polish United Workers' Party, PZPR). Opposition to the regime was led by elements of the industrial work force, Solidarnosc. During this period there were also movements elsewhere in Eastern Europe which were led by intellectuals, such as Charter 77 – and supported by the Catholic Church, a major political force in Poland that the communists had never been able to fully suppress. In 1981 Solidarnosc was banned and its senior figures detained, including its leader, shipyard electrician Lech Walesa.

In 1988, following collapse of the economy, the PZPR government resigned and opened negotiations with Solidarnosc. Elections were held in favour of Solidarnosc. Tadeusz Mazowiecki became the first non-communist prime minister. This signified a change in the tide and over the following years the whole of Eastern Europe shed its communist governments, directly resulting in the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Throughout the 1990s Poland was politically stable, securing entry into both NATO and the European Union. As the largest of the former Eastern European states, Poland's position is crucial. Poland joined NATO in July 1997 and the European Union in May 2004.

Geography and weather

Our tours mostly operate from late spring (April/May) to early Autumn (in Eastern Europe) when the weather is generally at its best. Temperatures will vary but will still be cool in April/May and again in October. The warmest months tend to be July/August. The further south you are the higher the average temperatures. You can expect snow from December to late March.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

Make sure your passport is valid for at least three months after your tour begins.

Visa regulations change frequently so it is important you consult with the embassy prior to travelling to ensure you have the correct visas. In some cases you will be crossing the borders on overnight trains. Visas are not required by British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and US citizens for a stay of up to 90 days.

IMPORTANT: All visitors entering Poland must possess travel or medical insurance to cover possible medical expenses for at least €30,000 and Zl100 per day for accommodation and sustenance.

Money

The monetary unit in Poland is the zloty, zł. Notes are in denominations of zł 200, 100, 50, 20 and 10. The new coins are in denominations of zł 5, 2 and 1, and 50, 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 groszyis. For up to date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

ATMs are widely available. American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard and Visa are accepted in larger establishments. Cash can be obtained from Visa credit cards at banks. Travellers cheques can be readily exchanged. To avoid additional exchange rate charges, travellers are advised to take traveller's cheques in pounds sterling.

Tipping

Restaurant bills usually include a tip. It is customary to give a little extra for good service.

You do not need to tip taxi drivers, etc but you should tip people who assist you with your luggage at hotels (don’t over-tip, your tour leader will advise a suitable amount). Tipping guides at the end of excursions and treks etc is always appreciated and your tour leader will advise you on the amount for this.

Security

Generally people find Eastern Europe to be safe and feel confident wandering alone during the day. However if you are unfamiliar with an area it is recommended that you exercise more caution at night and taxi taxis rather than walk, especially if you are a lone female traveller. In some cities bag snatching can occur so always keep a firm hand/eye on your personal items.

If there is a safe available in your hotel it is recommended you use it.

Local food and drink

Some breakfasts are included in your tour. Breakfasts can be basic so if you tend to get hungry it may be a good idea to buy some fruit or snacks to eat during the day. All other meals, extra snacks and drinks on the tour are at your own expense.

Ask your tour leader if they can recommend any restaurants in the area to suit your taste or budget or have fun exploring independently.

Poland has a distinctive cuisine, with typical ingredients being dill, marjoram, caraway seeds, wild mushrooms and sour cream, which is frequently added to soups, sauces and braised meats. Soups play an important part at mealtimes and are usually rich and very thick. Barszcz (beetroot soup), however, runs thin and clear and is often served in cups with small hot pasties stuffed with meat or cabbage. There are several salt- and fresh-water fish dishes using trout, carp and herring. Pastries, such as szarlotka (apple cake), packi (jelly doughnuts) and makowiec (poppy seed cake) can be bought at a cukiernia. Note that big cities offer a selection of other world cuisines.

Keep a look out for national specialities such as salted and rolled herring fillets with pickles and onions, Kabanos (long, thick sausages), Kasza (buckwheat). Bigos – sauerkraut with a variety of meats, Pierogi – dumplings stuffed with cottage cheese, minced meat, cabbage or wild mushrooms.

Of course being Poland’s national drink you can expect to find vodka in a multitude of varieties and strengths. Beer is also popular and widely served.

All drinks such as bottled water or soft drinks are at your own expense at all times and are fairly inexpensive. Alcoholic drinks vary in price, with wine and beer generally being the cheapest options. The legal drinking age is 18.

Time Difference

The time difference in Poland is GMT/UTC + 2. For other time differences please visit
