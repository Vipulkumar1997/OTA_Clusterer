Adding Rio Carnival to Group Tours

If you are travelling on one of our group tours that meet Rio Carnival we have a space already saved for you at the biggest event of the year! We make block bookings at our tour hotels in Rio de Janeiro to ensure our travellers don't miss out on the party. You'll still need to book in advance though, as we release extra space back for general sale at least a couple of months before the beginning of Carnival. Our 5 and 6 day tour extensions accommodation as well as your ticket to the Samba parade in Sambadrome on one of the main nights of Carnival.
