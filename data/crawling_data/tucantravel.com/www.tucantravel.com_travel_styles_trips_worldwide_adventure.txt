Worldwide Adventures

Tucan Travel Worldwide tours are designed for 18 to 65 year olds. Worldwide Adventure tours travel on local transport and offer adventure travellers the chance to get involved in local culture and meet local people. Tucan Travel adventures require a certain amount of involvement, be it carrying your own bag or helping the bus driver throw everyone's packs onto the roof. People travelling on adventure tours expect more from their travel plans than just accommodation, transport and itinerary. They want genuine experience, unexpected wonders and cultural understanding. Adventure holidays can offer amazing photos, incredible scenery and the camaraderie of travelling in a group adventure.

As a traveller on one of our adventure tours you are a participant, not a spectator. You may need a certain level of fitness if you are undertaking multi-day hikes, bike rides or other activities. You have the flexibility to do your own thing at times, or join in with the group. There are some included activities on our holidays, but you also have free time built into the trips to enjoy optional excursions, or find a quiet cafe and watch the world go by.
