Zimbabwe Tours

Sharing Victoria Falls with Zambia, Zimbabwe is the place to see nature in all her glory. Marvel at one of the natural wonders of the world as Victoria Falls cascades down into the Zambezi River, and head into national parks to spot masses of wildlife grazing on open plains. Zimbabwe is also home to ancient cities, where stone ruins still stand such as the Khami Ruins and Great Zimbabwe ruins. Finally the Matobo Hills are a huge attraction in Zimbabwe. Odd-shaped boulders are strewn amongst the valleys and their formations are a photographer’s dream.

Zimbabwe Travel Guide

Brief history

In 400 AD ancient tribes migrated from North Africa to settle. They built a site called Great Zimbabwe stone ruins which can still be found today. The settlement became a hub of trading activity known as the Shona society and one of the most powerful in South East Africa. After a combination of Portuguese presence and internal political fragmentation, the Shona broke off into autonomous states most of which became the Rozwi state which still makes up over half of present day Zimbabwe. Raiders from the south assassinated the Rozwi leader in 1834 and established their own state at Bulawayo.

British colonisation began during 1893 after a treaty which allowed the British to mine for diamonds and gold and the country becomes known as the British Colony of Southern Rhodesia. After nationalist uprising and civil wars Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo set up the Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) . Mugabe became prime minister and the new State of Zimbabwe became independent. Since then he has become under fire for committing a number of human right abuses and mismanaging the economy.

Geography and weather

Zimbabwe is a landlocked country. Victoria Falls, one of the world's biggest waterfalls is located in the country as part of the Zambezi River. The other side of the falls is in Zambia. The weather is tropical and the rainy season is from October to March

Visas

Many countries require a visa to enter Zimbabwe either on arrival or before hand. It is your own responsibility to check all visa requirements before travelling and obtain them in advance as required. For many nationalities visas can be obtained on the borders however you should contact the embassy for further information.

Border Crossings

South Africa - Zimbabwe : Beitbridge

Please be advised that this border crossing is one of the busiest in the world so although you can get visas on the border it is advised to get your visa in advance.

Money

Please note: It can be very difficult to obtain US dollars in Africa, even in major cities like Cape Town. Many places will not accept any notes that are marked, torn or older than the year 2002, and you may have difficulty exchanging these notes elsewhere in Africa, so please check your cash carefully at the point of purchase.

The monetary unit in Zimbabwe is the US Dollar . For up-to-date exchange rates with your own currency visit www.oanda.comor www.xe.com.

In general, Visa is the only credit card that will work everywhere in Africa. Master Card, AMEX and Cirrus will work in some countries but not in others.

We recommend that you bring cash in US dollars only. When changing money, it is a good idea if at all possible, to get small denomination notes and coins in the local currency as often there is a lack of change when you are making purchases and no-one in Africa ever seems to have change.

Please note that it is not possible to withdraw US dollars from ATMs in Africa, only local currency.

Tipping

A small tip for your guide is appropriate and welcomed. The suggested amount is between US$3 to US$5 per day.

Local transport

Taxis are recommended for local journeys and most are metered. Your tour leader will be able to advise on what the fare should cost so that you have an idea of what you should be paying beforehand.

Security

Crime is not a great problem in Zimbabwe, but you should still be careful and not become complacent. Don’t walk around lonely back streets, especially on your own, don’t wear expensive looking jewellery or a classy watch and don’t carry a wallet in your back pocket. Don’t carry your camera openly; always have it in a small day pack which is firmly attached to your body, preferably in the front in crowded places. Always wear a money belt or leave your valuables, including your passport, in the hotel security box. It is also illegal to criticise the government.

Photography

Caution should be taken when taking photos in and around the towns and cities. Locals should always be asked prior to taking a photo and it is not uncommon for them to ask for a small donation. Never take photos of police, military personnel or buildings. The same goes for any government buildings, banks, post offices or the railway station.

Local food and drink

Most meals are included when camping and lunch is usually included on travelling days in the truck. When staying in hotels or hostels, all meals are at your own expense.

Staple dishes in Zimbabwe include the use of maize and corn. British colonisation has also led spices, breads and tea to also make their mark. Common food dishes include Sadza, a heavy maize meal which is like porridge. It can be served with meat or vegetables. Papaya is also used to make Mapopo candy, a sugared treat.

If you are a strict vegetarian you may experience a distinct lack of variety in the food available, especially in small towns. You might find that you are eating a lot of omelettes and other egg dishes. Our tour leaders will do their best to provide interesting vegetarian alternatives when arranging group meals in the campsite, but your patience and understanding is requested.

All drinks such as water, soft or alcoholic drinks are at your own expense at all times. The following is a guideline for drinks bought at the campsites that we use. If bought from shops in the street, prices are likely to be cheaper, but in restaurants and hotels can sometimes be more than double the prices specified below.

You should be wary of drinking the local tap water. Bottled water, carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices are widely available and are generally safe to drink. Please note however that fruit juices are sometimes made with un-boiled tap water and could upset your stomach.

There are various brands of beers found in Zimbabwe with Zambezi being the national beer. Beware imported spirit prices as they are very expensive so always ask for the local equivalent spirit if you want to remain within your budget!
