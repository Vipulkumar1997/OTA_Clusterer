Estonia Travel Guide

Brief history

Originally a pagan territory followed by a spell under servitude to  German nobility. Estonia’s history along with the other Baltic States has  been a continuous struggle to maintain independence and national  integrity against its larger neighbours. Russia in particular saw the  benefits of acquiring Estonia’s territory for both economic and  strategic reasons and took Estonia from Sweden, at the Treaty of  Nystadt, in 1721. Proceeding the German invasion of the Soviet Union  during WWII, Estonia became one of the 15 Soviet Socialist Republics  until Mikhail Gorbachev then Communist Party General Secretary, offered  the prospect of change for the Baltic States. In 1990, the Estonian  Communist Party voted in favour of full independence from the Soviet  Union but allowed for a six-month transitional period before making the  decision final. Rapid international recognition of Estonia as a  sovereign state, followed by admission to the United Nations, completed  the transition to full nationhood. Estonia joined the European Union in  2004.

Geography and weather

Estonia is a low lying country with almost half of its land mass forested and over 1,400 lakes

Our tours only operate from late spring (April/May) to early Autumn  (in Eastern Europe) when the weather is generally at its best.  Temperatures will vary but will still be cool in April/May and again in  October. The warmest months tend to be July/August. The further south  you are the higher the average temperatures. You can expect snow from  December to late March.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your trip.

Visas

Make sure your passport is valid for at least two months after your  trip.Visa regulations change frequently so it is important you consult  with the embassy prior to travelling to ensure you have the correct  visas. In some cases you will be crossing the borders on overnight  trains and without the correct visa for your nationality you will not be  allowed to enter the country and will be asked to leave the train. It  is the responsibility of the traveller to obtain all correct visas  needed prior to departure. Visa services like www.travcour.com can be  very helpful.

Nationals of EU and EEA member states are free to enter Estonia. The  required travel document for entry is a national ID card or passport.

Money

The monetary unit in Estonia is the euro. For up to date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

All major currencies can be exchanged at banks and bureaux de change. Credit cards are  widely accepted. Most banks will give cash advances on credit cards with  a passport. There are ATMs in most towns. Traveller's cheques can be  changed in banks in most larger towns. The main banks in Estonia who serve  tourists are Hansapank, Sampo Pank and Ühispank.

Tipping

In restaurants 15% is usually added to restaurant bills and you are  obliged to pay this. It is also customary to give the waiter 5%-10% on  top of this if you are happy with the service.

You do not need to tip taxi drivers, etc but you should tip people  who assist you with your luggage at hotels (don’t over-tip; your tour  leader will advise a suitable amount). Tipping guides at the end of  excursions and treks etc is always appreciated and your tour leader will  advise you on the amount for this.

Local transport

Estonia’s cities have good bus and tram networks running from  approximately 6am to Midnight. Tickets are sold from Kiosks in the  street or from the driver they must be validated once on board the  vehicle on the spot fines can be issued if not. One of the most popular  and reliable ways of getting around on your own in large cities in is by  taxi. Try to find out what the going rate for journeys is before you  hop into a taxi to ensure you are not being overcharged. Your tour  leader will be able to provide advice on this when you stop in major  cities.

Security

Generally people find Eastern Europe to be safe and feel confident  wandering alone during the day. However if you are unfamiliar with an  area it is recommended that you exercise more caution at night and taxi  taxis rather than walk, especially if you are a lone female traveller.  In some cities bag snatching can occur so always keep a firm hand/eye on  your personal items. Petty theft, especially in Tallinn Old Town, is  becoming increasingly common. If there is a safe available in your hotel  it is recommended you use it.

Local food and drink

Ask your tour leader if they can recommend any restaurants in the  area to suit your taste or budget or have fun exploring independently. Hors d'oeuvres are very good in Estonia and  often considered the best part of the meal

You may want to try national specialities such as: Sült (jellied  veal), Täidetud vasikarind (roast stuffed shoulder of veal), Rosolje  (vinaigrette with herring and beets), Braised goose stuffed with apples  and plums and Estonian wild mushroom soup.

National drinks include: Saare beer (dark and heavy yet tasty),  Mulled wine and Vana Tallinn (a local liqueur that's probably best left  to the locals to sip!

All drinks such as bottled water or soft drinks are at your own  expense at all times and are fairly inexpensive. Alcoholic drinks vary  in price, with wine and beer generally being the cheapest options.

Vegetarians will find no shortage of fresh salads on offer.
