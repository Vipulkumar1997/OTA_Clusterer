Botswana Tours




Botswana is a small landlocked country in Southern Africa, which is dominated by the Kalahari Desert that makes up 70% of its land surface. Our Botswana adventure tours will take you to the Okavango Delta which is the world’s largest inland delta. We travel in mokoros, a type of dugout canoe, to make our way through the reeds to make camp inside the islands of the delta. We will take early morning walking safaris to see the wide variety of wildlife that call this unique ecosystem their home. We will also have time to relax and take a dip in the waters to cool off from the heat, or take a mokoro ride to watch the hippos swim and play in the evenings before we head back to camp to sit by the fire and interact with our mokoro polers in song and dance.

Our Botswana adventure tours also take us to Chobe National Park, where we take an early morning game drive through the park which has one of the largest game concentrations in Africa. Enjoy the experience as we get up-close and personal with many of the animals, have your cameras ready to catch a lioness with her cubs or even spot the elusive leopard. As the day is coming to a close on our Botswana adventure tours, we will take a cruise down the Chobe River to see many animals come to the banks; you may even seen a herd of elephants crossing from one side to the other.

Why everyone should explore Africa

Africa is this continent only 14 kilometers away from Europe through the Gibraltar Straight, but that feels very far from our western countries. It has everything that would make any traveller thrilled with excitement.

Botswana Travel Guide

Brief history

Bush people were the first inhabitants of Botswana, originating in  the north and migrating south. They mixed with the Hottentots and the  Bantu tribes and all coexisted quite happily together. In the 10th  century, the Shona settled in the north east followed by the first  Tswana settling in the south east in the 15th century. It is thought the  Tswana migrated up from the south and by the 18th century, they were  well established in the area. In the late 19th century, hostilities  broke out between the Tswana, the Ndebele and the mass of humanity that  was fleeing from the Transvaal and the Boers. As the British were also  rivals of the Boers, Bechuanaland as Botswana was then known, was put  under British protectorate in 1885. In 1964, Britain accepted proposals  for democratic self government in Botswana and full independence  followed in 1966.

Geography and weather

There is no wrong time to visit Botswana with every month bringing different temperatures and opportunities for wildlife viewing. Between December and March it is the rainy season while during September and October it tends to get very hot. This is the best time to view big game with less water, they congregate in smaller areas.

Visit
www.worldclimate.com
to get an idea of what the weather will be like on your tour.

Visas

Currently EU, US, Canadian, Australian and New Zealand citizens do  not need a visa to enter Botswana. It is your own responsibility to  check all visa requirements before travelling and obtain them in advance  as required. For many nationalities visas can be obtained on the  borders however you should contact the embassy for further information.

Visa services like
www.travcour.com
can be very helpful.

Important: pounds sterling are not accepted at border crossings so bring US dollars cash for any visa expenses at the border.

Border Crossings

Into Botswana from Zambia: Kazungula
From Botswana into Namibia: Muhembo

Money

Please note
: It can be very difficult to obtain US dollars in Africa, even in major cities  like Cape Town. Many places will not accept any notes that are marked,  torn or older than the year 2002, and you may have difficulty exchanging  these notes elsewhere in Africa, so please check your cash carefully at  the point of purchase.

The monetary unit in Botswana is the pula. For up-to-date exchange rates with your own currency visit
www.oanda.com
or
www.xe.com
.

In general, Visa is the only credit card that will work everywhere in  Africa. Master Card, AMEX and Cirrus will work in some countries but  not in others.

We recommend that you bring cash in US dollars or ZAR  only. When changing money, it is a good idea if at all possible, to get  small denomination notes and coins in the local currency as often there  is a lack of change when you are making purchases and no-one in Africa  ever seems to have change.

Please note that it is not possible to withdraw US dollars from ATMs in Africa, only local currency.

Tipping

A small tip for your guides in the Delta is appropriate and welcomed. The suggested amount is between US$3 to US$5.

Local transport

Taxis are recommended for local journeys but they are rarely metered  so you must negotiate your price before you get in. Your tour leader  will be able to advise on what the fare should cost so that you have an  idea of what you should be paying beforehand.

Security

Crime is not a great problem in Botswana, but you should still be  careful and not become complacent. Don’t walk around lonely back  streets, especially on your own, don’t wear expensive looking jewellery  or a classy watch and don’t carry a wallet in your back pocket. Don’t  carry your camera openly; always have it in a small day pack which is  firmly attached to your body, preferably in the front in crowded places.  Always wear a money belt or leave your valuables, including your  passport, in the hotel security box. Please remember that if you go into  the Okavango Delta by mokoro, you don’t need to take your valuables  with you. If you do, they will almost certainly get wet so leave them in  the safe at the campsite.

Photography

Caution should be taken when taking photos in and around the towns  and cities. Locals should always be asked prior to taking a photo and it  is not uncommon for them to ask for a small donation. Never take photos  of police, military personal or buildings. The same goes for any  government buildings, banks, post offices or the railway station. If you  go in to the Okavango Delta by mokoro, you will need to protect cameras  and binoculars in plastic bags as there is a good chance they could get  wet.

Local food and drink

Most meals are included when camping and lunch is usually included on travelling days in the truck. When staying in hotels or hostels, all  meals are at your own expense.

Your tour leader will be able to recommend restaurants.

In the villages, a popular evening meal is prepared in a three legged  cast iron pot hung over a wood fire. Beef or goat  meat forms the base  with veg such as pumpkin, potato, and onion added and then slowly  cooked. This method of cooking is common throughout Southern Africa but  varies from country to country both in content and preparation method.  In Northern Botswana and in the Delta fresh fish makes up a large part  of the local peoples’ diet. As Botswana is a very arid country a lot of  the fruit and veg has to be imported, but a wide variety is available in  the modern supermarkets that we visit in the larger towns.

If you are a strict vegetarian you may experience a distinct lack of   variety in the food available, especially in small towns. You might  find  that you are eating a lot of omelettes and other egg dishes. Our  tour  leaders will do their best to provide interesting vegetarian   alternatives when arranging group meals in the campsite, but your   patience and understanding is requested.

All drinks such as water, soft or alcoholic drinks are at your own  expense at all times. The following is a guideline for drinks bought at  the campsites that we use. If bought from shops in the street, prices  are likely to be cheaper, but in restaurants and hotels can sometimes be  more than double the prices specified below.

You should be wary of drinking the local tap water. Bottled water,  carbonated soft drinks and fruit juices are widely available and are  generally safe to drink. Please note however that fruit juices are  sometimes made with un-boiled tap water and could upset your stomach.

There are various brands of beers found  in Botswana including  Castle, Windhoek, Olsen, Black label and several different types of  cider as well. All of  the campsites / hostels that we use have bars or  serve alcoholic drinks. Beware imported spirit prices as they are very  expensive so always ask for the local equivalent spirit if you want to  remain within your budget!
