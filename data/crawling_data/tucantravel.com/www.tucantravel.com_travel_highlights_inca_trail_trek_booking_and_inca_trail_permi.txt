Booking & Inca Trail Permit









Guaranteeing Inca Trail Permits

In order to preserve the Inca Trail Trek and its surrounds, the Peruvian authorities cap the number of Inca Trail trekking permits to 500 per day. This number includes trekkers, guides, porters and other support staff. Permits often sell out several months in advance and you
must
book well ahead to secure your place, particularly if you want to trek in the high season between May and September.

We have a team based in Cusco who are able to book and collect your permit in person. This means that as soon as your permit is confirmed, you are
guaranteed
to trek the Inca Trail on the date that you want to travel.

Permit availability can change quickly and we cannot confirm you will definitely get a permit until we have gone to the Inca Trail office and booked it for you. Once confirmed we cannot make
any
amendments to your Inca Trail permit.

We are unable to book your permit for you until you have followed the following steps
:



Pay your deposit
When booking your tour you will pay a deposit for your tour
plus
a further non-refundable Inca Trail Trek deposit. These deposits will be deducted from your final balance.


Send us your Passport Details
You must provide Tucan Travel or your travel agent with a legible copy of your passport at the time you request your Inca Trail Trek. We can not book or confirm your trekking permit without this. Your permit is linked to your name and passport number. If you change your passport after booking your Inca Trail Trek permit or you plan to travel with a different passport, you MUST also bring the passport you used to book your permit, or you will not be able to trek the Inca Trail Trek. It is extremely important to check that the passport you use to enter Peru has a minimum of 6 months validity after the end of your tour before you apply.





Book in advance

Over the years, the Inca Trail Trek has become more and more popular. Every year, permits for the peak trekking season (May to September) sell out earlier and earlier. To guarantee your permit, we recommend booking as far in advance as possible.

Inca Trail closure in February

The trail is usually closed once a year for the month of February for maintenance. We offer the
Lares Trek
during this time.

Price changes for the Inca Trail Trek, Lares Trek and overnight train

All routes to
Machu Picchu
are subject to local regulations and the Peruvian Government can change the prices for permits and transportation without notice. Although we will endeavour to absorb any changes, it may become necessary to increase our prices accordingly (any increase will be paid locally in Cusco in US dollars cash).

More Information

See our
Peru adventure tours
page for the full list of tours that include the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu.
