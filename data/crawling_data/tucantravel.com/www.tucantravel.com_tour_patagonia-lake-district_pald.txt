What you need to know


We will try to run your tour as close to the itinerary as conditions will allow. On very rare occasions, local events may affect the way your itinerary operates. We ask for your flexibility and understanding in these situations.



Weather in Patagonia can be really changeable, so make sure to pack for wind, rain and shine!



The first day of your tour is simply an arrival day with no pre-organised activities. You will meet your Tour Leader at 18.00 for the pre-departure meeting. In order to allow time to relax and see some of the sights you may wish to add pre-tour accommodation.

Day 1 to 1 - Arrive Santiago



The capital and economic centre of Chile, Santiago is a fast growing city encircled by the peaks of the Andes Mountains to the east and a smaller range of coastal mountains known as the Cordillera to the west. With its fountains, parks and imposing neoclassical buildings standing side-by-side with glossy office skyscrapers, Santiago is a modern city very much in touch with its colonial past.
Pedro de Valdivia established Santiago in 1541 but not much remains of its original glory, except Santa Lucia Hill where the original fortress was constructed. From the top of the hill here are excellent views of the city below. However, for even better photo opportunities, take a funicular railway to the top of San Cristobal where the Statue of the Virgin overlooks the capital and the distant Andes. At this very pleasant viewing area you’ll find wine-tasting facilities and a couple of beautifully situated swimming pools. Much of the city is best explored on foot, particularly neighbourhoods like Bellavista which features outdoor markets. In the Plaza Constitución at the Palacio de la Moneda you can see the changing of the guard on most days. There is an interesting culture to explore in Santiago, with chic cafés, impressive museums, excellent restaurants and great shopping opportunities to enjoy.
While in Santiago you can take an optional excursion to Chile’s cultural capital, the port of Valparaíso. Take a funicular elevator from the flat town centre up the hill to explore the labyrinth of streets and cobblestoned alleyways of this UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Accommodation

1 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Libertador or similar




Day 2 to 3 - Pucón



Today we have a short flight to Temuco, where we will be greeted by our overland truck driver, who will take us on the scenic drive to Pucón. Situated in the Lake District of Chile, this picturesque town is a small resort on Lake Villarrica with great views of the perfect cone-shaped Villarrica Volcano. The whole area is surrounded by lakes, mountains, forests, rivers and waterfalls and offers many exciting optional activities such as trekking to the top of the active volcano, white water rafting, horseback riding, mountain biking and water sports on the lake. We have a free day to allow time to take advantage of some of the great activities on offer or simply relax.

Optional Excursions

Volcano climb – CH$100.000 • Horse riding “El Claro” – from CH$30.000 • Rafting – from CH$30.000 • Trekking Huerquehue – CH$45.000  • Guided walk and transport to Huerquehue National Parl – CH$65.000 •  Visit an estancia including BBQ and Chilean wine -  CH$40.000 • Canyoning – CH$40.000

Accommodation

Meals

1 Breakfast(s)



Day 4 to 5 - Bariloche



Our next stop is the resort town of San Carlos de Bariloche, also known simply as Bariloche, on the shores of Lake Nahuel Huapi. This town is a famous winter ski resort, but it also has a great deal to offer during other seasons and is a favourite holiday spot for Argentines. Originally built by Swiss and German immigrants in the Alpine style, here you will find charming Swiss-style chalets, numerous chocolate shops and even St. Bernard dogs with brandy barrels around their necks.
With the towering peaks of the Andes to the west, the glistening lake in front and the Patagonian steppe to the east, outdoor adventures abound in Bariloche, with popular options including mountain biking, horse riding or a bus ride along the lake with an opportunity to take in the sensational scenery from the cable cars.
If you’re very (very!) lucky you may spot the legendary Nahuelito, a giant creature which the indigenous Mapuche people believe lives in the depths of the lake. There haven’t yet been any recorded sightings to support this story, which predates the Loch Ness Monster, however despite that, the Buenos Aires Zoo took it seriously enough to make a trip to the lake to search for evidence in 1922.

Optional Excursions

Museo de la Patagonia – US$2.50 donation • Cerro Catedral ski lifts – from US$20 • Mountain bike hire – US$12 • Circuito Chico, a 60km circuit of nearby attractions which can be completed by local bus  • Horse riding – US$66

Accommodation

2 night(s) in hotels at Hotel Aconcagua or similar


Meals

1 Breakfast(s), 1 Lunch(es)



Day 6 to 7 - Futaleufu



Crossing back into Chile we arrive at Futaleufu located in the region of Los Lagos. Translated to “Big River” this town boasts some of the best water based excursions in all of South America on the Futaleufu River. Fed by the glaciers from the Lake District the river flows through the mountain range providing sensational views. Enjoy the fresh fast-moving waters where rafters annually descend to combat the rapids. Fly fishing and kayaking are also equally popular.
Alternatively, if you prefer your excursions land-based, you can enjoy full day hikes through the valley or visit Futaleufu National Reserve known for its large amount of Huemul (South Andean deer) and expansive trails.

Optional Excursions

White-water rafting various levels – from CH$35.000  • Canyoning – from CH$25.000  • Inflatable Kayaking – from CH$25.000  • Horse riding in a valley only accessible by boat – CH$70.000

Accommodation

2 night(s) in a guesthouse at Hosteria Rio Grande or similar


Meals

2 Breakfast(s)



Day 8 to 9 - Parque Queulat



From Puyuhuapi you can visit Parque Queulat National Park.  Situated on both sides of the Carretera Austral highway it is a realm of evergreen forests and winding rivers, with a large variety of flora and fauna living amongst it. If you are lucky you may get the chance to spot a Pudú, the smallest deer in the world, as well as a plethora of birds.
It is perhaps most famous for it's hanging glacier, Ventisquero Colgante,  located east of the Carretera Austral. Marvel at the long sheet of ice suspended off large rock faces, as nearby waterfalls cascade towards the bottom of the glacier. You can also indulge in the Puyuhuapi hot springs after hiking through the National Park's beautiful surroundings

Entry, transport & guided hike to hanging glacier in Parque Quelat – CH$30.000  • Kayaking in Parque Quelat – CH$42.000

Day 14 to 15 - El Calafate



We resume our journey to head for the town of El Calafate, located on the southern shore of Lake Argentino. El Calafate is our base to visit the spectacular Perito Moreno glacier. With a height of around 60 metres and a front of five kilometres (three miles), covering some 250 square kilometres the glacier is an incredible sight and is one of the few glaciers in the world to be growing slightly, not decreasing in size as most glaciers do. Named after Argentine explorer Francisco Merino, the glacier is coloured in a variety of hues from blue to grey to white and continually creaks and cracks. Advancing at a speed of around two metres per day, it can put on a spectacular show when giant chunks of ice at the outermost edges crack under tremendous pressure, rupture and crash into the water – a process known as calving. You will have the chance to walk around some paths and terraces where you can get some great views of the glacier.
Approximate Travel Time:
Four Hours
