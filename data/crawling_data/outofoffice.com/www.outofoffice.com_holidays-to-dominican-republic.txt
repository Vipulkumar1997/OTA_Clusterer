If you like beautiful beaches, luxurious resorts and a relaxed laid back atmosphere, then the Dominican Republic will tick all the boxes. It offers more of a modern experience compared to some of the other Caribbean islands but still has its unique charm. Punta Cana manages to create the perfect Caribbean image of beautiful beaches and incredible resorts in such a small area.

Some of our favourite resorts include
Breathless Punta Cana Resort and Spa
, which is perfect if you are looking for that all inclusive luxurious experience but want to meet new people and party in the evenings.
Secrets Royal Beach Punta Cana
is ideal for a honeymoon as it is adults only and is styled with romance in mind.

Santo Domingo is the mismatch of culture slotted together in one city. At the heart of it all is the
Zona Colonial, where you’ll find one of the oldest churches and the oldest surviving European fortresses. Walking through the rustic cobbled streets makes it hard to remember you are actually in the Caribbean but it's a nice change from the sand.

What everyone does in Dominican Republic

The Dominican Republic is famous for its top class all-inclusive resorts. If you pay a little more the difference is unbelievable.

What some people do in Dominican Republic

In the Peninsula de Samana you will find some of the country's best resorts, there is more of a cosmopolitan and laid back vibe here which is maybe why whales love to hang out here. The area is known for having North Atlantic humpback whales in the seas from mid-January to mid-March.

What no one else does in Dominican Republic

Spend a day out of the resort and delve deeper into what the Dominican Republic has to offer. Head to Los Tres Ojos which consists of a trio of caves and lakes. They date back to being prehistoric sinkholes, which have now filled with fresh water fed by the underground lakes.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
