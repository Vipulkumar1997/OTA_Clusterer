LGBT RIGHTS IN Barbados
html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Barbados is a destination many gay travellers visit without incidence. It is illegal to be gay in Barbados and public displays of affection should be exercised with caution. The Bajan people are welcoming though and there is an active gay community on the island.

As a gay traveller you can expect to receive a warm welcome in Barbados, but do tread carefully and ensure that you are discreet. Public displays of affection for gay people in Barbados are best kept behind closed doors.

If you fancy a holiday where you can leave all worries behind as soon as you step off the plane, then Barbados is definitely the destination for you.

Unbeatable white sandy beaches, a sea which feels more like a bath it’s so warm and gorgeous tropical sunshine. We work with some beautiful resorts which will make your stay one you will never forget.

Cobblers Cove is a perfect tropical hideaway, sink into ultimate luxury and enjoy the charming boutique styling.

Sandy Lane is one of the top resorts in Barbados and has a fantastic reputation. The stunning decor and impeccable white sandy beaches will make you never want to leave!

What everyone does in Barbados

Barbados is the perfect fly and flop destination since it is quite a way away, we recommend at least 10 nights in this tropical paradise.

What some people do in Barbados

Pair it with another island! You have flown all that way, you might as well soak up as much of the Caribbean as you can. A common pairing would be with St Lucia, it is easy to get to from Barbados and has a different vibe.

What no one else does in Barbados

Why not spend a day exploring the island a little more, other than the beaches there is actually a fair bit you can do. Head down to subterranean levels to visit Harrison’s Cave. This crystallised limestone cavern can be accessed by tramway and contains many flowing streams and crystal clear pools of water. A magical experience.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
