Best Gay Holiday Destinations

There are hundreds of destinations that we cover, but here's a selection of our favourites.

USA - Miami and Key West

Known for its whirlwind atmosphere and Cuban influence, Miami is a city which is totally unique. The combination of city skyscrapers and beach means you have a nice place to relax after a crazy night on the town. Once you have explored Miami it’s time to journey down to Key West. Cross the famous seven mile bridge and watch as you leave the bustling Miami city life behind as you enter into beach paradise. Key West is fabulous if you are looking to meet new people. It is a hub for LGBT people, and the abundance of gay bars and clubs makes it a wonderful place to meet new people. Spend your days lounging on the beaches and exploring the bays.

Argentina - Buenos Aires

The first country in South America to legalise same-sex marriage, Argentina is a fantastic place to visit if you are a gay traveller looking for your next adventure. Buenos Aires has been named one of the world’s most LGBT friendly destinations, so it should definitely be on your list of places to visit. Take a stroll through the gay neighborhoods (Recoleta and Palermo) where you will find plenty of gay bars and clubs. If you like nature and adventure, venture out of the city and head south to Patagonia where you will find incredible landscape and wildlife. From the tumbling waterfalls to the ghostly glaciers there is such a wide range of nature to explore it is sure to be an unforgettable experience.

Spain - Barcelona and Sitges

One of Europe’s most LGBT friendly destinations especially in and around the capital city Barcelona. The gay area Eixample is bursting with activity, making gay travellers feel very welcome. There are plenty of gay bars and hotel options for you to try. Once you have partied your socks off, head to the quaint town of Sitges which is only 30 minutes south of Barcelona. Here you will find a relaxed gay scene, with gay beaches, gay bars and for those who want to continue the party, there are some gay clubs as well. Spend the rest of your gay solo trip relaxing on the beach and soaking up the glorious Spanish sunshine. Much like Barcelona, Sitges is very welcoming to solo travellers, so if you have never been on a solo trip before and are apprehensive, then Barcelona and Sitges are wonderful destinations to begin with.

Brazil - Rio de Janeiro

Known for its energetic culture and also home to some of the world’s most beautiful nature Brazil is a fantastic destination to explore if you are a gay traveller. Head to Rio de Janeiro and immerse yourself in the city’s wonderful atmosphere. Head to Copacabana where you will find a gay beach, spend your days lounging on the sand and chatting to the locals who are very friendly and welcoming. Explore the city’s many sites including Christ the Redeemer, Rio’s main icon, from which you are greeted with incredible views of Copacabana beach and the skyline. For even better views, take a cable car ride up Sugar Loaf mountain. The beautiful combination of beach, city and mountains is a view you will treasure for the rest of your life. Brazil and Argentina share the Iguazu falls, which you must visit during your stay. The force of the falling water can be felt from such a distance and is an amazing experience from close up.

Canada - Toronto

It was the third country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage and ahead of its time when it comes to LGBT rights, making it a wonderful destination to explore if you are a gay traveller. There is so much on offer it’s hard to know where to start but Toronto’s gay scene is definitely attractive. Head up the CN tower to catch the best views of the city’s skyline and if you are into sports, then catch a local ice hockey match. Venture over to the west of Canada and visit Banff which is one of Canada’s finest ski resorts. In the winter you will find beautiful snow covered mountains and in the summer it is a fantastic place for hiking and biking enthusiasts. Head over to the city of Vancouver and explore the city from top to bottom. From the Capilano Suspension Bridge to the Museum of Anthropology, there is something for everyone. Head to Haida Gwaii which is a collection of around 450 islands scattered around beautiful bays. Feel the sense of peace and tranquility as you glide around the islands exploring their beauty and character.

Gay Group Travel

As you can see, we have loads of
gay group trips
on this page. These trips are fantastic if you are a gay man looking to travel the world and meet people who share the same interests as you, and you never know, that friend you meet on one of our trips might turn into someone special! The group operators we work with all share the same ethos as us and want to open the world to gay men which is why travelling with a group is great. You have an expert with you for the duration of the trip who will take you to the best places and will know the country like the back of their hand.







Best Gay Honeymoon Destinations



Mauritius and Reunion

These two tiny islands make for the perfect gay honeymoon getaway. Only an hours flight between each island, they are easy to travel between one another. Start in Reunion which is renowned for it’s fascinating wildlife and nature. The highlight being Piton de la Fournaise where you can explore underground lava tunnels. If you are a fan of horse riding, then there are plenty of horse trails around the volcano. Get up close and personal with the volcano and follow the hiking trails to the very top, the scenery is like something you would find on Mars. If you like canoeing and quad biking then Reunion is the place to do it, the beautiful landscape makes these activities even more enjoyable. It’s time for some relaxation, head back to Mauritius and stay in one of our favourite luxury boutique hotels. The beautiful tropical beaches and friendly staff will make your stay unforgettable.

Sri Lanka and the Maldives

If you are seeking the combination of adventure and relaxation, then Sri Lanka and the Maldives is the perfect twin centre holiday. Start in Sri Lanka and tour around the country, our favourite places to visit include the Dambulla Caves, where you will find a beautiful underground temple. Head to Kandy and visit the Temple of the Tooth Relic, which is said to house the sacred tooth of the Buddha. If you like nature then head to the glorious Yala National Park. Home to some of the world’s most majestic wildlife, spend a few days exploring the park by Jeep Safari and see if you can spot all the animals which live there including Elephants and Leopards.

Mexico

Riviera Maya in Mexico is perfect if you are looking for a gay beach honeymoon. The gorgeous stretches of white sandy beaches, the incredible all inclusive luxury hotels and the turquoise waters make it a romantic paradise.

Visit Chichen Itza which has been named one of the ‘new seven wonders of the world’. The area is also fantastic if you are a scuba diving fan, with many of the hotels having their own PADI diving instructor on site. Explore the colourful coral reefs and swim with giant sea turtles.

A destination many people are apprehensive about, but now is the time to visit Cuba. With its ever growing gay scene and authenticity, Cuba is the perfect destination for a gay honeymoon. Start in Havana which has culture bursting from every street. The old fashioned cars, the rustic cafes and the colourful buildings add to the city’s uniqueness. Spend some time strolling the streets and take in the atmosphere.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
