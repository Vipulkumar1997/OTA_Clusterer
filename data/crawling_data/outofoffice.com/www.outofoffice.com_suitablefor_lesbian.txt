Best Lesbian Holiday Destinations

There are so many destinations that we cover, but here's a few we recommend.

Greece - Lesvos

The Greeks islands in general are known for their lesbian friendliness, but Lesvos (aka Lesbos) in particular is very welcoming to lesbian travellers. This island was in fact the very place the word lesbian originated from, and hosts an annual women's festival, which attracts lesbians from all over the world. Alongside this, it is a fantastic destination for a holiday. The beautiful beaches, crystal clear sea and stunning scenery add to the picture. From Lesvos, you can also visit many other Greek islands including Mykonos and Santorini, which are both known for being very lesbian friendly. We can create you the perfect Greek island hopping itinerary for your lesbian holiday.

USA - Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon

The USA is perfect for a lesbian holiday, but Las Vegas in particular will provide you with some unforgettable memories. The non-stop casinos, the elaborate hotels and the energetic atmosphere are some of the things to look forward to. You can even have a lesbian wedding in the little chapel in Vegas. One trip you must make is a trip to the Grand Canyon. This vast valley of striped rock not only is absolutely stunning to witness, but also makes for a very interesting educational trip. You can learn about how the Canyon was formed and how the beautiful striped red layers of rock were formed. If you are looking to make your lesbian holiday even more special, then take a helicopter ride over the canyon for some unbeatable birds eye views.

USA - Miami and Key West

The city of Miami offers a very different experience to the laid back beach vibes in Key West, which is why they pair beautifully together if you are seeking a well rounded experience on your next lesbian holiday. Miami is depicted as the city that never sleeps. From the crazy nightlife to the long stretches of beautiful sand there are plenty of things to keep you occupied during the day. After a few days in Miami, head down south to Key West. The beautiful drive over the seven mile bridge is the perfect way to wind down from the Miami madness. Key West is one of the most lesbian friendly cities in the world, with plenty of lesbian friendly hotels, bars, beaches and clubs.

Cuba

Cuba is not only up and coming as a hot destination to travel to but as a lesbian holiday destination as well. This country is one of the few places on earth which has been untouched by western culture which is why we recommend visiting sooner rather than later so you get to experience its true authentic roots. From the colourful buildings in Havana to the beautiful beaches in Varadero, you are sure to have a varied experience. During your stay visit a cigar factory in the country and observe the amount of detail and precision which is required to make each individual cigar.

Brazil

One of South America’s most lesbian friendly destinations and also a country filled with fascinating vibrant culture. The capital Rio de Janeiro is one of the highlights and is particularly good for lesbian travellers. Spend time on the lesbian beach on Copacabana and meet the locals, head up Sugar Loaf Mountain for the best views of the city and visit the city’s iconic statue of Christ the Redeemer. The delicious food, the sound of samba music bursting out of every bar and the beautiful buildings make this city unforgettable. During your time in Brazil, head to the majestic Iguazu falls which also border Argentina.

Lesbian Group Travel

If you are a single lesbian traveller looking for a holiday, then we recommend a lesbian group trip. The group trips we have are fantastic if you are looking to discover new incredible destinations whilst meeting people who share the same interests as you. Whether you are trekking through Peru to Machu Picchu or kayaking through a ravine in the Grand Canyon, or even relaxing by the beach in Malaga, group travel is a fantastic way to explore the world.







Best Lesbian Honeymoon Destinations



South Africa and Mauritius

Perfect if you want a little bit of everything during your lesbian honeymoon, South Africa and Mauritius combines adventure, city exploration and beach relaxation in one. Start in cultural Cape Town before heading to the Winelands where you will find endless vineyards and beautiful scenery. Venture along the south coast following the garden route where you will find idyllic beaches and beautiful coastline. Finish at a game reserve and spend a few days exploring the incredible wildlife and nature which inhabits the area. See if you can spot the big 5 during your safari game drives. Round off your luxury lesbian honeymoon with a stay at one of our favourite boutique hotels in Mauritius. Allow yourself to fully relax as you sink into tropical paradise!

Sri Lanka and the Maldives

Perfect if you are looking for a well-rounded experience and also good if you and your partner have different interests. In Sri Lanka experience amazing culture, mind-blowing scenery and incredible wildlife. From the Dambulla Caves to Yala National Park, your experience will certainly be diverse.  After your exploration time in Sri Lanka, head to the Maldives and experience a whole new level of luxury. The standard of resorts are second to none and even though it is illegal to be a lesbian, the reality is somewhat different to the law. We have a beautiful selection of resorts who treat same-sex couples like any other guests and extend honeymoon benefits to them as well.

Bora Bora in French Polynesia

The words "Bora Bora" conjure up images of idyllic blue waters and an overwater bungalow that you can step out from straight into the sea. One of the most gay and lesbian-friendly set of islands in the world French Polynesia also allows for fully legal same-sex marriage in Bora Bora and the other islands such as Tahiti and Moorea. The flight can be fairly lengthy depending on where in the world you are travelling from but once you are there you’ll find incredible resorts, beautiful waters and wonderfully welcoming and friendly locals. It’s definitely one of the team’s favourite destinations.

Thailand

A great destination if you are looking to experience the hustle and bustle of busy Bangkok before heading down to the islands to relax and unwind. Island hop and visit some of our favourites - Ko Samui and Ko Pha Ngan - before flying down to Phuket and visiting Ko Phi Phi where you’ll find the beautiful stretch called Maya Bay - where the Leonardo DiCaprio film “The Beach” was shot. For a little more culture then head north to Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai where the abundance of temples and national parks make the area one of outstanding beauty.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
