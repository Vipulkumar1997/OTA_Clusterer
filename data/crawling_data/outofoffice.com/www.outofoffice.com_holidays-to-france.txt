VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for France vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to France and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.

When you think of France, romance, food and art springs to mind. Whether you head to Paris for a romantic city break or visit the South for long sunny days whilst surrounded by acres of vineyards, or a snowy ski holiday in the Alps, France pretty much has it all. The capital city is a must visit and with it being only a 2 and a half Eurostar train ride away from London. Of course, you must visit the Eiffel Tower, the Arc De Triomphe, the Notre Dame and the Louvre, but Paris has so much more to offer. The fantastic cuisine, the art galleries, the shopping and the laid back French lifestyle is wonderful to experience.

What everyone does in France

Since it is so easy to get to Paris is a great city break. Catch the Eurostar from Kings Cross St Pancras to Paris (which takes on two and a half hours) and you’re there! Spend three to four days visiting the main sites and enjoy the French art de Vivre (art of living).

What some people do in France

Skiing is a great holiday for the family, friends or even by yourself. The French Alps is one of the best places to ski, and the large number of resorts means skiing is available to everyone no matter what ability you are. The fresh mountain air, the slope side restaurants and most importantly the french apres will make your holiday fantastic (along with the skiing!).

What no one else does in France

Quite often overshadowed by other sunny destinations, but the south of France is actually a wonderful summer holiday spot. The French Riviera is particularly beautiful. Why not venture on a little road trip and visit idyllic Aix-en-Provence, buzzing Marseille and gorgeous Saint Tropez.
