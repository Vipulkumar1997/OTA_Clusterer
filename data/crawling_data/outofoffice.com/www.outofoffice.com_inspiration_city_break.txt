ENQUIRE NOW




Sometimes you only have a short window to get away and so you want to ensure you use your time efficiently. Our city break itineraries are more than just a hotel and a flight. In them you’ll find that we usually arrange transport to and from the airport alongside interesting excursions, private tours or restaurants on offer in the city. At Out Of Office we know that time is precious and so let us sort the arrangements for you.
Once you have browsed our site for inspiration, let us know your requirements and one of our travel concierge team will be in touch with you to build the perfect city break itinerary for you. If you're looking to travel to multiple cities on the same itinerary we can help you with that too.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
