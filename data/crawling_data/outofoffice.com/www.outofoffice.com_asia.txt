Luxury Holidays to Asia

























ENQUIRE NOW





IN A NUTSHELL

Asia is the perfect destination for those who are looking for a diverse cultural experience.

See the wonderful islands in Thailand such as Koh Phi Phi and Koh Samui, which are so different to the bustling busy life you'll find in Bangkok.

Work your way up Vietnam and visit Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi, and end at Halong Bay, which is an island paradise. Spend a few days cruising around the bay and one morning wake early to witness the sunrise from over the many tiny islands. A memory you will never forget.
Or perhaps you'd rather explore China and Japan on a luxury itinerary that takes in the best of each country.
Step into a different world when you step off the plane. The food, the culture, the history, and just about everything else is unique.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
