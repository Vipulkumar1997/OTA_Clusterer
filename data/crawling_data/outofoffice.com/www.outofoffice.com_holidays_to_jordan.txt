Holidays to

Jordan




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

An Arab nation on the east bank of the Jordan River, Jordan is a country defined by its incredible history alongside many nature reserves and seaside resorts. The famed archaeological site of Petra, the Nabataen capital dating to around 300 B.C.E and one of the new seven wonders of the world, is the real draw to this exciting country: nicknamed the “Rose City”, Petra is set in a narrow valley with tombs, temples and monuments carved into the surrounding pink sandstone cliffs, providing a truly unique sight. 
The Dead Sea, famous for being one of the world’s saltiest bodies of water, sits in between Israel and Jordan – combining your trip to Jordan with Israel, as offered in Out Of Office’s itineraries, is an ideal way to experience the best of both worlds.

What to do in Jordan

Jordan has delighted tourists for many years with its fascinating World Heritage sites including the ancient city of Petra, which is the focal point of Jordan. This ancient city has been chiselled out of the cliffs and it lay forgotten for centuries known only to the Bedouin (a native Arab group) who made it their home until it was discovered by Jean Louis Burckhardt, a swiss explorer. Other great historical sites also include the Roman Ruins and Umm Qais.

The traditional culture which is still very much a part of people’s lives is a wonderful thing to experience.

Then you have the awesome geographical landscape such as the majestic Wadi Rum desert which encounters deadly heat and the bitter cold all in 24 hours. Take a camel ride and take in the weathered sandstone and endless sand plains. Taking a swim in the Dead Sea is also a weird and wonderful experience, the high salt concentration means you float on the surface of the water. If you fancy a bit of adventure and are looking to cool off from the hot sunshine then head to the Red Sea as it is renowned for scuba diving

What everyone does in Jordan

A visit to the city of Petra is a must do during your time in Jordan. The scale of the cliff carvings is truly breathtaking.

What some people do in Jordan

Visit the Roman Ruins of Jerash which used to be a where chariot racing used to take place, along with several temples and gates to protect the city.

What no one else does in Jordan

Wadi Rum is Jordan’s famous desert. The sheer size of it and its behaviour is enough to take in, but if you want to see it from another perspective then take a plane ride over the desert for incredible birds eye views.
