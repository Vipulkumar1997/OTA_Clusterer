About Out Of Office

A lot of
OutOfOffice.com
's customers are well travelled and as such will be well versed in the potential pitfalls of foreign travel. We partner with both
Equaldex
and the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office
(FCO) to ensure that anyone booking with us has access to the best and most up-to-date advice anywhere.

We recognise that a lot of our clients are LGBT travellers and that it is important to be fully informed on the laws pertaining to the region of travel. Some countries we send clients to have severe penalties that discriminate against LGBT individuals but we also recognise that with the proper information, knowledge and advice there are ways to travel safely to many of these destinations.

It is why every page of our website includes the latest laws in black and white. It is intended to inform our customers about the current situation in any country. This is thanks to our well-established partnership with
Equaldex
. LGBT travel laws are changing all the time and as the world becomes a more progressive and accepting place we aim to continue to keep each of our customers informed. Indeed, where possible we offer advice to any traveller with no obligation.

The management team at Out Of Office are regularly in conversation with key stakeholders, hotels, tourist boards and governmental bodies to ensure that we continue to lobby for greater inclusion and acceptance in every country in the world.

FCO Advice

The FCO also updates its travel advice on a regular basis to ensure that British citizens are kept up-to-date on the latest situation in countries worldwide.

The FCO has recognised that there is now a need for a greater variety of good quality travel information, which reaches out to British nationals of all ages and demographics. Travel advice is now also relevant during your time abroad, as well as pre-departure, to help ensure you have a safe holiday.

To address this, the FCO has evolved their Know Before You Go pre-departure advisory campaign into
Travel Aware
, which offers travel tips and information to cover both of these stages.

Travel Aware offers the following advice for people going on holiday to help make sure you have a trouble-free, enjoyable trip:

Check you are insured

Take out appropriate travel insurance before travelling and make sure it covers you for all the activities you want to do. If you are travelling within Europe, ensure you have a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) that hasn’t expired and understand what it covers - you will still need travel insurance! For your free EHIC card visit
www.nhs.uk/
ehic
.

Do your research

Learn about the laws, customs and entry requirements of the country you’re visiting and understand how they differ from home, check
www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice
. Penalties if you get it wrong can be severe so think twice and know the risks. Check if vaccinations are required for your destination. For medical advice, visit
travelhealthpro.org.uk
. Understand what consular staff can and can’t do to help British nationals travelling overseas. Familiarise yourself with the number of the local British Consulate in case of an emergency.

Make sure your travel documents are up to date

Check your passport is valid and you have all necessary visas. Look after them while travelling. Once in resort, keep them in a safe place at all times. To make copies of important travel documents, take a picture of them and/or store them online using a secure data storage site.

Keep an eye out while you are away

Act responsibly and be responsible for yourself when abroad. Tell someone where you’re going and provide them with emergency contact details. Take enough money with you and make sure you have access to emergency funds. Keep an eye on your drink and stick with your friends and/or family.

Travel Aware aims to better prepare British travellers before you travel and while you are abroad with a view to reducing the number of problems you could face when overseas and ultimately the number of consular cases.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
