About Out Of Office

























ENQUIRE NOW




Out Of Office
prides itself in creating original tailor-made travel experiences and luxury holidays. Nearly everything we do is customised and designed based on your requirements. We offer five-star experiences to the discerning traveller and all our itineraries, destinations and resorts are handpicked to ensure the highest levels of service with the added reassurance that everyone will be welcome. We cater to all travellers - the couple looking for a romantic getaway, the group of friends wanting to spend time together as well as families and honeymoons for those just married.

You'll notice we're a bit different too when it comes to the photos we use. We think it's really important to show that everyone is welcome, no matter who you love. Too many travel companies ignore gay and lesbian couples and so we decided to create a company that prides itself in building all our itineraries from the ground up with gay people in mind. That's not to say that if you're straight then you're not welcome. In fact, totally the opposite. You are more than welcome and you will likely find that our itineraries are actually better than what you might find elsewhere. We handpick gorgeous boutique hotels and work with hotels and suppliers who are at the forefront of their locality.

We're constantly travelling the world finding the best experiences and places to add to our portfolio and we also pride ourselves in being able to organise those trips that are a bit off the beaten track. If you don't see the perfect itinerary for you on our site just ask us. From a honeymoon in a remote corner of the world to a private jet to take you and your friends to an event, ask us for a quote.


Out Of Office
offers experiences as diverse as a cruise around the Galapagos or a ten day tour of India staying in gay-friendly accommodation as well as romantic breaks in the UK. It also offers group departures for those that want to travel with others as well as trips to events like Pride and Mardi Gras.
Out Of Office
has destination guides and original content to augment our customers' enjoyment of their chosen destination.

And we want to hear from you - tell us the best place you've been and where you found that gave you that once in a lifetime experience or that was unexpectedly gay friendly. We're growing rapidly and are always on the look out for the next hottest destination that offers you exciting and out of this world experiences.

Why Book With Us?

Personal Service

We want to ensure you have the best experience with us and so we'll keep working on your itinerary until it's perfect. You will have your own personal dedicated member of our concierge team who will help build the perfect holiday for you. There is no charge for our services. We're confident that you'll be happy with your personalised itinerary.

Equality

Out Of Office
was set up to ensure that every client gets the travel advice and experience they deserve. No matter who you love or who you're friends with you'll find amazing experiences with
Out Of Office
.

Flexible Payment Terms

In most cases, we only need to take a deposit from you to confirm your booking with the full balance not due until ten weeks before travel. Unlike when you book a trip online and are expected to pay the full amount up front, we are able to confirm your trip with a deposit. We can also often hold flights at no extra charge ensuring you secure the best flight prices. Certain low cost carriers do require full payment at time of booking.

Financial Protection

Trips that include flights with us are protected under an ATOL licence.

Detailed Booking Documents

Once you've booked with us you'll receive a detailed personal itinerary which includes all your trip details. It will include emergency contact details, all the travel documents you require and helpful information.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
