What to do in England



html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Beautiful rural landscape, tradition and lively cities. England has more to offer than you might think. Head to London if you want to experience everything patriotic. A tour of Buckingham Palace where the Royal Family live, visit the many museums and head up in the London Eye for the best views of London’s skyline.

If you are looking for something a little more luxurious, why not head out on the Thames for a romantic dinner cruise. Branching out from London you’ll quickly find the tall concrete buildings turn to luscious grassy hills.

Head to the Cotswolds for a spot of fresh air. Immerse yourself in the beautiful countryside and hope that it doesn’t rain!

What everyone does
in England

With it being the capital city of England, London is a great place to start your holiday. With lots of great tourist spots, fantastic shopping and stylish hotels, your stay is sure to be jam packed and memorable.

What some people do
in England

Venture out of London and head up to the Cotswolds for a spot of hiking, biking and fresh air. Here you will find some of England’s most stunning landscapes.

What no one else does
in England

Have London as your base allowing you to venture out to more places. Why not take a day trip to Bath to see the ancient Roman baths. It is such a lovely city to walk around with beautiful buildings and boutique shops. Why not spend a few nights up in Edinburgh. It's only a 45-minute flight from London and embraces true Scottish Tradition.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
