When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible.

The entry requirements for Canada vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to Canada and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.

What to do in Canada

Canada is a breath of fresh air. Whether you are hiking in the Rocky Mountains, skiing in whistler or kayaking in the Tofino Sea you are sure to find unbeatable scenery and tranquility. Toronto’s vibrant atmosphere provides you with lots of things to do.

Take a trip up the CN tower for the best skyline views or go and see an ice hockey game and experience the incredible atmosphere from the crowd. Then there is the breathtaking Niagara falls where you can take a boat ride right up to the bottom.

Head to Newfoundland and Labrador which is one of the best places you can see the Northern Lights from. This incredible aurora display is one not to miss.The landscape itself is quite something as well, it’s like no human has ever been there with its jagged rocky landscape and misty atmosphere.

What everyone does in Canada

See the stunning Niagara falls in action and watch the unstoppable flow of water tumble down to the bottom of the waterfall. It is packed with tourists but totally worth it.

What some people do in Canada

Haida Gwaii is an archipelago on the West Coast of Canada. It is home to many unique and fascinating species of flora and fauna including bald eagles and bears.

What no one else does in Canada

Sable Island is not known to many people since the main inhabitants of the island are wild horses. The island is located just off the coast of Nova Scotia but is part of Canada.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
