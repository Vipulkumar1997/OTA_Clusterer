French Polynesia




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

A sprawling oasis, French Polynesia consists of 118 volcanic and coral islands including stunning Tahiti and Bora Bora. Not only a beautifully serene spot for a private holiday, extremely gay friendly French Polynesia is one of the most sought after spots for honeymoons – and with romantic views at every turn, it’s not hard to see. Breath-taking sights and experiences are easily found here, with crystal clear lagoons and waterfalls, 2 extinct volcanos and black-sand beaches just a few of the striking features.

VISA INFORMATION

html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




No visa is needed for citizens of the United Kingdom and the United States to enter French Polynesia for up to 90 days. You can visit islands like Bora Bora on a tourist visa. Citizens of other countries should check with their respective embassies for entry restrictions.




GETTING TO French Polynesia

html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




To get to French Polynesia, fly to Papeete in Tahiti from either Auckland or Los Angeles. Those of you flying to Bora Bora will get a short internal flight with Air Tahiti Nui to the island. It can be expensive to fly to Bora Bora so it's recommended that you seek expert advice on the best route and flight timings from one of the Out Of Office team.


LGBT RIGHTS IN French Polynesia

One of the most progressive South Pacific nations, French Polynesia allowed same-sex marriage from 2013. A beautiful destination to celebrate your gay wedding, the islands are also very welcoming and the perfect gay honeymoon destination.

The highlight of French Polynesia is undoubtedly the iconic island of Bora Bora. Immerse yourself in one of the Bora Bora water bungalows which the island has become synonymous with. Swim in the famous turquoise lagoon that is renowned for its scuba diving due to the protected coral reef that surrounds the island. You’ll also find Mt. Otemanu, the dormant volcano at the centre of Bora Bora, the top of which you can hike to or climb. The island is perfect for those who would like to combine relaxation with staying active. It has luscious greenery and jungle which allows for incredible walks.

With some of the most luxury resorts on earth, Bora Bora is a bucket list destination and one of the most popular regions we cover as a company. Not only is same-sex marriage legal in Bora Bora, but it’s one of the best honeymoon destinations on earth. Many of the couples we send to Bora Bora come back telling us that the trip was a once-in-a-lifetime holiday.

You’ll usually be greeted in Bora Bora by an impressive team of locals who will meet you at the small airport with a traditional flower lei before escorting you to a boat for a short transfer to your chosen resort. Be sure to have your camera ready for the journey.

In terms of things to do in Bora Bora, you’ll find watersports amongst the most popular. Scuba diving dominates along with snorkelling but it’s also a great destination to take boat safaris, jetski, parasail and much more. You can also swim with sharks in Bora Bora at the famous Lagoonarium. When it comes to snorkelling, you'll find some of the best coral and marine life in the world in Bora Bora.

Bora Bora is a perfect honeymoon destination. Snuggle down with your loved one in a beautiful water bungalow on stilts as you watch the sun set. Enjoy sumptuous food in your resort’s restaurants - you’ll find Asian, French and South American influences in the region.

The climate in Bora Bora and French Polynesia changes very little due to its excellent location. In the wettest months of December, January and February you will still over two hundred hours of sunshine though.

If you want to experience more of French Polynesia though you can look at visiting Moreea and Tahiti. You’ll need to fly into Tahiti anyway to get to Bora Bora - which is about an hour’s flight away - and so it is worth spending a night or two there on the way back.

In Moorea you’ll find plenty of hiking and trails that zigzag through the luscious rainforests. Whilst not as visited as Bora Bora, Moorea offers something different and is a good combination if you are wanting to visit more than one island. Moorea is surrounded by a stunning blue lagoon and lies just 12 miles away from Tahiti by high-speed ferry. Again, it’s a perfect honeymoon destination and because it falls under French Polynesia it’s also one of the best gay honeymoon destinations. The ideal place to watch the sun go down or stroll hand in hand along its white sandy beaches.

French Polynesia is also perfect if you are looking to sail around the islands on a catamaran. You can either opt to stay for a few nights on board a dedicated catamaran or we can arrange a day tour which involves exploring the lagoons by boat. There's also the opportunity to enjoy a motorised outrigger canoe for the day with a small group to explore the islands and swim with stingray and sharks. For adrenaline seekers then you can skydive in Bora Bora - a truly awesome sight from the sky as you take in the view of the islands and the blue waters. Moorea has some areas which are particularly difficult to access except by quad bike and so make sure you book a trip to include a trip. Enjoy panoramic views, craters with steep hills for you to navigate its lush plantations.

As mentioned, French Polynesia is known for its wildlife and aquatic life and we can organise a private wildlife expedition which sees you search for long-billed dolphins, leopard and sting rays as well as grey and black tip sharks. You may even spot a whale or two in season!
