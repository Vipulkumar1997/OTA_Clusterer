There is life wherever you look and there is a lot of it. The beautiful beaches, outstanding wildlife, friendly people and fascinating culture will make your experience in Tanzania unforgettable. If you want to venture on a proper safari, then look no further as some say Tanzania is the land of safaris. Watch as Wildebeest stampede across plains, elephants wander along their migration route, monkeys swing amongst the treetops and lions prowl around the grasslands.

The wildlife always puts on a magnificent performance, one you are unlikely to find elsewhere. It doesn’t just stop there, take a boat ride down the Rufiji River and spot the lurking crocodiles and the many species of birds float on the surface in the Selous Game Reserve.

In addition to the safari parks, you can visit the Mt Kilimanjaro, National Park. If you are fit enough you can climb the mountain and attracts many climbers as it doesn’t require ropes or technical climbing experience to reach the summit however still presents a tough challenge. Kilimanjaro is one of the highest volcanoes in the world

If you are looking for a spot of R and R after your week exploring the wildlife then head to Fundu Lagoon which is a luxurious resort located on the island of Pemba which is just off the coast of Tanzania. The resort has the conservation of nature at the forefront of everything it does. They recycle where possible and all produce used comes from local farmers.

What everyone does in Tanzania

The main reason for visiting Tanzania is to see the awesome wildlife which roams the safari parks, the mains ones being the Serengeti National Park, Selous Game Reserve and the Ngorongoro Crater National Park.

What some people do in Tanzania

There is more to Tanzania than just the game reserves. During your visit experience the traditional Tanzanian culture and head into Zanzibar. The city is divided into two sections; the old Stone Town (Mji Mkongwe) and the Other Side (Ng’ambo).

What no one else does in Tanzania

After all that exploration, you deserve a rest. Head to one of our favourite resorts in Mauritius such as the LUX Belle Mare or head to Fundu Lagoon on the island of Pemba and sink into ultimate luxury.
