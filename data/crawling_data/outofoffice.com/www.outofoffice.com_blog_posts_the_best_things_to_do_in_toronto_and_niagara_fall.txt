The best things to do in Toronto and Niagara Falls
Blog



























In part three, our founder Darren Burn heads to Niagara Falls with his partner.

Darren Burn







Our founder Darren Burn travelled to Canada with his partner for a week-long road trip to
Montreal
,
Prince Edward County
,
Toronto and Niagara Falls
.

In part three he takes in Toronto and Niagara Falls before nipping across the border to Buffalo.

Up early today saw us drive from
Prince Edward County
to Toronto. We chose the new boutique
Bisha Hotel
which rises 44 storeys above the entertainment district. The rooftop bar and infinity pool are just the ticket for relaxing in the bustling city and the fact that many of the rooms are adorned with icons such as Madonna and Michael Jackson are a lovely finishing touch.


We opted for a spot of shopping at the large
Eaton Centre
before heading up to the top of the
CN Tower
for stunning views over the city. We didn’t brave the Edge Walk - mainly because it was freezing cold - but certainly something for those looking for a little excitement and the adrenaline buzz. We did, however, jump up and down on the glass floor pictured above!

Late afternoon saw us head to West Queen Street for cocktails at the
Queen Mother Cafe
. I’d thoroughly recommend their Old Fashioned before heading to Rex’s a few doors down for live music. We then had a casual dinner at
Khao San Road
, known for the best Pad Thai in town.


Head to
Casa Loma
the following morning. Touted as Toronto’s majestic castle, it’s a large home turned museum overlooking the city. It’s difficult for us Brits to take the history of place like this terribly seriously when most architecture in the country dates back centuries earlier, but nevertheless the tale of financier Sir Henry Mill Pellatt who lived at the house is interesting and the architecture interesting.

From there we drove to
Kensington Market
- refuel on a burrito from
Big Fat Burrito
. The clue’s in the title. And then because we’d heard great things about
St Lawrence Market
too and wanted to compare them we headed there next. Kensington Market is a mixture of bohemian shops and quirky eateries whilst St Lawrence is a covered market which specialises in all food. Make sure you try
Nanaimo bars
whilst in Canada - one of my personal favourite before even visiting and one that tastes even better in its native country.


The following morning it was a relatively early start for the drive down to
Niagara Falls
. It’s hard in this day and age of social media to sometimes be wowed by a location, but Niagara satisfies. There’s no getting away from the fact that it’s become overly commercialised and there are a number of tacky hotels and casinos nearby. Don’t stay there would be my tip. Do make sure you see the falls from the Canadian side if you can - much better views. Take a boat ride on the
Hornblower
if you don’t mind getting a tad wet. The fifteen minute trip takes you up close and personal with the falls and you’ll be suitably adorned with a bright coloured cagoule. A tunnel allows you to walk behind the falls - though there are only two access points it’s worth doing. The highlight of the time at Niagara was definitely having an American man strike up a conversation and ask more about
OutOfOffice.com
as he followed us on Instagram. Always great to know we're making waves and a difference worldwide!


As I said, I wouldn’t suggest staying at the Falls - it’s one of those places that after a few hours it’s ticked off your bucket list. Instead drive to the nearby and quaint
Niagara-on-the-Lake
.
The Prince of Wales
is on the main high street (think a quaint English town) or the
Pillar and Post
is a short walk off the main strip (with a free shuttle too) and has a lovely spa with it too as well as hot springs - I’m not sure how authentic they were though! Niagara is known for its wine too and indeed this is the reason many people visit. A few to try are
Peller Estates
,
Inniskillin Wines
and
Southbrook Vineyards
. Also try to get to Fort George for a history lesson if you can.

The following day we crossed over into
Buffalo
in New York State - we had a Janet Jackson concert to attend! The border crossing process was relatively painless though at busy times I’m told it can take up to two hours to cross for non-Canadian and USA citizens. If I’m honest, Buffalo is not somewhere worth visiting in its own right, but it is a good place to drive through if you’re choosing to combine your Canadian road trip with Boston or New York. And if you do, then you’d be a fool to not eat Buffalo wings from
Anchor Bar
which is the home of the legendary meat feast!

This Canada Fly Drive 8 day journey through the urban centres and rural splendour of Ontario and Quebec celebrates Canada’s English and French heritage. Travel from cosmopolitan Toronto and the natural wonder of Niagara Falls to the neo-gothic Parliament Buildings of Ottawa that promise both to impress and delight.

Then, travel east and cross into Quebec as the scenic highway continues along the St. Lawrence River to the walled centre of Quebec City. Turning inland to the Saguenay region, the rolling hills and dense forests of the Mauricie / Bois-Francs region promise to enchant en route to Trois Rivières and francophone metropolis of Montreal - the second-largest French-speaking city in the world. Returning to Ontario, visit historic Kingston and its tranquil 1000 Islands from the deck of a comfortable cruise ship before arriving back in Toronto.
