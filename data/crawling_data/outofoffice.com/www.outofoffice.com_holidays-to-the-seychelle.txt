What to do in The Seychelles



html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Located off the East coast of Africa, the Seychelles is home to some of the world’s most luxurious resorts. Made up of 115 islands, you feel like you have escaped to a tropical paradise. Get used to the gorgeous African sunshine, clear turquoise seas and beautiful untouched beaches. The nature feels so un-threatened that it is common to see turtles coming ashore during the day to lay their eggs.

Take a trip to Moyenne island which has been transformed into a tortoise nature preserve. This island was bought by English newspaper editor Brendon Grimshaw who rescued it and transformed it into a mini paradise. He has refused many offers from hotels as he feared his little friends may lose their home.

It has now been named the smallest national park in the world. Of course, there are beautiful white sandy beaches to enjoy, and there are many fantastic reefs in the surrounding ocean for the diving enthusiasts out there.

What everyone does in The Seychelles

The main reason people visit the Seychelles is to enjoy the beautiful resorts and everything that comes with them. The gourmet cuisine, beautiful surroundings, stunning beaches and top of the range service from the highly trained staff. What more could you want?

What some people do in The Seychelles

Pair your week of relaxation with a tour of South Africa. Since it is easy to get between one another, spend some time exploring Cape Town, the Winelands and a game reserve before heading to the Seychelles for a week of wind down and relaxation.

What no one else does in The Seychelles

Spend a day outside of your resort and head to the Sainte Anne Marine National Park. It makes a lovely day trip as you need to catch a boat to the island. Take in the beautiful nature which is found on the island. You can take a glass-bottomed boat ride to get a closer look at the coral reef below the surface.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
