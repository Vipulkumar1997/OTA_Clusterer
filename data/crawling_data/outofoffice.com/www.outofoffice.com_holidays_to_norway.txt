What to do in Norway



html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Norway is one of the best places to visit to see the Northern Lights. This country is blessed with some of the world’s most beautiful green landscape. The sculptured mountains, vast lakes, and the snowy north make this the perfect place to visit if you are an adventure seeker. There is plenty of hiking, biking, northern light chasing and snowmobiling to be done here!

Norway’s capital city Oslo, is somewhat of an undiscovered gem. With its cool quirky architecture and nordic themes blended with modernism, it’s a nice place to visit if you are looking for a change from the fjords and stunning landscape.

What everyone does in
Norway

What Norway is most famous for is its incredible Fjords which are found mainly on the West coast. A great way to see them is via boat, which will cruise amongst the fjords, meandering in and out allowing you to take in their splendour.

What some people do in
Norway

Head up north to Lapland to see the northern lights. A great family trip as you can take your children to visit Santa Claus and experiencing the Northern Lights is fun for everyone. Take a snowmobile ride or even a husky tour through the snowy mountains.

What no one else does in
Norway

You might have planned to spend most of your time outside to take in the fresh Norwegian air, however one thing we recommend which not many people do, is to take a road trip along the Atlantic Ocean Road. Experience some outstanding landscape and beautifully sculptured roads.








Weather in Norway



html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Norway sees a wide range of weather from the Northern Lights in the winter months to beautiful sunny days in the south. Visit during the winter months if you want to see the Northern lights, the fewer hours of sunlight the better chance you will see them.


Norway Weather in January


January is a cold month nationwide, with daily averages only reaching -3°C in Oslo. Further north temperatures will be even colder and snowfall is also very common. Even though January is still in the dark season, because of the heavy snowfall which reflects the sun, January seems to feel lighter.




-7°C - 1
°C

Norway Weather in February


February is also very similar to January, cold temperatures in Oslo and even colder daily averages further north. Daily sunshine starts to increase from here onwards as we progress through the winter into spring.




2-7°C - 2
°C

Norway Weather in March


March sees a slight increase in rainfall as the temperatures get slightly warmer. Further north the total hours of sunlight increases to 5.

Norway Weather in May


May sees an increase in temperature with Oslo averaging at around 12°C. May is the start of spring, and with it brings 7 hours of sun during the day.

Norway Weather in June


Moving further into spring, June brings more good weather. Longer sunnier days and warmer temperatures with the average reaching 16°C in Oslo.




11°C - 20
°C




£££



Norway Weather in July


July is Norway's warmest month, with the average in Oslo reaching 18°C. In previous years Norway has seen warmer summers, but it is hard to predict when the heat wave arrives each year




13°C - 22
°C




££££



Norway Weather in August


August continues to be a warm month, but is the rainiest month with around 90mm of rain on average




12°C - 20
°C




££££



Norway Weather in September


September is a pleasant month, temperatures start to drop again but there is less rain compared to August. September is on the cusp of the dark season so the days start to get shorter.




7°C - 16
°C



£££



Norway Weather in October


October is the start of the dark season, with around 3 hours of sunlight in total. Because of this, temperatures drop right down with averages in Oslo only reaching 7°C.




4°C - 10
°C



££££



Norway Weather in November


November is a good time to visit if you are looking to catch the Northern lights in all their glory. Due to there only being 1 hour of sunlight during the day, there is plenty of time in darkness to see them!



-1°C - 4°C



££££



Norway Weather in December


In December temperatures get even colder and there is still only an hour of sunlight during the day. Expect plenty of snow as well and don't be surprised if temperatures stay sub zero.
