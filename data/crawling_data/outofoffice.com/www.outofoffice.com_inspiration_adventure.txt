Best adventure holiday destinations

You can find adventure wherever you go, but there are certain destinations we recommend you visit if you are looking for a real and authentic adventure holiday.
Costa Rica
This Caribbean island is filled to the brim with things to do. Whether you are abseiling down a giant waterfall, trekking up a volcano or horse riding through the plains of the Manuel Antonio national park, you are sure to find plenty to do during your stay. We recommend staying at least ten nights so you can fully enjoy what's on offer. Since it is in the Caribbean you are guaranteed to have beautiful sunny weather and awesome sandy beaches.
Peru
Located in the northern part of South America this country stands out compared to its neighbours if you are seeking adventure. There are lots of things to do in Peru including trekking through the Peruvian Andes, discover the iconic and ancient city of Machu Picchu and exploring the vast openness of the Sacred Valley. Head to the Cotahuasi Canyon which is located near the city of Arequipa. Known for its stunning valleys and tall peaks, there is plenty of exploration to be done here.
Thailand
Whether you are in a city or a beach location, there is always adventure to experience. Take a boat ride through Bangkok’s floating market and watch as the locals float past selling their produce. Head to an elephant sanctuary where you can have a go at washing the animals and riding them through the hillside. Have a go at scuba diving in the Phi Phi islands. The waters are filled with an array of exotic fish and beautiful coral reefs.
Galapagos Islands
The Galapagos Islands should definitely be on your bucket list if you like the combination of wildlife and adventure. Home to some of the world’s most exotic creatures including lava lizards, giant tortoises and marine iguanas. Visit the many islands which are micro climates for certain species and explore the unusual habitats which have evolved to suit the wildlife they serve.
Las Vegas
Your first thoughts of Las Vegas probably won’t be adventure but aside from the casinos, it is only a short car journey away from the majestic Grand Canyon. Known for its grandiose cliff rock edges, and profound valleys, it feels like you are on another planet. For the adrenaline junkies, you can have a go at the giant rope swing!
Canada
Canada, in our opinion, is home to some of the world’s most stunning landscapes. Not only is it a picturesque destination, but its landscape also serves as a focus for several adventure activities. Hike through the Rocky mountains, kayak on Lake Minnewanka or during the winter months, head to one of the many ski resorts such as Banff or Whistler and explore the snowy mountains on a ski holiday. It was also one of the first countries to legalise same-sex marriage and is known for its LGBT friendliness.
Iceland
Iceland is home to some of the most extraordinary geological landscapes. Visit the many colossal waterfalls, venture on a trek on the monumental Vatnajökull glacier and watch the dazzling performance from the exploding geysirs in Strokkur park. Iceland is also one of the world’s most LGBT friendly destinations and a good place to try to see the Northern Lights.
Australia
The list of destinations to visit in Australia is almost endless, and with this brings plenty of adventure to unearth. Since the country is massive, it requires a lot of time if you want to experience it in full. Start in Port Douglas where you can visit the Great Barrier Reef, before heading down the east coast and stopping at Brisbane and the Gold Coast where you can test your surfing skills. Your next destination is Sydney where you can venture into the Blue Mountains for some trekking. Be sure to check out the Great Ocean Road just outside Melbourne and if you make it to Adelaide then head to Kangaroo island and discover the incredible wildlife that inhabits the area.

Best gay group adventure holidays

Since there are lots of new gay group trips coming in all the time, our product range is always changing. There are certain destinations which come up every year because they are so popular with gay travellers. As with all our gay group trips, you will have a professional gay or gay-friendly guide with you the whole time who is an expert in the destination. Group trips are fantastic if you are a solo traveller looking to meet new people and explore new destinations.

Peru

Start in Cusco and explore the city’s streets. This city which is nestled in the Peruvian Andes was formerly the capital of the Inca Empire so there is plenty of history here for you to learn. The next part of your holiday continues with the Inca theme, however it is time to swap the luxury hotels and comfortable shoes for camping tents and walking boots as you will be heading on a 5 day trekking adventure along the Inca Trail. Spend your days hiking up beautiful mountains with your guide. Enjoy delicious freshly made camp food each evening prepared by your Peruvian guides. Your final destination is Machu Picchu. This ancient Inca City is an incredible sight to behold. The ruins which have merged into the hillside tell a story about the life of the Inca people.

Thailand

This country has everything on offer from the bustling city life in Bangkok, the authentic culture in Chiang Mai and the stunning beaches in Phuket and the Phi Phi islands. There is adventure wherever you look, whether it's taking a boat trip through the floating market in Bangkok, to an elephant safari ride in the hills of Chiang Mai, your days can always be filled with new experiences. A lot of our group trips finish with some island hopping in the south, where you can discover the islands Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, and Koh Lanta.

Galapagos Islands

One of the most extraordinary places in the world. The Galapagos islands are a hub for some of the world’s most unusual wildlife. There are species which can only be found in the Galapagos, and it has played an essential role in developing several scientific theories which have helped us answer many questions about mammalian development and evolution. Tour around the islands by cruise where you will be allowed to discover the life which inhabits the islands including giant tortoises, marine iguanas and blue-footed boobies.

Best adventure destinations in


January

Finland
The best adventure holiday in January is to be found in Finland. Even though there is very little sunlight, the snowy landscape serves as the perfect source of entertainment. Spend your days exploring the hills on a husky safari, or venture on a snowmobile for a spot of Northern Lights Aurora hunting. Our favourite place to stay is the Kakslauttanen Arctic Resort, where you can sleep in glass igloos and watch the dazzling Northern Lights display as you drift off to sleep.
February

Thailand
Head to Thailand if you are looking for the best adventure holiday in February as the weather will be hot and dry. There is so much to do and see, it can be hard deciding which places to prioritise. Head to Bangkok and experience this crazy city’s lively atmosphere. You will have an adventure by simply taking a stroll through the streets. Work your way down the country where you can stop at Chiang Mai, famous for its mountainous temples and elephant sanctuaries. End your trip island hopping round Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Phuket. The area is surrounded with an abundance of marine life so it’s great if you like snorkelling or scuba diving.
March

Costa Rica
The best time to visit Costa Rica is March because it is the dry season. Since it is in the Caribbean, temperatures are always high and is why we’ve chosen it as the best adventure holiday in March. March is the best time to visit Costa Rica for adventure activities as they are less likely to be cancelled due to bad weather. Whether you are horseback riding through the Manuel Antonio National Park, or zip lining through the Arenal Reserve, there is adventure around every corner.
April

Sri Lanka
For an adventure holiday in April we suggest visiting Sri Lanka. Even though the east and west coast mirror each other (when one is sunny, the other is rainy) on the whole, the weather in April is dry. Sri Lanka has many incredible places you can visit including the Dambulla Caves, where you will find an underground temple, Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage where you can get up and close to these gentle giants and Sigiriya Rock Fortress which is steeped in ancient history when King Kasyapa reigned for many years. Climb to the top of the fortress for amazing views of the surrounding area. Head to the famous Yala National Park to experience some of the world’s most unimaginable wildlife. From sulking leopards to families of elephants, make sure you bring a camera to capture the magic. In the south, if you are looking for some down time, Bentota has some incredible beach resorts which are great to wind down your trip.
May

Australia
Our suggestion for an adventure holiday in May would be to head to Australia. If you want to avoid the scorching summer months but still want nice warm temperatures, then Australia is the best destination. There is so much to do in Australia, but if you are looking for the must dos, we recommend heading down the east coast as that is where most activity happens. From scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef to hiking in the Blue Mountains near Sydney, there are plenty of activities you can pack your days with. If you’re feeling extra adventurous then drive into Australia’s outback and experience the vast plains of endless desert. Visit Uluru (Ayers Rock) and watch the sunset behind the giant mass of red sandy rock which is sacred to Australia’s indigenous people and formed around 500 million years ago.
June

Greece
Greek island hopping is perfect if you are the type of person who enjoys relaxing beach holidays, but like a little bit of exploration and adventure. June is the best time to visit Greece because it is the start of the summer months so the weather is lovely and warm, but you’re avoiding the school holiday months. You can choose which islands you visit but we recommend Mykonos if you are looking for a vibrant nightlife, Santorini if you are looking for beautiful boutique hotels and Skiathos if you are looking for stunning beaches. Each island has its own unique spirit waiting to be discovered. The perfect Greek adventure holiday would be to charter your own yacht complete with a skipper to sail round the islands.

July

Canada
Canada is ideal for an adventure holiday in July. The country has been blessed with dramatic landscape from the rolling Rocky Mountains to the peaceful atmosphere at Lake Minnewanka. Take a gondola ride up to the top of Sulphur Mountain for breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. It is a wonderful place to hike around and admire the beautiful scenery. The beautiful cities of Montreal and Quebec are must sees as well as venturing from Toronto to witness Niagara Falls.
August

Iceland
Scattered with immense landscape and captivating geological features you will never find a dull moment. The best adventure holiday destination in August is Iceland. Since it is located near the Arctic circle, in the summer months it experiences nearly 24 hours of sunshine a day, meaning there is plenty of time to visit as many waterfalls as possible. As well as the waterfalls, you have the mammoth glaciers, spectacular geysirs and natural hot springs. It is also worth visiting the Blue Lagoon spa, where the water is said to contain minerals which have age defying effects and healing powers.
September

South Africa
South Africa is just coming into Spring and offers one of our favourite adventure holiday destinations in September. Winter has just ended and the coastal towns are coming to life again but without the influx of tourists seen later in the season. It’s much easier to find availability on a South African safari and in the country’s winelands just outside Cape Town. Venture into Kruger National Park to experience some of the planet’s best wildlife and ensure you book as many game drives as possible for real adventure.
October

Galapagos Islands
This collection of islands are located off the coast of Ecuador and should definitely be on your bucket list. The best adventure holiday destination in October is the Galapagos Islands because of its cooler temperatures which means that you can explore freely without working up too much of a sweat. It’s low season and so it means you can book a handful more excursions for a similar price to if you were going in peak season. You’ll find that the Galapagos fur seals are in mating season at this time of year and the lava herons start building their nests in October. The blue-footed boobies start raising their chicks too.
November

Peru
For adventure holidays in November head to Peru in South America. During this time, the weather is dry and warm, making it a pleasant time to visit. If you are trekking the Inca Trail, having dry weather can make your experience a lot more enjoyable as camping in the rain can be miserable. The Inca Trail usually takes around 7 days to complete. The end point is at the top of Machu Picchu which is an ancient Inca settlement. To this day, you can still feel what life was like high up in the Peruvian mountains for the Inca population.
December

Riviera Maya
Riviera Maya in Mexico is better known for its stunning all inclusive hotels and long stretches of white sandy beaches but there is more to this beautiful area than you may think. The area is dotted with several Mayan Ruin sites including the breathtaking Chichen Itza which has been named one of the ‘new seven wonders of the world’. The area is home to several cenotes which are natural sinkholes filled with natural spring water and are fun to explore. The Mexican area is also famous for scuba diving and home to sea turtles and an abundance of tropical fish. Take a boat ride to the Garrafon National Park where you can enjoy the many water activities offered, including kayaking through the mangrove plots.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
