Vietnam




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

Stretching over 3,200 kilometers in length with countless mountains, rivers, forests and beaches, Vietnam is one of Asia's most diverse and fascinating countries. From the natural splendour and majesty of the north, to the historic charm of the central provinces Vietnam is a beautiful country.
Few places in Vietnam hold quite as much historic allure as Hoi An. The former importance of the ancient port can be witnessed in its colourful array of merchant houses, temples and markets. Nearby, the spectacular ruins at My Son mark the capital and religious centre of the former Champa Kingdom.

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for Vietnam vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to Vietnam and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.

Our holidays to Vietnam will allow you to see the best parts. Start in Ho Chi Minh city and visit the war remnants museum and the Jade Emperor Pagoda. Visit the Binh Tay Market where you can pick up all your local goodies.

Our next stop we recommend is Hoi An, which is famous for its Chinese lanterns. This cute historic city offers a different experience compared to the other larger cities you will be visiting.

Your penultimate stop is going to be Hanoi which is the capital city of Vietnam. Spend a few days exploring from top to bottom. Hanoi is filled with lots of great places to visit including the Temple of Literature and the Hoa Lo Prison Museum.

Save the best till last and visit Halong Bay which is just off the coast of Hanoi. Board your boat and cruise around the bay which is scattered with tiny little islands. Dive off your boat and swim in the bay. You can join a group or opt for your very own private ship. Dine on board and enjoy top quality Vietnamese food whilst watching the sunset. We have three wonderful blogs, written by one of our travel gurus about his experience in Vietnam. He discusses the
Highlights of Vietnam
, a guide to the city of
Ho Chi Minh
and he talks about the
best things to do in Hue
, which is a city between Hoi An and Hanoi.

What Everyone Does in Vietnam

It is easy to get around in Vietnam, so most people when they visit Vietnam, they see it all. Our
Discover Vietnam
itinerary takes 10 days, but you could take longer and do it in two weeks and add in a few extra places.

What Some People Do in Vietnam

Nha Trang is a city in the North of Vietnam. The Cai River and Cua Be rivers divide Nha Trang into 19 different islands. A great trip to build into your itinerary would be to island hop around these islands. Our top ones we recommend visiting are Hon Mieu Island, Hon Tre Island and Hon Mun Island.

What No One Does in Vietnam

Hop on board a luxury cruise and sail up the Mekong River. Start in Ho Chi Minh and end in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. From here you can tour around Cambodia, of fly to another destination.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
