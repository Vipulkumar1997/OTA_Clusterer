Holidays to North America

























ENQUIRE NOW





IN A NUTSHELL

North America - full of opportunity and surprise and a perfect holiday destination. If you are looking for the classic USA road trip drive along Route 66, or perhaps a trip to Hawaii for that tropical getaway.

Visit the Big Apple and immerse yourself in the bustling life of New York City. Take a luxury helicopter ride to get the perfect bird's eye view.

Hawaii on the other hand, is the opposite, with the vast majority of the land covered in gorgeous tropical wildlife. Spend your days here lounging on the beautiful white sandy beaches, or trekking up the many wildlife trails.

If you are seeking lights, camera and a bit of Hollywood action, then Los Angeles is the destination for you. The list of things to do is endless.

Venture further north to Canada that really does have it all. From the bustling cities of Toronto and Vancouver to the slopes of Whistler and the falls of Niagara, the country is teeming with activity. 

But if you are looking for the ultimate fly and flop experience, then Riviera Maya in Mexico has some of the best 5-star hotels you'll find in the world. Lounge on a beach, swim in the sea or head out on a deep-sea diving experience.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
