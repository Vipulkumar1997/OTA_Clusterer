Holidays to

The Maldives




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

The Maldives is the place to switch off. When it comes to unwinding, a holiday to the Maldives is undoubtedly at the top of the list. Its iconic water bungalows and beautiful beaches allow you to relax and pamper yourself in its luxurious surroundings.
Most people will travel to the Maldives to do absolutely nothing. Rekindle your romance, read a good book or enjoy the fine food on offer at your resort's restaurants.
For those of you who like the idea of watersports, then diving and snorkelling is a must in the Maldives. It has an abundance of coral and reef life sure to wow even the most experienced divers.
Many of the resorts we work with in the Maldives have incredible spas, which offer a wide range of treatments including massages and facials using traditional Maldivian herbal remedies and ointments.

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for The Maldives vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to The Maldives and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.


GETTING TO The Maldives

html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Getting to the Maldives is relatively straightforward. Fly to Male direct at certain times of year with British Airways, via Dubai with Emirates or via Colombo with Sri Lankan Airlines. From the international airport you will leave the mainland and pick up a speedboat or seaplane to your chosen resort - an experience in itself.


LGBT RIGHTS IN The Maldives
html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Whilst by law being gay is illegal, many gay couples choose to travel to The Maldives without any problems. Public displays of affection are not acceptable in The Maldives - but that applies to all couples. All of the resorts we feature have successfully hosted gay couples before without incident.

It is important to note that the law in The Maldives does pose risks to gay people. However what our service offers are hotels and resorts with whom we have had extensive discussions and they ensure that as a part of the LGBT community you will receive a respectful welcome from them. There remain risks under the law but our gay-friendly resort and hotel partners will help you to enjoy their countries as freely as possible.

What to do in The Maldives



html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"






The Maldives - with perhaps some of the most beautiful resorts on earth - is made up of hundreds of individual islands that each have their own unique style and ambience. Stunning white sandy beaches sit next to crystal blue waters and you'll be able to unwind and relax as you watch beautiful sunsets from the shore.

The abundance of underwater reefs and wildlife augment the natural beauty of the islands with a diverse range of resorts - most accessed by speedboat or seaplane.

If you've always dreamt of that overwater pool villa getaway, then the Maldives are sure to impress. Watch our
video guide to the Maldives
for further information on these beautiful islands.

What everyone does in The Maldives

The point of visiting the Maldives is to experience the resorts which are on another level. Yes it is expensive which is why we strongly recommend going all inclusive.

What some people do in The Maldives

If you go to the Maldives, for some of us it is going to be a once in a lifetime experience. Make it extra special and stay in an iconic overwater bungalow. Awake to the sound of waves lapping up on the shoreline and enjoy your morning swim in the ocean which is right on your back door step.

What no one else does in The Maldives

Male, which is the capital city is great to explore. Before you head off to your luxurious resort, why not spend a couple of days in the city and explore its culture.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
