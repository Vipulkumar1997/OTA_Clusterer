Thailand




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

You can find everything in Thailand: romance, a varied nightlife, hidden treasures and peaceful islands surrounded by pristine, clear waters. An incredible open, accepting and welcoming place, its world-renowned floating markets will have you not knowing where to look first, and the Grand Palace is a photographer’s dream. The extent of its intricate detailing will have you feeling somewhat inferior to the Thai craftsmen.
An abundance of blue water can be found in the islands of Koh Samui, Koh Phangan and Koh Tao as well as some of the best diving in the world. Soak up the sunshine in the south and experience the culture of the north in Chiang Mai and the cosmopolitan capital Bangkok.

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for Thailand vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to Thailand and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.


GETTING TO Thailand

html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Bangkok has two airports. It is easy to travel around the country and most of the country's major destinations have their own airports close by. You can also fly directly to Phuket from London in certain seasons as well as via the Middle East.

The perfect destination if you’re looking for a combination of culture and idyllic beaches.

Relax and unwind on the beautiful beaches of Koh Samui, Ko Phi Phi and Phuket. With stretches of sand that meet blue waters, Thailand has some of the best beach resorts in the world. Perhaps a room with its own private pool is up your street or a villa in the hills.

For culture, look to the north of Thailand. The capital city Bangkok not only has abundant nightlife but many temples and markets to explore. Head up to Chiang Mai to visit elephant sanctuaries and experience incredible trekking.

Further north in Chiang Rai you’ll discover more temples and the Golden Triangle – which is where the hilly landscape of Thailand meets Myanmar and Laos. Don’t forget to try your hand at a traditional Thai cooking class whilst in the country.

What Everyone Does in Thailand

Much like our
Luxury Thailand Honeymoon
itinerary, start in Bangkok and spend 3 nights there exploring the city. Visit the Royal palace and the floating markets, then head over to Phuket for a week or two of sun and sea! We can arrange a private boat tour of the Phi Phi islands for you where your driver will take you to some of the most exclusive bays and beaches.

What Some People Do in Thailand

Why not pair Thailand with another country? Our suggestions would be Cambodia and Thailand, Vietnam and Thailand or if you want to see it all, then check out our
Indochina Heritage itinerary
which takes you through Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.

What No One Does in Thailand

Explore Northern Thailand and visit the Bridge over the
River Kwai
. We think the best way to experience is up close! Board your intimate cruise ship at Kanchanaburi and sail up the river Kwai to Muang Singh. Here you will explore the national park followed by a scenic train journey to Saphan Tham Krasae.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
