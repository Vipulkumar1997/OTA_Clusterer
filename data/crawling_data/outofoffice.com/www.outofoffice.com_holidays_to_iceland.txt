Iceland




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

Iceland is the definition of striking drama, with a volcanic landscape of hot springs, waterfalls, glaciers, geysers and black-sand beaches waiting to be discovered. The lifestyle here is one that even suave James Bond would envy, where daytime attractions of ice climbing, hiking and snowmobiling abound and the vibrant nightlife scene in Reykjavik runs until the early hours.
In Iceland you can walk from Europe to North America in seconds at the Reykjanes Peninsula which spans a gaping rift between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. You can also swim in geothermal baths, the famous Blue Lagoon and find a hugely tolerant and welcoming society.
At Out Of Office we are able to plan and customise your perfect trip. From snowmobiling on an Icelandic glacier to taking a helicopter ride over a waterfall, simply let us know what you want to do and we'll plan the perfect getaway to Iceland.

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for Iceland vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to Iceland and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.


GETTING TO Iceland

html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Iceland's main airport is Reykjavik and is well connected to both Europe and the United States. The island is also relatively small and so getting around is easy if you rent a car. Some of the most stunning scenery is outside of the capital Reykjavik.

What to do in Iceland



html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




A country known for its incredible geological features including incredible waterfalls, exploding geysers, awesome glaciers, and hot natural springs! The capital city Reykjavik has lots to offer as well. A nice addition to all the nature you will be experiencing, take a stroll along the harbour where you’ll see all the fishing boats come in and out. For those who like art, take a stroll along Skólavörðustígur where you will find many galleries. You’ll then reach Hallgrímskirkja which is Reykjavik’s famous concrete church. We recommend a visit to the Einar Jónsson Museum where you’ll find many unusual sculptures. There are plenty of wonderful authentic restaurants for you to try in Reykjavik along with many cute cafes, which are great for breakfast. Of course, you can’t miss the splendid nature and wildlife. Due to its Iceland sitting on top of a fault line, where tectonic plates meet, it has many geological formations including waterfalls, geothermal springs, geysers, glaciers and mountain ranges, so a fantastic place to visit if you love geography and nature.

What everyone does
in Iceland

It’s a must, and close to the airport so you can either start or end your trip with a visit to the world famous Blue Lagoon Geothermal Spa. The water is said to have age-defying natural minerals and has also known to have healed several medical skin conditions. Due to the geothermal activity which occurs directly below, the water is naturally heated to a toasty 38 degrees centigrade.

What some people do
in Iceland

Head out to sea for a spot of whale watching. Húsavík is Iceland’s whale watching capital and is home to many different species including humpback, Minke and killer (orca) whales. It is also common to spot Dolphins and Porpoises in the Icelandic waters so make sure you have your camera at the ready.

What no one else does
in Iceland

For those looking for an active adventure, a glacier trek is perfect. There are lots of glaciers in Iceland for you to choose from. A professional guide will take you up on top of the glacier and will safely guide you through it, and will point out many of the interesting features. An experience you won’t find in many other countries.
