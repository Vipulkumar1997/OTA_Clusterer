Mexico is the perfect destination if you need a holiday to suit different needs and interests. It is perfect if you like relaxing by the beach and staying in luxurious 5 star resorts but also want to venture out and explore the local culture.

Riviera Maya in Mexico is also famous for have some fantastic diving spots as well. Outside of the wonderful resorts, you will find plenty of things to do and see. Tulum, which is close to Cancun is filled with Mayan Ruins dating back to centuries ago and is also home to the famous Chichen Itza which was named one of the 'new seven wonders of the world'.

Because of this, there is an abundance of wildlife in the park including 120 species of plants and 131 species of animals. There are also 10 cenotes which are cave-like formations filled with natural spring water. There is so much to do and see along with enjoying the impeccable white sandy beaches and gorgeous turquoise seas.
