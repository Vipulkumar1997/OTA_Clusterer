Morocco

IN A NUTSHELL

Situated in the North-West corner of Africa, Morocco's rich and diverse culture is something that makes it somewhat of a hot spot for travellers. Cities such as Fès, Rabat and Marrakech are some of the most unique and historic destinations the world has to offer, packed with souks, markets, and thousands of "hidden gems" secluded in an array of winding traditional Moroccan streets. Casablanca, the hub of Western Morocco, is also home to the spectular Hassan II mosque, the largest mosque in Africa. The sounds, smells, and flavours of these Moroccan cities will infuse your memories for years to come.
Morocco is also home to the infamous Saharan Desert, which boosts some amazing landscapes as well some incredible "kasbahs", and numerous Moroccan villages. The High Atlas Mountain range is also a massive draw if the hustle and bustle of the cities is too much for you!

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for Morocco vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information.

If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.

Awaken your senses and step into a world of colour, spice and culture. Morocco offers a truly unique experience and its wide diversity is why people love it. From the vast deserts to the high atlas mountains, to the buzzing atmosphere in Marrakech there is so much to do and see.

This isn’t the only city which offers a great experience, head to Casablanca and get a feel for the more modern Morocco. Fez on the other hand is known for its historical and cultural lineage which grabs its visitors at first sight.
It is the world’s largest car-free urban area, which makes exploring it rather pleasant and peaceful.

What everyone does in Morocco

Though at first you may be a little apprehensive but if you can get over the rickety mount and dismount, then you must take a camel ride. There are plenty of places you can do this, but if you want a true authentic experience then head to the Moroccan Sahara desert.

What some people do in Morocco

If you are a fan of geography then head to the Todra Gorge which can be found in the High Atlas Mountains. This stunning gorge has been carved out by the Todra and Dades Rivers and stretches 600m. In some parts, the gorge is only 33 feet wide but more than 500 feet deep.

What no one else does in Morocco

The Argania tree may not be the prettiest tree to look at with its thorny branches and untamed leaves, but these trees still seem to attract a select group of admirers. Moroccan goats love to hang out in the trees and can climb right to the very top. Quite an unusual sight! These tree goats can be found in Tamari.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
