IN A NUTSHELL

Out Of Office can show you breathtaking Myanmar from all angles, any time of day. The sunsets from Mandalay Hill are truly spectacular. At dawn, the monks take part in religious rituals, something Out Of Office can give you a rare look at. Inle Lake shows off Myanmar’s culture, where houses and gardens seem to float on the water.

Myanmar, also known as Burma borders India, Laos and Thailand. Like many of its neighbouring countries it has a rich culture and to this day, embraces its traditions. From the elaborate temples in Yangon to the traditional fishing villages in the Inle Lake region, you will see it all in Myanmar.

In Mandalay is often referred to as the ‘cultural capital’. It busy chaotic atmosphere is why people fall in love with it. Once you pass the busy hectic surface discover the rich culture on every street. The city is filled with endless monasteries, pagodas, workshops and teahouses.

Our top traveller's tip would be to head up Mandalay Hill for incredible views of the skyline. Head there at sunrise or sunset to make it extra special!

Head to the Inle Lakes and take a boat ride passing the idyllic villages. Watch the fisherman hard at work catching their daily load - using traditional Burmese methods!

What everyone does in Myanmar

The most famous temple in Myanmar is the Shwedagon Paya in Yangon. This temple is coated in gold leaf and decorated with thousands of diamonds and other precious gems. It is magnificent to witness. In Yangon, you will find plenty of other temples to visit.

What some people do in Myanmar

Make your holiday extra special and add on a hot air balloon ride over Bagan. Set off at sunrise and watch the mist slowly lift above the trees and temple tops.

What no one else does in Myanmar

If you are seeking a break from all the temples and culture, then head to the Minbu Mud volcanoes. An interesting geological feature formed due to trapped methane gas, which causes the mud to bubble away.
