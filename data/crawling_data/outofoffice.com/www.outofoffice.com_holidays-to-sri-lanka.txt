Sri Lanka




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

Sri Lanka boasts a rich culture, with its many Buddhist temples and World Heritage sites. The enticing markets are a must-see, filled with friendly chatter and the aroma of spices you never knew existed. Out Of Office can take you beyond this, however, to appreciate the abundance of wildlife you can find further afield.

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for Sri Lanka vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to Sri Lanka and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.

A country which has so much to offer from incredible wildlife to stunning scenery and a rich historic culture. It is the country you need to spend a good length of time in if you want to visit more than one place.

If you want to see the highlights, we would suggest a 10-day tour, starting in Colombo which has more of an urban city vibe. You will then move onto Dambulla and Sigiriya to see Sigiriya Rock fortress. Then head to Polonnaruwa which is home to many world heritage sites and is surrounded by beautiful landscape.

Your next stop is  Kandy which is known as the capital for "World Heritage Sites" so if you like culture and exploration, this stop is a must! You will then move to Pinnawala which has an incredible elephant sanctuary you can visit. Nuwara Eliya is the next place on your list and is known for its beautiful mountain landscapes and tea fields.

Spend a couple of days in Yala National Park if you are a big wildlife fan, as there are several safaris you can do.

Finally, you will end in Colombo where you can catch a flight to your next destination. We often recommend pairing Sri Lanka with the Maldives as it is only a short flight away and it's nice to combine exploration and adventure with some relaxation time on the beach.

What Everyone Does in Sri Lanka

One of the most well-known National Parks in Sri Lanka, and rightly so. A trip to Yala is a must see. Head out on a 4x4 jeep safari into the park, where your guide will show you the wildlife that lives there including elephants, leopards and crocodiles. You must also visit Sigiriya Rock fortress which was where the emperor Kasyapa lived and reigned for many years. On Top of this humongous rock, you will see the remains of the palace he built which was abandoned when he died.

What Some People Do in Sri Lanka

Known for making some of the best tea in the world, a visit to Dambatenne Tea Factory should be on your list if you like tea. You can see how the teas is made and the process right from it being picked to the fermentation, rolling, drying, cutting, sieving and grading of the tea.

What No One Does in Sri Lanka

Visit Sinharaja Forest Reserve which is the last major undisturbed rainforest in Sri Lanka. For those who love nature and wildlife, you will have a truly unique and authentic experience on this rainforest tour. The only way to reach the reserve is by foot in order to protect the natural habitat. With a canopy of trees reaching 45 m there is plenty of space for all manors of plants and animals to grow and live, including leopards and purple-faced langurs.
