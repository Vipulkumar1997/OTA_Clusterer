Holidays to

Colombia




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

Being the only country in South America to border both the Carribean and Pacific Ocean, Colombia's colonial charm, vibrant culture and incredible landscape is making it some what of a hotspot for travellers (especially as the country is becoming safer and more hospitable). There's plenty to visit and see, from the sun-toasted Caribbean sands to coffee-strewn, emerald-green hilltops in the Zona Cafetera. You also have an amazing mountain range of snowcapped peaks and people that are so warm and welcoming you won't want to leave!

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
