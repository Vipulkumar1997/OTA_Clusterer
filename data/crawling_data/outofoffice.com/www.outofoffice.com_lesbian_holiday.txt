If you are looking for a more substantial itinerary, then island hopping means you can experience a selection of the islands. Mykonos is also a very LGBT-friendly destination.
Iceland

ROMANCE



Lesbian Honeymoons
We know when it comes to planning your wedding, there is so much to think about. Then when you have the added stress of organising your honeymoon, it can be quite overwhelming. The last thing you should feel when planning a honeymoon is stress, which is why we are here to help you enjoy the experience. Our LGBT travel concierge team are here to guide you every step of the way, and create you the best lesbian honeymoon.
We cover pretty much every destination - from the sunny beaches in Mexico to the incredible sunrises in the Serengeti. We want to open the world to everyone, no matter who you love and understand it can be quite daunting for lesbian couples travelling to destinations where LGBT rights may not be recognised.
For this reason, our team offer honest lesbian travel advice and we have worked hard to gather a selection of hotels worldwide who want to work with us as they believe that everyone should be allowed to travel anywhere. An example is the Maldives, known for its glorious sunshine, heavenly resorts and breathtaking beaches making it a perfect honeymoon destination. Even though it is illegal to be gay, we work with a selection of hotels who believe in the same ethos as us, and welcome lesbian couples like any other guests. We ensure you will receive honeymoon benefits and a double bed and receive special treatment - it is your honeymoon after all.
It can be hard to decide on a honeymoon destination if you and your partner like doing different things whilst on holiday. We are here to find you the perfect solution, and often recommend twin centre holidays meaning you both get what you want. South Africa and Mauritius is a great example of this. Start in colourful Cape Town, known for its spirited atmosphere and welcoming lesbian scene. Then head to the winelands and experience the vast rolling hills and picturesque landscape. Follow the garden route to Port Elizabeth and visit one of the many game reserves where you can experience wildlife like never before. Your final stop is Mauritius, a beautiful tropical island off the east coast, known for its affluent boutique resorts and unbeatable all-year-round sunshine. This itinerary is great if you want culture and exploration combined with 5-star luxury and relaxation.
Alternatively, if you are a couple who simply love to kick back and relax, then Riviera Maya in Mexico is the perfect lesbian honeymoon destination. With plenty of magnificent all-inclusive luxury resorts to pick from including Secrets Akumal and Zoetry Paraiso your stay is sure to be memorable.
Our travel concierge team frequently get asked by lesbian couples “Should I change my passport name before my honeymoon?”. It is important all your travel documents are up to date at the time of travel and the name you book with matches the name on your current passport.
We advise waiting to change your passport name until later if your honeymoon is immediately after your wedding day to avoid any complications. You don’t want to turn up the airport and be told you can’t board the plane!

LESBIAN TRAVEL LAWS



LGBT Holidays and the Law
With laws relating to same-sex marriage differing from country to country it is essential you are given the correct advice. At OutOfOffice.com we are experts in LGBT travel, and therefore are forever refreshing and updating our knowledge on the latest laws in destination. We will always give you the most transparent advice and will never try to hide anything from you. Knowing the reality is important so that you don’t get caught in any potential sticky situations whilst abroad. We always try to make your travel dream into a reality, however also believe that if your safety may be at risk that we give you the most honest advice and find you a perfect alternative destination.
It is also important to note that the reality in many countries is somewhat different to its laws. The Maldives is technically under Islamic law, which means it is illegal to be gay or lesbian. However we have selected a range of hotels who we are proud to say treat same-sex couples like any other guests, offering them double beds and honeymoon benefits.
We want to open the world to everyone. Many lesbian travellers come to us saying they are put off by travelling to certain places as they are worried about other people’s judgement. As much as we would like to, we can’t unfortunately control other people’s perceptions and can’t guarantee that you will be encounter-free on your trip, but we also recognise that most lesbian people are used to dealing with certain prejudices and by making them aware of the current laws this will help them to be more mindful when in the public eye. In many countries personal display of affection are frowned upon even for straight couples. It is about respecting the culture you are experiencing, even if it does mean you can’t hold hands with your partner. In the Maldives, we advise you don’t hold hands in the airport, however in the resort it becomes a lot easier.
If you are a lesbian couple and are travelling with your children, it is important you have the necessary documents with you when travelling. Some countries will only recognise one parent as the legal guardian. If you are unsure which documents you need, contact the Foreign Office if you are a British citizen or the local embassy for your country in the relevant destination. If you have adopted a child, make sure you carry the adoption papers with you at all times.
As with all our trips, it’s a prerequisite that you have adequate travel insurance for the holiday you book. Whilst we do not sell travel insurance at Out Of Office, we partner with
Emerald Life
who offer the service.
