Mauritius




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

Crystal blue lagoons, reefs and beaches lined by palm trees create a paradise on the volcanic island of Mauritius. Home to the now-extinct Dodo, it’s an idyllic spot for those who love nature, with some of the world’s rarest plants and animals hiding away in the lush rainforests and waterfalls that scatter throughout the mountains of this pretty island. A venture into the capital of Port Louis can lead you to an electrifying time at the famous Champs de Mars racecourse, or a relaxing night exploring its vibrant blend of shops, bars and restaurants alongside the waterfront. 
Consider combining a trip to Mauritius with a few nights in nearby gay friendly Reunion Island.

If you are looking for the perfect destination to relax and unwind, whilst surrounded by beautiful beaches and great hills to hike on, then a holiday to Mauritius is the one for you.

We work with some incredible resorts which all offer a luxurious experience. If you have a modern taste, then we would suggest staying at the
LUX Belle Mare
, or if you are looking for a more traditional experience, then our suggestion would be the
Angsana Balaclava
.

Opt for all inclusive and escape from responsibility and stress and if you are looking for a spot of pampering then most of the resorts have top quality spas, which offer a fantastic range of treatments.

For those who are looking to explore outside of their resorts, then there are several. PADI diving centres which offer scuba diving lessons and tours. There are some wonderful coral reefs around the island waiting to be explored.

What Everyone Does in Mauritius

Fly to Mauritius International airport and spend a week or two relaxing at the resort. Enjoy the delicious cuisine, beautiful accommodation and soak up as much sunshine as possible.

What Some People Do in Mauritius

Why not take some time to explore outside of the resort. There are lots of activities waiting for to be discovered. You can go quad biking and hike in the mountains along with a trip down to the beach to test out the many water sports available for you to try.

What No One Does in Mauritius

For those who are looking to combine adventure with relaxation, visit the island of Reunion which is close to Mauritius. Here there are loads of adventurous activities for you to try. Spend a few days here, then head over to Mauritius to relax.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
