Best Gay Weddings
Mexico
If you are looking to plan a gay beach wedding then Riviera Maya is the perfect destination. The beautiful stretch of Caribbean coastline is blessed with impeccable white sandy beaches, tropical turquoise waters and incredible luxurious five-star hotels. Say your vows at sunset on the beach followed by a delicious gourmet meal. Spend the rest of your time exploring the Mayan Ruins, including one of the ‘new seven wonders of the world’. The area is also renowned for scuba diving, with plenty of coral reefs to explore. Many of the resorts we work with have qualifies PADI diving instructors on site as well. Elsewhere in Mexico one of our favourite destinations is Puerto Vallarta. On the west coast of Mexico, the beach destination is ideal for a gay wedding in Mexico.
Bora Bora and French Polynesia
Bora Bora is one of our standout gay wedding destinations. It is one of the few countries where you can have a legal ceremony and what's more, you are situated in a tropical haven. We can arrange an intimate ceremony on the beach, where you will have a traditional Polynesian ceremony along with all the extra arrangements you’d expect from a South Pacific wedding including flower lei garlands, a professional photographer and a hair and makeup artist. Experience your wedding and stay in an overwater villa and enjoy the sunsets each evening as a newlywed couple. The resorts in Bora Bora are one-of-a-kind, in keeping with traditional Polynesian decor and each is adorned fantastic facilities. For the actual legal ceremony you need to get married on the island’s City Hall in a quick ceremony before heading to the beach for your symbolic nuptials.
South Africa
One of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, Cape Town is the up-and-coming destination for gay weddings. With its pretty coastal location and vibrant atmosphere, Cape Town is perfect if you are looking for a city wedding. There is lots to do during your stay as well, from hiking up Table Mountain to exploring Boulders Penguin Colony. Cape Town’s gay scene is big, with plenty of gay bars and clubs so there is plenty of evening activity to keep you entertained.

The Garden Route runs along the south coast of South Africa and makes the perfect location if you are looking for a gay beach wedding. Picture yourself saying your vows at sunset with the gentle sound of waves lapping upon the shore. If you want to go all out, then head to one of South Africa’s many game reserves for your gay wedding.
Hawaii
Hawaii is a great gay wedding destination if you are looking for a tropical island setting. This archipelago is made up of eight main islands, all which are easy to travel between. We often suggest you visit a couple so you get to experience their unique charm and character. Honolulu is known for its cosmopolitan city vibes whereas Maui is fantastic if you are interested in nature as it is known for its stunning mountain ranges and breathtaking valleys. Visit Haleakala which forms more than 75% of the island. Head to Kauai, which is also known as the "Garden Island" due to its tropical climate, gorgeous waterfalls and exotic vegetation. If you choose to visit Kauai head to the Waimea Canyon and experience the vast openness.

Symbolic Weddings

In many countries where same-sex marriage isn’t legal, you can still have a gay symbolic wedding. This means you would have a legal ceremony prior to departure and then you would have your symbolic ceremony abroad in whichever destination you decide on. The good thing about symbolic weddings is that it gives you a host of further destinations to choose from where you will still receive a warm welcome despite the lack of full equality.






Japan
If you are looking for a totally unique experience, then head to Japan and celebrate your love by having a Japan gay wedding. Even though same-sex marriage is not recognised in Japan, you can have a symbolic ceremony. It is the perfect destination if you are looking to get married in somewhere historic. Dress in traditional Kimono wedding attire and say your vows in a traditional Japanese temple. You will still have all the necessary preparations including a wedding fitting and styling. After your ceremony, enjoy a traditional Japanese wedding meal to round off the evening. Japan is a country filled with rich heritage and culture, there is plenty to do after your gay wedding.

The gorgeous Mediterranean sunsets, the traditional Greek cuisine and the beautiful hotels make Greece a wonderful destination if you are looking for a gay symbolic wedding.

We can arrange for you to have official wedding photos and a pre-wedding makeover. Enjoy a delicious wedding meal to celebrate with your loved one. After your ceremony spend some time exploring the islands. Our favourites are Mykonos, which is famous for its gay-friendly atmosphere and beautiful beaches. Santorini is another favourite and known for its boutique hotels and quaint towns. We recommend visiting a couple of the islands as they each have their own unique character.






Aruba

Have a break from the beach and head to the Arikok National Wildlife Park and jump off the rock edges into the warm waters.

The country recently allowed civil partnerships, but not full marriage. Have your ceremony in Venice, a city known for its romantic ambience and architecture. Picture yourself in the canal lined cobbled streets, or take a charming ride in a gondola. Head to Florence and experience the abundance of Renaissance architecture on every corner. Known for being a laid back city, it is the perfect place to unwind and relax as a newlywed couple.

Gay Weddings





Wedding checklist



Planning a wedding abroad is arguably more stressful than one at home. Depending how far you intend to travel, you will likely not have seen the venue before you arrive and there can always be a difference between what you pictured to the reality.

It’s important to establish what you want from your wedding. Do you want your marriage to be recognised back home or would you rather get married in the UK before you travel and then have a symbolic beach wedding abroad?

There are a lot of questions to answer and when planning a gay wedding it’s important to ensure you are aware of the laws involved too. We’ve planned a number of same-sex weddings to destinations worldwide and are expanding our portfolio all the time.
Submit an enquiry
and one of our expert team will give you a call for an initial consultation to start the ball rolling.





Minimoon



Gay minimoons are great if, for whatever reason, you are unable to travel to your honeymoon destination. It may be the wrong season for that particular country or you might not be able to get a lot of time off work. A minimoon is a fantastic solution if you still want to have a break with your new partner straight after your wedding.
Whether it’s a weekend away to the
Lapland Igloo hotel
, or a city break to Rome, there are endless potentials and you can make it as fancy as you like. The good thing is once your mini moon is over, you still have your honeymoon to look forward to!






Gay Wedding Destinations
