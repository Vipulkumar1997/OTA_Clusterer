Best Honeymoon Destinations In

January

For honeymoons in January, head to Riviera Maya in
Mexico
. Enjoy the beautiful beaches, glorious sunshine and fabulous five star luxury resorts. The area is famous for its Mayan historical ruins which are amazing to visit and explore. The area is famous for its beautiful coral reefs and tropical turquoise waters. Riviera Maya is one of the best honeymoon destinations as it is home to some of the world’s best all inclusive resorts. Ideal if you are looking to totally relax and enjoy life as a newlywed couple.

February

For honeymoons in February head to
Thailand
and enjoy the vast range of cultural attractions, incredible cuisine and beautiful cities. Start in Bangkok and immerse yourself in hustling bustling city life, the zooming tuk tuks and chaotic streets are wonderful to witness. Experience the other side to Thailand and head down south where you can visit Phuket, Koh Samui and Koh Lanta, three of Thailand's most beautiful tropical islands. The beautiful white sandy beaches, the stunning resorts and the romantic island vibes makes it the ideal place to round off your romantic honeymoon.

March

For honeymoons in March,
Sri Lanka
and the
Maldives
makes the perfect twin centre honeymoon. Also good if you and your partner like doing different thing. In Sri Lanka you will experience the rich culture and fascinating historical sites dotted all over the country. Head to the famous Yala National Park and experience the fascinating wildlife before heading to the Maldives for some well deserved sunshine. Make it extra special and stay in an overwater villa for the best sunset views. Wake yourself every morning with a refreshing dip in the lagoon which is right on your backdoor step. Enjoy a delicious breakfast on your private terrace as you watch the world slowly float by. The Maldives is a bucket list destination, so what better way to tick it off than for your romantic honeymoon.

April

For honeymoons in April head to
Canada
and see this beautiful country in the height of spring. Spend time in Calgary before heading up to Banff to experience the stunning landscape and breathtaking mountain ranges. Your next stop is Vancouver which is known for its beautiful unity of the city and landscape. The tall skyscrapers merge in with the bays and the mountains as if they have been there the whole time. Take a cable car ride up Grouse Mountain for unbeatable views of the skyline. The state of British Columbia is a goldmine for nature and activities, a visit to the beautiful islands of Haida Gwaii is a must. Take a boat cruise and explore the archipelago of 450 islands. Of course, no visit to Canada is complete without a trip to Niagara Falls. One of the most majestic land formations in the world, you can take a boat tour which brings you up close and personal

May

Head to
South Africa
and
Mauritius
for a honeymoon in May. The weather perfect with temperatures averaging 24 degrees. Start in cultural Cape Town and enjoy the energetic atmosphere. This cosmopolitan city is amazing to experience, from the wide range of restaurants to try from the incredible range of activities on offer including, hiking up Table Mountain and boat trips along the waterfront.

Your next stop is tropical Mauritius, which is known for its beautiful boutique hotels and palm tree beaches. A perfect way to finish your romantic adventure.

June

For honeymoons in June, our favourite destination is
French Polynesia
. This beautiful archipelago is located in the middle of the South Pacific Ocean. Its isolation is one of the reasons it’s so special and makes it the perfect destination if you are looking for an intimate honeymoon experience. You could always spend a few days in LA to break up your journey and experience the hollywood movie star life. Then head to Tahiti where you will be met by one of our representatives who will then escort you to next flight. Our favourite island in French polynesia is Bora Bora. From the breathtaking tropical lagoons to the outstanding all inclusive hotels, your stay is sure to feel lavish and exclusive. Since French Polynesia is a once in a lifetime destination, we recommend an island hopping itinerary so you get to experience a few of the island's characters. If you are looking to take your honeymoon to the next level, then why not spend some time on a private Catamaran and explore some of the smaller islands as well.

July

For honeymoons in July, head to
Greece
and discover the many islands in the Mediterranean sea. Start in Athens and discover the beautiful classical Greek historical sites including the Parthenon and the Acropolis. There are plenty of islands to pick from but we have selected a couple of our favourites. Start in Mykonos which is known for its beautiful beaches and stunning scenery. Mykonos as good nightlife if you are looking for entertainment in the evenings as there are plenty of bars, clubs and restaurants. Your next stop will be Santorini which is known for its beautiful boutique hotels, take in the gorgeous sunshine and spend your days relaxing on the beaches.

Honeymoon Checklist

There is a lot to think about when picking your honeymoon destination. Not only do you have to think about planning the logistics, but you also have to organise a wedding as well. We are here to alleviate some of the stress and make your honeymoon the holiday of a lifetime.

Type of Honeymoon

Choosing the destination can be hard for some couples if you have different interests and then deciding what type of honeymoon you would like is the next step. If you are a couple who can’t decide, then a brilliant solution is a twin-centre holiday. It means you can divide it up so each of you get what you want. If one of you likes culture and adventure and the other prefers relaxation and the beach, then Sri Lanka and the Maldives will tick all the boxes. Sri Lanka has so much to offer from the beautiful temples to the fascinating wildlife parks. The Maldives is such a romantic destination, with beautiful island resorts, incredible overwater villa accommodation and all inclusive board, it makes the perfect end to your luxury honeymoon. Depending on when you are planning on having your honeymoon could also influence your honeymoon destination as certain places are seasonal and therefore are better during certain months. See our calendar list of the best honeymoon destinations for each month.

Passport

Before you travel make sure you check that your passport is in date and that it also matches your name. We advise that if you are going to take your partner’s surname and your honeymoon is soon after your wedding day, that you wait until after your honeymoon to change your name as the process can take some time. You don’t want to turn up at the airport and be stopped at passport control because your passport is incorrect.

Mini Moon

Mini moons are perfect if for whatever reason you are unable to travel to your chosen honeymoon destination. It may be out of season or you may not have enough annual leave left. Many couples still want to have a break immediately after their wedding which is why mini moons are a fantastic solution. A romantic city break in Venice or a snowy trip to the Lapland hotel in Finland are some of the trips you could consider. You can then have your official honeymoon later on in the year.
