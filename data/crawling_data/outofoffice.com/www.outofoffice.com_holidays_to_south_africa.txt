South Africa




























ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

A truly unforgettable experience, South Africa really has it all: sun, sea and the adventures of a lifetime. Africa’s most alluring golden beach lies in wait for pure relaxation in Plettenberg Bay, whilst the lush winelands in Stellenbosch and Paarl provide relaxing picturesque views, as you while away the hours with top-quality wines from the very vineyards you overlook.  Luxury establishments can be found all over the port city capital of Cape Town, where you can board a cable car to climb to the top of Table Mountain which towers above. A thirst for adventure can be quenched through one of South Africa’s magical iconic safari trips, where you will catch views of the incredible ‘Big 5’ game and more, including big cats, hippos, giraffes and rhinos.

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for South Africa vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to South Africa and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.

What to do in South Africa



html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




South Africa is a diverse country which offers a wide range of holiday choices. From a South African safari to sampling fine South African wines in the vineyards of Stellenbosch and Franschhoek, the country offers something for everyone.

Most people start in Cape Town where you can visit the iconic Table Mountain and Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for eighteen years of his incarceration. With beautiful beaches and stunning views, the city is a cosmopolitan haven.

Then pick up a car and head into the winelands to spend a few nights in quaint accommodation ensuring you sample the finest South African wine from the very vineyards in which they are produced.

Driving the Garden Route is also a popular South African holiday idea. With its incredible coastal vistas, it’s impossible not to be seduced by the stunning natural beauty. Enjoy South African wildlife, beaches and beautiful lakes and lagoons alongside majestic mountain landscapes that make the Garden Route a bucket-list experience.

No South African holiday would be complete without experiencing a traditional South African safari and game drive. The sheer range of South African wildlife on offer means that finding a quaint resort to enjoy a your favourite cocktail as the sun sets is not optional, it’s a must.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
