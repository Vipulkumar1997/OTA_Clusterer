Your honeymoon will be the trip of a lifetime and choosing the right destination can be tricky when there is so much choice.

That is where we come in. We specialise in

Best Gay Honeymoon Destinations

No two people are the same and no two honeymoons are the same. Here are some of our favourite destinations, but we really like to customise your honeymoon so that it's unique to you.





INSPIRATION



Best Gay Honeymoons
Bora Bora
French Polynesia and its islands like Bora Bora are a perfect gay honeymoon destination. Gay marriage is legal in the South Pacific country and so the islands are extremely welcoming to LGBT couples. We have a close relationship with a number of our favourite properties there and ensure that you get the best honeymoon benefits.
Sri Lanka and the Maldives
If you want to combine culture with the beach then this itinerary is perfect. Start in Sri Lanka and head on a circular tour of the country where you will visit places including Dambulla, Nuwara Eliya and Yala National Park. We recommend having your own private driver in the country - not as expensive as you think. Then head to the Maldives and stay in a luxurious overwater bungalow for that iconic honeymoon to remember.
Mykonos and Santorini
If you are seeking the perfect gay friendly European honeymoon destination, then Mykonos and Santorini will definitely tick all the boxes. Experience each island's unique charming character and allow yourself to sink into an Aegean paradise, with Mykonos being renowned for its quaint tavernas and Santorini the idyllic romantic destination.
South Africa and Mauritius
Perfect for a same-sex couple as Cape Town is known for being one of South Africa’s most LGBT cities. Soak up the vibrant atmosphere here before heading to the beautiful winelands and experience the stunning landscape. Then drive the Garden route which follows the South Coast. End your time in South Africa with a safari before heading to neighbouring Mauritius for a relaxing beach holiday.
Cambodia and Vietnam
Start in Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia known for its rich culture. Fly to Siem Reap where you can visit the many Hindu temples, including the famous Angkor Wat. Fly up to Hanoi and work your way down Vietnam, stopping at Halong Bay, Hue and ending in Ho Chi Minh.
Canada
Known for being one of the best gay friendly destinations in the world, and perfect for a honeymoon if you want to combine adventure with exploring a city. Start in Banff and take in the fresh mountain air and stunning scenery. You can then head to Vancouver and experience this beautiful city. Alternatively think of a trip to Eastern Canada where you can visit Toronto, Algonquin National Park and Montreal.
Iceland
Iceland is renowned for its geological features and so you'll find incredible waterfalls, geysirs, glaciers and volcanoes in this beautiful country. For a sense of adventure go during the Northern Lights season and ensure you go snowmobiling too as well as visiting the renowned Blue Lagoon - known for its healing properties.






ROMANCE



Honeymoon Checklist
When you not only have a wedding to plan but a honeymoon as well, it can be quite stressful. We’ve compiled our list of things to think about when planning a honeymoon.
Honeymoon Types
What kind of honeymoon should I go on? We understand that everyone is different. Some couples want to throw themselves into a destination and explore it from top to bottom, whereas others prefer to kick back and relax in a luxurious resort - and some like to do a little bit of both! If you and your new husband or wife have different interests, then
multi-centre holidays
are the perfect solution. It allows you to combine multiple honeymoon destinations into one trip.

Your Names and Passport
We often get asked “do you need to change your passport names when you get married?”. Changing your passport names for your honeymoon means there are a lot of things to consider. As part of getting married you are likely thinking of what your married name will be. In the case of same-sex couples it’s more common to think about a double-barrelled name. You must ensure that when you book your gay or lesbian honeymoon that you think about what will be on your passport at the time you travel. Flights in particular need to be booked in the correct name or you can end up with costly amendment fees. You can apply a new passport in your married name three months before your ceremony and it becomes valid on the day of your wedding. However, it’s important to be aware that some countries won’t issue a visa for a passport that is not yet valid. Some travel companies will advise that it is fine to travel on your old passport but with your wedding certificate in tow. This is sensible advice, but there are places in which people still have problems. As a rule of thumb, we suggest to our clients that it’s best to leave changing your passport names until after you travel. That way you can book your trip in your pre-married names and then not have to worry about any problems that may arise on your trip. Of course, you should also ensure you carry your wedding or civil partnership certificate with you on your honeymoon so you can be sure that you benefit from any honeymoon upgrades that might be on offer to you from the resorts you stay at - and to wave at them at the airport check-in desk to try to blag an upgrade!

Your Budget
Everyone wants their honeymoon to be holiday of a lifetime, and we know they can be expensive. Our gift voucher service means your wedding guests can contribute to your honeymoon. Don’t settle for a third set of salad servers you don’t need when you can have a contribution to your honeymoon.
LGBT Laws
For same-sex couples, we understand you may be apprehensive about staying in hotels in destinations which may not be known for their LGBT friendliness. Our product team have developed fantastic relationships with hotels all over the world who believe in the same ethos as us. We ensure you will have a double bed in your room, receive honeymoon benefits and are treated like any other guests in the hotel - even in some destinations which may not be seen as traditionally gay-friendly.
