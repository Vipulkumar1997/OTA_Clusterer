Sweden

IN A NUTSHELL

Sweden is famed for its sea and cityscapes, and rightfully so - lakes, forests, mountains and thousands of coastal islands bring this impressive country together. With a rich royal history and abundance of culture (where even the train station are decorated as modern art murals), its capital city of Stockholm is home to palaces, parks and museums that beg to be visited and explored. And of course you can’t forget the ABBA museum in Stockholm.

When you think of Sweden, you think snow-capped peaks, Northern lights, and 24 hours of sunlight in the summer. With it being the largest of the Scandinavian countries, it actually has a lot more to offer than you may think.

The capital city Stockholm is spread over 14 island but getting around is easy due to the 57 bridges which keep everything well connected. With its own unique styling and nordic themes, it’s such a lovely city to wander around.

Of course, in the North, you have the spectacular Northern Lights display which can be seen during the winter months. The Abisko National Park is definitely worth a visit if you like nature and outdoor activities. One of the best places to see the Northern lights as well!

For those seeking more of a cultural experience, head to Visby which is a picturesque town on the Swedish island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Imagine idyllic cottages, a tangle of cobbled streets all decorated with flowers and the ruins of Gothic churches.

What everyone does in Sweden

Stockholm is the capital city of Sweden and has a lot to offer. Its elegant buildings and picturesque ports make it a wonderful place to simply wander around. There are plenty of things to do, including a trip to the Vasamuseet which is a maritime museum displaying a 17th century ship that has ever been salvaged, the 64-gun warship Vasa sank in 1628 on her first voyage.

What some people do in Sweden

Swedish Lapland is such a fantastic destination to visit, especially if you are looking for a memorable family holiday - one that the kids will never forget. The incredible snowy landscape, the magical Northern Lights and the cosy lodges make Swedish Lapland an incredible destination.

What no one else does in Sweden

Head out into the Baltic Sea and visit one of the smaller islands off the coast of Sweden. In particular, we recommend a trip to Gotland, which is famous for its tranquillity and enchanting landscape.
