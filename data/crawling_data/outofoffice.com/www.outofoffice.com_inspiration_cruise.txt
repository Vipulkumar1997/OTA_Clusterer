What better way to see the world then by visiting a new destination each day. At Out Of Office we’ve handpicked the cruise lines and sailing groups we recommend. From gay river cruises to gay sailing trips, we have a host of interesting itineraries with multiple departure dates that will allow you to meet new people and create memories to last a lifetime. We’ve chosen our portfolio based on extended time in each port and overnight stays in some of our most popular destinations to allow you to enjoy the atmosphere in the evening. All the cruise lines we work with are gay friendly and have excellent credentials for being welcoming to all. Visit multiple ports on each of our itineraries rather than staying put in one place and enjoy the excellent food and entertainment on board too. From river cruises to luxury round the world cruises, we can help so get in touch with us and one of our sales concierge team will be in touch to plan your perfect cruise itinerary.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
