Italy is a wonderful country waiting to be discovered by you. The word ‘romance’ originates from Rome and rightly so, with it now known as the ‘city of romance’. The streets are lined with beautiful buildings and practically every street has a water fountain on it. Toss a coin into the Trevi fountain and legend has it if you throw three coins into the fountain, the first ensures you will return to Rome, the second means you will find romance and third means you will get married. It is these lovely stories and legends which make Rome such a magical place. With so many interesting places to visit and so many historical sites, you’ll never have a dull moment. There isn’t an ugly building in site and your stomach is sure to be satisfied with the many pizzerias and fine dining Italian restaurants. Venice is one of the most picturesque places Italy has to offer, the labyrinth of tiny canals, the floating buildings and stunning architecture makes it a fantastic place to simply wander. The great thing is, in Italy is there are so many places to visit, it is great if you are looking for a longer holiday. We can put a personalised itinerary together for you, enabling to visit wherever you would like. From the beautiful coastlines of Capri, the Amalfi Coast and Sicily. Visit the awesome Pompeii or for those looking for luxury take a stroll through the boutiques of Milan before heading up to the stunning Lake Como and Lake Garda.

What everyone does
in Italy

A visit to Italy must include a trip to Rome. Whether you spend one night there, or 5 nights, this versatile city is perfect for a short break but since there is so much to do, you can easily extend your trip. Visit the Colosseum, and it is definitely worth viewing it from the inside. A trip to the Vatican city is also recommended where you can see the Sistine chapel, St Peter’s Basilica and the Vatican Museum.

What some people do
in Italy

The Amalfi coastline is absolutely beautiful. If you are looking for luxurious boutique hotels, gorgeous coastline and quaint charming villages then the Amalfi coast will tick all the boxes. Sorrento is one of the well-known towns. Its stylish shops and stunning architecture makes it a great place to stay if you want an authentic experience.

What no one else does
in Italy

Why not venture on a little interrail adventure. Start in Venice and then visit Florence, Pisa and Rome. Each city is so different from the next it’s great when you experience them all. Trains in Italy are good or there are flight options in between cities as well.

You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary
