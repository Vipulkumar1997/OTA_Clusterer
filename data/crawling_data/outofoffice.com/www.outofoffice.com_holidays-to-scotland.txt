What to do in Scotland



html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




A country which still very much embraces its true heritage. Visit Scotland and immerse yourself in the abundance of tartan, haggis and bagpipes! Start in Edinburgh, which although very much has tradition at heart, has its own modern atmosphere. Explore the numerous boutique cafes, homemade tartan shops, and of course, during your visit you must climb Arthur's seat for the best views of Edinburgh. Glasgow offers a very different experience, with its grungy buildings and modern atmosphere.

What everyone does
in Scotland

With several flights departing from London every day, a trip to Edinburgh couldn’t be easier. Visit Edinburgh Castle, taste the local food Haggis and explore the smaller streets lined with boutique shops and cafes. Get used to the constant sound of Bagpipes in the background and don’t forget to pick up a tartan scarf during your visit.

What some people do
in Scotland

With only a 55-minute train journey between Glasgow and Edinburgh, you would be silly not to visit both whilst in Scotland. Besides, these two cities might as well be in different countries they are so different. With Edinburgh's beautiful architecture and traditional atmosphere, compared to Glasgow's arty modern vibe, it’s a great experience to compare the two.

What no one else does
in Scotland

Open to the elements but blessed with peace and rawness. The Scottish highlands are the perfect place to visit if you want gorgeous scenery and ultimate tranquillity. With lots of great walking areas, the Scottish Highlands are perfect for the outdoors and adventurous type.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
