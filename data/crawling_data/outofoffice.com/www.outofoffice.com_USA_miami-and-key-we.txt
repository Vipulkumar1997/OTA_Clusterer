Miami

Arrive into Miami and pick up your rental car from Miami International Airport. Drive to your Out Of Office recommended hotel where you'll check in and stay for three nights in beautiful South Beach.

Explore the nightlife, the beaches and the surrounding area to soak up the Miami vibe in its countless cafes and boutique lined boulevards.

Stay in a choice of hotels including our recommendations of The Raleigh, The Redbury and SLS South Beach.

Key West

Drive from Miami to Key West - via the Everglades - and either drop your rental car on arrival or hold on to it. The beautiful Florida Keys are a small set of tropical islands off the southern tip of Florida and are renowned
for their laid-back vibe and inclusivity. It's a destination for that thrives on ocean live - fishing, boating and scuba diving.

Duval Street in Key West is famous for its many bars, Mallory Square's nightly Sunset Celebration which sees
visitors from all over the world come to watch the stunning Gulf of Mexico pink and red sunset. You'll find magicians, jugglers, clowns, psychics, local musicians, artists, and food vendors that combine for an incredible cultural experience.

Stay in a choice of resorts. Our favourites are gay-only Alexanders, gay friendly La Te Da and ultra luxe Little Palm Island.

South Beach

Famous for its fun vibey atmosphere, head to South Beach and experience the typical sterotype of Miami. Start the day with a champagne breakfast at one of the beach club bars. Play games on the long stretch of sandy beach with friends, and have a dip in the lovely warm sea. Head to Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue where you may recognise the scenery as every movie that was every filmed in Miami was filmed here.

Little Havana

If you want to get a hint of Cuban culture then head to Little Havana. Pick up your Cuban cigars and take a stroll around the many shops and cafes scattered in the area whilst the air is filled with the faint sound of Latin music. Check out the Azucar Ice Cream Company and get a taste of true Cuban ice-cream.

Miami Beach Botanical Gardens

Mix up your holiday and head to the beautiful Botanical Gardens. Escape from the busy non-stop city centre to this tranquil paradise. Wander around the 2.5 acre gardens and take in the aroma of nature. Relax under a palm tree or fill your basket with local produce from the farmer's market.

Clubs and Bars

For the party animals out there, Miami has a great party scene with lots of great bars and clubs for you to check out. If you are looking for glitz and glamour, then head to club Cameo. This renovated art deco movie theatre attracts a swanky crowd, so make sure you dress the part. Miami is also filled with loads of great bars on the beach. If you don't fancy putting your dancing shoes on, then head to Nikki beach club and enjoy a cocktail on the beach.

Whilst you are there, why not fill your time with some of our suggested activities.

Head out onto the water and sail around the coastline on a gorgeous yacht. We can organise gay only sailing trips and can also arrange private boat tours.

If you fancy getting a little closer to the sea itself, then why not try stand up paddle boarding. This has become very popular in many coastal towns, including Key West. Imagine yourself 'Walking on water' as you glide around the shores, you will be lead by a guide.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
