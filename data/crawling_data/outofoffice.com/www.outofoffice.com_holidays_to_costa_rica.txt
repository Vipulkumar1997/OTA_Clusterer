Costa Rica

IN A NUTSHELL

Leave your stress at home, because it's not welcome here! Costa Rica is where the word paradise was meant for.  It's one of the most biologically diverse places in the world with dense jungles full of monkeys, sloths, reptiles and other tropical life, reaching out onto stunning white sand beaches. Nature is perfectly paired with adventure in this tiny Central American country and gives its visitors an unlimited number of opportunities to get as active, or as relaxed as you like!  Soak away an afternoon in a hidden hot springs waterfall oasis, zipline through the thick jungle on one of the world's longest ziplines, take a surfing lesson from a local Tico, hike onto the hardened lava flow of an active volcano, or surround yourself with wild spider monkeys, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunities are endless!
Costa Rica is also known as the most gay-friendly country in Central America, with a lively gay social scene in San Jose and Manuel Antonio, and some of the friendliest local Latin people you could ever meet!  This is a true Latin experience from the people, to the Salsa dancing, to the Gallo Pinto for breakfast.

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for Costa Rica vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to Costa Rica and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.

What to do in Costa Rica

The list of things to do is endless. Costa Rica has beaches, rainforests, ravines to white water raft down and a capital city which has so much culture for you to find out about.

The capital city San Jose might not be the first destination you wish to visit on your trip, but often people are pleasantly surprised. If you can get over the noisy traffic and concrete buildings then you will discover the city’s charm and character. Visit the historical neighbourhood of Barrio Amón which is covered in colonial architecture.

If you are looking to test your paddling skills then head to the Turrialba Area. The Río Reventazón River have carved its way through the Cordillera Central over time which is one of central America's best rafting spots.

Visit the Parque Nacional Volcán which is where Volcán Arenal is located. This volcano lay dormant for 42 years until its explosion in 2010. Though it may have stopped spewing ash and lava, this park is still a worthy visit as the volcanic soil means there is plenty of beautiful vegetation to gaze at.

Visit the village of Tortuguero which is only accessible by boat or plane. This little village is best known for the hoards of sea turtles it attracts (Tortuguero translates as turtle catcher’).

What everyone does in Costa Rica

Because there is so many wonderful places you can visit in Costa Rica, most people tend to do a little tour of the country which takes you to the main places including San Jose, Arenal, Poas Volcano and Tortuguero. Check out our luxury Costa Rica tour for some ideas.

What some people do in Costa Rica

Visit the Aviarios del Caribe: Sloth Sanctuary where you can get close to these insanely cute animals. The sanctuary is there to protect the species and raise awareness about their endangerment.

What no one else does in Costa Rica

For the dog lovers out there visit the Territorio de Zaguates (Land of Strays). Costa Rica has over one million stray dogs with the number rising every day but the Territorio de Zaguates takes in stray dogs to try and control the problem. The dogs are spayed and given a health check first and looked after by onsite vets. The aim it to eventually find each dog a loving home!
