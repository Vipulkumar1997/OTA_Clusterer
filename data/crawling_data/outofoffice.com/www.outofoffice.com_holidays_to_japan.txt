A country rich in culture, history and variety. When you visit Japan your eyes will be opened to what seems like a whole new world.

Your first stop has to be Tokyo, spend your time exploring this fascinating city. Visit the famous Meiji Jingu which is the shrine to the late Emperor Meiji and is also a popular destination for Japanese weddings, so if you are lucky you may catch a glimpse of a traditional ceremony.

Tokyo is like a time machine, with a combination of the old and new merged together. Take a stroll through Omotesando which is a tree lined avenue lined with little shops. Take a subway ride to Asakusa which is known as ‘old town’ and home to the Sensoji (“Asakusa Kannon”) Temple (Tokyo’s oldest temple).

Next, journey to Hakone which is home to Mt Fuji which is also known as Fuji-san. This active volcano is located in the Fuji Hakone National Park where you will also find plenty of natural hot springs. Take a stroll around the town and immerse yourself in the true authentic Japanese living.

Head to Hiroshima, which was the first target for an atomic bomb. The city now has a vibrant atmosphere with plenty to do and see.

Visit Kyoto which is a like a breath of fresh air. With the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove the city is infused with green freshness. There are lots of temples to visit so if you like culture, Kyoto should definitely be on your list.

What everyone does in
Japan

Starting in Tokyo is a must. This city never stops moving, and its modern vibrant atmosphere is awesome to experience. From the endless number of incredible food spots, shops and rich cultural sites, there is never a dull moment in this cosmopolitan city.

What some people do in
Japan

Why not take a day trip from Tokyo and head to the Fox Village (Zao Fox Village). If you are an animal lover, you will fall in love with these furry friends.


What no one else does in
Japan

Take a trip to the Narusawa Hyoketsu Ice Cave near Mount Fuji were formed by a volcanic eruption. Descend the steps into the cave and be amazed by the huge ice crystals which catch and reflect the light beautifully.
