IN A NUTSHELL

Spanning low-lying plains, the stunning Mekong Delta, towering mountains and the dazzling Gulf of Thailand coastline, Cambodia is a nation full of surprises. Culture and history lovers will marvel at the ancient ruins of Angkor Wat, a stone temple complex built during the Khmer Empire, whilst those looking to dive into a hubbub of activity will find a home in the bustling capital of Phnom Penh, host of a range of amazing features to lose yourself in exploring. With a riverfront lined with parks, restaurants and bars, the glittering Royal Palace and Silver Pagoda just a step away, and the expansive art deco Central Market at its heart, never a dull moment is to be had in this vivacious country.

If you are looking for somewhere a little off the beaten track then visit Cambodia for your next holiday. It ticks all the boxes, from culture to beaches, to adventure and a luxury.

We have a wonderful itinerary which covers all the highlights you must see. Start in Phnom Penh which is the capital city. Cambodia, although a very welcoming stable country now, has a dark past to it. In the 1970’s the country was ruled by the Khmer Rouge regime where over a million Cambodians were killed.

Their troubled past has shaped the way Cambodians act towards each other, and there is a real sense of gratefulness. In Phnom Penh, see the Royal Palace, the Genocide museum and The Killing Fields. It is a very important part of their culture so it’s worth a visit.

After Phnom Penh head to Siem Reap, which is known as the capital for temples as it is home to the majestic Angkor Wat. The temple is so important that it even is part of the national flag.

Siem Reap is filled with many Hindu and Buddhist temples, each displayed their own uniqueness. Hop on a tuk-tuk and your driver will take you to the best ones.

What everyone does in Cambodia

Visit the capital City Phnom Penh and immerse yourself in the lively buzzing atmosphere. Then head to Siem Reap to see the incredible temples. We have some wonderful itineraries including the
highlights of Cambodia
, which will take you to all the best spots.

What some people do in Cambodia

If you are looking for the best holiday picture, then brave the early hours of the morning and head to Angkor Wat and watch the sunrise over the temple. It is an amazing experience, one you will never forget. Another activity you can do is take a boat trip through the rice fields where you can see the rice farmer's house on stilts, which are built so high up to stop them from flooding. The boat will cruise along the river and end in lake Tonle Sap.

What no one else does in Cambodia

It is not common knowledge that Cambodia has a couple of beautiful resorts which offer overwater bungalow accommodation including Song Saa Private island. This wonderful resort not only offers luxury accommodation, but also embraces the nature and wildlife which surrounds it and believes in sustainable and eco-friendly living.
