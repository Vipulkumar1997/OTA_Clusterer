The perfect destination for those who are seeking a true authentic experience. The neverending list of adventurous journeys to embark on make it a wonderful country to discover if you love exploring new places.

There is of course, the iconic Annapurna Circuit Trek, or venture on a trek to the Everest Base camp. Head to Kathmandu to experience the beautiful temples, draped in colourful prayer flags and the Hanuman Dhoka which is Kathmandu's Royal Palace.

Head to Lumbini to see the Maya Devi Temple which sits on the site of the Buddha's birth. When visiting, you must remove your shoes at the gate as a sign of respect.

For those seeking a wildlife experience, then head to the Chitwan National Park where you will find herds of elephants roaming the park along with other animals including leopards and sloth bears.

What everyone does in Nepal

A trip to Kathmandu is a must. If you like learning about new cultures then Kathmandu is the perfect place with its unique Buddhist temples. If you can’t wait to get stuck into something adventurous then Kathmandu is famous for having an excellent white water rafting experience.

What some people do in Nepal

Chitwan National Park has a specific part of the park dedicated to elephant breeding. This centre is around 3km west of Sauraha. Get up close to these majestic animals and watch the fascinating interaction between the mothers and their babies.

What no one else does in Nepal

Quite a few people make it to Everest Base camp, but climbing the tallest mountain in the world is really a task for those who have been in serious training and are mentally and physically unbreakable! With oxygen levels at almost 40% less than what they are at sea-level this climb is extreme.

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
