Best City Beaches

Dubrovnik

Where the city’s old walled town with red tiled roofs meets the elegance of the Adriatic Sea.

Rio De Janeiro

The former capital of Brazil is famed for its Latin flavour of the city meeting the opulence of the many beaches that surround it.

Key West

Coral reefs live in harmony alongside the hustle and bustle of the city of Key West, famed for its man-made beach with sand from the Bahamas.

Gold Coast

This metropolitan hub on the East Coast of Australia features some of the best beaches the country has to offer.

Barcelona

The beaches here are just as lively and exciting as anywhere else in the city, with the amount of entertainment, activities, and watersports on offer right on the beach front!

Cape Town

This multicultural capital is famed for its beaches and Port, and really draws in a mixed crowd on different beaches, with Clifton 2nd beach drawing a large gay contingent.

Vancouver

This may not be the first place that comes to mind when thinking of beaches, but its stunning array of mountains clashing with the city skyline and sandy beaches make it worth considering.

Nice

Famed for drawing in the rich and famous, Nice comes out on top as the jewel in the crown of Europe’s best beach locations.

Tel Aviv

The most liberal city in the Middle East welcomes you to its shores, where the tech and financial hub of Israel meet the paradisal sands of the country’s coast.

Best Beach Destinations In...

January

Cancun is calling with the start of its summer season. With average temperatures reaching 30 degrees, you’re sure to get plenty of sunshine whilst lounging on the tropical beaches like Playa Delfines. Or maybe escape to Goa on the coast of India, facing the Arabian sea. Reaching an average of 25 degrees in its coldest month, it's still the perfect time to sunbathe on beaches such as Mandrem or Agonda.

February

Take advantage of the beaches of Rio De Janeiro. The beaches are filled with the young and beautiful, plus the sounds of samba fill the air from the colourful Carnival festival, often taking over Copacabana and Ipanema beaches. Alternatively, The Dominican Republic is the perfect escape for some winter sun. Crystal clear waters and white sands found in places like the Playa Bavaro transport you away from harsh weather into paradise.

March

Visit Phuket in March to catch the last drops of sunshine in the dry season. Phuket’s beaches are amongst the most popular of the Thai provinces and are loved by tourists for the warm waters and beach sellers selling kooky souvenirs. Patong and Kata beaches are popular sunshine havens.

April

Key West, Florida is the perfect time to take advantage of this American beach haven. Gentle waves and miles of white sands stretch out along the coast, perfect for exploring one of America’s best coastline attractions. Smathers Beach feels straight out of the Bahamas due to the sand being imported straight from there!

May

When it comes to breathtaking beaches, look no further than Bali when it comes to deciding where to relax and unwind in May. Discover secret hidden beaches with unspoilt beauty, such as Lovina Beach which is made up of black volcanic sand!

June

The beaches of the Greek islands come second to none as the perfect mid-year destination. Hop between Mykonos, Santorini and Milos to find secluded beaches and discover the charm and allure of the Greek coast.

July

You’ll feel like a movie star lounging on the shores of the French Riviera, famed for its romantic and luxurious feel. St Tropez, Cannes and Nice all offer coastlines made for those who seek somewhere more opulent and upscale. Monaco equally is recommended as a luxury beach holiday, as a place to relax or to take a helicopter ride that can take you into the heavens to see the French Riviera in all it’s glory.

August

Tanzania offers shorelines that one can only dream about. August provides the perfect climate to visit and discover everything the East African country has to offer. The beaches of Zanzibar look like something from a postcard with serene shores stretching for miles and miles.

September

Sri Lanka and the Maldives offer the best shorelines to relax and unwind when it comes to September. You never have to leave the picture-perfect shores with the option of water bungalows, meaning you can wake up on the shore every morning to the sounds of the ocean, such as at the Anantara Veli Maldives resort.

October

Hawaii is arguably the most famous destination in the world for its beaches that attract tourists the world over. Visiting in October means you can experience the natural wonder of the coastline with minimum interruption from other tourists, meaning more space for you to lay back and relax. Highlights include Kauna ‘oa and Punalu’u beaches.

November

The Seychelles has no competition when it comes to escaping winter time and is a great place to go island hopping in order to take in as many beautiful beaches as possible. Mahe, Denis Island, La Digue benefit from average temperatures of 27 degrees, clear blue seas and natural beauty everywhere you look; ideal for turning your winter blues into ocean blues.

December

If you’re looking to spend the coldest months somewhere hotter, Australia is a perfect choice. December is the start of Summer for most parts, meaning it’s time to hit the beach. Australians and tourists alike are known to spend Christmas time on Bondi Beach, bringing the festive holiday into summertime. Bora Bora is also one of the best LGBT friendly beach holiday destinations and one of the most stunning too; great for island hopping to take in as many crystal clear beaches as possible.








Best Family Beach Holidays

We understand how hard it can be to please everyone in the family, especially when everyone is looking for something different from their holiday. Whilst it might seem this way, it’s not impossible to please everyone with OutOfOffice.com. No matter whether there’s few of you or too many to keep track of, we specialise in tailor-made beach holidays that suit the kids as well as giving the heads of the family some much-needed sun, sea and TLC. Whether it’s the summer holidays, Easter breaks, or Christmas time, there’s always serene white sands waiting for you somewhere in the world. So why not start packing?

Little Ones love: Exploring and Adventure

Do you have little ones that are already showing signs of being an explorer? Then not take them to places only heard of in story books and set their imaginations free? The Galapagos Islands host some of nature’s most awe-inspiring creatures and marine life. With giant sea turtles, sea lions and colourful fish all waiting to be discovered, this location is a holiday fit for the future generations of Charles Darwins and Bear Grylls. Or maybe the little ones want to immerse themselves with ancient ruins of once great civilisations? Rhodes will enthral the little ones with the ruins of the ancient Greeks, medieval towns and cobbled streets lining the sandy white beaches of this Mediterranean island.

Teens love: Alternative, Urban, Cool

If you have teens that are too old for the kiddie stuff, why not go on vacation to the coolest beach location in the USA; Key West? This amazing beach holiday destination in the US is perfect for teens with it’s array of available watersports and cool, trendy beachgoers, both found on Smathers beach. It is also a great place for LGBT family holidays being the first American city to recruit gay tourists. Alternatively closer to home, Barcelona offers all the excitement of life in the big city alongside the famous Barceloneta beach, famed for attracting the young and beautiful and hipster crowds.

Not-so-little ones love: Relaxation and Family Bonding

Are the little ones not so little anymore with more refined tastes? Then maybe try sailing around the Isle of Sicily to bring the family closer together with the help of gentle waves, a spot of snorkelling or diving, and a private yacht complete with skipper to take the hassle and responsibility away, leaving you and your family with nothing but the serenity of the Mediterranean coast. Or maybe bask in the beauty of Vietnam; soaking up the rays in Nha Trang with a beach yoga holiday, or a kayaking trip through Halong Bay (the holiday location that inspired inspiration the blockbuster film Avatar).

For more family friendly beach destinations, take a look through our itineraries, or give us a call for a tailor-made family experience.

(PS: Don’t forget the bucket and spade!)
