This country has so much to offer from spiritual journeys to eye-opening culture and adrenalin pumping activities. If you are looking for an all rounded experience, then Laos is perfect. The capital. Visit Luang Prabang which is located in the North of Laos. This wonderful city will open your eyes to a whole new world of colour, culture and tradition. Here you will find stunning ancient temples and cultural museums. If you are looking for an authentic rural experience, then head to Vang Vieng. This off the beaten track is not well known to tourists making it a perfect destination if you are looking for an original experience. Head to the Vieng Xai to see the 'bomb-shelter caves'. Take a boat trip through these mystical caves which were formerly used as shelters when under attack.

Head to the capital city Vientiane which is known for being one of the quietest capital cities in the world. Here you can visit the Buddhist temple Pha That Luang along with many other cultural sites. It offers a much more laid back experience, at definitely is a slow-paced city, filled with charm and character. If you like ancient ruins, then head to Champasak, which is home to the famous Wat Phu Champasak.

What everyone does in Laos

The most popular destination in Laos is Luang Prabang. Purely because there is so much to do and see. Home to the Wat Xieng Thong Temple which is the most photographed temple in Laos.

What some people do in Laos

Why not see Laos from a different perspective? Cruise down the Mekong River along the border of Thailand and watch the beautiful rural countryside float past.

What no one else does in Laos

Go all out and do a tour of Asia, combine Laos with Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and venture on our Indochina Heritage route itinerary which takes 16 days. Comparing the culture and experience from each country is fascinating.
