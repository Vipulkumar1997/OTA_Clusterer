New Zealand

IN A NUTSHELL

A truly awe-inspiring country, New Zealand has perhaps some of the most stunning scenery on earth. You need a good chunk of time in the country to explore and get under its skin. You'll see spectacular glaciers, picturesque fjords, vast plains, rolling hills, subtropical forests, rugged mountains, a volcanic plateau and miles of coastline with sandy beaches.
New Zealand's straddles two tectonic plates and is therefore home to geothermal areas and volcanoes, some of which are still active. Lake Taupo is the result of one of the largest and most destructive volcanic eruptions in the world. Visit Rotorua and you can witness this geothermal activity with spouting geysers, hot water pools and bubbling mud.

Known for its breathtaking landscapes, incredible geological features and peacefulness, New Zealand is perfect those seeking a holiday filled with adventure and exploration. From zip lining, bungee jumping, white water rafting, skiing, subterranean trampolining, hiking, biking and so much more, the list is endless.

It is safe to say there won’t be a dull moment as there is always something to do. Auckland is a great city to visit. The modern buildings are laid upon the rugged rocky coastline makes it a unique place. Spend a couple of nights here giving you plenty of time to see the sites.

Then head to Rotorua and go via the Waitomo Glow-worm Caves. Once at Rotorua choose from many activities including white water rafting on the Kaituna River or see Mt. Tarawera - Waimangu Volcanic Valley by floatplane.

Your next stop is Christchurch which is a great place to swim with dolphins or go whale watching.

Your final stop is Queenstown. Enjoy the sublime landscape including smokey lakes, flat green plains, and snowy mountains.

What everyone does in New Zealand

Visit Auckland and experience the colourful vibrant city. Due to its coastal location, it is a great place to sail, so why not head out on a day trip along the coastline. If you are looking for a holiday which covers the main places then our
Introduction to New Zealand
itinerary is perfect.

What some people do in New Zealand

Put your fears to the test and bungee jump off the Kawarau Bridge in Queenstown. There are plenty of other incredible destinations you can jump in New Zealand. You will be strapped in (by professionals!) and then take the leap of faith off the bridge and feel the awesome rush of adrenaline. A once in a lifetime experience we recommend.

What no one else does in New Zealand

Visit Stewart Island which is just off the South coast of New Zealand. A nice additional trip to make when visiting. Stay in Oban and visit the many beautiful bays and beaches. Like the majority of New Zealand, it is known for its beautiful scenery.
