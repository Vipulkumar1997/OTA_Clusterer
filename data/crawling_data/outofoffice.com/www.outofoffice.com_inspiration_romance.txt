Buenos Aires, Argentina

Fire and passion run through the veins of the locals of Buenos Aires who are not afraid to show public displays of affection to their loved ones, making it one very loved-up city.

Prague, Czech Republic

Also referred to as ‘The Golden City’, the medieval characteristics of the Czech capital is famously a huge inspiration for many bohemian artists. It’s quaint buildings and beautiful skyline makes it look like a small town straight out of a storybook, the perfect destination to take your Prince Charming/Princess.

Cupid definitely looks over this city with it’s many love stories to tell, and after you have visited it will have one more fairytale for the books.

New York, USA

Skyscrapers dominate the skyline in the city that never sleeps and where romance can be found almost everywhere.

Wherever you wander in the Big Apple you are bound to find things to do together.

Best Romantic Gay Beach Holidays

There’s nothing more romantic than the beach. The white sands, the emerald blue seas, and the scent of sea salt in the air creates a romantic setting like no other. With this in mind, Out Of Office has compiled a list of the best romantic gay beach holiday destinations, where you can express your love for one another without fear or prejudice.

Phuket, Thailand

Thailand's most gay friendly island is a great place to be affectionate and be yourselves. Walk hand in hand down some of the most beautiful beaches in Asia and see for yourselves why this is one of the top destinations in the world for gay couples.

Tel Aviv, Israel

Tel Aviv is the gay capital of the Middle East and it’s not hard to see why. A city break and beach break in one, plenty of sunshine, and a buzzing LGBT scene makes this destination a great place to discover with your significant other.

Cape Verde, Africa

This small nation is one of the few places in the African continent where being gay is completely legal. This piece of paradise is also not overrun with tourists, making it a great little private getaway with plenty of romantic beach landscapes.

Mykonos, Greece

The traditional, white, Greek architecture of this island almost blends into the white sandy beaches that surround it. Aphrodite looks over this idyllic Greek island, meaning gay couples are free to show off their love everywhere they go.

Cape Town, South Africa

Cape Town’s mix of culture, history, landscape and lively LGBT scene makes it one of the best locations for gay couples to visit. Aside from these factors, it is home to some of the most beautiful beaches you will ever see, and with attitudes towards LGBT people being generally progressive, it is truly a place to let love blossom.

Key West, Florida USA

Key West has long celebrated love of all kinds with a very open LGBT scene in the city. The imported sands from the Bahamas create beaches with a touch of the tropics alongside the beautiful coral reefs on the shores of this Florida Keys island, making it a beautiful, luxurious, romantic gay holiday destination.







The Law

The laws on same-sex marriage differs between countries around the world. Indeed, cultures and attitudes in different countries can vary also, sometimes being different to what the laws of the land say officially. Considering this, it is important that you are made aware of all of these factors before you take a trip anywhere.

When you book your holiday with Out Of Office, we fully brief you on everything from culture to laws to general social attitudes of any destination you consider visiting. Some places are safer than others when it comes to travel, whether straight or LGBT, however, thankfully they are in the minority. Regardless, safety and clarity are two key focuses when referring to countries of interest with our clients, and pride ourselves on our knowledge and experience.

In some parts of the world, the laws don’t necessarily reflect the reality on the ground. The Maldives is a popular tourist destination and yet the laws state that homosexuality is illegal. However, we have specially picked a selection of different resorts where LGBT people are more than welcome, and are accommodated as equally and to the same standard as straight guests. We vet each and every one of our properties to make sure that they are LGBT friendly, that staff are well trained and that LGBT guests are treated exactly the same as any other guest. Equally, public displays of affection are not recommended here as it is unsafe to do so for straight or LGBT people, and so we advise, for example, to not highlight being a gay couple at the airport or showing PDA until at your designated resort.

Every page on our website gives up to date, and regularly updated, information on laws in different countries retaining to LGBT travel. This includes laws on homosexual activity, same-sex adoption, same-sex marriage, age of consent and discrimination based on sexuality. We make sure that every client is made aware of these regulations before they travel, and whilst we cannot guarantee travellers will not face any discrimination at all, we recognise that most LGBT people can be made aware of the situations in different countries and therefore be mindful when travelling.

With family travel, it is important to ensure all the correct documentation is in place and carried pertaining to whichever country you are in. In some places only one legal guardian is recognised and so it is important to get the most updated travel advice from the relevant authorities, ie. The Foreign Office if you’re a British Citizen or the local embassy for your country in the relevant destination. Adoption papers should be carried everywhere when travelling, and legal advice can be seeked where necessary.

As with all our trips, it’s a prerequisite that you have adequate travel insurance for the holiday you book. Whilst we do not sell travel insurance at Out Of Office, we partner with Emerald Life who offer the service.








Proposal Ideas


Best places to propose

We believe that all love should be recognised and celebrated. No matter who you love, the opportunity to cement your love between you and your partner freely and openly is something we fully support and want to help with in any way we can. We have compiled a list of the best places to propose.

Overwater Bungalow, Bora Bora

Love is often said to be as deep and vast as the ocean, so an overwater bungalow looking out onto the enchanting blue waters of LGBT-friendly Bora Bora would make the perfect choice for a place to propose to your loved one. Sit on the deck, watch the sunset, pour some champagne, and create your happily ever after.

Toyama Bay, Japan

This famous bay in Japan is famous for it’s glowing, bioluminescent water that glows a beautiful blue as the gentle waves wash upon the shore. This phenomenon is caused by firefly squid that migrate nearer the shores between March and June to breed, creating the perfect spot to propose to the light of your life.

Sky Walk, Auckland, New Zealand

Take your loved one sky-high and consider this proposal location that will get your adrenaline pumping (if the thought of proposing already wasn’t). Book a Sky Walk in Auckland, 192m above the city and pop the question whilst high up in the heavens, towering above the buildings below..

Northern Lights, Finland

The vivid, mystical, colourful phenomenon lights the night sky above your heads as you look up in awe, keeping shelter from the cold and snow outside. A humble and beautiful place to propose in your very own winter wonderland.

Trevi Fountain, Italy

According to legend, “throwing one coin means a return to Rome, a second coin leads to a new romance, and a third coin leads to marriage”. The superstition surrounding the Trevi fountain, combined with the dramatic sculptural design, makes it a place where you can make wishes come true (however many times you may have visited).

Underwater, The Maldives

One of our favourite restaurants on earth is at the
Conrad Rangali
in The Maldives where you will find a stunning underwater restaurant surrounded by tropical corals and fish.



Top Romantic Landmarks

Out Of Office has compiled a list of the most romantic landmarks in the world that provide the perfect trip with the person you love. These iconic monuments have stood the test of time and provided lovers the world over with memories that will last forever.

Eiffel Tower, Paris

Famously known as ‘The Tower of Love’ the Eiffel Tower lives up to it’s nickname as one of the most romantic places to visit in the world. A limited number of people are allowed on the very top of the tower at any given time making for a much more intimate affair. Visit the tower at night time to see it light up in all it’s glory, and gaze into the night-lit skyline of ‘The City of Love’.

Empire State Building, USA

Everyone remembers the famous scene from ‘Sleepless in Seattle’ when the two love interests finally meet at the top of the tower, warming the hearts of everyone that saw it. One of the tallest buildings in New York, The Empire State has stood as the most romantic skyscraper in the world for over 80 years, making it a place to truly shout your love from the rooftops!

The Taj Mahal, India

The fifth Mughal Emperor built the Taj Mahal in loving memory of his Persian Princess wife who sadly passed away. The love story between the two was the inspiration to build this stunning structure, now named as one of the new seven wonders of the world. Wait till the sun sets over the Taj Mahal for the dreamiest, most romantic location you could only ever dream of.

Great Wall Of China, China

Let this ancient wall of architectural wonder lay the foundations for everlasting love. Walking, climbing and hiking along these old walls looking out onto the stunning views makes for the most romantic trip. The great wall is over 13,000 miles in length, making this a romantic place for couples who like to go and explore together.

Neuschwanstein Castle, Germany

This stunning castle looks like the kinds you heard of as a child in fairy tales, fables and folk stories. The mountainous landscape and gushing waterfall below the old footbridge make this the perfect place to take your very own King or Queen.

Alley of the Kiss, Mexico

The legend of the Alley of the Kiss tells of two lovers from different worlds who were warned to stay apart. The man, madly in love, rented out the room across the alley from his lover; an alley so narrow they could meet and share a kiss across the alley from their two opposite houses. Legend says that if a couple kisses on the third step of the alley they are guaranteed 15 years of happiness.
