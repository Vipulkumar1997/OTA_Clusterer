ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

The Taj Mahal is just one of the unexplainably stunning pieces of architecture in India. Venture through the backwaters of Kerala or explore the backstreets of Delhi on the back seat of a rickshaw. Try out the ‘Pink City’ of Jaipur and explore the culinary spices of authentic India cuisine. With Out of Office, you could be relaxing on the white sand of Goa, or be right in the middle of the action in the bustling streets of Mumbai.

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for India vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to India and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.


GETTING TO India

html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




India is well connected to both the west and east with major airports in Delhi, Mumbai and Goa. The country is also well connected by a rail network which is a unique and authentic way to travel the country. Bear in mind though that travel times can be extensive as the distance between India's key cities is long.

With its unique vibrant culture, busy bustling cities and delicious cuisine, a trip to India will definitely be a once in a lifetime experience. It is definitely a country you can’t rush, as there are lots of places you must visit and it’s worth taking your time in order to really experience it. From the vibrant streets of Dehli to the quiet rice fields in Kerala, every place is different from the next. One thing is for sure, your stomach is sure to be satisfied (that is if you like spice!)

We have some wonderful India itineraries to varying different parts. Our Kerala itinerary is perfect if you are looking for more of an off the beaten track experience, and our Golden Triangle itinerary is perfect if you are looking to see the essential destinations including Mumbai and Goa.

What everyone does
in India

The Golden triangle itinerary is the route we recommend if you are looking for the perfect taste of India. You’ll visit all the essential places including Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Mumbai and Goa. After you’ve finished exploring, end in Goa for some beach time - you won’t be disappointed.

What some people do
in India

As you move south, the landscape changes to luscious fields and a tangle of rivers. Visit Kerala and experience the rural side of India. With beautiful landscape and

What no one else does
in India

If you want to experience somewhere which has virtually no tourists then head to the Hill stations which can be found way up in the mountains. They are used as places to escape the hot Indian summer. Head up here to experience awesome untouched landscapes, you'll find deep valleys, towering mountains and fresh luscious grassy plains - very different to the rest of India!

Why Book with Us?




Over 65 Countries

We offer more than 300 sample itineraries in over 65 different countries to help inspire you. We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
