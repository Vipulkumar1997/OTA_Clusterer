ENQUIRE NOW






IN A NUTSHELL

An ever popular tourist destination and bursting at the seams with culture, it’s little wonder that myths and legends were born here. Popular with partiers and culture-lovers alike, Greece is known for its sandy beaches and nightlife, alongside ancient landmarks most famously found in Athens. With so many islands to choose from, there’s something to suit every vibe: Mykonos and Santorini are perfect for a bustling party atmosphere, but a little off the beaten track lie tranquil gems such as Out Of Office favourites Naxos, Skopelos or The Odyssey’s legendary Ithaca. Start planning your Greek Islands holiday now.

VISA INFORMATION

When going on any holiday it is important to ensure your trip is as successful as possible. From beach holidays to city breaks, you need to check the visa requirements for the holiday you are going on in order to make sure you enjoy your trip without the stress of worrying about visas. The entry requirements for Greece vary depending on where you are visiting from. UK travellers are advised to check the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website for the most up-to-date visa information. It is travellers' responsibility to ensure they are able to travel to Greece and that they obtain the correct permissions for doing so. If you are not a British citizen please do check with your country's relevant embassy for the most reliable and up-to-date information.


GETTING TO Greece

html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"




Greece has a number of different destinations to visit. Athens is its capital city and easy to fly to from most European cities as well as those in the USA. The major islands also each have own airports too such as Mykonos and Santorini. You'll also be able to catch a ferry between the mainland the the other Greek islands.

Greece is a perfect destination if you are looking for a laid back atmosphere with excellent food to match.

From the Cyclades where you’ll find the stunning Mykonos and Santorini - ideal for a romantic holiday in the Greek Islands - to the capital of Athens with its titanic architecture and history, Greece has a lot to offer. Perfect for a history buff wanting to brush up on their knowledge of Ancient Greece, the city of Athens remains a treasure trove of original buildings and landmarks dating back to the 5th-century BC.

The famous Acropolis museum is a must visit and we specialise in arranging knowledgeable and private guides to ensure you get the best possible experience.

If you’re hoping to relax and catch some sun then head down to Mykonos. Known for its beautiful beaches and its summer party atmosphere and laid back vibes, the island of Mykonos has fast become the go-to destination over places like Ibiza. Still a quaint island though, Mykonos town has beautiful tavernas and a melting pot of wonderful restaurants. You’ll find cobbled streets and an abundance of boutiques.

For the perfect Greek honeymoon destination you’ll find the island of Santorini an ideal choice. With its rugged landscape - a result of a volcanic eruption almost 4000 years ago - the towns of Fira and Oia are set on the cliffs of a large underwater crater known as the caldera which was created when the centre of the island collapsed.

It’s a great idea to pair both Mykonos and Santorini and take the ferry between the two islands. The approach to Santorini is rather special. Most facilities on the islands close in the middle of September so be sure to visit then. Santorini is also a great hiking destination and the island’s resorts are luxury in both appointment and vision.

What everyone does in Greece

A trip to the capital city is a great starting point. The city allows you to experience what true ancient Greece was like back in its hay day. A trip to the famous Acropolis is a must, along with the majestic Parthenon. Visiting the many ancient Greek temples gives you a real feel for how important the Greek Gods were.

What some people do in Greece

Why visit only visit one island? There are hundreds you can visit, with each possessing its own unique charm and character. Mykonos is probably the most famous, with its beautiful beaches, classical restaurants and buzzing nightlife. Also a popular destination for the LGBT community, the locals are very welcoming. Santorini is definitely worth a visit, along with Skopelos which was where the film ‘Mamma Mia’ was set. A great way to see as many of the islands as possible is by sailing. You can do this by joining a group or if you already have a group we can arrange a boat for you. Sail along the coastline and enjoy the gorgeous mediterranean sea.

What no one else does in Greece

Tucked away and almost untouched, the South West area of Greece is the perfect place to visit if you are looking to extend your trip. This area may not be as popular as other areas of Greece but this makes it perfect if you are looking for an authentic Greek experience. The tiny village of Koita, which is located right in the South is the perfect place to visit if you are looking for a picturesque seaside escape.

We're also at the end of the phone to offer unlimited advice and expert knowledge from our well travelled teams. And remember, we're LGBT-friendly too and pride ourselves on ensuring everyone can travel the globe.




It's the little things

We are able to hold seats with all major airlines rather than having to pay for flights up front. We secure your booking with a small deposit and the balance is not due until ten weeks before your trip, giving you time to plan and save. You'll also get your own personal advisor with you every step of the way.




It's Your Itinerary

What we really enjoy most is tailoring our trips for each client. No two people are the same and so no two holidays should be the same. We send you a personalised quote and detailed booking documents to ensure that you get the most out of your tailor-made luxury holiday.
