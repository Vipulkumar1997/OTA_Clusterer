Self-Guided Cycling Holidays

Rather than following a guide who points you in the right direction, the decisions are yours to make; based on personal interests and preferences and detailed route notes that offer you all the information you’ll need for your destination. Prefer to spend a lazy afternoon picnicking by a riverbank? With self-guided travel you set your own pace, which means there’s always time for that paddle in the sea, the detour to visit the nearby chateau, that extra piece of cake at lunchtime! For those looking for a little more independence, self-guided travel provides the opportunity for you to explore things in your own way. And of course, we take care of your luggage making sure it’s transferred and ready for you at your next accommodation. Perfect for that anniversary or birthday celebration!

In focus: cycling in Italy

“Don’t tell anyone about how beautiful Lecce is – everyone will go there! There are white limestone cathedrals, old squares and little cobbled streets, but it’s nowhere near as busy as somewhere like Rome. Cycling 50km a day, in southern Italy, with bikes supplied and all your baggage transported for you – I was sold! Our family’s split across countries – my husband, teenage daughter and I live in Geneva – but our son’s in the UK, so it would’ve been tricky to bring our own bikes. And, as there were five of us, we thought a self-guided trip would give us that extra bit of flexibility and the chance to go at a leisurely pace, chatting as we cycled along. Exodus gave us route notes about the area and suggested detours to the sights – castles, lighthouses, grottos."
