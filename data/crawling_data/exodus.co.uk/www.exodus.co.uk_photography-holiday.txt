Wildlife Photography Holidays

Our award-winning wildlife photographer Paul Goldstein leads specialist photographic expeditions. “For wilderness or photography fans, the Arctic and Antarctica are nirvana,” he says. These regions have near 24-hour daylight in the summer months, and combined with spectacular scenery and amazing wildlife, a photography holiday here under expert guidance is an opportunity like no other. Our s
pecial photgraphy departures take place throughout the year, and there are also dedicated photography trips to Tanzania and the Galapagos. Unpredictable wildlife and vast expanses of wilderness can make photographing the world’s wonderful wildlife a tricky affair, but with eagle eyes and expert advice on hand, you won’t be disappointed.
Most of our photography itineraries are fixed departure small group tours, but many of them can be arranged as a
Tailormade Adventure
, so if you want to organise a trip for friends, family or your local photography club, you can.

New 2018 Polar Photographic Departures

If you’re prepared to go to the ends of the earth for rarefied wildlife, this is the perfect temptation. Exodus’ Arctic and Antarctic photographic charters are exclusively for our travellers, and you’ll be joined by the most articulate, passionate and opinionated wildlife professionals on the planet. On board both charters will be zoologist, conservationist and award-winning author and presenter Mark Carwardine and Exodus’ resident photography and wildlife doyen Paul Goldstein. On the Antarctic one they will be joined by the BBC’s Chris Packham .  Head to
Spitsbergen
for bears, walrus, Arctic foxes and huge bird colonies and
Antarctic Peninsula
for vast penguin rookeries, huge glaciers and icebergs, whales and seals. Neither will have strict itineraries, both will maximise the many hours of daylight – we’ll see you on the ice.

Quotes from the experts:

"It’ll be a real pleasure to have several weeks to teach Paul and Chris a thing or two about photography (I know they’re both keen to learn) in one of my favourite places on the planet. And expedition adventures don’t come much more comfortable than on the Resolute.

Mark Carwardine

"One ship, three Canons…. this will be something. I cannot wait to lock horns with these ‘sometime’ friends again and help share the seventh continent with a hundred or so polar pilgrims. Will the three of us be talking at the end of it? Come and find out!”

Paul Goldstein

"You don’t have to go to the ends of the earth to get a good photo . . . but it helps! Snow and Ice, Golden Penguins, a Humpback Surprise . . . and these are just the cocktails at the bar! Seriously, this will be amazing.”

Chris Packham

Top tips: the perfect picture

Know your camera:
if you are buying it especially for the trip, take it out beforehand and practice until you know how to use it without looking at the manual.

Keep your distance:
bring a camera which has a decent zoom, and your subject is more likely to behave in a calm, natural way.

Bring plenty of memory:
make sure you take plenty of memory cards. Most people also take portable hard-drives or laptops to give them extra storage capacity.
Invest in a tripod:
they are a great way of preventing blurry shots from camera shake, especially when taking pictures in strong winds or in close up. Tripods are also very useful for keeping images sharp when your camera is on maximum zoom.

Expert help:
book yourself on to a photography course, or join one of our photographic charters to get expert tuition while ‘
in the field
’.
