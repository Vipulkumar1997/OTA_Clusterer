Wildlife Walks






Perhaps the least obtrusive way to go on safari - on two feet.

Wildlife Walking Holidays

The best way to get a real feel for wildlife is on foot. Remote trekking, wonderful wildlife, local lodges: on Wildlife Walk with Exodus you'll get closer to nature than ever before. You'll never forget the thrill of trying to be silent as you
step over a rustling bush on the jungle floor, trying to catch a glimpse of the nearby creature. You can spot mountain gorillas on a mountain trek through Rwanda and The Congo; search for a snow leopard in the snowcapped Indian Himalayas or explore bear territories in Romania. On a walking safari you’ll come breathtakingly closer than ever before, and have an immersive experience taking in tracks, spoor, smells and other signs of animal life.

Wildlife wellbeing and habitat preservation is central to our philosophy, which is why we make sure that all of our holidays are sustainable and give back to the community. Positive impact tourism can bring benefits to many communities, help preserve the environments we travel to see, and provide real and positive social exchanges. Find out more about Responsible Travel

In the spotlight: Zimbabwe

It was the perfect combination of walking and wildlife:
it just so happened that it was in Zimbabwe!

The people were absolutely amazing:
in the beginning I was nervous about the political situation, but I was assured that going there was the best way to help. Everyone was so welcoming, happy and friendly.

The landscape was dramatic and varied:
we were walking in the mountains and we didn’t see another soul all day, and were all alone on the summit of Mount Nimbube.

The accommodation was all locally owned:
o
n the seventh day we stayed in Hermit’s Peak Lodge, where you could see zebra, wildebeest and giraffe, practically on the lawn. In the Svengi National Park we saw elephants and hippos. The birdlife is fantastic too.

Seeing five white rhinos in the wild was a very emotional moment:
we’d walked for ten miles that day, but then we came across a group of five white rhinos. What a moment! A huge conservation effort is being made: they had their horns cut off to protect from poaching and there was a visible armed guard – and finally, the numbers are going up.

We were taken to a village to meet the local people:
it was clear that the trip really supported the local community, and it was lovely that the things that we were taken to see were real, not commercialised.

Our guides gave us a unique perspective:
between them they knew everything: facts and figures, were able to give us an insight into the historical and political situation; pointed out rare wildlife; and rustled up some amazing food. Travel arrangements were spot on, and they were helpful, patient, friendly and good fun. They couldn't have been better.
