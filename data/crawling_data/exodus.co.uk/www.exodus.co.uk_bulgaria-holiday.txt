Adventure Holidays in Bulgaria

An adventure holiday to Bulgaria is one full of hidden surprises. Challenge yourself with a trek into the Pirin and Rodopi Mountains where the soaring summits leave you breathless. With medieval monasteries, enchanted caves with mythical histories, and forests that echo with the plaintive cry of Europe’s remaining wolves: a trip to Bulgaria wins in the fairytale stakes. At Exodus we can take you further - pick a
Winter Holiday
in Bulgaria and head into the wilderness on
snowshoes
through some of the tiny mountain villages of the Rodopi. Hearty meals and roaring fires fortify you against the cold and prepare you for each day’s walking in this isolated Eastern wilderness.

Activities in Bulgaria







Walking












Top five Bulgaria attractions:

1. Mountain trekking:
Southwestern Bulgaria is dominated by two dramatic mountain ranges, the Pirin and the equally imposing Rila. Try hiking across stunning passes and glacial lakes and even ascend Mount Musala, the highest on the Balkan Peninsula. This is raw and rugged nature at it’s most epic.

2. Bulgarian Cuisine:
Bulgarian cuisine combines the rich influence of the Ottoman Empire with a peasant cooking style that piles in Bulgaria’s tasty vegetables and herbs. Shopska Salad, banitsa, kebabche, kyufte, lyutenitsa, these are just a few of the delicious traditional dishes to try. Try fish soup on the coast, fruit and veg in the plains and cheese in the mountains.

3. Villages:
Discover Bulgaria’s pretty towns and villages, like Koprivshtitsa, Kovachevitsa, Etar and Bozhentsi and you learn about Bulgarian customs and traditions. Pick fresh fruit and veg at local markets and enjoy a slower pace of life.

4. Mud bathing:
Renowned for skin and healing properties, the mud near Atanasovsko Lake has formed over millions of years. Aside from applying it to your skin you can also float in the saline pool next to the baths.

5. Wildlife:
Spend a week in the Rodopi Mountains discovering the realm of the brown bear. Record tracks, scats and other signs of bear activity as part of an on-going conservation project and visit a specially constructed bear-watching hide and see these beguiling animals in their natural habitat.
