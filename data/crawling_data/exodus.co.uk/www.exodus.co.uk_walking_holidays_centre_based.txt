Centre-based Walking

On all our centre-based itineraries we stay at a small hotel, private lodge or farmhouse for the duration of the trip, taking the hassle away from having to unpack each day. There is always plenty of time to relax with optional visits or walks available for those who wish. These trips are perfect for couples, singles or groups of friends travelling together, with each accommodation hand-picked for its character and location, quality of food and warm welcome on your return from your day's exploration. These trips are ideal first time walking holidays, as well as great short breaks for the experienced walker. And wherever you choose to go you'll find yourself in the heart of one of the most scenic and spectacular areas of Europe, within easy access of great walks, culture or activities.

Solo Travel

Around half our small group trips are filled by solo travellers, joining other single travellers, couples and groups of friends. It’s a great way to meet new people, and you’ll never have to pay a single person supplement. You’ll share a room with someone of the same sex – although in some instances you can pay extra for your own room – and often these people become friends for life. That’s the great thing about our Guided Group Adventures, you’re guaranteed to be travelling with like-minded people from a range or backgrounds. And age differences just don’t matter.
