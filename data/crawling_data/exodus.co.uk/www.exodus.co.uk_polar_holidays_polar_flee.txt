Our Expeditions offer the adventure traveller the most diverse polar fleet in the world.



Polar Adventure Ships

These are small ice rated vessels, well qualified for Polar waters. The staff and food are simply superb. These ships offer the most amazing and intimate journeys with activities including frequent Zodiac excursions, trekking, camping, kayaking and many hours on deck in areas that other ships only dream about accessing.



The Ships:

Ocean Diamond
|
Ocean Nova
|
Ocean Endeavour
|
Akademik Sergey Vavilov
|
Akademik Ioffe
|
Ocean Adventurer
|
Ocean Atlantic
|
RCGS Resolute

Island Sky



The Icebreaker

The 50 Years of Victory is an actual icebreaker – an enormously powerful ship, carrying the highest ice rating in the world, and equipped with helicopters for aerial sightseeing. Some of our most extraordinary journeys are only made accessible on very grown up Polar-Class icebreakers.

The Ship:

50 Years of Victory
