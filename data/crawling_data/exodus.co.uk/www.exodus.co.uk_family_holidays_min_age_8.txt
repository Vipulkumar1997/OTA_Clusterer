Family holidays, minimum age 8

Our Family Adventures are carefully crafted to showcase the best the world has to offer. And with a good mix of activities, our trips will appeal to all the family. Who knows? Next summer holiday you could be learning to surf in Portugal, or going on a game drive in Tanzania.

Below we've listed a range of adventures where the minimum age on the holiday is 8 years old. But that doesn't mean that older children won't enjoy them too.
