Adventure Holidays in Colombia

One of South America's most beautiful and interesting countries, Colombia is still largely undiscovered despite its amazing variety of landscapes, sights and cultures. On holiday in Colombia you can experience the contrast between the lively and cosmopolitan capital, Bogota, and the atmospheric streets and well-preserved colonial buildings of Cartagena; the wild Pacific Coast and effortless laid-back cool of the Caribbean Coast; the lush undulating plantations deep in the Cocora Valley and the towering snowcapped peaks of Los Nevados National Park.

Revered by coffee lovers the world over, the western slopes of the Central Andes sprawls ‘Eje Cafetero’, the coffee region of Colombia. It makes for great trekking and cycling, and those with a real thirst for adventure can wild camp under the stars in the Andes Cordillera Central. With a chilled vibe, warm welcome, and great cycling, trekking and exploring on offer, trips in Colombia are beginning to achieve legendary status among adventure travellers.

Expert opinion

Colombia is Lonely Planet’s number two in their Best Destination list for 2017. In the list, called “Ten destinations you cannot afford to miss,” there are several old-time Exodus’ favourites, including Nepal and Finland, it’s but Colombia takes the number two spot:

“Decades of civil war and violent crime meant Colombian passport stamps were once for hardcore travellers only. Fast forward to the present day, and the lost years seem but a dust speck in Colombia’s rear-view mirror. There are no world wonders, but the country’s mix of vibrant culture, nature and hospitality is a rich tapestry woven by welcoming arms. Over a decade into its dramatic about-face, this South American jewel is even expecting a visit from the world’s number-one Catholic. When Pope Francis kisses Colombian soil in 2017, it will mark the Andean nation’s first papal visit in 30 years.”
