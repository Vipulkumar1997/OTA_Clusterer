Where Adventure Begins

Over 40 years experience of taking people on extraordinary adventures.

At Exodus, we love adventure travel and always have. There’s something about the feeling of visiting a new country, culture or environment – whether that’s a mountain range, desert or jungle – that just can’t be beaten. We first took a group of travellers to the Himalaya over 40 years ago, and have since expanded to offer more than 500 itineraries across more than 90 countries. So, if you’re looking for an adventure holiday, or are in need of some travel inspiration for your next activity holiday, you’ve come to the right place.

Our trips include walking and cycling tours that take in awe-inspiring scenery and breath-taking wildlife encounters. And we have journeys designed specifically for families, mixed-activity holidays and seasonal getaways, perfect for those interested in winter sports. There are unforgettable experiences in top destinations the world over. From your own African odyssey, to a journey of discovery in Central America and pioneering expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic, with Exodus these are just some of the memories waiting to be made.
