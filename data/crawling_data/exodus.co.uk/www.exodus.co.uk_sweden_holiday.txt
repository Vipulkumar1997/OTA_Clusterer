Adventure Holidays in Sweden

Sweden is a land of much diversity. At once there are large areas of wilderness, huge forests and thousands of lakes with simple log cabins scattered along the shores, and cosmopolitan cities like Stockholm, famed for its sleek aesthetic and excellent cuisine.

Its an excellent year-round destination, a playground for adventure seekers in both winter and summer months. There’s the wintery Arctic North, with its glittering Icehotel, and opportunity to experience Winter Holiday activities like snowshoeing, snowmobiling and cross-country skiing. Not to mention the magical Northern Lights, dancing in the night sky. Yet in summer months blue skies prevail over stunning fjords and rugged mountains, perfect for trekking, sailing and other watersports.

Winter












In focus: winter in Sweden

The Varmland region of Sweden is a pristine wilderness, famous for its rugged mountains and beautiful landscape dotted with spruce forest and frozen lakes as far the eye can see. In the winter months all is blanketed in white, and you can enjoy a week experiencing traditional life here, by snowshoeing, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and making friends with the local husky dogs – the best mode of transport in these parts.  There’s also the opportunity to horse ride through the forest, try ice-fishing and camp beneath the stars on an adventure that has ‘winter wonderland’ written all over it.

At night cosy up in an authentic Swedish Villa, locally-owned and run. Dating from 1910 its decorated in traditional Swedish country style made famous by designed Josef Frank. Guests eat locally sourced Swedish food together in the dining room, from where there’s a view over the mountains and the river Klarälven. Next door there’s a snug sitting room and cracking fire, perfect for relaxing in after an active day outdoors.
