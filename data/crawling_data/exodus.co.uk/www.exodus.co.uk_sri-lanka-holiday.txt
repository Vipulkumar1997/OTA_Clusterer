Adventure Holidays in Sri Lanka

With sandy, palm-fringed beaches, jewelled cultural treasures and magical chance encounters with elephants all on offer, Sri Lanka has a magic all of its own. On your trip to Sri Lanka, visit the ancient rock fortress at Sigiriya, rising high above the rainforest canopy; see elephants in their natural environment tugging at the grass and grazing on palm fronds; and watch out for darting leopards too. Discover rare species and the gemstones that first drew travellers here; explore paddy fields by bike; lose yourself in maze-like rows of highland tea plantations; and let juddering tuk tucks zip you through the underbrush to hidden expanses of beach. Holidays in Sri Lanka provide a fantastic mix of culture, history, people, food, wildlife and beaches, and Exodus – with the help of our expert local guides – promises to get you closer to the action than anyone else.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

Top five reasons to visit Sri Lanka

1. Wildlife encounters:
if you’re not lucky enough to see elephants grazing at the side of the road Yala National Park is where it’s at. Here majestic elephants, powerful bears, skittish deer, languorous leopards and a rainbow of exotic birds can all be found. A trip to the elephant orphanage near Kandy is an absolute highlight.

2. Friendly local guides:
for most people, though the best thing about holidays in Sri Lanka is the warm charm of the people. Our local guides Our local guides are chosen for their friendly nature, knowledge and enthusiasm, and will be able to tell you all about the history of the country and their way of life.

3. Off-the-beaten-track adventures:
we’ll take you down back streets to see real life Sri Lanka, eat with local people, and really get to know what makes the country tick.

4. Local accommodation:
all 4*, and run by local families, so customers get an authentic experience.

5. Tailormade Adventure:
pick and mix from the normal itinerary on an Exodus
Tailormade Adventure
so you can personalise your trip.
