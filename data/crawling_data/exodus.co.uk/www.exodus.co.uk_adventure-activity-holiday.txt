Activity and adventure holidays

We offer adventures in over 90 countries around the world, and work on the basis that we look for the best activities to do, in the very best places. Our activities include Cultural & Discovery Holidays, Cycling, Walking & Trekking, Winter Activities, Polar Adventures, Family Holidays and the opportunity to see the world's weird and wonderful Wildlife. And if you can't decide there's a range of Mixed Activity Holidays too: you can also kayak, canyon and camp out under desert stars. Whether you know what you want to do, but are flexible on where you go, or you have a burning desire to visit a certain country but need recommendations on what to do, we can help. Simply pick an activity from our list of holidays below, and then choose your perfect destination.

Your adventure, your way

We are the experts in small Guided Group Holidays, and our leaders are carefully chosen to help you uncover the real nature of a destination. After all, that’s how we began over 40 years ago. But our adventures are for everyone, no matter how you want to travel. We have a selection of Self-Guided Adventures, and offer new Tailormade service, which are totally bespoke and give you complete flexibility.
Just as no two people are the same, no two holidays need to be either. With so much of the world to explore and so many things to consider, the variety of travel and activity options we offer will ensure that your holiday is just as unique as you are. Because for us, it’s personal…

Many of the flights and flight-inclusive holidays on this website are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all holiday and travel services listed on this website. Please ask us to confirm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected. Please see our booking conditions for information, or for more information about financial protection and the ATOL Certificate go to:
www.atol.org.uk/ATOLCertificate
If you book arrangements other than an ATOL protected flight or a package holiday, the financial protection referred to above does not apply. Our ATOL number is 2582 and our ABTA number is Y0751.
