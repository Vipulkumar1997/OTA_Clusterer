Off-Road Cycling Holidays

This is where our passion for Cycling Holidays began, providing off-road and mountain biking adventures to destinations where independent riders would find it difficult to find the best trails. Some trips date back to our original range, but have all benefited from years of tweaking and improvements at the hands of our passionate biking leaders. Carve your way down a technical Slovenian single track, conquer a mountain pass in the Moroccan desert, or ride with the Masai in Tanzania’s Rift Valley. Whether you're new to off road or a hardened singletrack fan, with Exodus you will be enjoying some of the finest bike trails anywhere in the world.

Guided Groups

Guided-group trips are our most popular type of holiday. Guided exploration with a small group of travellers is how we began, and we’ve been doing it for over 40 years now. Our groups are normally between 8-16 people. This means our trips aren’t disruptive to the places we visit, and having a smaller number of guests creates a good group dynamic too. Over meals eaten together, you’ll get to know a range of people who come from different backgrounds but who have a shared interest in cycling and travel. It also works out better value for money as the costs of the trip are spread across the group. With a local expert on every adventure, you’ll experience the true nature of your chosen destination and our passionate and knowledgeable guides are famous for going the extra mile.

















The trip is really an unforgettable one. The cycling itself is difficult but the people on our...
