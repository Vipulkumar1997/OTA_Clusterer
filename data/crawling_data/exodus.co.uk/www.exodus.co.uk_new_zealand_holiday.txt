Adventure Holidays in New Zealand

The home of the fabled All Blacks may be a very very long way away, but a New Zealand holiday offers diversity that few others come close to. From the bustling city of Auckland to the breathtaking South Island the country is blessed with sublime forests, awesome mountains, crystal clear lakes, beaches and fjords. It’s perhaps one of the best hiking – that’s “tramping” to locals –locations on earth. And whether you’re glacier walking, or strolling along a beach, on a holiday to New Zealand there’s always something to marvel at. Whether that’s a night camping on the beach at Abel Tasman National Park or gazing at the the reflection of the glacier on Lake Crucible, so clear and sharp.

In focus: adventure in New Zealand

New Zealand is best seen at close hand, whether that’s by boat or on foot, and sights like

Milford Sound, Ruapehu, Tongariro Crossing and Mount Cook are unforgettable. South Island – Queenstown in particular – is the adventure capital of the Southern Hemisphere. Every activity from rafting, bungee jumping, skydiving, paragliding, gorge swinging, heli-skiing and trekking are available.

Space, wilderness, clean air, glaciers, mountains and volcanos: New Zealand has all the right ingredients for a great Walking and Trekking Holiday. On the North island we trek the Tongariro crossing, with the chance of an optional ascent of Mt Ruapehu, while on the South Island we trek both the classic Routeburn and Milford tracks. These are interspersed with visits to Roturua, Christchurch, Mt Cook and Queenstown.

These days, the food isn’t bad wither. The lush landscape and varied climate creates some of the richest, most mouth-watering ingredients on the planet, and Wellington is its culinary capital.
