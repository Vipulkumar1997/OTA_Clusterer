Adventure Holidays in Asia

Zingy, vibrant and spicy all at once, just like its fabulous food, Asia boasts a stunning collection of ancient civilisations, spectacular wildlife and an astounding range of cultures. You’re never far from the swirl of incense on an Asia holiday, or a clash of colours that will leave your senses tingling.

Holidays in Asia offer a bewildering choice of experiences for the adventurous traveller. But with us you’re in safe hands. We’ve taken guests on Asia trips since Exodus began life in 1974 when two friends got together to provide an overland truck to the Minaret of Jam, the most inaccessible of the world’s great monuments.
Since then we’ve scoured the backroads of this vast continent to bring you a comprehensive range of trips that cover the highlights as well as the
off-the-beaten-track adventures.

Responsible travel

Responsible travel is central to our philosophy, and it’s goal to ensure that tourism benefits the people and places we visit. That's why we are actively supporting them by helping to fund local schools and projects such as our tree nursery in Nepal. Your Asia holiday could help support our efforts.

Asian wildlife is also under threat from poaching and population pressure, and wildlife safari holidays to national parks encourages the protection of wildlife, and provides valuable employment, and income. Although parks such as Nepal's Chitwan, Sepilok Orang-Utan Sanctuary in Borneo and Ranthambore in India are not short of visitors, we also visit lesser-known parks like Khana and Kaziranga in India - vital habitats for the tiger and Asian rhino respectively.

Where Adventure Begins

Exodus began life in 1974, when two friends got together to provide an overland truck to the Minaret of Jam, the most inaccessible of the world’s great monuments. It was the hippy-trail heyday and the journey from Calais to Kathmandu departed from London in Autumn, returning in Spring. Soon we were also travelling to South Africa, and taking hardy adventurers to the Amazon Basin as well.
