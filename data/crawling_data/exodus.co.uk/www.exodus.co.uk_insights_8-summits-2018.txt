8 Summits for 2018




Share this

































Georgina Lawrence


December 30, 2016







Need a New Year’s Resolution that you will want to keep? Forget boring resolutions about what you’ll quit or lose, here’s a New Year’s Resolution you’ll actually enjoy sticking to: summiting a mountain. From splendidly isolated peaks to iconic volcanic summits, there really is a mountain for everyone. Climb one, and chances are it won’t be your last. Wherever you walk, the sense that the world is opening itself up to you step by step is one of the most liberating and uplifting experience we can imagine. But if you want to talk uplifting – well, the only way is up.

Monte Capanne



Where?
Elba
Level:
Beginner
Max Altitude:
1019m
Avg Altitude:
500m
Take me there:

Elba: Jewel of the Tuscan Archipelago

Elba is one of Italy's best kept secrets, and there's nowhere finer to enjoy this beautiful island than from the summit of Monte Capanne, with stunning views across Elba, Corsica and the rest of the Tuscan Archipelago. Don't fancy the walk? There's the option to take the cable car instead.

Mount Etna




Where?
Sicily
Level:
Beginner
Max Altitude:
3350m
Avg Altitude:
800m
Take me there:

Sicilian Volcanoes

Best for volcanic landscapes; you’ll be hard pressed to beat Sicily for dramatic black lava flows and beautiful, but otherworldly trekking vistas.

Mount Toubkal




Where?
Morocco
Level:
Intermediate
Max Altitude:
4167m
Avg Altitude:
2600m
Take me there:

Mount Toubkal Climb
,
Mount Toubkal Long Weekend
,
Mount Toubkal Winter Climb

Best for those short of time, this popular peak can be conquered in just a long weekend – or, if there’s no rush, the surrounding High Atlas offer miles and miles of pink and orange routes to enjoy.

Mount Triglav




Where?
Slovenia
Level:
Intermediate
Max Altitude:
2846m
Avg Altitude:
2000m
Take me there:

Mount Triglav Weekend
,
Slovenia: Julian Alps Traverse

Best for thrill seekers with a head for heights, this dramatic mountain is in the heart of the moonlike peaks of the vastly underrated Julian Alps. Snake along a vertiginous ridge towards summit glory, aided with a few ropes.

Kilimanjaro



Where?
Tanzania
Level:
Intermediate
Max Altitude:
5895m
Avg Altitude:
4000m
Take me there:

Kilimanjaro Climb - Lemosho Route
,
Kilimanjaro Climb - Rongai Route
,
Kilimanjaro Climb - Lemosho Route & Safari

Best for seeing the curvature of the Earth, a suitably spectacular reward for your efforts. There are several routes to the top – we offer two of the quietest, and most beautiful.

Stok Kangri




Where?
India
Level:
Experienced
Max Altitude:
6153m
Avg Altitude:
4000m
Take me there:

Ladakh: Stok Kangri Climb

Best for gaining high altitude experience, Stok Kangri is many people’s first 6000m peak – giving this summit an aura of romance and nostalgia for many trekkers.

Island Peak




Where?
Nepal
Level:
Experienced
Max Altitude:
6189m
Avg Altitude:
3680m
Take me there:

Island Peak & Everest Base Camp

This is not a summit for the faint hearted. The summit itself is a roped ascent through deep snow, surrounded by a sea of jagged dramatic peaks in the heart of the Khumbu. But the views make it worthwhile.



New for 2018! Lenin Peak




Where?
Kyrgyzstan
Level:
Experienced
Max Altitude:
7134m
Avg Altitude:
4513m
Take me there:

Lenin Peak Ascent

The snowy crown jewel of the Pamir Mountains, Lenin Peak is one of the most accessible 7000m summits out there. For a challenge of epic proportions, this new addition to the Exodus (mountain) range is a must. Plus, the first departure is accompanied by none other than Exodus' mountain queen,
Valerie Parkinson
