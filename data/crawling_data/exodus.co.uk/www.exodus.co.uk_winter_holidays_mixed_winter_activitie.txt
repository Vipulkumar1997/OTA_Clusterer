Mixed-Activity Winter Holidays

Our Mixed-Activity Winter Holidays allow you to try a different winter activity each and every day. This gives you the opportunity to sample everything from gentle pursuits like Snowshoeing and ice fishing or the sheer adrenaline rush of Snowmobiling, Dogsledding or Cross-Country Skiing.

The range of activities available ensure you are never bored and there's a free day so you can revisit some of your favourite activities for another go. Full instruction is always given so no previous experience is necessary. Take a look at the Mixed-Activity Winter Holidays below for more detailed itineraries and activity ideas.

In the spotlight: Finland

Finland's Basecamp Oulanka is our 'wilderness camp' which is a lovely complex of wooden buildings providing comfortable and cosy accommodation in a stunning location overlooking a lake and backing on to the Oulanka National Park. Here you'll feel the call of the beautiful Finnish wilderness and breathe crisp fresh air. The vast forest landscape is punctuated with ice-blue lakes. From Basecamp Oulanka all activities take place, from Crosscountry Skiing, Dogsledding, Snowshoeing and Igloo Building.
