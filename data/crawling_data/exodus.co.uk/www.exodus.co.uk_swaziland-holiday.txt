Adventure Holidays in Swaziland

The tiny Kingdom of Swaziland has a lot to offer: there’s prolific wildlife and incredible scenery, beautiful beaches, awe-inspiring mountains and rich culture, as well as world-class wine. Swaziland has a multitude of game reserves and national parks that are home to the ‘Big Five’ – the lion, African elephant, Cape buffalo, African leopard, and rhino. Its lush landscape is ideal for embarking on exciting on-foot
safaris
– accompanied by an experienced tracker of course.

Highlights of Swaziland

1. Nature walking:
seeing animals and tracks outside of the confines of a vehicle is a thrilling experience and gives you the chance to see and hear the variety of smaller animals and birds that are often passed by while driving.

2. Game drives:
there’s nothing on earth quite like getting up before sunrise to go on a game drive in Africa. Waking up with nature’s creatures on the open plain is spectacular, and aside from the humbling sight of the sun rising over the savannah you’ll have the opportunity to spot elephant, lion, rhino, hippo, giraffe and antelopes.

3. Malolotja Nature Reserve:
stunning flora awaits on one of the many picturesque walking trails that cross 200km of high-altitude grasslands and lower-lying bush. Spot over 280 species of birds and many antelope species and choose from 19 different camping sites.

4. Waterfalls:
the Nkomati River cuts a gorge through the Malolotja Nature Reserve and flows east in a series of falls and rapids. Follow a trail up to a viewpoint to be awestruck by the magnificent Malolotja Falls. Climb even further to the upper Majolomba Falls and take some lunch for one of the most memorable lunches of your life.
