Polar Adventures

Take a voyage to the ends of the earth, on an awe-inspiring journey to the Polar regions of the Arctic or Antarctica. Here you’ll find an icy wilderness made up of the some of the most beautiful and wild scenery you could imagine, icebergs the size of housing estates, and a range of fascinating wildlife, including Polar bears, walruses, penguins, seals and whales.

Once reserved for ground-breaking pioneers and seasoned adventurers, these days you can explore the Poles in comfort on small ships crewed by committed staff with extraordinary levels of experience and a dedicated work ethic. These are the people who make the adventure of a lifetime possible.

New 2018 Polar Photographic Departures

If you’re prepared to go to the ends of the earth for rarefied wildlife, this is the perfect temptation. Exodus’ Arctic and Antarctic photographic charters are exclusively for our travellers, and you’ll be joined by the most articulate, passionate and opinionated wildlife professionals on the planet. On board both charters will be zoologist, conservationist and award-winning author and presenter
Mark Carwardine
and Exodus’ resident photography and wildlife doyen
Paul Goldstein
. On the Antarctic one they will be joined by the BBC’s
Chris Packham
.  Head to
Spitsbergen
for bears, walrus, Arctic foxes and huge bird colonies and
Antarctic Peninsula
for vast penguin rookeries, huge glaciers and icebergs, whales and seals. Neither will have strict itineraries, both will maximise the many hours of daylight – we’ll see you on the ice.

Quotes from the experts:

"It’ll be a real pleasure to have several weeks to teach Paul and Chris a thing or two about photography (I know they’re both keen to learn) in one of my favourite places on the planet. And expedition adventures don’t come much more comfortable than on the Resolute."

Mark Carwardine

“One ship, three Canons…. this will be something. I cannot wait to lock horns with these ‘sometime’ friends again and help share the seventh continent with a hundred or so polar pilgrims. Will the three of us be talking at the end of it? Come and find out!”

Paul Goldstein

“
You don’t have to go to the ends of the earth to get a good photo . . . but it helps! Snow and Ice, Golden Penguins, a Humpback Surprise . . . and these are just the cocktails at the bar! Seriously, this will be amazing.
”

Chris Packham
