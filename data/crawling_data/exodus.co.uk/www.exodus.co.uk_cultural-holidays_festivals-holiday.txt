Festival Holidays

Time it just right, and a festival can make the difference between a fantastic holiday and an utterly unforgettable one. Why not coincide your visit with a huge cultural event, give yourself some added insight into the local life and of course, the chance to celebrate along with the locals?
Our festival holidays are all designed to work around the momentous ev
ent, to give you a front row seat for the festivities, without worrying about the timings yourself. In Mongolia, that means watching the horse racing at Nadaam festival, in Ladakh it’s the unforgettable high altitude masked dances at the Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, and in Mexico it is the colour and excitement of the Day of the Dead. You could be in the whirlwind of colour that is Holi Festival, or the extremely cool (literally) Snow and Ice Festival in China.

In focus: Holi Festival

"Holi celebrates the beginning of spring and it is possibly my favourite festival in India: a riot of colours, with people throwing dyed water at each other in the form of buckets, water guns and water balloons, and smearing colourful gulal (powder) on each other’s faces. All accompanied with dancing and music, and traditional Holi sweets and delicacies such as Ghujiya and Bhaang. It really does bring pure joy to everyone as the bursts of colours transform your face and clothes. Everyone gets involved and as a visitor, you’re a prime target! You’d have to literally stay indoors if you want to avoid it."
