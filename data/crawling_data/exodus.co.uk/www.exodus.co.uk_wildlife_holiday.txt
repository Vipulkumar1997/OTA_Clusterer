Wildlife Holidays

From the Arctic to the African savannah, nothing beats the thrill of being breathtakingly close to some of the world’s most incredible wildlife.

It’s the splash of seawater from a whale’s tail, stepping into a bear’s snowy footprint, canoeing past a jaguar basking on a riverbank, or waking up to the sound of trumpeting elephants. Then there are the Komodo dragons in Indonesia and the orang-utans of Borneo…

Discover Darwin’s enchanted isles on a Galapagos Cruise, look into the amber orbs of a Bengal tiger in India or catch The Great Migration thundering across the mighty Mara River. These are the kind of life-changing moments you can an expect on a Wildlife Holiday with Exodus.

New 2018 Polar Photographic Departures

If you’re prepared to go to the ends of the earth for rarefied wildlife, this is the perfect temptation. Exodus’ Arctic and Antarctic photographic charters are exclusively for our travellers, and you’ll be joined by the most articulate, passionate and opinionated wildlife professionals on the planet. On board both charters will be zoologist, conservationist and award-winning author and presenter Mark Carwardine and Exodus’ resident photography and wildlife doyen Paul Goldstein. On the Antarctic one they will be joined by the BBC’s Chris Packham .  Head to
Spitsbergen
for bears, walrus, Arctic foxes and huge bird colonies and
Antarctic Peninsula
for vast penguin rookeries, huge glaciers and icebergs, whales and seals. Neither will have strict itineraries, both will maximise the many hours of daylight – we’ll see you on the ice.

Quotes from the experts:

"It’ll be a real pleasure to have several weeks to teach Paul and Chris a thing or two about photography (I know they’re both keen to learn) in one of my favourite places on the planet. And expedition adventures don’t come much more comfortable than on the Resolute.
”

Mark Carwardine

"One ship, three Canons…. this will be something. I cannot wait to lock horns with these ‘sometime’ friends again and help share the seventh continent with a hundred or so polar pilgrims. Will the three of us be talking at the end of it? Come and find out!”

Paul Goldstein

"
You don’t have to go to the ends of the earth to get a good photo . . . but it helps! Snow and Ice, Golden Penguins, a Humpback Surprise . . . and these are just the cocktails at the bar! Seriously, this will be amazing.
”

Chris Packham
