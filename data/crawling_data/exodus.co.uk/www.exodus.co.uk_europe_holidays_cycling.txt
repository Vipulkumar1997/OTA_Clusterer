Cycling Holidays in Europe

Cycling




Share this




















Europe is the traditional heartland of cycling. Every year it is home to the most famous and arguably most exciting race the pedal-powered world has to offer, the inimitable Tour de France, and year-round it boasts miles and miles of world-class cycling routes, satisfyingly twisty backroads and iconic cols to ascend and descend.

It’s not difficult to see why cycling holidays in Europe are soaring in popularity. With so many people taking to two wheels it’s only natural to want to branch out, to discover a different country in a different way.

If you want to upgrade from enthusiastic commuter to alpine climber, from a Sunday cyclist to a full week adventurer, or just discover a country in a new and different way, we have plenty of first time cycling holidays in Europe to tempt and inspire you.

Cycling holidays in Europe appeal to all sorts of travellers. For the serious cyclist, there’s the chance to tackle world-famous cols and climbs, push yourself on the same routes as the professional athletes. But you don’t need to be a hardcore training fanatic to take to two wheels. There are leisurely cycling holidays in Europe aplenty: wind your way through multiple countries along the banks of beautiful rivers and canals, meander the pastoral paths through idyllic countryside or find your way through ancient forests and rugged coastlines.  You can choose between a fully supported self-guided ride at your own pace, luggage transfers taken care of and detailed route notes provided, or join a group of fellow friendly cyclists to share the journey with, led by an experienced guide. Either way, you’ll be able to discover the best of Europe on two wheels.
