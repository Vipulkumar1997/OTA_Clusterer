Cultural Winter Holidays

As glittering snowdrifts drape a white blanket around Europe’s shoulders, it isn’t just the landscapes that are transformed – it’s the people and cities too. Festive markets spark into life, snow falls on bustling streets and Christmas decorations twinkle among the city lights.

Our selection of Cultural
Winter Holidays
perfectly capture this truly special time of year. These adventures sparkle with seasonal traditions, Christmas celebrations and wintry charm, taking you to places completely altered by the onset of winter.

Top Four Cool Cultures

Winter in Transylvania:
this feels like how other parts of Europe might have felt decades ago. Still steeped in rich tradition, the architecture, particularly when dusted with a layer of snow, looks like a scene from a story book. Mountains provide the backdrop as you explore traditional Christmas markets, Saxon villages and medieval buildings.

Harbin Ice & Snow Festival:
here creators compete to craft the most fantastical sculptures from ice, snow and lights, resulting in some truly breathtaking sights. China in itself is incomparable during this season, and this itinerary takes you to see stunning cities, temples, the Great Wall and more – all under the intoxicating cover of winter.

Stockholm & the Baltics in Winter:
visit Sweden, Estonia, Latvia & Lithuania on this Baltic adventure, exploring traditional Christmas markets as you go. Meandering through this magical corner of Europe, you’ll see fairytale old towns and capital cities. Guests love relaxing in the crisp, clear air as they sail across the Baltic sea before heading onwards to historic Riga.

Moscow to St. Petersburg:
this week of winter culture will take you to some of Russia’s most notable sights, along with its less explored gems. As well as Moscow and St Petersburg, we stop in Novgorod, Russia’s oldest city. With fewer tourists and an authentic vibe, winter drapes a romantic veil over one of the country’s most important destinations.
