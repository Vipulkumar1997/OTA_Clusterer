Late Getaways


At Exodus we know it's not always possible – or desirable – to book a holiday months in advance. So for the spontaneous traveller who prefers – or needs – to travel at the last minute, we've created a selection of Late Getaways to inspire you. If you can't find what you are looking for, try our search by date option, selecting the country or activity you are considering for your next adventure.

Often we add extra dates to our most popular trips after the publication of our brochures, so check out the Extra Departures if there's something you feel you've missed.

Below are a few trips with late availability for each of our programmes, and even more last-minute adventures can be found on the right in the Quick links panel, including our Christmas Getaways.
