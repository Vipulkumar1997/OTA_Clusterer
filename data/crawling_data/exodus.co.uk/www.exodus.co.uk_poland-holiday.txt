Adventure Holidays in Poland

Poland has disappeared from the map of Europe many times over the centuries, a casualty of the battle line between East and West. But it has emerged as a newly confident and welcoming nation, sure of its place in the world. Visit the grand capital of Warsaw, the cultural heart of Krakow, its 14th century Wawel Castle rising above the Old Town - and the gritty port city of Gdansk, where the Velvet Revolution of 1989 started. History here is rich, endowed with literature and
culture
and whose fervent religious faith has survived the ravages of both Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. But it's all the richer for the juxtapositions. Pay a visit to the sobering Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, and take in the beauty of the Tatra Mountains in the delightful spa town of Zakopane.

Poland: in focus

The Poles are approaching the end of only their first decade of free elections after 45 years of Communism, and Poland’s society, once as deeply traditional as any in Europe, is now developing very quickly as a new generation emerges, keen to adopt the ways of the West. Comprehensive economic reforms have shown dividends and overall standards of goods, services and accommodation have improved considerably as economic growth has taken off.

These days a holiday to Poland goes far beyond the stereotypes of communist housing blocks and stodgy food. Warsaw is a cosmopolitan hub; we visit the port city of Gdansk where the Solidarity Trade Union Movement began – the opposition to the Communist regime that led to the end of Communist Party rule in 1989; and we spend time in Krakow, Poland's cultural capital, with its beautiful old town square, cobbled streets and jazz bars. Plus there's wonderful walking in the beautiful Tatra Mountains.
