Adventure Holidays in Spain

Mixing Moorish magic with Spanish splendour, stunning interior landscapes with old-world majesty, holidays in Spain are so much more than burnt Brits abroad and package holidays. It’s rugged and outdoorsy, infused with passion and a sense of adventure. This is a land of much diversity. From charming bays of the Mediterranean, to the wild Atlantic northwest, the drama of The Pyrenees and Picos de Europa to the Sierra Nevada, each region is wildly different and marked by unique cuisine and dialect. This is a landscape full of secluded valleys, stunning sierras, and scorching coastline, offering scenic Walking and challenging Cycling year round.

Must-see Spanish Attractions

1. Andalucia:
incredible scenery, sublime architecture, fabulous cities and wild undiscovered countryside – Andalucia has it all. The Sierra Nevada boasts rugged mountains, fertile valleys and forests of chestnut and oak. Ronda oozes old school charm and the cities of Granada and Seville parade exquisite Moorish art.

2. Picos de Europa:
this is the setting for some spectacular limestone mountains and home to an astonishing diversity of flora and fauna. A comparatively small area on the Iberian Peninsula, the Picos is home to a large number of vultures – eagles and kites – as well as the odd wolf and bear. Its wild scenery are the big draw for many visitors who come not just for the Walking but also for activity holidays full of caving, canoeing, canyoning and climbing.

3. Mediterranean Coast:
in the upland areas behind the seaside development of Benidorm lie the untouched hills of the Sierra de Aitana and the Valls de la Marina. These limestone ranges offer superb walking in a sunny but mild climate – a perfect escape in the winter months.

















A wonderful week of challenging walking in stunning limestone scenery. The November weather was...
