Day
1










Depart London.







The group flight usually departs in the evening from London Heathrow.
















Day
2










Arrive Colombo; transfer to Minuwangoda.







The group flight arrives at Colombo's Bandaranaike Airport and we transfer to our hotel approximately 30 minutes away. Those not flying with the group will meet us at the hotel.
Tamarind Tree Hotel
or alternative accommodation in the area
















Day
3










Visit cave temples at Dambulla; to Sigiriya.







We depart after breakfast and for approximately 4 hours drive through lush green countryside (a mix of coconut palms, paddy fields and banana plantations) through Kurunegala to Dambulla. Here we visit the magnificent Cave Temple, for some, the most impressive sight in Sri Lanka. There are colourful, well preserved paintings and statues of Buddha inside the caves, which date back to the 1st century BC. After lunch we continue to Sigiriya where we stay for the night. From our hotel we can see Lions Rock rising up from the plains (occasionally we may stay nearer to Dambulla due to hotel availability).
Hotel Sigiriya
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
4










Morning climb to the rock fortress; optional afternoon game drive.







This morning we drive to the foot of the Lions Rock at Sigiriya. The imposing 5th century rock fortress of Sigiriya rises 600 feet from the plains overlooking the surrounding countryside and giving far-reaching views. Used as a safe haven from invaders, the route to the top goes via a series of steep steps and gangways. From the base, where a moat surrounds impressive water gardens, we ascend 200m, passing an overhanging rock under which superb portraits of native maidens holding flowers and temple offerings still adorn the rock wall. Crowning the flat-topped summit of the rock are extensive remains of the King's Summer Palace.

During the afternoon there is a chance to enjoy an optional game drive in either Minneriya or Kaudulla National Park or the Hurulu Eco Park to see elephants in their natural habitat. For those who don’t want to take part, there is time to relax at the hotel.

Hotel Sigiriya
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
5










To Giritale; bike ride through country villages.







This morning we have a short drive to Giritale where our usual hotel overlooks the scenic Giritale Tank. The island’s early inhabitants solved the dual problem of heat and lack of water in this dry area by constructing large tanks to act as reservoirs and cool the warm breeze. Nowadays they provide an important habitat for bird life, particularly from August to April. Today we take to bikes and cycle at a leisurely pace through a series of small villages and lakes (if you don't want to cycle you can follow the group in the support vehicle). We should see plenty of bird life including Egrets, Brahmany kites, Kingfishers and Bulbuls. Stopping for lunch in a traditional village will break up the journey. In the late afternoon we return to our hotel in Giritale.
Deer Park Hotel
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast

Lunch










Day
6










Visit ancient capital of Polonnaruwa; drive to Kandy via spice garden.







After breakfast we take a short drive to the 10th century capital of Sri Lanka; Polonnaruwa, the ancient capital of the Sinhalese. Here there are many Buddhist relics and ruins dating from a thousand years ago when Sinhalese culture reached its zenith. The city flourished in the 12th century after the decision was made to move the capital from Anuradhapura, so it was further away from incursions from Southern India. The ruins are therefore younger and better preserved than those at Anuradhapura. We visit many of the temples, palaces, huge dagobas (Buddhist stupas) and remarkable Buddhist sculptures. After lunch we head into the hills to the picturesque town of Kandy. On the way we stop at a spice garden near Matale where we can see various spices and herbs growing, and there is a chance to stock up on massage oils, spices and Ayurvedic medicines. This is a long but fascinating day and we arrive at Kandy in the early evening.
Hotel Thilanka
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast










Days
7-8










Free time in Kandy to explore or relax.







Kandy is located by a small lake and we spend two full days in and around the town. On the first day we will visit the Temple of the Tooth, which houses Sri Lanka's most important Buddhist relic. The Tooth of Buddha was taken from the funeral pyre in 543 BC and only found its way to Sri Lanka in the 4th century AD. There are literally hundreds of worshippers who visit the temple each day and in August the most spectacular ceremony takes place. Some of our trips in August should coincide with the Kandy festival, but the exact dates, decided by priests, are not known until 5 months prior to the event. After our visit we drive to a beautiful viewpoint over Kandy overlooked by a huge Buddha, and visit a gem museum where you can see the products of the traditional methods of gem extraction. Another highlight is the vast Peradeniya Botanical Garden with species of orchid that are endemic to Sri Lanka. In the evening we may have the chance to attend a performance of dancing and fire eating.
The second day is free to explore this wonderful town. The surrounding hills are wonderful, offering fantastic views of the town below and there are many handicraft stores and antique shops in which to browse.
Hotel Thilanka
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
9










To Nuwara Eliya via Kitulgala; optional Adams Peak climb (Dec-Apr only).







Leaving Kandy early, we have a spectacular drive through the countryside on the way to Kitulgala. Here we have the opportunity of going on a walk through the jungle or local villages followed by an optional white water rafting excursion. The rafting costs extra (see the Optional Excursions section), lasts a maximum of 1.5 hours and there is a choice of gentle or wild water (grade 3 rapids) depending on your preference. Those of us who do not wish to go rafting will be able to freshen up and relax by the water until the rafters return in time for lunch. Afterwards we will drive to our hotel in Nuwara Eliya.

(Please note that from the full moon day of December to the full moon day of May it is possible to climb Adams Peak. This is optional and you need to be very fit to attempt this. You would leave Nuwara Eliya at 11pm on day 8 and drive to the base of the peak. From here it is a strenuous 4 hour climb to the top in time for sunrise. We then return to Nuwara Eliya to join the group for lunch on day 9).

Plantation Hotel
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
10










Free morning in old colonial hillstation of Nuwara Eliya. Visit tea factory in afternoon.







This morning we will have free time to explore the beautiful town of Nuwara Eliya. Nuwara Eliya was a popular hill station during the British era and is situated in the cool highland air at 1890m. Known locally as 'Little England' it is dotted with British style houses and parks and features a golf club and a racecourse! Following lunch we will visit a nearby tea factory and learn about the process of tea production.

St. Andrew's Hotel
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
11










Early morning to Horton Plains; walk to World's End viewpoint; to Bandarawela by train.







We have an early start this morning and take a 30km drive south to Horton Plains, a large plateau over 2,000m high, overlooked by the second and third highest peaks in Sri Lanka. The scenery is beautiful and the best way to explore is on foot. We take a guided walk through the rolling grasslands where we hope to see such as the Sambur and Purple Faced monkey. We also visit 'World's End' which is one of the most stunning sights in Sri Lanka where the ground drops 1050m to the plains. Following this we catch a train from the highest railway station in the country - within an hour and a half we drop from 1889m to 1097m. The train travels through the cloud forest into the tea plantations, with breath-taking views of the lush valley below. Although the train can be very busy on occasion, this is still a great experience. We get off at Bandarawela, a town relatively untouched by tourism.

Bandarawela Hotel
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
12










Scenic drive through Ella Gap to Kataragama; game drive in Yala N.P.







Today we continue on to Ella Gap where we have spectacular views of the coastal plain nearly 1,000m below. Almost the entire southern part of the island is in view and on a particularly clear day the shimmering silver of the Indian Ocean is visible. Heading south out of the hills we travel to Kataragama on the plains; this is our base for visiting Sri Lanka's best known national park, Yala. The park is popular for elephant, leopard, bear, crocodile and Wild boar. At 97,800 hectares, this is the second largest of Sri Lanka's national parks. Its open undulating terrain made it famous for elephants for many years, but recently the park has also become better known for leopard. The park, which is primarily shrub jungle with several salt and fresh water lagoons, has one of the highest concentrations of leopard per square kilometre in the world. (Please note that the sanctuary may be closed for 4-6 weeks from September to October allowing the park authorities to check the welfare of the animals. We therefore go to an alternative area close by, usually Udawalawe National Park).
Mandara Rosen
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
13










Drive to Tangalle and walk through rice paddies; coastal drive to Ahangama; optional lunch at Tsunami house.







Today we leave for the coast, with its beautiful palm fringed bays. Stopping on the way at Hambantota and walking to a nearby farm house where you be offered tea in a coconut shell along with a local snack. We will mix with real Sri Lankan life and take part in some traditional Sri Lankan games, returning to our bus in tractors used by the farmers. We have the option of enjoying lunch at one of the houses that we built for Tsunami victims; this may be one of the best curries of your trip! Continuing on to Ahangama in the afternoon we arrive at our coastal hotel and you can relax for the rest of the day.
Garton's Cape Resort
or alternative accommodation in the area










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
14










Free day to relax on the beach or optional activities including whale watching (Nov to April).







Today is a free day to relax on the beach or by the hotel pool. There are also optional activities during the day including a boat ride through mangrove swamps to a cinnamon plantation or, from November to April you can go whale watching off Dondra head, one of the best places in the world for seeing Blue and Sperm whales. Huge pods of dolphins are also often seen playing alongside the boats.

15










To Galle; visit old fort and turtle hatchery; transfer to Colombo.

Essential Info

Visas


Sri Lanka





A visa (Electronic Travel Authorisation) is required if you are British and for most other nationalities. If you do not hold a British passport, please check the visa requirements with your local Sri Lankan Embassy or the ETA website
www.eta.gov.lk
. Passengers should also be aware of local laws and customs in Sri Lanka (
https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sri-lanka/local-laws-and-customs
). The mistreatment of Buddhist images and artefacts is an offence; please note that people have been refused entry to Sri Lanka because of visible tattoos of Buddha.






Vaccinations


Sri Lanka





There are no mandatory vaccination requirements.

Recommended vaccinations are: Polio, Tetanus, Typhoid, Hepatitis A.

The risk of malaria is slight but you may wish to consult your GP or travel health clinic for further advice.

Dengue fever is a known risk in places visited. It is a tropical viral disease spread by daytime biting mosquitoes. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available for Dengue, and therefore the best form of prevention is to avoid being bitten. We recommend you take the usual precautions to avoid mosquito bites.






Eating and Drinking




All breakfasts and 1 lunch is included.

We suggest allowing about £15-£17 (approx. US$24 - US$27.50) per day for all other meals. Sri Lankan cuisine is a fascinating reflection of the island’s heritage; there is a unique fusion of fresh local produce with spices brought to the island over the centuries by Malays, Arabs, Indians as well as the Dutch, Portuguese and English. Despite (or perhaps because of) these influences, Sri Lankan cuisine is often referred to as simply ‘Rice and Curry’. This is the staple dish in most restaurants and is usually a serving of rice accompanied by assorted meat and vegetable curries as well as various pickles, ‘sambols,’ and a handful of tiny poppadum’s – all using the contrasting flavours of coconut, chilli, curry leaves, cinnamon and garlic.

Vegetarians are well catered for but please inform us before departure of any special dietary requests. Please note that in Sri Lanka the availability of certain products is minimal or non-existent, for example wheat or dairy-free. Please be prepared for this and you may need to bring these from home. Spicier food can be avoided easily and lots of the hotels will serve Western options alongside traditional food.






Weather




Generally, you should expect rain at some time but with plenty of sunshine. On the plains, day and night time temperatures are warm to hot with Colombo having an average daytime temperature of 30ºC. The temperatures drop as we go higher into the hills and especially at Nuwara Eliya and Horton Plains where daytime temperatures are between 10º - 15º C and night time temperatures will be chilly (about 8º C minimum) and a warmish jacket will be needed.






Kandy







Is this trip for you?



This is not a demanding trip although there are a few long drives, on bumpy and twisty mountain roads. The buses that we use are comfortable and air-conditioned. Temperatures can vary between the tropical heat of the coast to the cool of the mountains.

We stay in a range of excellent hotels, ranging from comfortable and modern to older properties bursting with character. Many have pools, and most have excellent facilities as well as restaurants serving tasty local specialities and international dishes.

Accommodation






Hotels


























You will spend 14 nights in en suite hotels. On these departures we stay in a range of excellent hotels, ranging from comfortable and modern to older properties bursting with character. Many have pools, and most have excellent facilities as well as restaurants serving tasty local specialities and international dishes.

Please note that hotels in Sri Lanka are becoming increasingly busy and occasionally we have to find alternatives to the ones that we usually use. We will endeavour to find the nearest alternative that provides the same standard of rooms.

Single accommodation available on request.

DIscover Sri Lanka




Two weeks of absolute bliss. A group of 15 gelled magnificently considering age range was between 28- 72! Starting in the capitol, Columbo we ventured north to Dambulla + Sigiriya taking in Cave temples and climbing the impressive Lion Rock- what views! Something we would get used to over the course of the fortnight, each different view offering us an awesome insight to the lush, green island before us. Game parks - herds of elephants- not the odd one or two - dozens. Along with multitudinal birds of all colours , shapes, sizes and other animals( although the Leopard did not make an appearance this time )- Sri Lanka is a nature lovers paradise. Temples, architecture, stupas, sculptures in abundance enough to satisfy the cultural aspect of the trip. Cycling through paddy fields, white water rafting , whale watching all achieved and even if you were not athletically inclined the majority of luxurious hotels had a pool to lounge by and an informal game of cricket on the beach caught the imagination of even the most non sporting amongst us. Trips to a gem factory , woodcarving store, spice garden were also on the itinerary. There was something for everyone. Food was delicious - curry and rice but other 'western' food available. Beer relatively cheap. shopping in Kandy was a must - this definitely the place to get any souvenir or just to treat yourself. Can't believe we did so much and saw so much - the time flew by - even the 'free days'. Thoroughly recommend.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


I loved the white water rafting and floating down the river kept afloat by life jacket.
Swimming in Indian ocean also high on hit list




What did you think of your group leader?


Neelaka has the broadest grin ever. He was so knowledgeable about all sorts, plants, animals, birds, temples, history, religion, geography- like many guides has a repertoire of anecdotes. He had time for everyone, no 'problem' was too small and was sorted immediately. Definitely made the holiday - a good group leader, one of best I have encountered




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Take a prepaid card for money. ATMs available and cash can be exchanged at airport.
Buy goods in Kandy - best prices here.
Laundry available in some hotels - you do not need to take loads of clothes.
Try all the food - even curry for breakfast - has to be done
Be aware the train may be mega crowded




Is there anything else you would like to add?


One of the most enjoyable trips I have been on with Exodus.

Discover Sri Lanka Premium




Beautiful and varied country with a lovely laid back and fascinating culture. The trip manages to combine a good mix of scenery, culture and history in a relaxed manner with outstanding food if you like moderately spicy curry. The logistics and transport were excellent. The hotels were superb except for one which we understand Exodus will not use in future.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Sigirya rock was both fascinating and visually impressive, helped by the fact that our tour leader organised for us to see it first thing in the morning before the crowds arrived. Candy and the temple of the Tooth were also impressive but then again so was the bike ride along the river and travelling through the tea plantations. Each day was different and interesting.




What did you think of your group leader?


Roshan was outstanding. He was calm, assured, organised, approachable, knowledgeable, sociable, with an English sense of humour. He brought the trip to life not only explaining the history but also never afraid to discuss the challenges facing modern Sri Lanka. It was no surprise to learn is in the Exodus Hall of fame.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Watch out for small leeches on the jungle walk if it's been raining. they are harmless but it's a bit unpleasant.

Lovely trip of Sri Lanka with a variety of activities




Lovely country, lovely people. Trip had good variety of culture, scenery, wildlife and walking/cycling/rafting. Fairly active trip but with times to relax. Group mixed well which made the trip more enjoyable. Hotels good except at Kitulgala. Drives not too long - able to spread out in coach (driver and mate really good).




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Seeing around 150-200 elephants converge at the National Park on Day 3 and watching them play and interact.




What did you think of your group leader?


Roshan was a very experienced group leader with a great sense of humour and organisational skills.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Take good trainers/walking shoes as they are required for some of the walks. There seem to be quite a lot of 'special' days when no alcohol available.

Discover Sri Lanka, premium holiday




This holiday provides a really good overview of the highlights of Sri Lanka




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


All three in our party had different moments: The views from Lion Rock, meeting a family at a farm and surviving the white water rafting! Plus many, many more




What did you think of your group leader?


Sujan was excellent. He always informed us what we were doing, and made sure we had enough time to see and experience everything




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


It was easy enough to get money from ATMs, so travellers cheques were not needed. Most hotels also took credit cards. Be prepared to eat a lot of hotel buffets as there's not much option to eat out




Is there anything else you would like to add?


The trip is very busy (especially if you do all the options), but there is also plenty of time to relax as well.

A really varied tour with something for everyone - exactly as promised. Beautiful country, great people, delicious food (and if they say "hot", they mean it!).




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Sitting at World's End, awe-inspiring view and perfect peace - before the bus-load of Chinese tourists arrived.




What did you think of your group leader?


Quite brilliant. Easy to see why he is a 'Hall-of-Famer'!




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Go now. The first of the big chain hotels (Marriott) is about to open on the beach on the South coast so book early before everyone else does.

An overview of flight options
Exodus is committed to making joining our tours as easy as possible, wherever you live. We generally only block book seats from London, but this certainly does not mean that you need to fly from there. Depending on the route and airlines available, there will usually be various options available for those who want to fly from their local airport.
This page aims to provide a useful overview of the options available to our clients. However, the best flight arrangements should be tailored to your personal requirements, so please contact our Sales team for expert advice.

What kind of options do I have ?
1. We can book for you: Flights from anywhere in the world - not via London

Depending on the route, this may be direct or via an overseas hub like Amsterdam, the Middle East or elsewhere. On short haul routes there may be direct flights with low cost airlines, charter flights or scheduled airlines. Exodus can book most, but not all, of these for you. The most appropriate airline may be different to that which we use for the group flight from London, but many people now travel on different airlines and meet up with their fellow passengers at the destination.
Pros

Cons
May be the most direct route
Often the extra fare compared to the London flight is minimal.
As you will be in the hands a single airline for your entire journey, the airline will be responsible for your bags and your connections.
You may not be able to join the group transfers. However, we can usually arrange private transfers, or book your flights to try and coincide with the group transfers. See notes on
transfer arrangements
below.

2. We can book for you: Connecting flights from your local airport to London
Exodus can book connecting flights to London so you can join the group flight there. Connecting times will be followed according to airline advice, or as requested by clients. There are two types of fares we can use for this option: a 'through-fare' or a 'published fare'.

a) A 'through-fare' is where you will be in the main airline's care throughout. You change planes, but your bags are checked all the way through to your final destination.

b) A 'published fare' ticket is completely seperate from your onward ticket from London. It is usually cheaper than a through-fare but will need to be paid for and issued as soon as it is booked. This can be a problem if your tour has not yet reached minimum numbers. On 'published fares' neither airline is aware that you have connecting flights, so Exodus is responsible for timing your connection, not the airlines involved. The tickets are also usually non changeable and non refundable.
Pros

Cons
Depending on the fare type, Exodus or the airline is responsible for flight connections.
Through fare tickets can be expensive.
On a published fare, tickets must be issued immediately; tickets on published fares can be very difficult to change if onward flight times change; bags are not checked though to your final destination.
Published fares are non-refundable.

3. Booking some or all of the flights yourself
You can also book connecting air travel yourself, either to London, or all the way to the start point. There may be certain airlines or routes we don't have access to, so this is always an option. However, if you make your own travel arrangements you become liable for any delays, cancellations or missed connections, and Exodus is not required to offer refunds if you have trouble reaching the start of your trip.
Pros

Cons
You might find cheaper fares, or routes not available to Exodus.
You are responsible for any delays or missed connections, and the cost of the tour is not protected should you miss your flight be cancelled.

Notes on transfer arrangements
Sometimes it is possible to travel on a different airline to the group flight from London. Where this is the case, we need to think about ensuring you meet up with the group with minimum extra cost and hassle.
On certain trips, it is easy to arrive on a different flight and still meet the group at the hotel with time in hand. We can usually arrange private transfers (at extra cost) or offer advice on taking a taxi to the start hotel.
On other trips (especially in Europe), the transfer meets the group flight and then travels some distance to the first night's accommodation. Where this is the case, our Sales team will try to arrange flights that arrive before (and depart after) the group. However, we do have to make it clear in your final documentation that if your flights are delayed, the transfer cannot wait for you. While Exodus or our local operators will do what we can to help you reach the start point of the tour, any additional costs must be paid by the client.
