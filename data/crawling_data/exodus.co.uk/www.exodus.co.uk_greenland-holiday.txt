Adventure Holidays in Greenland

Greenland is the world’s second-largest island. Covered in a huge ice sheet, three kilometres deep, towns cling to its rocky coast. For many, it’s the ultimate adventure holiday destination, particularly for those seeking a
Polar Adventure
. Here there are many fjords, deep, steep-walled valleys that eat into the coastlines and are flooded with seawater. In the short summer season, there is 24-hours daylight, and it’s an excellent place to spot wildlife including Polar bears, humpback whales, musk oxen, walruses, reindeer and sea eagles to name but a few. And, due to it's isolation and northern position, Greenland is also an excellent destination for
Northern Lights Holidays
during the winter months.

Greenland highlights

Western Greenland has both one of the fastest moving glaciers in the world, Eqip Serm, and the most productive glacier outside of Antarctica, known as the Sermeq Kujalleq. At 10 kilometres wide and 1,000 metres thick, it’s enormous. The icebergs produced by this glacier represent more than 10% of all icebergs in Greenland, corresponding to 20 million tonnes of ice per day.

Eastern Greenland is home to the world's largest fjord complex, Scorsbysund, which contains 'Iceberg Alley', with majestic icebergs, some of which are over 100 metres high. The eastern coast of Greenland is the most isolated and the communities found here are the most traditional, demonstrating ways of life which are now long past in other areas of Greenland. This region also contains the remains of Thule winter houses, once inhabited by the ancestors of Greenland’s indigenous people.
