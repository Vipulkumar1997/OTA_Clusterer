Small breaks, big adventures

We think that there's always time for a little adventure, and if you think so too, our range of Short Breaks could be for you.

Perfect for those craving a bit of excitement but struggling to make time for adventure, in just a long weekend you could stand on the highest point of North Africa, the Norwegian fjord’s most iconic viewpoint, or cycle some of the most famous routes of the Tour de France. All you need to do is take a couple of days of work, and we'll do the rest.

Exodus Short Breaks are also perfect if you want to travel with friends, family or a group of fellow enthusiasts and we're able to Tailormake the perfect trip for you. It's never been easier to fit in a quick escape to see majestic brown bears in Finland or the Northern Lights adorning the skies – all in just a few days away from home.

You'll be amazed at what you can achieve in a weekend.
