Adventure Holidays in Myanmar

After years of isolation from the outside world Myanmar is starting to emerge as a tourist destination. It has recently been given the all clear by Tourism Concern, which had previously boycotted the country, following Aung San Suu Kyi's request for visitors to return. Myanmar holidays are now an exciting possibility! The highlights of Myanmar include the mystifying Thousand Temples of Bagan, Rangoon’s colonial charm and glittering Shwedagon Pagoda, Inle Lake and Mandalay Hill are just a few of the places this amazing country has to offer; whether you prefer to cycle, walk or take it easy, there’s a Myanmar trip for you.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

Highlights of Myanmar

Bagan:
shrouded in dawn mist, over two thousand temples loom large over the surrounding plains. This is Bagan, once-capital of an ancient empire, now staggering archaeological site sprawling from horizon to horizon. Myanmar holidays just aren’t complete without a chance to immerse yourself in this piece of history. For a truly magical experience, take a hot air balloon over the complex at sunrise.

Inle Lake:
high in the mountains of Burma lies a body of water unlike any other in the world. Inle lake, though not deep, is home to numerous endemic species; it has its own ecosystem! The lake is home to floating villages and markets, built atop the water itself – the locals pilot small boats between them, rowing with their legs whilst standing so as to be able to see over the dense floating plantlife and reeds. To top it all off tranquil monasteries are scattered around Inle lake’s shores, creating a peaceful and spiritual environment. Travel on one of our Myanmar holidays to see this one-of-a-kind place up close.

Shwedagon Pagoda:
in the city of Yangon (formerly Rangoon), one of the most impressive monuments on the planet stands tall, visible from all around. The Shwedagon Pagoda is a 99m tall, and covered base to tip in gold which glimmers in the sunlight. As the most sacred Buddhist pagoda in Myanmar, this wondrous structure is an absolute must-see on all Myanmar holidays.
