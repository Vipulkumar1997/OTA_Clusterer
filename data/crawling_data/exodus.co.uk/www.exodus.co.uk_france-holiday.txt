Three French Highlights

The French Riviera:
stunning architecture and exotic gardens, hilltop communes and secret coves - as you travel closer to the Italian border, the French Riviera is enchanting. In the artists’ town of Menton visit the Jean Cocteau museum, and in the mountain town of Sospel, take lunch at the Place Saint Michel.

The Alps:
marked by huge glaciers, massive cliffs, waterfalls and massive snow-clad summits. As you zigzag up the valley, forests take over and at 2000 feet even those thin away to reveal the mountains. The pretty town of Chamonix tends to be the base for those wishing to explore mighty Mount Blanc. In the summer trek through sweet smelling pastures, in winter explore the snowy wilderness by snowshoe.

The Loire Valley:
explore UNESCO World Heritage Listed chateaux that dot the countryside as you leisurely ride through the beautiful countryside of the Loire Valley. Feast on deliciously ripe tomatoes and crusty French bread, and some of the best wine that France has to offer.
