Our destinations

There's something about visiting a new country, culture or environment – whether it's a desert, mountain range or jungle – that just can't be beaten. At Exodus we're always on the look out for new people and places to visit, and currently there are more than 100 countries on our map. We have a shared desire to visit new places and to come home with a real feeling for a particular country’s unique identity, from local traditions to lifestyle and cuisine. At the same time, we always remember that we are guests, so we travel courteously and respectfully, in smaller groups to minimise our impact, to ensure every
Exodus holiday is a beneficial experience for everyone. We take this philosophy with us around the world, helping you reach some incredible destinations across all seven continents.

Many of the flights and flight-inclusive holidays on this website are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all holiday and travel services listed on this website. Please ask us to confirm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected. Please see our booking conditions for information, or for more information about financial protection and the ATOL Certificate go to:
www.atol.org.uk/ATOLCertificate
If you book arrangements other than an ATOL protected flight or a package holiday, the financial protection referred to above does not apply. Our ATOL number is 2582 and our ABTA number is Y0751.
