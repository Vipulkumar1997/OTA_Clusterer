Adventure Holidays in Estonia

Few tourists venture to Estonia, an undeniable part of the appeal of this pleasant Baltic state. Here there are stunning cities, whose fairytale appearance belie their vibrant nature; stunning National Parks containing windswept beaches, hushed pine forests and glistening lakes; and a fascinating historical and cultural mix that binds its Soviet past with ancient mythology and a delightfully quiet pastoral setting. It’s a joy to cycle on its winding – and remarkably flat – backroads, and delightful to walk among its fantastically varied countryside, exploring incredible architecture and picturesque castles perched atop hills, as you go. And then there’s cross-country skiing through slow-clad pine forests: for this is paradise for winter-activity seekers.

Highlights of Estonia

Tallinn:
The stepping off point for most people it Tallinn, with its captivating UNESCO-listed old town. Framed by old city walls, and completely free from modern buildings, this is a gem and you can leave modern life behind as you explore the cobblestone alleys with spluttering torches and secret stairways. There’s a surprise around every corner: look out for Toompea palace and castle, the Alexander Nevsky cathedral, the Dome church and the St. Nicholas church.

Lahemaa National Park:
The Lahemaa National Park – meaning the Land of Bays – takes in 725
km
2 of untouched sandy beaches, waterfalls, cascades and mossy pine forests. Its a haven for wildlife, with 222 types of birds here and 50 mammal species, including brown bear, lynx and wolf. The park offers a verity of cultural sights like Palmse Manor and the pretty 400-year-old fisherman’s village of Altja.

Tartu:
Known for the prestigious, 17th-century University of Tartu, students make up one seventh of the population here, giving Estonia’s second city a youthful buzz and rich cultural offering. Visit the cafe-filled main square for excellent people watching or explore the cities winding streets admiring the omnipresent street art. Don’t miss the ruined Tartu Cathedral, in hilltop Toomemägi Park, which has two restored towers with viewing platforms.
















Great trip with a wonderful group and just sooo much to see plus lots of great food!
