Mixed-Activity Holidays

Can’t decide what you want to do on holiday or want to try it all? Our Mixed-Activity Holidays offer a new challenge each day, whether you’re learning a new skill or simply discovering a fresh perspective of a different culture. All you need to join an Exodus Mixed-Activity Holiday is an up-for-it attitude and a reasonable level of fitness. We’ll do the rest.

And who knows where you’ll find yourself? You could be ziplining through Costa Rica’s rainforest; kayaking along the beautiful Dordogne; wildlife watching as you canoe the Zambezi River. You could be cycling through Vietnam’s rice paddies; whitewater rafting the wild beauty of the Pyrenees; or canyoning in Spain’s wild Sierra de Aitana. For a Winter Holiday with a difference, our Mixed-Activity Winter Trips are the perfect introduction to life in the snow, and include cross-country skiing, dogsledding and igloo building, all in stunning snow-wrapped landscapes.
