Adventure Holidays in Russia

Stretching from the Baltic to the Pacific and the Arctic to Central Asia, Russia is the biggest country in the world. It has an enormous variety of landscapes and attractions, perfect for cycling, walking or exploring. Holidays in Russia have a big cultural agenda. The iconic cities of
Moscow
and
St Petersburg
providing plenty of architectural interest. Here the ornate domes of St Basil's Cathedral and the Church of Our Saviour's Blood rise above the busy streets, and the Armoury in the Kremlin and the Hermitage in the Winter Palace house incredible collections of art. To the east of the Ural Mountains lies Siberia, a seemingly endless expanse of wild landsape. Lake Baikal is the deepest and oldest lake in the world, home to 1,500 endemic species. Further east still is Kamchatka, dominated by volcanoes and a dramatic place for a trekking holiday.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

A tale of two cities:
Moscow to St Petersburg

Repositioned as a cosmopolitan, sleek and stylish capital, you don’t have to scratch far beneath the surface to find the Russian blood that courses through this proud city’s squares and thoroughfares. In Novgorod, the birthplace of the country, Mother Russia’s culture is impossible to ignore, and St Petersburg’s Hermitage and Catherine Palace will leave you in no doubt – Russia is smitten with two things: power and beauty.
