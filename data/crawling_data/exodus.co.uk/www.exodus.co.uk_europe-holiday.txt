Adventure Holidays in Europe

Adventure is right on our doorstep! With so many cultures and countries just a short flight away, Europe holidays offers far more than they're given credit for. With gloriously sunny summers and snowy winters, there’s something to keep you entertained all year round.
Stretching from the countries of the former Soviet Union in the east to the Atlantic islands of Iceland and Greenland in the west, Europe is one of the most beautiful and diverse regions on the planet. And whether you want to explore a new place on a laid-back city break, or make new friends on an action-packed adventure, our Europe trips offer so much more than just a week on the beach.

Expert opinion:

Europe is packed with the very ingredients we travel the globe for: romance, adventure, contrast, drama. Our adventures here range from challenging treks through the Alps, to wildlife-watching trips in Romania or a week of family fun in France. Then there’s kayaking and canyoning in Turkey, foodie trips to Italy, and trekking tours amongst the snowy peaks of Bulgaria’s mountains. Holidays in Europe really have it all.

"My trip to Romania with Exodus involved only a three-hour flight, but it introduced me to landscapes and cultures I thought had long disappeared, as well as one of the most thrilling animal encounters I’ve ever had: watching a dozen brown bears from a hide deep in the Carpathian Mountains. Now there’s a backyard worth exploring."

Where Adventure Begins

Exodus began life in 1974, when two friends got together to provide an overland truck to the Minaret of Jam, the most inaccessible of the world’s great monuments. It was the hippy-trail heyday and the journey from Calais to Kathmandu departed from London in Autumn, returning in Spring. Soon we were also travelling to South Africa, and taking hardy adventurers to the Amazon Basin as well.
