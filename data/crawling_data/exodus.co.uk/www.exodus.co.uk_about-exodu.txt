About Exodus

It's all about adventure

That is what Exodus was founded upon over 40 years ago, and what the company is still all about. Discovering countries, cultures, environments, cities, mountain ranges, deserts, coasts and jungles; exploring this amazing planet we all live on.

At Exodus, we know what makes you tick when it comes to holidays. It’s a desire shared by so many others. A yearning to visit new places and come home with a real sense of what they’re all about. This means delving into local traditions, cultures, cuisine, lifestyles – anything that contributes to its unique identity. At the same time, we always remember that we are only guests. So we travel courteously and respectfully, in smaller groups to minimise our impact, to ensure that every Exodus holiday is a beneficial experience for everyone involved.

This is a philosophy we take with us around the world, helping you reach some incredible destinations on 500 itineraries across over 90 separate countries. We also strive to provide as much flexibility and choice as we possibly can, making it simple for you to experience a very different holiday.

Exodus started life on 4 February 1974 when two friends got together to provide an overland truck to travel to the Minaret of Jam, deep in the heart of the Hindu Kush, the most inaccessible of the world’s great monuments. See
our history page
for more details about how we began and how we have grown over the past 43 years.

Never travelled with Exodus before? Visit our
New to Exodus
page for some useful, first-timer information.



With Exodus you're in safe hands

All our office staff have a passion for travel and adventure, and between us we’ve notched up experience that spans 171 different countries – all of which means we know how to give you the best experience when you travel with us.
We’ve even won awards for it
.

That’s not all. In their former lives, our team members have been professional archaeologists, wildlife guides, overland drivers, mountain leaders, diving and ski specialists and mountain bike gurus – and we use our expertise to give you the very best adventure possible. Extensive planning, research, fact-finding and training are just some of the ways this expertise comes through in your adventure.

It is no exaggeration to say that our tour leaders can make a world of difference to the enjoyment of your holiday – so we choose them carefully. The result is that, in 2015, 97% of travellers said they would recommend us to a friend. Where possible, we train and employ local leaders because they can provide invaluable insights that enrich the trip. What’s more, this investment in local staff really helps us benefit both them and their community.

Every year we recognise the outstanding contribution of our leaders in our annual
Tour Leader Awards
. Our winners for 2016 are Justin (Kilimanjaro, Tanzania) and Marinella (Puglia, Italy) –
find out more about them here
.

Work for Exodus
page for our current vacancies.

Your words, not ours...




We bring to the forefront the feedback from our clients, watch the video clip...














Your opinion matters
to us and to show this we offer a monthly prize draw of £500 Exodus Holiday vouchers when our travellers complete the Holiday Evaluation Form (HEF) upon their return from their adventure with us. You can find out more on the
Your Opinion Counts
page.

Leader Awards


THE SHORTLIST -
please
vote for your tour leader
!
From the nominations you send in, we will compile a shortlist of the top ten Exodus tour leaders for 2017. A panel of widely travelled expert judges will then make the final decision, based on client votes, comments and feedback from the trips that they have led during the year.

See who are the winners of the
2016 Leader Awards
.



Responsible Tourism

Tourism is one of the most important and largest industries on the planet. It employs more people worldwide than any other, with millions of families relying on tourism for their daily needs. Of course there are negatives attached.

The last few decades have been dotted with disaster stories where tourism has resulted in over-development, destruction of environments and in cultural misunderstandings and mistrust. It has also recently been embroiled in the debate about global warming and carbon emissions caused by flying. At Exodus we believe that our type of small group, positive impact tourism can bring benefits to many communities, help preserve the environments we travel to see, and provide real and positive social exchanges.

Please visit our
Responsible Travel
section for more information.











Fully Protected

Exodus is a fully licensed and bonded tour operator. We hold an Air Travel Organisers Licence (ATOL) no. 2582 issued by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and we are bonded with the CAA. Our ATOL bond covers all holidays which include air travel. In the event of our financial failure before departure, all monies paid, except insurance premiums, will be refunded. If failure occurs while you are on your trip, the bond administrators will first of all attempt to apply the funds to complete your trip, or if this is not possible, they will ensure that you are repatriated to the UK. Should the bond be insufficient, back-up funds are available through the CAA. Our membership of this organisation means that our accounts are subject to regular and stringent independent scrutiny, which, although it cannot prevent failure, certainly makes it less likely. You can book with Exodus in complete confidence that all monies paid to us for trips are fully protected.

Our membership of this organisation means that you can book with Exodus Travels Ltd in complete confidence that all monies paid to us for trips (not for insurance premiums) are protected.

Exodus (Registered in England No. 1150160) is a member of the Travelopia Group of companies. Registered Office: Origin One, 108 High Street, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 1BD.  For more information visit
www.travelopia.com

Many of the flights and flight-inclusive holidays on this website are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all holiday and travel services listed on this website. Please ask us to confirm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected. Please see our booking conditions for information, or for more information about financial protection and the ATOL Certificate go to:
www.atol.org.uk/ATOLCertificate
If you book arrangements other than an ATOL protected flight or a package holiday, the financial protection referred to above does not apply. Our ATOL number is 2582 and our ABTA number is Y0751.
