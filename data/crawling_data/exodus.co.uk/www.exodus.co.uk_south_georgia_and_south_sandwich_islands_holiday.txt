Adventure Holidays in South Georgia

This is one of the most remote destinations on this planet: a holiday to South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands. Located just north of Antarctica, this rugged island archipelago is about as wild as you can get.

Here you can follow in the footsteps of famous explorers, like Captain Cook who visited in 1775, and Ernest Shackleton, who tragically died just off the coast and is buried here. Now there is just a British Government office, postmaster, museum staff and scientists who inhabit the island alongside a whole host of seals, penguins and birds. Getting here is no mean feat, so let Exodus take care of logistics while you concentrate on making memories.

Wildlife highlights of South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands

1. Penguins:
Salisbury Plain, St Andrews Bay, Gold Harbour, and Right Whale Bay house the four largest King penguin colonies, whereas Copper Bay offers a wide variety of wildlife including Macaroni, Gentoo and Chinstrap penguins.

2. Seals:
pups play in the surf off Fortuna Bay while enormous Southern elephant seals dominate the beaches. South Georgia is home to the largest population of elephant seals, and over half of the world’s population of these extraordinary beasts.

3. Whales:
Humpback, Fin, Minke, Southern right and Blue whales have been spotted. Check out the abandoned whaling village of Stromness and former whaling station and Whaling History Museum at Grytviken. This part of the island is also where Shackleton’s grave lies.
