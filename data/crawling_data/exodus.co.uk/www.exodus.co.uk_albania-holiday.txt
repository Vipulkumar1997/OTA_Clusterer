Adventure Holidays in Albania

Until the collapse of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania in 1991, few people had glimpsed the country hidden within, and Albania remains far less visited than neighbouring Greece. On a holiday to Albania, here you’ll find a wild and rugged landscape. Snow-capped mountains, inviting beaches, pretty rural villages, a genuine subsistence culture and an exceptionally friendly welcome, make it the dream destination for many adventure travellers. Its quiet roads are perfect for cyclists, and the national parks perfect for walking. Both Roman and Greek civilisations have each left their mark here: the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Butrint is located on the picturesque coastline, and is one of the country’s most important archaeological sites. According to legend the city is thought to have been a trading city founded in the 8th century BC, by people escaping Troy.

Responsible travel: Albania

Our goal for Adventure 2017 is to give disadvantaged children from all over the world the chance to experience the same adventures as our travellers do. In Albania, we took 30 children from a small orphanage on an Exodus tour of Berat, led by experienced Exodus guides.

Berat is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Albanians affectionately call it the City of a Thousand Windows and it is a huge centre of Albanian history. There’s a beautiful walk through the aromatic pine forests marked by the striking white shapes of the Ottoman houses perched on the hills, and an the imposing 14th century castle overlooking it all. The citadel contains both Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques side-by-side, linked by ancient cobbled streets and – surprisingly – houses where people still live. It’s the dictionary definition of living history, and a chance for the children to learn more about their own culture and identity.
