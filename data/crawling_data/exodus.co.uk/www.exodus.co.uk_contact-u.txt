Common booking | Post booking questions





Considering booking a trip?





See our page:
Before You Go FAQs
to help you understand our adventure holidays and what happens next after booking with us.







What if I need to change my booking?





If you wish to make any changes to your booking, particularly if you need to alter any flights booked through us, please let us know as soon as possible. Flight amendments often incur extra airline costs depending on the changes to be made and if the ticket has been issued or not. All requests for changes should be referred to
Customer Operations
.







What if I need to cancel or transfer my booking?





If you need to cancel your booking, please let us know as soon as possible. This is required in writing and you should refer to the
booking conditions
with regards to any cancellation charges that may apply. Normally, if you cancel before the final balance is due, the deposit and insurance premium are non refundable but we can usually hold your balance for you to use on a future trip. Please contact Exodus for further details. Once your final balance has been paid, there is a sliding scale of charges, outlined in the booking conditions.

If you wish to transfer your booking to a different holiday or traveller, you should contact us before the final balance is due for your existing holiday, and there are no fees charged by Exodus to do so. Any changes are, however, subject to any additional fees charged by local suppliers or airlines. Transfers after the final balance is due are classed as a cancellation and re-booking. For cancellations or transfers, please contact
Customer Operations
.

.







How can I pay my balance?





How can I pay my balance?

The balance of your payment is due 56 days (133 days for Polar trips) before departure. Your invoice shows the date your final balance is due and, if you have booked directly with Exodus and we have an email address for you, a reminder will be sent out 1 to 2 weeks before this date. To pay, you can use any of the following methods, quoting your booking reference in all cases:

Call the Accounts team on 020 8772 3743; we accept all major Credit Cards and UK Debit Cards. Please note that we do not accept payment by Amex. There will be no fee applied to payments made on any other card types.

Pay us by Bank Transfer – payments in £ Sterling should be made to Exodus Travels Ltd. Sort Code 20-65-63, Account No. 53813509. For payment in other currencies, please contact us directly.

Send a cheque, made payable to 'Exodus Travels Limited', to The Accounts Department, Exodus Travels, Grange Mills, Weir Road, London, SW12 0NE.

For queries, assistance or to pay by card, you can contact the accounts team as follows: telephone 020 8772 3743, email
[email protected]
or fax 020 8675 5276.

A receipt of payment will be emailed out to the lead booker within one working day of payment being received. If you have not received a receipt and would like one, please contact the accounts team on the above number. If payment is not made on time you may lose your place on the trip, although we will always do our best to contact you before we cancel your booking.







About my ‘flight inclusive’ booking





Each Exodus holiday has a designated group flight. This is the recommended flight for use in conjunction with this trip and will be the one the tour leader meets at the start of the holiday. It is possible, due to limited availability or higher costs, that clients may travel on flights other than the designated group flights in order to make the trip, even when booking through Exodus. Some clients also choose alternative flights if they prefer a different airline or route.

Transfers
Arrival and departure transfers are included in the price of any trip booked with group flights, and these are booked for you automatically. If you are travelling on alternative flights, then separate transfer arrangements may be required; this may involve waiting for the group transfer, booking a private transfer or deciding to make your own way at your own cost. Any alternative arrangements will be discussed at the time of booking and your confirmation invoice will show what transfer type has been confirmed for you.

Regional flights
If you would like Exodus to arrange flights from your local UK airport, our sales team are happy to look into this for you at the time of booking. If you have already booked and would like to discuss the possibility of changing your flights to depart from a regional airport, please contact the
Customer Operations
team.

Changing my flights
Once booked, your flight may be changeable depending on the airline conditions of contract and if you wish to change your flight details, you should contact Exodus as soon as possible. Any changes are subject to availability and may involve additional costs. There is also a standard flight ammendment fee of GBP25. Once your ticket has been issued (usually 4 to 8 weeks in advance of travel), changes are generally more costly and sometimes not possible at all.

Dietary requirements on flights
If you advise us of any dietary requirements at the time of booking or in sufficient time before you travel, these will be automatically passed on to the airline concerned. Please note meals are not included in the ticket cost for many European and shorthaul flights these days.

Seat requests
With most airlines, specific seat requests can be made from the time of booking up until a few days before departure and the sales or customer operations teams will be happy to look into this for you. Many clients ask about emergency exit seats (for the extra leg-room) but very few airlines will allocate these in advance of travel and they will only be given out at airport check-in. Some airlines do offer the option to pre book and pay extra for them, usually starting at about GBP50 per person.

Online check-in
Online check-in is becoming more and more popular these days and almost all airlines offer this service. The airline reference we provide with your final joining instructions is usually all you need, although sometimes they will ask for a full ticket number, which we can provide. However, if we have booked your flights as part of a block allocation of seats then you will not be able to check-in online, even if the airline offers this service. Please check with the customer operations team for further details.

Baggage allowance
We recommend that you don't travel with more than 20 kilograms of luggage. Some international flights may have higher allowances for checked baggage, and exact allowances are available from our customer operations team. On certain holidays that include domestic flights, there may be lower allowances; this is mentioned in the trip notes if applicable.

Lost luggage
In the event of missing luggage, you must immediately file a Passenger Irregularity Report with the airline concerned. If the baggage is damaged, you must write to the airline within seven days and, in the case of delay, you should write within 21 days from the date on which the baggage was returned to you (in accordance with the Montreal Convention). The liability for baggage loss, delay or damage is up to a maximum of GBP800.

Missed connections and flight delays

When you buy your international flights through Exodus, we guarantee to get you to your destination at no extra cost to yourself and as quickly as possible. If your flight is delayed, cancelled or you miss a connection, we will do what we can to reroute or rebook you as required, but sometimes this is handled directly by the airline. If you miss your flight through your own fault, the airline will normally assist you with rebooking your travel but you may incur additional costs. If you are due to arrive on different flights to those originally booked, you must contact Exodus immediately (or our out of hours service) to inform us of your new flight details, so that we can pass them to the leader locally.

Please note that if, for any reason, you don’t show up for your original outbound flight (if you decide to buy a new ticket to reach your destination, for example) that airlines will usually then class you as a no-show and also cancel your inbound flight home. If you are considering buying a new ticket for any reason and have your flights booked with Exodus, please contact us before doing so, as we will need to confirm whether or not your original inbound flight will still be valid.

Denied boarding
EU regulations are in force to protect clients who are denied boarding or who are delayed by an airline. These apply to all flights originating in the EU or flying into the EU using an EU carrier. If you are ‘bumped’ or have your flight cancelled without at least 14 days notice you are entitled to compensation unless the airline can prove that it was due to circumstances beyond their control. If as a result of being denied boarding, you are delayed by more than 12 hours, you have the right to cancel your booking and receive a full refund. The airline must also supply suitable meals and refreshments. Complimentary refreshments are also an entitlement if your flight is delayed beyond a certain number of hours. For full details please visit
www.ec.europa.eu/transport/air_portal
. If you are at the airport you can also ask the airline representative for written details of your rights.

Assistance while travelling to your destination
Exodus offers a 24-hour assistance service to all our passengers. Anyone who has trouble or major delays on their flights should call Exodus (or our out-of-hours service) to advise us of the latest situation and to see what assistance we can offer. However, in many cases the airline handling your booking will be your point of contact for rearranging flights, providing overnight accommodation and general airport assistance. Exodus does not have representation at any UK airports or any overseas transit airports, and has limited contact with UK airline offices over weekends.







About my 'land only' booking





Joining the tour
When you purchase a tour on a land only basis (i.e. without international flights from Exodus), you take the responsibility of reaching the start point of the tour yourself. In most cases, the start point of the tour is the first night’s accommodation; the exact start point is referred to in the brochure, website or trip notes for that trip. Our final joining instructions contain detailed advice on how to reach the start point from the main airport for that destination. Meeting times with the tour leader and group will vary from tour to tour, normally depending on the arrival time of the group flight from London. However, instructions for land only clients should be displayed in the hotel or left with reception confirming what to do next.

Making use of Exodus transfers
If you have booked land only and your flight arrangements allow you to make use of the Exodus group transfers, then we can arrange for you to join these at no charge. You must request this in advance and provide us with your flight arrival details. You should be aware that if your flight is delayed, the Exodus group transfer will not wait for you indefinitely (we usually set a maximum waiting period of 30 minutes beyond the scheduled arrival time) and you will be responsible for the cost of your onward travel arrangements to catch up with the group.

Changes to group flight arrangements
Occasionally we are forced to change the group flight, and re-arrange the group transfer accordingly. If you are relying on taking the group transfer, you may need to make alternative arrangements if the transfer no longer coincides with your flight arrangements










We are currently experiencing an issue with Edge and Safari browsers which makes it look like the request hasn't gone through, however the request will go through and you will receive a confirmation email.

Many of the flights and flight-inclusive holidays on this website are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all holiday and travel services listed on this website. Please ask us to confirm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected. Please see our booking conditions for information, or for more information about financial protection and the ATOL Certificate go to:
www.atol.org.uk/ATOLCertificate
If you book arrangements other than an ATOL protected flight or a package holiday, the financial protection referred to above does not apply. Our ATOL number is 2582 and our ABTA number is Y0751.
