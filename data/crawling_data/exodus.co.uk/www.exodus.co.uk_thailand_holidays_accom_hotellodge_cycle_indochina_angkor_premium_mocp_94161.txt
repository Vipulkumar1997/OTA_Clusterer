In Vietnam we enter the Mekong Delta, a spectacular patchwork of rice paddies and waterways. Our journey ends in Saigon where the frenetic pace and vibrant street life contrasts starkly with the rural areas we have cycled through, and will leave a lasting impression.

Day
1










Depart London.























Day
2










Arrive Bangkok.







There will be a group meeting and briefing in the evening followed by an optional group dinner for those that would like to join. Your main luggage will be transported ahead of you to the start point early in the morning so please bring this with you to the meeting; just hang on to what you need for the night/morning - you will be with your luggage again mid-morning tomorrow.
Comfortable Hotel
















Day
3










Early transfer to Nakorn Nayok N.P; warm up ride on jungle roads/trail.







Early morning transfer to Nakorn Nayok National Park., the start point of our cycling. Our route today is approx 60kms but we suggest you don't attempt to cycle the full distance unless you are well acclimatized to the heat. The support vehicle follows us throughout the day so you can cycle as much or as little as you like. Our route follows minor roads and byways and we pause at Khun Dan Prakan Chon Dam for our rest stop where we have the option for a quick swim. We will pass through small villages and past monasteries and paddy fields. Continuing the ride along country backroads we arrive at our hotel in the late afternoon with time to relax before sampling some of the local dishes. Cycle approx. 60km.
Standard Hotel

2018 departures - Ayuttaya

For all 2018 trips we will instead be starting cycling in Ayuttaya as per the below description:

An early start this morning as we venture out of Bangkok to the ancient town of Ayuttaya. Our two hour transfer takes us into the heart of this fascinating site and we start cycling by the huge reclining Buddha. Much of the old town was destroyed by the Burmese in the 18th Century and we will cycle through the remaining shrine towers and enormous temples to appreciate the past magnificence. We will finish today’s warm-up ride at Aranyik village, famed for traditional knife making, and will pause to learn a little about this age old tradition that has been passed through generations. Cycle  approx. 46km.










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
4










Cycle to Sa Keaw.







Today we follow minor roads through rural Thai landscapes including rubber and eucalyptus plantations as well as tapioca and rice fields. There are a few easy rolling hills but the route is mostly flat.The ride ends when we join a busier road before driving the final short distance to the town of Sa Keaw by bus. Cycle approx. 90km.
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
5










Ride to Aranyaprathet.







Leaving our hotel early in the morning we ride towards Tha Krabak where we can stop by a reservoir for a swim and a view of the untouched jungle on the other side. We will break for lunch before carrying on cycling on quiet but well-maintained scenic roads on the way to Aranyaprathet, 10km from the Cambodian border. Cycle approx. 85km.
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
6










Into Cambodia and on to Siem Reap.







After breakfast we drive to the busy border and complete customs formalities as we cross into Cambodia at Poipet. We then drive to Siem Reap. Due to years of civil war the country is poorer and less developed than its neighbours. Apart from growth in the capital and around Siem Reap, the way of life in the countryside is still very much the same as it has been for centuries. This afternoon's ride from Siem Reap takes us past Wat Athvea, a modern temple in the grounds of the ruins of an Angkorian temple, and ends at a market and picnic area outside of Siem Reap. Cycle approx. 20km.
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
7










First of two full days to explore the temple complex of Angkor by bus and bike, including Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, the Bayon and Banteay Srei.







Today we may choose to have an early start to avoid the inevitable crowds drawn to the wonders of Angkor. The various temples are spread over a wide area and are linked by shady avenues; meandering our way between them by bike gives us a unique perspective. Our cycle tour will include the jungle-covered Ta Prohm, with the amazing roots of the Fromagier trees clinging to the ancient stones, Angkor Thom with the famous Bayon temple of 37 towers (originally there were 49) topped with the four faces of the king, and of course the incredible Angkor Wat, with its huge moat, long causeway and massive towers - it is the largest temple complex in Asia. Cycle approx. 25-30km.
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
8










Second day at Angkor temple complex.







Today we cycle outside the main Angkor complex to the outlying temple of Banteay Srei, 35km from Siem Reap town. Our route takes us past paddy fields, and through pretty villages. Banteay Srei was built in the 10th Century and contains some of the finest examples of Khmer sculpture. Although much smaller than the later temples, here all of the buildings are covered in exquisite carvings. In the afternoon as we cycle back to Siem Reap we can stop and visit a few of the less visited Angkor temples. Siem Reap town is pleasant to wander around; the market has plenty of interest and excellent shopping and there is a vibrant nightlife scene. This afternoon there should also be time to visit the Tonle Sap Lake, which is a branch of the Mekong River. This optional trip includes a boat ride to see the floating fishing villages. Anyone wanting to do this visit may need to miss part or all of the ride back to Siem Reap, depending on timings. Cycle approx. 70 km. if riding the full distance to and from Banteay Srei.
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
9










Drive to Phnom Penh, stopping at Skuon.







Today we take a bus journey of approx. 7 hours along National Road 6 to Phnom Penh. We will have a couple of stops, one in the town Skuon, which is known for its local delicacy of fried spiders. The road is currently undergoing some resurfacing so some sections will be a bit of a bumpy ride! We should arrive in Phnom Penh for late afternoon, the perfect time for a sundowner on the Mekong.
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
10










Sightseeing including Royal Palace, Silver Pagoda and Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and the 'Killing Fields'.







The fortunes of Phnom Penh have shifted dramatically during its history and the terrible years of the Khmer Rouge and subsequent civil war through 1970s and 1980s have scarred the country. During our stay we visit two sites which give us a vivid impression of some of the horrors. There is the Genocide Museum, which is the former Khmer Rouge prison known as S-21 or Tuol Sleng, in the centre of the city. 15 km. of out of town is the area known as the 'Killing Fields,' a mass grave and execution site for the former inmates of S-21. While visiting Tuol Sleng and the Killing Fields may not appeal to everyone, we feel they give us an important understanding of what the country and its people had to endure just a few decades ago.

On a more positive note, the city is very much on the rise again and is a fascinating place with fine examples of French colonial architecture. We tour the Royal Palace with its Silver Pagoda. There is also excellent shopping at the 'Russian' market, and the lively Mekong waterfront area, where our hotel is located.
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
11










Transfer to Takeo then cycle to Vietnam border and Chau Doc.







This morning we transfer south out of Phnom Penh to the town of Takeo. Here the road becomes quieter and we mount our bikes for the 50km ride to the Phnom Den / Tinh Bien border. Once border formalities have been completed we meet our Vietnamese leader and cycle approximately 30km to Chau Doc. Cycle approx. 80km.
Standard Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
12










Drive/cycle through the Mekong Delta to Vinh Long; catch boat to homestay.







A morning transfer by road to Long Xuyen where we take a public ferry across the river. From here we ride along a lovely quiet backroad, lined with small villages and dwellings, towards Vinh Long. Leaving the bikes on the mainland, we take another boat (20 mins) to reach our homestay on an island in the Mekong Delta, known as the 'rice bowl' of Vietnam. After settling in we can explore the area on foot. The rivers and canals of the Mekong Delta form an amazing network of waterways. The area is famous for its abundant rice production but in many areas farmers are now moving to more profitable fish-farming and fruit and vegetable growing. The evening is tranquil as we have dinner at the homestay and enjoy some 'Delta' hospitality. We spend the night sleeping at a simple guesthouse built in the style of a local house. Bedding, a mosquito net and a small towel are provided. Cycle approx. 50km.
Homestay










Meals included:


Breakfast

Dinner










Day
13










Transfer to Cai Be for floating market; scenic cycle along Mekong riverbank; transfer to Saigon.







We leave by boat, stopping en route for a look at the Cai Be floating market. Here large boats moor up in the Mekong River, weighed down with fruit and vegetable produce. Local traders and shop owners buy in bulk in this strictly 'wholesale' market. A little further on we make a short stop to see cottage industries producing such items as popped rice, popcorn and other homemade products. We start our ride towards Cai Lay where we take a scenic route through fruit orchards and along the Mekong riverbank. Back on the bus in My Tho, we drive on to the heat, hustle and bustle of Ho Chi Minh City, still usually known as Saigon. This is an exciting and absorbing city where scooters pack the streets and temples stand defiantly alongside modern developments. Devastated by the Vietnam War, it is now a free market city where anything goes. Our hotel is in the heart of this incredible city. Cycle approx. 35km.
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
14










Free day.







The whole day is free to explore Saigon, do some shopping and to relax. There are a number of interesting things to see - the Saigon River, Ben Thanh Market, Reunification Palace and Notre Dame Cathedral are all within easy walking distance. Alternatively a short cyclo (cycle taxi) ride will take you to the War Remnants Museum with an interesting (if a little gruesome) photographic record of the Vietnam/American War. For those that are interested your leader can arrange an optional visit to the Cu Chi Tunnels, located 2 hours outside the city. Used by the Viet Cong during the war the network covers 3 levels and approximately 240km of tunnels. Originally these were very narrow but some areas have been widened to allow tourists to explore the system. Claustrophobes may prefer to stay outside in the sunshine!

Essential Info

Visas


Thailand





A visa for Thailand is not required for British nationals for stays of 30 days or less. If you are unsure of the requirements please check with your nearest Thai embassy.







Cambodia





Arriving By Flight: An electronic visa (e-Visa) facility is available via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs & International Co-operation website at the cost of $37. A tourist visa can be obtained on arrival for British nationals at most border crossings. Two passport photos are required. The cost is US$30, although an additional express fee of US$5-6 may be incurred at the border. For further information see the FCO site and check under Cambodia / 'Entry Requirements'.

Arriving Overland: A tourist visa can be obtained on arrival for British nationals at most border crossings. Two passport photos are required. The cost is US$30, although an additional express fee of US$5-6 may be incurred at the border. For further information see the FCO site and check under Cambodia / 'Entry Requirements'.







Vietnam





A visa is no longer needed for British, German, French, Spanish and Italian citizens travelling to Vietnam (for all purposes) for a period of up to 15 days, and on the basis of meeting all conditions prescribed by Vietnamese laws. The visa exemption period will end on 30 June 2018. All other nationalities require a visa to enter Vietnam and this must be obtained prior to departure. For further information see
http://www.exodus.co.uk/assets/travelink/Vietnam.pdf
or the FCO site and check under Vietnam / 'Entry Requirements'.






Vaccinations


Thailand





There are no mandatory vaccination requirements. Recommended vaccinations are: Polio, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Typhoid, Hepatitis A. The risk of malaria is slight but you may wish to consult your GP or travel health clinic for further advice. Dengue fever is a known risk in places visited. It is a tropical viral disease spread by daytime biting mosquitoes. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available for Dengue, and therefore the best form of prevention is to avoid being bitten. We recommend you take the usual precautions to avoid mosquito bites.







Cambodia





There are no mandatory vaccination requirements. Recommended vaccinations are: Polio, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Typhoid, Hepatitis A. Malaria risk is low but we suggest that you seek advice from your GP or travel health clinic about malaria prophylaxis.







Vietnam





There are no mandatory vaccination requirements. Recommended vaccinations are: Tetanus, Polio, Typhoid, Hepatitis A and Diphtheria.
The risk of malaria is slight, but you may wish to consult your GP or travel health clinic for further advice. Dengue fever is a known risk in places visited. It is a tropical viral disease spread by daytime biting mosquitoes. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available for Dengue, and therefore the best form of prevention is to avoid being bitten. We recommend you take the usual precautions to avoid mosquito bites.






Eating and Drinking




All breakfasts and 1 dinner are included.

The food on this trip is a real highlight for many. Southeast Asian cuisine is known for its abundance of freshly prepared dishes with strong aromatic flavours. There is a focus on herbs and citrus to ensure each dish packs a punch; chilli does feature highly too but is easily avoided if desired. Typically most dishes will come with rice and many are often served in a banana leaf with a variety of dips and herbs served separately. The three countries visited ensure a different culinary experience every time you cross the border; ensure you try the freshly made Pad Thai noodles from the street stalls of Bangkok, the fish amok curry in Cambodia for a creamy coconut-based fragrant curry and the Banh Xeo (huge sizzling pancakes) found in Vietnam cannot be missed!
Western food is readily available almost everywhere. Vegetarians are well catered for but please inform us before departure of any special dietary requests. Please note that the availability of certain specialized products for restricted diets, e.g. gluten-free or dairy-free, is minimal or non-existent and we strongly recommend you bring these specialised dietary items from home. You may find it beneficial to bring some 'cycling snacks' with you from home if you have high energy bars or gels that you like to use during a ride. For those who wish to contribute a kitty is normally arranged (see extra expenses) - fresh fruit, nuts, biscuits and local snacks are all provided from the snack kitty along with soft drinks and electrolyte powders.






Weather




In Thailand and Cambodia the weather will be hot and humid all year round. The dry season runs from November to April with the monsoon between May and October. April and October are transition months. The dry season is characterized by hot days and generally clear skies, though you can expect the odd shower. The monsoon is characterised by short, sharp bursts of rain. The monsoon can be a very atmospheric time to travel but an umbrella may be useful! In Thailand and Vietnam the weather patterns are very similar to Cambodia and you should expect year round temperatures from 25-39C. The rainy season will normally run from June to September when you should expect short sharp showers, but the sun will normally break through for extended periods. From the end of March to May the temperatures become very hot and humid with temperatures into the high 30’s between Bangkok and Siem Reap as this is the build up to the monsoon season.






Siem Reap


Bangkok







Is this trip for you?



This trip is classified road and graded Moderate. Please see the introductory pages of the cycling holidays brochure for more important information on classification and grading. If you have any queries about the difficulty of the trip please do not hesitate to call us. Average daily distance: 47km (29 miles) No. of days cycling: 11 Vehicle support: 95% Terrain and route: road quality is generally good tarmac in Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, with some easy dirt roads in Thailand and Vietnam. Conditions will be hot and humid and there are some long days, but there are very few hills.

Accommodation






Upgraded Hotels and Guesthouses




Our premium departures either stay in the same hotels we usually use on our standard trips but in upgraded rooms with balconies or larger rooms, as some examples of the main differences. Some of the hotels have been upgraded and changed entirely. We will still stay in the standard guesthouse in the Mekong Delta on premium trips despite this not being premium accommodation, as this is regarded as a highlight by many people. An extra BBQ dinner is also included on the first night of the trip and drinks and snacks are included whilst cycling for parts of the trip.

Single Accommodation

Single rooms are available for a supplement for hotel nights only. Please advise the sales team at the time of booking if you require a single.

Extra Accommodation
Is available in Bangkok and Saigon before and after your trip please ask your sales consultant if you wish to book extra nights. Due to high demand for rooms there is a chance it may be in a different hotel to the end hotel of your trip.

Trip:



Cycle Indochina & Angkor - Premium





cycle indochina & angkor




We had a really great time on this action packed trip.There was so much to see especially since we experienced 3 countries in 2 weeks so we never really had a spare moment. The cycling was great mainly flat with some quite long days the longest being 90 k, but the roads are mainly flat with good surfaces and with the excellent bikes the cycling was no problem and although it was quite hot, it was cool in the saddle. We booked the premium trip and were impressed with the standard of hotels and the snacks at the rest stops were amazing.Having been on the Myanmar, Cuba & Costa Rica trips which were all excellent but we thought the premium trip was worth the extra.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The first time we caught sight of Angkor Watt after the 20k cycle from our hotel in Siem Reap was breathtaking
and Pub street in Siem Reap was a real eyeopener.
Crossing the two boarders during our trip especially into Cambodia was also a unique experience.




What did you think of your group leader?


Our Group leader was an amazing lady called IS from the moment she met us at the Bangkok airport to the emotional parting when we left he at Ho Chi Mhin she was a revelation. I can't praise he enough not just as a fantastic guide but all the extra little things she did like checking that everyone was happy with their room after arriving at each hotel and making sure no one was left out on free days and nights.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Book this trip its so interesting with so many things to see, we still can't believe we have been.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


It would have been nice to all have had cycle shirts with Exodus logo and Bankok to Ho Chi Mhin
would not cost that much and think of the advertising, we had so many tourists asking us what we were doing.

Cycle Indochina & Angkor - Premium





Indo china premium cycle tour




A thoroughly enjoyable trip. Fantastic scenery off the beaten track and away from tourists to see the real countryside and how the locals live. Our guide was very knowledgeable and great fun and took us to eat local street food that he knew was safe. Food was dirt cheap in Thailand and Cambodia. A bit more expensive in Vietnam. Wine was expensive but beer was cheap. We were lucky with the weather and had only one day where we got drenched. The rest of the time it was hot and steamy.
Don't take any notice of the Exodus currency advice. We found it incorrect. Take US dollars only. We took pounds sterling and couldn't change them anywhere and had to supplement the few dollars we had with an ATM withdrawal. Take some Thai baht but don't bother with Cambodian Real or Vietnamese Dong.
If you are reasonably fit and adventurous then this is for you. There were support vehicles a plenty if you needed a rest. The snacks provided were very welcome at the breaks.
The only negative if you can call it that was the hotels. Excellent 4 star plus but you could have been anywhere in the world. We would have preferred more character. The air con however was very welcome. The most characterful stay was at the homestead in the Mekong delta on an island




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Cycling on tracks by the Mekong though local villages. We all got horse responding to the locals saying hello all the time. Very friendly. The river trip to the floating market was also unusual and interesting. You have to do the extra trip to the CuChi tunnels near Saigon. The saddest morning was the visit to the Killing fields and torture prison in Cambodia. You have to do it just to appreciate the horrendous time the country went through. A thoughtful and moving experience.




What did you think of your group leader?


Chai was excellent. His local knowledge was a great help and he knew al the best places to sample local food at dirt cheap prices. He was very conscious of safety on the roads and wherever we went and we never felt uncomfortable anywhere. He organised everything and everyone wonderfully and even provided a helping hand to some the group up some of the minor hills. The countryside is flat as a pancake with a few gentle inclines but the heat and humidity take it out of you. Chai ensured that we had regular stops for water etc usually about every 15 km.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Take US dollars only or include some Thai baht. Don't take pounds sterling. Take suncream and ensure you take your deet mossie spray. We didn't see many but my wife had a few bites even so. Also take your malaria tablets.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Of the 4 Exodus cycle trip we have taken this one comes second to the Coata Rica coast to coast. However this one has to be the best supported from a local guide and leader perspective.
Go for it, all our group thoroughly enjoyed it. The local bike team in Thailand had some new toys and made a video of the trip during the three days we were in Thailand. An excellent addition to all our photos.

An overview of flight options
Exodus is committed to making joining our tours as easy as possible, wherever you live. We generally only block book seats from London, but this certainly does not mean that you need to fly from there. Depending on the route and airlines available, there will usually be various options available for those who want to fly from their local airport.
This page aims to provide a useful overview of the options available to our clients. However, the best flight arrangements should be tailored to your personal requirements, so please contact our Sales team for expert advice.

What kind of options do I have ?
1. We can book for you: Flights from anywhere in the world - not via London

Depending on the route, this may be direct or via an overseas hub like Amsterdam, the Middle East or elsewhere. On short haul routes there may be direct flights with low cost airlines, charter flights or scheduled airlines. Exodus can book most, but not all, of these for you. The most appropriate airline may be different to that which we use for the group flight from London, but many people now travel on different airlines and meet up with their fellow passengers at the destination.
Pros

Cons
May be the most direct route
Often the extra fare compared to the London flight is minimal.
As you will be in the hands a single airline for your entire journey, the airline will be responsible for your bags and your connections.
You may not be able to join the group transfers. However, we can usually arrange private transfers, or book your flights to try and coincide with the group transfers. See notes on
transfer arrangements
below.

2. We can book for you: Connecting flights from your local airport to London
Exodus can book connecting flights to London so you can join the group flight there. Connecting times will be followed according to airline advice, or as requested by clients. There are two types of fares we can use for this option: a 'through-fare' or a 'published fare'.

a) A 'through-fare' is where you will be in the main airline's care throughout. You change planes, but your bags are checked all the way through to your final destination.

b) A 'published fare' ticket is completely seperate from your onward ticket from London. It is usually cheaper than a through-fare but will need to be paid for and issued as soon as it is booked. This can be a problem if your tour has not yet reached minimum numbers. On 'published fares' neither airline is aware that you have connecting flights, so Exodus is responsible for timing your connection, not the airlines involved. The tickets are also usually non changeable and non refundable.
Pros

Cons
Depending on the fare type, Exodus or the airline is responsible for flight connections.
Through fare tickets can be expensive.
On a published fare, tickets must be issued immediately; tickets on published fares can be very difficult to change if onward flight times change; bags are not checked though to your final destination.
Published fares are non-refundable.

3. Booking some or all of the flights yourself
You can also book connecting air travel yourself, either to London, or all the way to the start point. There may be certain airlines or routes we don't have access to, so this is always an option. However, if you make your own travel arrangements you become liable for any delays, cancellations or missed connections, and Exodus is not required to offer refunds if you have trouble reaching the start of your trip.
Pros

Cons
You might find cheaper fares, or routes not available to Exodus.
You are responsible for any delays or missed connections, and the cost of the tour is not protected should you miss your flight be cancelled.

Notes on transfer arrangements
Sometimes it is possible to travel on a different airline to the group flight from London. Where this is the case, we need to think about ensuring you meet up with the group with minimum extra cost and hassle.
On certain trips, it is easy to arrive on a different flight and still meet the group at the hotel with time in hand. We can usually arrange private transfers (at extra cost) or offer advice on taking a taxi to the start hotel.
On other trips (especially in Europe), the transfer meets the group flight and then travels some distance to the first night's accommodation. Where this is the case, our Sales team will try to arrange flights that arrive before (and depart after) the group. However, we do have to make it clear in your final documentation that if your flights are delayed, the transfer cannot wait for you. While Exodus or our local operators will do what we can to help you reach the start point of the tour, any additional costs must be paid by the client.
