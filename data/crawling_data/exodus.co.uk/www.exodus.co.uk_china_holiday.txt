Adventure Holidays in China

From epic mountains and desert moonscapes to the modern chic of Shanghai; ancient civilisations to the People’s Republic, holidays in China are vast and varied, just like the landscape. On a China trip, you need to take your time to take it all in. Overland tours give the maximum opportunity to make your trip a real once-in-a-lifetime experience. Iconic sights are aplenty: float down the Yangtze, follow the Silk Road and stop off at the Great Wall before you arrive at the Forbidden City. China has so many cultural sights and natural wonders that you will be spoilt for choice.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

Adventure Holiday to China: The Highlights

1.
Follow the Silk Road
:
one of the world’s oldest and historically important trade routes and had a huge influence on the civilisations of the West. A series of trade routes connecting China to the Mediterranean via the Central Asian steppes. The vast plains and great deserts create an unmissable wilderness landscape, home to nomadic tribes and marauding warriors. The Silk Road is also home to the forgotten cities that were once the centre of civilisation – Samarkand and Bokhara in Uzbekistan, and Kashgar, regal posts on this incredible journey to Beijing.

2.
Trek the Great Wall
:
China’s most famous landmark, the Great Wall, winds like a dragon across the landscape. Stretching over 6,000km it maps out most things Chinese, taking in Imperial tombs, quiet rural villages and mountainous highlands before reaching Beijing itself. The best bits are away from the tourists, and we'll take you to the more remote areas. Your effort will be rewarded with peace and tranquillity, and an opportunity to get a real sense of the scale and majesty of this remarkable construction.

3.
Walk among the Terracotta Army
:
in 1974, a group of peasants unearthed one of the biggest archaeological discoveries of the 20th century: over 8,000 life-sized terracotta warriors. Beautifully crafted with astonishing attention to detail, the soldiers had been lying there for over 2,000 years guarding the tomb of the first Chinese Emperor in the ancient city of Xi’an.
