Adventure Holidays in Mexico

Bordering the US to the north and Guatemala and Belize to the south, Mexico is a fantastic country of contrasts: tropical jungles, palm-fringed beached, Indian markets, colonial towns and the majestic ruins of the Aztecs and Mayans. Mexico is a large country and needs at least ten days to two weeks to travel through. Highlights of a Mexico holiday are always the time spent in the Yucatan Peninsula - especially the extraordinary ruins of Chichen Itza, Palenque and Tulum. Travelling distances around Yucatan are not too great and there is plenty of time to relax and soak up the pulsating Latino atmosphere. You'll find a range of Mexico holidays below.

Expert Opinion: Chichen Itza

“Chichen Itza, which has been voted one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. With its central step pyramid it is an imposing site. The pyramid was originally used as a calendar: four stairways, each with 91 steps and a platform at the top, making a total of 365, the equivalent to the number of days in a calendar year. If you are fortunate enough to be there at the rising and setting of the sun during the spring or fall equinox, the corner of the structure casts a shadow in the shape of a plumed serpent along the side of the North staircase. On these two days, the shadows slither down the northern side of the pyramid with the sun’s movement."
