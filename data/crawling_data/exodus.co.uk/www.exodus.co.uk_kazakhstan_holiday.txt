Adventure Holidays in Kazakhstan

Probably the biggest country in the world people know almost nothing about. Much of the country is wide open steppe where the odd run down town serves the gas and oil industry and a rocket launch-site for the Russian space agency. In the south, however, in areas bordering Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, the landscape is different. Mountains rise up with green pastures and flower meadows, gorges and lakes. This part of the country also lay on one of the branches of the historic Silk Road as see through mausoleums and citadels, whilst the country’s biggest city, Almaty, is more akin to its European counterparts than Asian ones with leafy boulevards and café culture. It’s definitely a country with a lot more to offer the curious traveller than Borat would have us believe.
