Adventure Holidays in South Korea

South Korea, the "Land of the Morning Calm" has long been overshadowed. A holiday in South Korea will reveal a dynamic country steeped in culture, tradition and history, it offers vibrant cities, rich landscapes, friendly locals and staggering, jaw-dropping nature. This, combined with the chance to taste some of the most underrated cuisine in the world – the smells of sizzling barbecue and the clinking sounds of locals drinking rice wine at Gwangjang Market, is a feast for the senses – makes a trip to Korea unforgettable. With Exodus you’ll go further on your South Korea holiday, and get closer than ever before: spend a night partaking in ceremonies at the UNESCO World Heritage Haeinsa Temple and even visit the ‘living Cold War museum’ village of Panmunjom to learn how Korea was divided. And we can take you to South Korea during the cherry blossom Spring season, according to availability.

Must-see South Korea:

1. Panmunjom:
the only place on the peninsula where North and South Koreans can meet face to face. It was here that the peace treaty was signed in 1953 and where both parties agreed on a Joint Security Area (JSA) in the middle of the border between the two countries, also known as DMZ (Demilitarized Zone).

2. Seoraksan N.P.:
situated on the beautiful east coast, the Seorak Mountains are a sight to behold. At their feet is an enormous Buddha statue which makes for a perfect starting point to explore a variety of trails from 2km to 10km.

3. Andong Hahoe Village:
here century old traditions, influenced by the teachings of Confucius, are still alive. The inhabitants live in the same way their ancestors did, in simple houses for the common farmers and in richly decorated houses for the "Yangban" aristocrats.

4. Tumuli Park and Cheomseongdae:
Tumuli Park contains royal tombs dating back to the Shilla Dynasty. The numerous artefacts inside highlight the exceptional technological and cultural advancements during that period (600-900 CE).

5. Jeju island:
from the Spirited Garden with roughly 100 rare species of trees and a spectacular display of 300-year-old bonzai trees, to the impressive Jusangjeolli lava coast, where we can see remains of ancient volcanic activities, there is much to see here.
