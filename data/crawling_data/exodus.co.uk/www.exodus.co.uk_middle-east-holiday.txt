Adventure Holidays in the Middle East

Middle East holidays are magical. Here you can camp under desert stars, float on the salt-heavy waters of the Dead Sea and visit the ancient wonders of the world. On a Middle East trip unimaginable treasures, dramatic landscapes and awesome adventures await…

From the ancient rock art of the Sahara to the pyramids and temples of Egypt to the classical remains of Jordan, and the jewelled treasures of Iran, a Middle East adventure veritably tingles with history. Soak in the landscapes of the Nile Valley while floating down it on a felucca, enjoy some of the world's most spectacular desert scenery in the Wadi Rum; or get lost the region’s atmospheric souks or walled towns. Whatever adventure you choose, a journey to the Middle East will make for a memorable holiday. This is a region of powerful diversity, and with the promise of reliable year-round sunshine and just four hours from London, it’s the perfect winter sun destination.

Top three Middle East adventures

Morocco:
said to be imbued with strange and magical qualities, the dunes and plains of the Sahara Desert stretch into eternity. Well, almost. Its name comes from Arabic, meaning the Great Desert. And great it is. Reaching from the Atlantic Coast to the Red Sea, it’s the size of the USA, and covers a quarter of the African continent. It’s largely uninhabited, but Nomadic Berber people live in tents here and the most reliable means of transport is camel.

Jordan:
discover the legendary lost city of Petra. Carved into red and pink sandstone cliffs, the vast subterranean township was once a thriving trade centre and capital of the Nabatean Empire between 400 BC and AD 106. In 1812 a young Swiss explorer – whose ambition was to discover the source of the Niger – disguised himself as a Bedouin in order to explore the area and stumbled upon the fabulous ghost town of ornately decorated tombs, temples and theatres.

Egypt:
feluccas are single-masted wooden boats that have been sailing the Nile since ancient times. Travel between Aswan and Luxor to witness the landscape of the Nile Valley, and the lavish tombs of the Valley of the Kings. At night you’ll sleep on deck which is strewn with colourful cushions and rugs. From here watch the golden late-afternoon sun dissolve into a spectacular sunset.

















I have always wanted to visit Egypt to see the antiquities, but because of the political...

Where Adventure Begins

Exodus began life in 1974, when two friends got together to provide an overland truck to the Minaret of Jam, the most inaccessible of the world’s great monuments. It was the hippy-trail heyday and the journey from Calais to Kathmandu departed from London in Autumn, returning in Spring. Soon we were also travelling to South Africa, and taking hardy adventurers to the Amazon Basin as well.
