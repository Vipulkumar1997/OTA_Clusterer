Adventure Holidays in Armenia

Armenia is a mountainous nation in West Asia, a former Soviet Republic, and was one of the first Christian nations, embracing Christianity in the 4th century. This rich cultural and natural environment makes it an exciting destination for a wide range of adventure, activity and walking holidays to Armenia. There area many pagan sites to vsisit as well as UNESCO World Heritage Listed churches, which are – almost without exception – built in stunning locations. Surrounded by forests, perched on the top of dramatic gorges or silhouetted before snow-capped mountains, they draw us to magnificent open spaces filled with a huge variety of trees and wild flowers. We see wonderful mountains, lakes and waterfalls which provide cooling breezes in the countryside whilst the cafes and restaurants of Yerevan are proof of an emerging economies. Beautiful scenery is plentiful and Mount Ararat towers majestically over Yerevan.

Activities in Armenia







Culture












Highlights of Armenia

1. Yerevan:
Armenia's capital is sometimes known as the 'pink city' because of the colour of the stone used to build it. Begining on Republic Square there's the House of Opera and Ballet, Cascad Park, Matenadaran, Armenia’s ancient manuscripts library,and the Genocide Memorial. There's a thriving café culture here, and lots of opportunity to try the local drink.

2. Religious sites and pagan temples:
Garni was built in the 1st century and the only pagan temple remaining in the region. Outside  friendly locals selling homemade honey and sweets. And there's Armenian's answer to Stonehenge, Karahunj dating back to the middle of the Bronze Age.Then there are numerous UNESCO-listed churches and monasteries too, some linked dramatically to the natural world around them. Geghard Monastery dating back to the 13th century where on the hillside you can still see caves that housed monastic cells. Khor Virap, one of the holiest sites in in the country, with stunning views of Mount Ararat, and there's Noravank Monastery – a masterpiece of the 13th century architect Momik – located in the twisting canyon. Sevanavank has commanding views of Lake Sevan.

3. Wine production:
wine has been produced here for 10,000 years, and we visit Areni village where the finest Armenian wine is produce for a tasting.

4. Echmiadzin:
the capital of Armenia from 180 to 340 AD, when Christianity was first adopted by the Armenian people is simply stunning. The main cathedral sits amongst hedges and lawns, where bearded clergy in dark robes sit in theological debate. In the gardens there are many fine khachkars (carved cross stones) and bell towers.

5. The Silk Road:
snaking through Europe, Central Asia and all the way to China, travellers have been passing this way for millenia. There's the well-preserved, 14th century Selim caravanserai, and we continue to the top of the pass where the landscape changes, before descending to the blue waters of Lake Sevan. Making a stop at Noraduz to see the 'forest' of cross stones which incorporate both Pagan and Christian symbols before continuing to the shores of the lake, the largest in the Caucasus and Armenia's 'seaside'.

7.  Lori:
is the lush alpine region of northern Armenia. We visit Dilijan, a small town known for its arts and crafts, we visit the 12th-century Haghartsin Monastery, nestled in a forested valley.
