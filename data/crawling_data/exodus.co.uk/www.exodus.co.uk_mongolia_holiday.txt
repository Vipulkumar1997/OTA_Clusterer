Adventure Holidays in Mongolia

Mongolia is a place of legend. It’s known by its inhabitants as “land of the blue sky,” for the sky is cloudless for more than two thirds of the year. It’s the land of Genghis Khan; perhaps the world’s fiercest warrior – and longest continuous ruler – whose Empire stretched from here to Venice. It’s the land of the Gobi Desert – meaning “waterless place” – known for its sweeping dunes, and rare animals such as the Argali, Ibex and the snow leopard. Once the stomping ground of dinosaurs, this arid place has turned up the world’s richest cashes of dinosaur fossils and remains. And it’s famed for its horses and horsemanship. With a population of 2.2 million people, the ratio of equine beasts to human inhabitants is almost 1:1. And almost half of Mongolians live pastoral lifestyles little-changed for millennia.

In focus: the Golden Eagle Festival

Where we can we time our departures to coincide with some of the world’s special and unique events. One such event is the Golden Eagle Festival in Olgii. The people of the Altai Region in Western Mongolia still practice the ancient tradition of hunting for foxes and marmots with eagles. It’s considered a high art form, and the eagles – eventually returned to the wild – are considered their most treasured possessions.

The annual festival celebrates the strong connection the Mongolian people have with their animals and land. It includes competitions and demonstrations from the eagles and their hunters, a camel race and the lively competition of Kukhbar – a fighting match on horseback where two riders have to fight over a goat skin, each trying to claim possession of it. Arranged by the local Kazakh community, the festival also includes a competition for the best Kazakh costume, horse racing and archery, as well as cultural performances.
