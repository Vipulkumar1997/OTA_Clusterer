Day
5










Sunrise at the incredible Taj Mahal; transfer to Karauli via Fatehpur Sikri, authentic Thali Lunch at a family run restaurant.







A very early start to see the incredible spectacle of the sunrise over the Taj Mahal. The Moghul Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631, built this beautiful monument. The Taj is serenely beautiful and never fails to amaze a first time visitor; the white marble exterior changes colour according to the position of the sun throughout the day and is matched by a rich interior detail. After our visit it's time to leave Agra and drive to Karauli via the deserted ancient city of Fatehpur Sikri. Formally the capital of the Mughal Empire, this wonderfully preserved 'ghost town' was constructed by Emperor Akbar between 1570 and 1585 and reflects his ideals in art, religion and architecture. This impressive and well-preserved citadel became his capital in 1571, after the blessing of a local Moslem holy man correctly predicted the birth of a longed-for son, his successor the Emperor Jehangir. But this magnificence only lasted 14 years, as in 1584 Akbar left Fatehpur Sikri to secure his outlying territories, leaving this city much as we see it today. The site is one of the most atmospheric in northern India, its position on a ridge overlooking the modern village below and wonderful state of preservation provide us with a taste of this city's majestic past. We will enjoy a traditional Thali lunch today at a family run restaurant. Thali is a national staple and a common way of serving food in India. It is a one plate meal with a serving of rice, chapati and multiple curries (usually served in small separate bowls).

Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
7










Morning and afternoon game drives in search of tiger; evening cooking demonstration.







Ranthambore is one of India's tiger reserves under Project Tiger. After initial success, poaching has reduced the tiger population and seeing a tiger is by no means guaranteed, however, a number of Exodus groups have seen them over the last few years. We make our first game drive today early in the morning and a second drive in the evening to increase our chances of seeing a tiger. There is a huge array of other wildlife, such as several species of monkey, deer, crocodiles and bird life, which together with the scenery, make for a fascinating and exciting day. Game drives are undertaken in a large open truck (called a canter) from which we have unobstructed views of the park and the animals. In the evening we will have a Rajasthani cooking demonstration in the open garden. Rajasthan is famous for its spicy mutton and gatta curry and this is what we will see being prepared this evening.

Meals included:


Breakfast

Day
9










Visit City Palace, Jantar Mantar, Hawa Mahal and the Amber Fort; evening cooking class.







Jaipur was built in the early 18th century and is a planned city of broad avenues built of sandstone and painted pink at a later stage. In the centre of Jaipur is the City Palace, formerly the residence of the Maharaja it is now a fine museum containing rare manuscripts, paintings, royal garments and weapons. Close to the palace is one of the most intriguing sights of India, the observatory of Jai Singh. This is an assembly of immense astronomical instruments made of marble and brass set in a pleasant garden. We will also see Jaipur's impressive landmark, the Hawa Mahal, or Palace of the Winds. A few miles from the main city is the splendid Amber Palace; the imposing hilltop fort contains large courtyards and interiors with fine decorations including inlaid alabaster panels and a Chamber of Mirrors. We walk up the hill and through the massive gateway to the courtyard. Jaipur is a centre of many handicrafts, such as durries (woven rugs), carpets, printed cloth, semi-precious stones, leatherwear etc. It will be difficult to leave a workshop without buying anything! In the evening we will have our final cookery class and tonight we will focus on preparing vegetarian dishes. We'll then sit together and eat what we have prepared. If available we can arrange a class with a popular chef who is famous on Indian TV, he runs a small class usually assisted by his wife and daughter. If the chef is available the supplement cost per person will be GBP£10 (approx. 14USD).

Essential Info

Visas


India





Visas are required if you are British and for most other nationalities. For UK residents full details of the visa process can be found here
http://www.exodus.co.uk/assets/travelink/India-visa-information.pdf
. Other nationalities should check with their travel agent or the relevant embassies.






Vaccinations


India





There are no mandatory vaccination requirements. Recommended vaccinations are: Polio, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Typhoid, Hepatitis A. The risk of malaria is slight but you may wish to consult your GP or travel health clinic for further advice. Dengue fever is a known risk in places visited. It is a tropical viral disease spread by daytime biting mosquitoes. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available for Dengue, and therefore the best form of prevention is to avoid being bitten. We recommend you take the usual precautions to avoid mosquito bites.

Some of our India trips spend time at altitude. In regions over approx. 2000m, there is low to no risk of mosquito-borne diseases. For trips going to altitudes of over 3000m there is a risk of being affected by Acute Mountain Sickness. Our itineraries are designed to enable everyone to acclimatise to these altitudes, but you should be aware that it is still possible for you to be affected. Please see the TRIP NOTES for further information.






Eating and Drinking




All breakfasts, 2 lunches and 6 dinners are included during the trip. India is famous for its food and there is ample chance to try traditional local Indian cooking and sample Kashmiri, Rajasthani and Mughali cuisine, as well as the more familiar dishes such as tandoori and biriyani. There are wonderful deserts and excellent beers, soft drinks and Indian specialities such as lassi, a refreshing yoghurt drink. In most of the towns there is a good choice of restaurants and a choice between Indian and Western food. If you are a vegetarian, India is probably one of the best destinations. On our final evening, we have a cookery class focussing on vegetarian food. Tea and soft drinks are very cheap. A (large!) bottle of beer is approximately £3 (approx. US$4). Mineral water is available in the bus in 20ltr containers so please bring a bottle with you to refill. Please note that service in restaurants can be quite slow.






Weather









Is this trip for you?



Activity Level: 1 (Leisurely). This holiday is designed so that you can see the Golden Triangle at a comfortable pace, whilst learning about, and tasting, diverse regional dishes. We'll enjoy two cookery classes and eat what we have prepared, and we'll also enjoy two cooking demonstrations.

There is a lot to see in the time you are there, but everything is scheduled so that it doesn't feel too rushed. You should come armed for an experience: India can be hard work, and the heat and the bustle of some of the cities can be a little overwhelming. That said, there are places where you can find peace, and there are few places in the world to match India in providing you with great stories and memories to last a lifetime. This is a Premium trip, with a higher level of accommodation than on our standard trips.

Please note that the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) are responsible for the conservation of many monuments in India, including the Taj Mahal, and very occasionally this may mean that work is taking place at sites visited on this trip. The ASI’s schedule is never published so it is not possible to forewarn our clients of when work will be taking place.

Holi and Diwali Festivals

Some departures will be in India during the festivals of Holi and Diwali. They are great festivals to witness and some very minor itinerary alterations may be made locally in order to make the most of these occasions. Holi celebrations typically involve people throwing coloured water at each other and smearing powder on each other's faces. This is accompanied by dancing, music and traditional Holi sweets such as Ghujiya and Bhanng. It's a riot of colours as the powder bursts into the sky. During Diwali, the festival of lights, people typically light up their houses, shops and streets, and celebrate on the streets with fireworks.

Memorable




Such a memorable trip, from the food, sights and friends we met. Our guide Manni was so brilliant, funny and organised. From the Taj Mahal which was breathtaking to the street food, every step of the trip was just great, we loved every minute! The food demonstrations have had a positive influence since we have returned- what more can I say!!




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The Taj Mahal and the palace at Karouli, breathtaking.




What did you think of your group leader?


Manni was brilliant, he had lots of history and background information wherever we went. A lovely guide.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Enjoy every minute, be adventurous and try the streetfood!

A wonderful hectic tour




In February the weather in Northern India is just right for a British tourist! This tour packed in numerous cultural and historical sights along with an (optional) visit to a school for children with disabilities, visits to Hindu temples during services and a stroll through a small town. The Bollywood movie (Rangoon) was so enjoyable that we stayed to the end.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The Tah Mahal was glorious. As February mornings in the region are chilly and misty, we visited in the afternoon. I hadn't expected it to be such an emotional experience.
The Karauli City Palace was astonishing too - I won't forget standing on the roof surveying the palace, town and region.




What did you think of your group leader?


Unni was very knowledgeable, keen to share his knowledge (and opinions) and was mindful of our safety.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


If you want to go shopping, you need to seize any opportunities. The trip notes mention handicraft shopping in Agra and Jaipur but there was virtually no time at all!




Is there anything else you would like to add?


I was surprised that no unfamiliar vegetables (like you see piled up outside Indian stores in the UK) were featured in any of the cooking classes or restaurant meals - but it was clear from driving past market stalls that they weren't in season. The ubiquitous red carrots were great!

Trip is too busy.




The trip has all the highlights of the golden triangle with the addition of seeing tigers in the wild. There is too much packed into 8 days. The tour needs to be 10 days so that there is a little independent time. For a premium tour the accommodation was disappointing. I have travelled with Exodus before and did not find the accommodation any better than a standard tour, hotels were often old and dirty. For a food tour it would be good to include a cooking class to really learn about the spices. We had a disappointing tour leader.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Seeing a tiger.




What did you think of your group leader?


Unni was hard to like. It was very obvious he had not done this tour before. He got everything done but he tended to repeat himself and often confused people. He was very anti the British. He also stated that Exodus was the last tour company on his list because he didn't get good tips!




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Be prepared for a very busy time.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Cooking classes and extra days need to be added. The Dehli hotel is miles from any of the sights so it means every time you go out it is at least 45 minutes on the bus, more in rush hour. Although this was one of the better hotels the position was disappointing.

Taj, tigers and terrific food




This trip combines the iconic sights of the Golden Triangle with the amazing experience of seeing tigers in the wild and the delicious home cooked food typical of the region.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Meeting the chefs in their own homes and watching them produce fantastic meals in front of us.
Seeing two tigers in their natural setting as they passed within touching distance.




What did you think of your group leader?


Where would we have been without Gaj? Lost, ripped off, wandering around India without much of an idea of what we were doing or what we were seeing. Gaj was our organiser, our guide, our teacher, our protector. He got us onto the train to Agra when it looked odds on we would miss it. He taught us so much about India as a country and the Indians as a people, and introduced us to some accomplished chefs who produced memorable meals. He was the key to making this a most memorable holiday. From the Taj Maharaja to the tigers, from Red Forts to Pink Palaces Gaj was there, teaching us Indian words such as "juldi" and latterly reassuring us when the currency went into meltdown. He was our guru and our friend, a "legend" as we say in Scotland.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


You get a better exchange rate at the hotels than the airport so don't change too much initially. It can get cool in the canter looking for tigers, so take a hat and fleece.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


There was a breakdown in communication regarding the change of hotel in Delhi at the start of the trip. As a result we went to the wrong hotel, not the most relaxing start.

Tigers, Temples and Thalis




A fantastic introduction to India. From Delhi at Diwali, touring the temples and palaces of Northern India, seeing a tiger at Ranthambore to learning to cook delicious food in peoples homes. A great combination of activities and experiences.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


There are several to choose from. Seeing a tiger has to be at the top of the list. I loved visiting the quieter less touristy town of Karauli and the deserted Maharajas palace. We tried so many different foods and learning to cook in peoples homes was a real highlight




What did you think of your group leader?


Our group leader (Bali) was fantastic. He brought India to life for us and gave us a real insight into the culture and way of life. Nothing was too much trouble and he organised extra visits and experiences above and beyond the itinerary.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Come prepared for a full itinerary and sensory overload. Follow the guides advice as he gave us great tips to keep us safe, Delhi belly free and able to make the most of our time. If you find a cash point that works then make the most of it!




Is there anything else you would like to add?


We were only the second trip on this new itinerary and I am sure there will be some tweaks to it, it would have been great to have the recipes for the food demos that we saw and hopefully that will be added for future trips.

Northern India Food Tour




This was a terrific, fast-paced trip introducing the traveller to several cities and an exceptional visit to the Ranthambore National Park which was a perfect interlude between crowded, busy cities. What made the trip was seeing India through Bali's eyes and heart. He loves his country and shared that with us daily. He told us stories about the country, the people, the customs, his personal experiences and made every effort to acquaint us with local Indians along the way. He is a sensitive and caring person and that made all the difference. What was also so special was experiencing meals in people's homes. It enabled us to have a first-hand look at the way Indians live and also showed us the welcoming ways of the hosts.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The Taj Mahal.




What did you think of your group leader?


See above.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Do not expect to learn the specifics of Indian cooking. The demos were a lot of fun and gave us an overall view of Indian cuisine, but no recipes were distributed and it was more observation than learning.
Get ready for fast-paced travel with little or no down time.
Also, mostly bus travel and not too much walking.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


My suggestions:
1) this should not be marketed as a food trip unless there are more tools to share with the travelers (recipes and hands-on cooking experience)
2) the day traveling from Ranthambore entailed a 5-hour bus ride followed by sitting in a 3-hour Bollywood movie. TOO much sitting. Also, the movie was SO violent and horrible. It should be a walk-in opportunity to see the movie theater with the option for people to stay (IF they want to) and an option for the others to walk and do something else.
3) I brought a huge suitcase full of school supplies per the Exodus website and the Pack for Purpose program. Noone knew anything about it! Exodus people really didn't know and Bali didn't know. Thankfully he made a point of stopping at a place where a few families live together in the rural area and we distributed some of the things and we stopped at an elementary school where we distributed the rest. The guides and Exodus staff should be better educated and assure people that the things will get to the proper place.
4) The Jaipur Fern airport hotel was terrible
5) Try to find guides who are relatively easy to understand (Anu in Agra was great!). It was difficult for all of us to understand several of the day guides.

Eating our way around Northern India




Not just an amazing introduction to the culture and wildlife of the 'Golden Triangle' but also the opportunity to discover the cuisines of the different regions through visits to restaurants and the homes of some excellent chefs. This is a new tour and is clearly developing into something truly exceptional.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


There is not enough space to list them all! From celebrating Diwali in Delhi to visiting an abandoned palace in Karauli, from the real life experience of watching a huge male tiger in Ranthambore to the make believe world of a Bollywood movie. I was moved to tears, no, not at the Taj Mahal, but at the astronomical observatory in Jaipur. What an amazing place!




What did you think of your group leader?


We could not have wished for a better guide. He gave us a fascinating insight into the culture, religion and foods of India. He was constantly aware of our safety and comfort and ensured we had daily opportunities to experience so many different aspects of Indian life. AND he had a great sense of humour.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Be prepared to try all the foods on offer. Stick to bottled water. Listen to what your guide advises you. No one in our group of 12 experienced stomach problems.

I feel privileged to have taken part in this wonderful trip. Thank you Exodus

Inspiring and fun in Rajasthan




A really excellent introduction to a compelling country enhanced by a group of like minded people and absolutely fantastic guide which made it all an unforgettable experience for myself and two companions (i.e. 3 people).




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Very hard to select just the one after a trip packed with inspiring experiences but the Taj Mahal - especially early am as arranged - did not disappoint which is some achievement given its hype. On par with this was the experience our Group Leader organised on the Ganges at sunset with musicians and floating candles. Does not get much better than that!




What did you think of your group leader?


Badam Singh is a bit special and Exodus should treasure him . He is thoroughly professional , knowledgeable and was very discrete knowing exactly how to balance control and freedom. He was extremely attentive to the needs of both the group and individuals within it. He also had a great sense of humour. At no point did one feel under pressure even though the week was very busy with a demanding schedule. He was the glue that helped our group work so well allowing opportunities for members to work together or individually. He also provided alternative events and guidance when free time emerged. Anyone who has Badam as a guide will receive insights into the history and culture of Rajasthan and Indian society and religions and should feel very lucky indeed to have him.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Have som 10/20rupee notes ready for the toilets.
To be aware that this sort of trip is not for the faint-hearted / fussy.
Excellent for single people but also couples and small groups ( we were 3 - a couple and single)




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Group Leaders could have a stash of small 10/20 rupee notes for members to buy at start of trip.
The only weakness of trip was the extra optional guide of Delhi on final day (particularly when juxtaposed with the very high standard of our Exodus Guide).

A wonderful trip




This holiday surpassed my expectations, introducing us to different aspects of Indian culture and life. It is a country full of vibrant colours and we were fortunate to be there during Diwali. We received a warm welcome everywhere we went and stayed at comfortable hotels in good locations.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


There were so many 'special' moments. Seeing a tiger in Ranthampore, walking by the Ganges in Varanasi as well as experiencing sunset and sunrise on the river. The Taj Mahal was more impressive than I had expected and there were so many memorable forts - in Jaipur, Agra and Fathipur Sikri. The whole trip was truly inspirational




What did you think of your group leader?


Our group leader was brilliant. So knowledgable and attentive, sensitively responsive to our requests




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Take a swimming costume! (I hadn't appreciated there would be pools at most of the places we stayed). Also take some games/entertainment to play on the overnight train journey from Varanasi to Agra as it's not particularly comfortable.

An overview of flight options
Exodus is committed to making joining our tours as easy as possible, wherever you live. We generally only block book seats from London, but this certainly does not mean that you need to fly from there. Depending on the route and airlines available, there will usually be various options available for those who want to fly from their local airport.
This page aims to provide a useful overview of the options available to our clients. However, the best flight arrangements should be tailored to your personal requirements, so please contact our Sales team for expert advice.

What kind of options do I have ?
1. We can book for you: Flights from anywhere in the world - not via London

Depending on the route, this may be direct or via an overseas hub like Amsterdam, the Middle East or elsewhere. On short haul routes there may be direct flights with low cost airlines, charter flights or scheduled airlines. Exodus can book most, but not all, of these for you. The most appropriate airline may be different to that which we use for the group flight from London, but many people now travel on different airlines and meet up with their fellow passengers at the destination.
Pros

Cons
May be the most direct route
Often the extra fare compared to the London flight is minimal.
As you will be in the hands a single airline for your entire journey, the airline will be responsible for your bags and your connections.
You may not be able to join the group transfers. However, we can usually arrange private transfers, or book your flights to try and coincide with the group transfers. See notes on
transfer arrangements
below.

2. We can book for you: Connecting flights from your local airport to London
Exodus can book connecting flights to London so you can join the group flight there. Connecting times will be followed according to airline advice, or as requested by clients. There are two types of fares we can use for this option: a 'through-fare' or a 'published fare'.

a) A 'through-fare' is where you will be in the main airline's care throughout. You change planes, but your bags are checked all the way through to your final destination.

b) A 'published fare' ticket is completely seperate from your onward ticket from London. It is usually cheaper than a through-fare but will need to be paid for and issued as soon as it is booked. This can be a problem if your tour has not yet reached minimum numbers. On 'published fares' neither airline is aware that you have connecting flights, so Exodus is responsible for timing your connection, not the airlines involved. The tickets are also usually non changeable and non refundable.
Pros

Cons
Depending on the fare type, Exodus or the airline is responsible for flight connections.
Through fare tickets can be expensive.
On a published fare, tickets must be issued immediately; tickets on published fares can be very difficult to change if onward flight times change; bags are not checked though to your final destination.
Published fares are non-refundable.

3. Booking some or all of the flights yourself
You can also book connecting air travel yourself, either to London, or all the way to the start point. There may be certain airlines or routes we don't have access to, so this is always an option. However, if you make your own travel arrangements you become liable for any delays, cancellations or missed connections, and Exodus is not required to offer refunds if you have trouble reaching the start of your trip.
Pros

Cons
You might find cheaper fares, or routes not available to Exodus.
You are responsible for any delays or missed connections, and the cost of the tour is not protected should you miss your flight be cancelled.

Notes on transfer arrangements
Sometimes it is possible to travel on a different airline to the group flight from London. Where this is the case, we need to think about ensuring you meet up with the group with minimum extra cost and hassle.
On certain trips, it is easy to arrive on a different flight and still meet the group at the hotel with time in hand. We can usually arrange private transfers (at extra cost) or offer advice on taking a taxi to the start hotel.
On other trips (especially in Europe), the transfer meets the group flight and then travels some distance to the first night's accommodation. Where this is the case, our Sales team will try to arrange flights that arrive before (and depart after) the group. However, we do have to make it clear in your final documentation that if your flights are delayed, the transfer cannot wait for you. While Exodus or our local operators will do what we can to help you reach the start point of the tour, any additional costs must be paid by the client.
