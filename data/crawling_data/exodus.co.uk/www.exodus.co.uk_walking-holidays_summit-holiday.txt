Summit Adventures

There are few sensations as rewarding and fulfilling as that of reaching a summit of a mountain. We have over 30-years experience trekking the highest and most challenging mountains on earth, so we know the importance of careful planning and expert support, especially when tackling peaks over 6000 metres. At Exodus it’s never just about “peak bagging”, it’s about finding the most enjoyable routes with the best views, and putting something back into the communities we visit.

The thrill of standing at the highest point in a given mountain range, country or continent is unparalleled. From the challenging climb to the sense of achievement as you reach the top, these treks are more than just a holiday. We
offer the highest peaks in Africa, The Americas, Europe and Asia, including mountains in The Alps, The Tatras, The Atlas, The Andes, Malaysia and Borneo, not to mention Mera Peak (6476m), Kala Patar (5545m) in Nepal and Stok Kangri (6114m) in India.

In focus:
Island Peak, 6,189m

See it:
Flanked by Lhotse and the Imja glaciers, the mountain stands like an island in the middle of the Dingboche Valley in Nepal.

Live it:
We stay in a mixture of environmentally-friendly camping spots and locally-owned teahouses. All the money you spend on meals in the teahouses goes directly back to the community.

Climb it:
16 days point-to-point walking with full porterage, on this trek you’ll experience walking roped-up, using an ice axe and crampons. In terms of technicality, this is a stage up from Mera Peak, and great for those who want to progress up the ladder of high altitude peaks. There are some steep ascents and descents and some narrow trails. As this trek also ascends to very high altitudes participants should be confident of their physical fitness and should have previous experience of trekking at altitude and in snow.
