Highlights of Central America from Pacific to Caribbean coastlines









This busy itinerary takes us through three countries and to both Caribbean and Pacific coasts covering the highlights of the region. Nicaragua’s enchanting landscape is vast and relatively untouched by tourism; from the colonial city of Granada to the rising twin peaks of Ometepe Island, it’s a country waiting to welcome the world. Costa Rica's tropical climate supports a range of ecosystems including dense jungle, cloud forest, coastline and a handful of active volcanoes. The result is a paradise bursting with wildlife and tropical verdant scenery. From the Bocas del Toro Islands, a stunning archipelago with a lively Caribbean culture, to the Panama Canal, one of the world’s most impressive feats of engineering, and the vibrant capital Panama City, our last stop is Panama, under-visited but a jewel of the region.

Day
1










Fly to Managua; transfer to Granada.







Those on group flights will arrive in the evening and be transferred (40 minutes) from the airport to the beautiful colonial city of Granada. Located on the shore of Lake Nicaragua, Granada is Nicaragua's fourth largest city, with a rich heritage and culture. Land only clients should make their own way to the hotel today.

Accommodation: Hotel El Almirante (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel
















Day
2










Morning visit Masaya Volcano and market; afternoon walking tour of Granada and visit Las Isletas.







After breakfast we visit Masaya Volcano National Park where we can witness the most active volcanoes in the country, with their smoking and steaming craters. From here there is a remarkable view over the Masaya Lagoon and towards the town. After a stop at Masaya market to look at some of the local handicrafts and souvenirs on offer, we return to Granada for lunch. This afternoon we discover Granada by foot on a walking tour around the cobbled streets and striking colonial buildings. Our city tour will take in the main cathedral and markets as well as the beautiful La Merced Church, with great views of the city. Granada is highly regarded for its traditional craftsmanship and manufacturing of local products.
Later this afternoon we take a peaceful boat tour around Las Isletas, a cluster of islands within Lake Nicaragua. These volcanic islands were created when Mombacho Volcano erupted more than twenty thousand years ago. They are now a haven for wildlife and some of them are now permanently inhabited with people living in private residences alongside restaurants and small hotels.
Accommodation: Hotel El Almirante (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast

Lunch










Day
3










Visit San Juan de Oriente; to Ometepe Island.







This morning we visit San Juan de Oriente and Catarina, known as the famous 'pueblos blancos' or white towns, for their striking colonial churches. From a viewpoint at Catarina there are wonderful views of the Apoyo Lagoon, the Mombacho Volcano, Lake Nicaragua and Lake Granada. After this morning's visit we transfer to San Jorge, where we board a ferry for the one-hour journey across Lake Nicaragua to Ometepe Island. The volcanoes of Concepion and Maderas characterise Ometepe, their majestic peaks connected by a small strip of land to make an hourglass shaped island. Ometepe means 'two peaks' in the traditional náhuatl language spoken by indigenous ancestors. At 276 square kilometres, it is home to a vibrant population, many who survive principally by agriculture, livestock and fishing. Ometepe has a rich archaeological background due to the mix of tribes and cultures that inhabited the island, with petroglphys found in some parts.
Accommodation: Charco Verde (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast

Lunch










Day
4










From Ometepe Island to San Juan del Sur.







Early this morning we enjoy a short stroll through the Charco Verde area, looking at the wildlife and beautiful landscape of the area. There are several species of butterflies found in the gardens here that we hope to have a chance to see. Following this we take a mid-morning ferry back to the port of San Jorge and transfer to the town of San Juan del Sur, on Nicaragua's Pacific coastline. The charming town of San Juan del Sur hosts a small fishing community nestled within a tranquil bay overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
Accommodation: Villa Palermo (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
5










To La Fortuna, near Arenal Volcano; optional visit Ecotermales Hot Springs.







Today is a travel day as we depart Nicaragua and arrive into Costa Rica, changing vehicles as we cross the border. We hope to arrive into the small town of La Fortuna, near Arenal Volcano, by the middle of the afternoon. Arenal was Costa Rica's most active volcano until fairly recently, when it entered a resting phase and can no longer be seen spitting ash, smoke or lava. However there is still a lot of geothermal activity in the area and you'll have the opportunity to visit one of the excellent hot springs this evening. In clear weather there are great views of the volcano from our overnight base in La Fortuna.

Accommodation: Arenal Montechiari Hotel (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
6










Visit Arenal Volcano N.P., La Fortuna Waterfall and Don Juan Farm; afternoon for optional activities







There is a guided hike this morning through Arenal Volcano National Park. The park has a great system of trails passing through secondary forest and near lava fields created by previous eruptions. The high vantage points on this walk allow great views overlooking Lake Arenal, and the birdlife is plentiful. We include a visit to La Fortuna Waterfall and Don Juan Farm today, where lunch is provided along with a tour of the organic farm. The rest of the afternoon is free to sign up for an optional activity, such as the Sky Walk (canopy walk) or Sky Trek (zip wire) excursions.

Accommodation: Arenal Montechiari Hotel (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast

Lunch










Day
7










To Tortuguero N.P.







This morning we set off to the north-east of Costa Rica to Tortuguero National Park. Accessible only by boat or light aircraft, Tortuguero's vast network of waterways, canals and swamps is remarkably tranquil, unspoilt and devoid of noise pollution. On reaching the pier we board a small motorboat for the one hour fifteen minute journey to our lodge, which is nestled on a small strip of land between the Caribbean Sea and the main lagoon. Our afternoon is spent in Tortuguero village, where it’s possible to visit the Sea Turtle Museum (a donation will be requested at the entrance). Tortuguero is probably most famous as a nesting site for the endangered Green turtle, which can be seen arriving onto the beach to lay eggs from late July to October (as part of an optional excursion). Hawksbill, Loggerhead and Giant Leatherback turtles also nest in this region, and during November to January baby turtles start to hatch and make their way towards the ocean.
Accommodation: Laguna Lodge (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast

Lunch

Dinner










Day
8










Boat tour around Tortuguero waterways.







An early morning boat trip enables us to discover the extraordinary flora and fauna of Tortuguero, passing serenely along the waterways. At this time of day wildlife is usually at its most active and with the help of our expert guide we are likely to encounter monkeys, caiman, iguanas, butterflies and many of the 300+ bird species recorded here. We return to the lodge for a hearty breakfast by the river. The lodge is a tranquil spot to relax this afternoon if you want to take some time out to enjoy the facilities, or alternatively you can join a second boat trip (included), visit the beach or follow a short walking trail through the forest.

Accommodation: Laguna Lodge (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast

Lunch

Dinner










Day
9










To the Caribbean coast.







We leave Tortuguero by taking a small boat to the pier. Our bus will be at the pier waiting to drive us to the Caribbean coast, where we check into our hotel located either in Cahuita (Atlantida Lodge) or Puerto Viejo (Namuwoki). Caribbean culture pervades this part of Costa Rica and is reflected in the music, food and laid-back lifestyle. Cahuita’s famous white-sand beach is fringed by tall palms, behind which the dense, wet tropical forest of Cahuita National Park is located.
Accommodation: Atlántida Lodge or Namuwoki (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast

Lunch










Day
10










Cross into Panama; to Bocas del Toro islands.







Our journey continues alongside vast banana plantations, crossing the border on the banks of the Sixaola River and entering into Panama. We transfer through the frontier town of Changuinola and then through steep rainforest hills which are inhabited by indigenous people. Once we arrive at the coast we board a shuttle boat taxi to cross the Caribbean to the wonderful Bocas del Toro Islands, our home for the next two nights.

Accommodation: Playa Tortuga (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
11










Free day in Bocas del Toro for optional activities.







Today has been left free to explore the beautiful Bocas del Toro Islands, which are rapidly becoming a popular destination in the Caribbean. Today you will get a chance to see why: spectacular palm-shaded white sand beaches, crystal clear water, wonderful snorkeling and lots of wildlife and kayaking. It's possible to take boat trips to discover the surrounding islands too. All of these activities can be arranged locally.
Accommodation: Playa Tortuga (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
12










Morning to Boquete; afternoon coffee plantation tour.







After taking a shuttle boat taxi back to the mainland, we drive into the mountains that separate Panama's two coastlines. The change in temperature, humidity and eco-systems is significant as we gain altitude. Our destination is the small village of Boquete, nestled in the highlands and well known for its beautiful scenery, nice weather and high quality coffee. We should arrive at our hotel just before lunch. Afterwards, we have a coffee tour to discover this regions most famous crop: Arabica coffee beans. From gathering beans in the plantation by the expert hands of Ngobe Indians to roasting, you will learn everything about the best coffee in the world!

Accommodation: Boquete Tree Trek Mountain Resort (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
13










Fly to Panama City; visit Casco Viejo and the Panama Canal.







From Boquete we take a short transfer to David, where we take a domestic flight with Air Panama to Panama City. This flight takes around 45 minutes and has been included to avoid an otherwise long bus transfer. On arrival into Panama City we have a guided tour of the old town, known as Casco Viejo, with its numerous colonial monuments and churches. This interesting area of the city is gradually being restored and is lovely to wander around, with the modern city skyline as a contrasting backdrop. This afternoon we visit the Panama Canal to see the spectacular 'Miraflores Locks' in action - marvel at this incredible feat of modern engineering as you watch huge cargo ships navigate the locks.
Accommodation: Tryp by Wyndham Panama Centro (or similar)
Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
14










Depart Panama City.







The trip comes to an end today after breakfast and it's time to bid the rest of the group goodbye. Transfers to the airport are included for those on the group flights today.

Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama lie between 5º and 15º north of the equator, and have an almost perfect tropical climate. The average temperature is 10 - 13ºC in the highlands, and 22 - 28ºC in the lowlands. There is a rainy season from May to October when there may be daily downpours, though these are usually quite short and there is still plenty of bright sunshine. November to April is the driest time of the year but you should still expect some rain - particularly in the cloud forests. August offers moderate temperatures.












Is this trip for you?



Activity Level: 1 (Leisurely)

Most of the driving distances are short, but some of the roads can be of poor quality which may occasionally result in slower driving times than expected. There are several included and optional walks on the itinerary which occasionally involve walking on rough paths. These are suitable for most levels of fitness and usually last from two to three hours. During times of heavy rain, trails can be muddy and slippery and extra care should be taken. Many of the areas visited on the trip are hot and humid and there is the chance of heavy rain year-round.

Please note that we require some details from you at least two months prior to departure in order to organise the internal flight with Air Panama. You will be required to provide us with a copy of your passport to show your full name, nationality and date of birth. This information will be given to the airline at the point of the tickets being booked and must match the passport that you are using to travel with. Please contact our Customer Operations team to provide these details.

Trip:



Discover Nicaragua, Costa Rica & Panama





A three in one Gem




As seasoned travellers in our 70’s we tend towards more leisurely trips these days but would have to say this one seemed pretty full on. However, we fully engaged with it and thoroughly enjoyed it.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Despite a systems breakdown at the Panamanian border, delaying our arrival at the superb resort of Bocas del Toro, our chosen water-borne options there were the highlight of our trip, eclipsed only perhaps by the sight of turtle hatchlings scurrying to the water’s edge on Tortuguero’s Caribbean coast a few days earlier.
We also found transport by speedboat in both these locations very exhilarating.




What did you think of your group leader?


With couples from Australia and Canada and solos from Ireland and the UK the party of 15 gelled well but expectations were diverse. All were pretty much satisfied under the direction of experienced Leader Alex with organisational skills, wildlife and local knowledge more than equal to the task.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


The itinerary encompassed a wealth of historic architecture, ecosystems and wildlife to suit all tastes but we would also recommend participating in as many of the other options as possible during free time. We chose not to Zip-Line the cloud forest but shared the Sky Tram to the launch pad and then took the Sky Walk which we found sufficiently exhilarating.
The climate throughout the trip was hot and humid but buses and hotels were air-conditioned and decent showers always available after active days. Being in rain forests we expected to get wet but more than we actually did. We always carried a light rainjacket (or a poncho in pocket) which we think could have doubled for an outer garment in the mountain region.
We do not have massive appetites and limit alcohol when travelling and were pleasantly surprised that our expenditure was far less than expected based on Exodus costings. This may not be the case if a choice is made to make fuller use of bar and restaurant facilities.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


The flight out via Houston was tiresome and we were glad that we had tagged two days on the front of the tour to acclimatise before meeting the group. As it was we found Granada a charming city worthy of extra exploration and the service/amenities at Hotel Almirante very much to our liking.
The visit to Boquete, in the cooler highlands, seemed all too brief (the one time we wore fleeces and then only on the early morning trip to the airport). Although this internal flight to Panama City spares a long bus transfer it did rather feel like the beginning of a long journey home. Our Canal visit was great being timed to the passing of several large ships but other sightseeing was only fleeting as the City is huge and highly congested.

Discover Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama




A whirlwind tour of 3 amazing countries. Nicaragua is still in its infancy as far as tourism goes. Lake Nicaragua, volcanoes, wild life are all mind blowing, particularly the visit to the Masaya crater (where visits are limited to 10 minutes owing to the effects of sulphur in the air). The scenery, landscape and rain forests of Costa Rica are not to be missed, especially walking around Arenal. The Caribbean coast of Panama is superb for dolphin watching and visiting indigenous villagers on their own island.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The wildlife and walking in the Costa Roca rainforest




What did you think of your group leader?


Alex is, quite simply, the BEST tour guide we have had the pleasure of meeting. His knowledge of flaura, fauna, wild life, geology is unsurpassed. He always went the extra mile to ensure that our holiday remains one to last in our memories for the rest of our lives.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Many people mistakenly think malaria pills are required. We (as did the most of the party) used Deet50 spray and were absolutely fine.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Many of the hotels were on the edge of towns, requiring taxis to visit the town centre. It would be better to get some (if not all) hotels to be within walking distance of amenities.

Discover Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama




It was an amazing trip - I was attracted by the variety it offered and it didn't disappoint: wildlife/National Parks, colonial cities, Caribbean Islands, mountains and of course the Panama Canal. We got a great sense of Central America including its history which is fascinating. So many different boat rides too which were great.
It was the first time this trip had been run and they just need to sort a couple of the hotels out which they said they will do - the majority were lovely.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


No one moment but 3 or 4 favourites: Granada, the slow boat trips early morning and evening in Tortuguero NP; the overnight stay in Cahuita/ Puerto Viejo (very lively coastal town, felt like being in Jamaica!); the day out on the boat from Bocas del Toro (take tour 2) - exceptionally good and very much worth the money; the Panama Canal.




What did you think of your group leader?


Alex was absolutely excellent - the best Exodus guide I've had. He stayed with us throughout the trip and we had local guides also in Nicaragua (Elvis who was great fun and very knowledgeable and helpful) and Cesar and Philippe in Panama. Alex has this amazing telescope which allows you to take your own photos of the wild life through it - felt a bit like cheating but very good!




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


You go on 10 different boats over the 15 days - they were all amazing even if a couple were a bit "edgy"!
You definitely don't need anti- malarial tablets though you should take care to cover up/use insect repellent.
Although the trip is "Leisurely" be prepared for early starts (5.30 -7am) about 50% of the time.
It was hotter than the temperature chart indicated - mostly about mid 30s - though the mini-buses are all air-conditioned and almost all of the hotels were too. The internal flight to Panama City is great but watch your luggage weight. Nicaragua is quite cheap but Costa Rica is about as expensive as the UK.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


About the food - a lot of rice and beans and rice and chicken as you would expect AND a lot of Italian Pizzas and Pasta almost everywhere which we did not expect!

Nicaragua,Costa Rica,Panama




Very busy and fascinating insight into three beautiful countries, led by excellent guides and accompanied by an enthusiastic group of fellow travellers.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The experience of visiting two new countries,Nicaragua and Panama and the knowledge and communication of our excellent guides,Elvis and Alex.




What did you think of your group leader?


Alex stayed with us throughout the trip and worked tirelessly to ensure everything ran smoothly.Could not have asked for more, first class.
In Nicaragua Elvis was the main guide and his knowledge and passion were shared at every opportunity, his zest was infectious and for me he was an outstanding guide and personality, hope to meet both again!!!!!




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


It is a very full and busy itinerary but worth every moment-book now!
Currency wise all three countries seem to favour US dollars.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Having already visited Costa Rica previously for the wildlife, the culture and history of Nicaragua and Panama were mesmerising,a real surprise as I thought this wasn't for me-how wrong I was!!!

Travellers not tourist .....




Just back from a wonderful adventure travelling the length of Nicaragua , Costa Rica and Panama .
Rid yourselves of preconceptions about war torn Nicaragua , over populated Caribbean beaches and that Panama is only about hats and canals and you will have a great experience .Travel from Volcano to jungle and experience the wildlife, geography and culture of this little travelled path through Central America . Be prepared for early starts and busy days along with the excitement of some rustic boat rides into the interior and you will not be disappointed - ..




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Looking into the lava lake at Massaya and ALL of our wildlife encounters - too many other wonderful experiences to select from ....




What did you think of your group leader?


If the Gods are on your side then you will be accompanied by the best guide we have ever encountered - Alex- and for Nicaragua, superb local guide and side kick Elvis . Well done Exodus for engaging Alex - his encyclopaedic knowledge , sense of dedication and all round great attitude made this trip near perfect .




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Reality check - this isn't a foody trip - The food wasn't bad and matched the trip note budgets but not the highlight of the trip . The good news is that the local beers were excellent and not too expensive - water was freely available as part of the tour and don't forget to take your water container .




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Malaria tablets aren't required but bring your insect repellent , plenty of sun cream and a hat as the temps and the sun high
Dollars throughout were easier than credit card .
Swimming opportunities at many places - if you have two swimming costumes take them - humidity is high and they don't always dry overnight before you travel to your next venue
If you don't have a complex camera / lens for those distant shots , iPhones are excellent for quick pictures and take great pics through a spotters scope - our lovely guide Alex took time to help us get great pictures through his excellent lens and then we air dropped the pic to each of the group !

An overview of flight options
Exodus is committed to making joining our tours as easy as possible, wherever you live. We generally only block book seats from London, but this certainly does not mean that you need to fly from there. Depending on the route and airlines available, there will usually be various options available for those who want to fly from their local airport.
This page aims to provide a useful overview of the options available to our clients. However, the best flight arrangements should be tailored to your personal requirements, so please contact our Sales team for expert advice.

What kind of options do I have ?
1. We can book for you: Flights from anywhere in the world - not via London

Depending on the route, this may be direct or via an overseas hub like Amsterdam, the Middle East or elsewhere. On short haul routes there may be direct flights with low cost airlines, charter flights or scheduled airlines. Exodus can book most, but not all, of these for you. The most appropriate airline may be different to that which we use for the group flight from London, but many people now travel on different airlines and meet up with their fellow passengers at the destination.
Pros

Cons
May be the most direct route
Often the extra fare compared to the London flight is minimal.
As you will be in the hands a single airline for your entire journey, the airline will be responsible for your bags and your connections.
You may not be able to join the group transfers. However, we can usually arrange private transfers, or book your flights to try and coincide with the group transfers. See notes on
transfer arrangements
below.

2. We can book for you: Connecting flights from your local airport to London
Exodus can book connecting flights to London so you can join the group flight there. Connecting times will be followed according to airline advice, or as requested by clients. There are two types of fares we can use for this option: a 'through-fare' or a 'published fare'.

a) A 'through-fare' is where you will be in the main airline's care throughout. You change planes, but your bags are checked all the way through to your final destination.

b) A 'published fare' ticket is completely seperate from your onward ticket from London. It is usually cheaper than a through-fare but will need to be paid for and issued as soon as it is booked. This can be a problem if your tour has not yet reached minimum numbers. On 'published fares' neither airline is aware that you have connecting flights, so Exodus is responsible for timing your connection, not the airlines involved. The tickets are also usually non changeable and non refundable.
Pros

Cons
Depending on the fare type, Exodus or the airline is responsible for flight connections.
Through fare tickets can be expensive.
On a published fare, tickets must be issued immediately; tickets on published fares can be very difficult to change if onward flight times change; bags are not checked though to your final destination.
Published fares are non-refundable.

3. Booking some or all of the flights yourself
You can also book connecting air travel yourself, either to London, or all the way to the start point. There may be certain airlines or routes we don't have access to, so this is always an option. However, if you make your own travel arrangements you become liable for any delays, cancellations or missed connections, and Exodus is not required to offer refunds if you have trouble reaching the start of your trip.
Pros

Cons
You might find cheaper fares, or routes not available to Exodus.
You are responsible for any delays or missed connections, and the cost of the tour is not protected should you miss your flight be cancelled.

Notes on transfer arrangements
Sometimes it is possible to travel on a different airline to the group flight from London. Where this is the case, we need to think about ensuring you meet up with the group with minimum extra cost and hassle.
On certain trips, it is easy to arrive on a different flight and still meet the group at the hotel with time in hand. We can usually arrange private transfers (at extra cost) or offer advice on taking a taxi to the start hotel.
On other trips (especially in Europe), the transfer meets the group flight and then travels some distance to the first night's accommodation. Where this is the case, our Sales team will try to arrange flights that arrive before (and depart after) the group. However, we do have to make it clear in your final documentation that if your flights are delayed, the transfer cannot wait for you. While Exodus or our local operators will do what we can to help you reach the start point of the tour, any additional costs must be paid by the client.
