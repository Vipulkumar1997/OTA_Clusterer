Our best-selling holidays

For more than 40 years, Exodus has been blazing the trail for adventure travel. Our carefully crafted itineraries are designed to give you the best possible trip. We can take you up mountains and down canyons, through cities both ancient and modern, along windswept coasts and winding roads. We can take you on foot or by bike, or face-to-face with the rarest and most noble of animals. We can take you to the dizzy heights of Mount Everest basecamp, the lush jungles of Costa Rica or the thriving ports of Vietnam.

But wherever we take you, we promise it will be an adventure.

Find out more about some of our most popular adventures below. These trips are tried and tested. They’re firm favourites, and with good reason. These are the unforgettable experiences that keep our customers coming back for more.
