5 Things We Love About Winter Holidays




Share this

































Louise Ungless


May 5, 2017







At Exodus, a blanket of snow never gets in the way of an adventure. From
cross-country skiing in Norway
to the mesmerising sight of the
Northern Lights in Iceland
, there are a lot of adventures to be had in winter. But whilst we do love the unforgettable experiences and moments they create, here are five other reasons why we like to make the most of the colder months.

Goodbye January blues

The High Tatra Mountains


The festive period ends and January suddenly hits us. We’ve over indulged, we’re back at work, fantasising about where to go next. But it doesn’t have to be all doom and gloom. Come January onward, Europe usually sees the best snowfall, so now is the perfect time of year to head out on a
winter holiday
!

Escaping the crowds

Cross-country skiing at Kvitavatn


We like to escape the crowds rather than join them, leaving the downhill runs behind and getting off the beaten track. Downhill skiers and snowboarders often shun the idea of cross-country skiing, preferring the dramatic high-altitude mountains. But we’re big believers in trying something different.
Cross-country skiing
is an exhilarating way to take in breathtaking scenery, without the need to reach breakneck speeds or join the lift queues.

Playing in the snow

Sledding in Slovakia


Enjoy throwing a sneaky snowball or two? We do.
Mixed activity holidays
allow for all sorts of fun in the snow, with a new activity to try every day. Whether it’s downhill sledding, sleigh riding, a warming picnic in the forest, snow tubing or ice skating, there is a lot of fun to be had on a winter holiday. Who said snow was just for kids?

Getting cosy

The fireplace at Basecamp Oulanka, Finland


Whilst we love playing in the snow, winter is also about seeking warmth and cosiness. There is nothing better than sitting by an open roaring fire in your lodge, sampling traditional hearty food in the restaurant, or relaxing in the hot sauna. Sitting in the heart of Finland’s Oulanka National Park is
Basecamp Oulanka
, a typical example of a warm and comfortable place to stay. Equipped with all of the above, you can’t get any more cosy than this place!

Stepping into a fairytale

Vilnius, Lithuania


When a fresh fall of glittery white snow settles over a historic European city, it’s like something out of a fairytale. There’s a reason why they chose the fabled streets of Vilnius Old Town to film the hit TV series adaptation of Tolstoy's
War and Peace
. The snow creates a perfect backdrop, so now is the perfect time to book a
cultural winter holiday
and explore the Baltics and beyond.
