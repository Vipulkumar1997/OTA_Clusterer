About Exodus
Exodus Booking Conditions




Share this




















IMPORTANT TO NOTE

Please read these booking conditions carefully, they form an important part of the contract for your holiday.
All holidays advertised in our brochures and on our website are operated by Exodus Travels Ltd. Registered number 1150160 (hereinafter called 'the Company', ’we’, ‘us’ or 'our'), a member of the Travelopia Group of companies. Registered Office: Origin One, 108 High Street, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 1BD, and are sold subject to the following conditions:
Insurance
.
Please Note:  Adequate and valid travel insurance is compulsory for all Exodus travellers and it is a condition of accepting your booking that you agree you will have obtained adequate and valid travel insurance for your booking by the date of departure. We recommend that you take out insurance as soon as your booking is confirmed.

For Certain Tours:
You may be asked to accept a separate Contract of Carriage with a local vessel owner/carrier or a local service provider (collectively, the "Carrier") of your cruise which shall govern the relationship, responsibilities and liabilities as between you, the passenger, and the Carrier of your cruise. By agreeing to the Contract of Carriage and accepting the conditions therein, you agree that any dispute that you raise directly with the Carrier will be governed by and subject to the terms and conditions of the Contract of Carriage.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement governs the relationship between you and us, and any dispute or claim that you raise with us will be subject to this Agreement and not the Contract of Carriage and to the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement and the provisions of the Contract of Carriage as they relate to you and us, this Agreement shall prevail and supersede the provisions of the Contract of Carriage.

1. Your Financial Protection
The Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992 require us to provide security for the monies that you pay for the package holidays booked from us and for your repatriation in the event of our insolvency.
We will provide you with financial protection for any ATOL protected flight or flight inclusive holiday that you buy from us by way of our Air Travel Organiser’s Licence number 2582, administered by the Civil Aviation Authority (‘CAA’). When you buy an ATOL protected flight or flight inclusive holiday from us you will receive an ATOL Certificate. This lists what is financially protected, where you can get information on what this means for you and who to contact if things go wrong.
We, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, will provide you with the services listed on the ATOL Certificate (or a suitable alternative). In some cases, where neither we nor the supplier are able to do so for reasons of insolvency, an alternative ATOL holder may provide you with the services you have bought or a suitable alternative (at no extra cost to you). You agree to accept that in those circumstances the alternative ATOL holder will perform those obligations and you agree to pay any money outstanding to be paid by you under your contract to that alternative ATOL holder. However, you also agree that in some cases it will not be possible to appoint an alternative ATOL holder, in which case you will be entitled to make a claim under the ATOL scheme (or your credit card issuer where applicable).
If we, or the suppliers identified on your ATOL Certificate, are unable to provide the services listed (or a suitable alternative, through an alternative ATOL holder or otherwise) for reasons of insolvency, the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust may make a payment to (or confer a benefit on) you under the ATOL scheme. You agree that in return for such a payment or benefit you assign absolutely to those Trustees any claim which you have or may have arising out of or relating to the non-provision of the services, including any claim against us, the travel agent (or your credit card issuer where applicable). You also agree that any such claims may be re-assigned to another body, if that other body has paid sums you have claimed under the ATOL scheme.
The price of your holiday includes the amount of £2.50 per person as part of the ATOL Protection Contribution (APC) we pay to the CAA. This charge is included in our advertised prices.
When you buy an ATOL protected flight or flight inclusive holiday, all money accepted from you by a travel agent acting as our agent is held by that agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust at all times, but subject to the agent’s obligation to pay it to us for so long as we do not fail. If we do fail, any money held at that time by the agent, or subsequently accepted from you by the agent, is and continues to be held by that agent on behalf of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust without any obligation to pay that money to us.
When you buy arrangements other than an ATOL protected flight or flight inclusive holiday, all money accepted from you by a travel agent acting as our agent is held by that agent on our behalf at all times (except insurance premiums).
We will provide you with financial protection for any package holidays you buy from us that do not include travel by air by way of a bond held by ABTA. For further information, visit the
ABTA website
.
If you book arrangements other than an ATOL protected flight or a package holiday, the financial protection referred to above does not apply.
We are a Member of ABTA, membership number Y0751. We are obliged to maintain a high standard of service to you by ABTA’s Code of Conduct.
2. How to Book
To make a booking you can contact us in several ways: directly over the telephone, via our website
www.exodus.co.uk
(‘Website’), or through an approved travel agent. The person making the booking (the ‘lead name’) must be 18 years old or over and possess the legal capacity and authority to make the booking and accepts these booking conditions on behalf of everyone in their party. Whether you book alone or as a group, we will only deal with the lead name in all subsequent correspondence, including changes, amendments and cancellations. The lead name is responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the personal details or any other information supplied in respect of yourself and any other person travelling on the booking and for passing on any information regarding the booking or any changes made in relation thereto, to all persons travelling on such booking, including but not limited to information on schedule changes or copies of booking confirmations.
For all holidays, excluding Polar holidays, you will need to pay a deposit to us at the time of booking of at least 10% per person of your selected travel arrangements (minimum £150 per person or equivalent). For Polar holidays the required deposit is 20% per person of your selected travel arrangements (minimum £1000 per person or equivalent). For Tailormade Bookings the deposit amount will be confirmed on the initial quotation document sent prior to booking. You may also be required to pay for any non-transferable and non-refundable items such as National Park entrance fees and Permits, and in some cases for accommodation and services at peak times of travel or where accommodation and spaces are limited. You will be advised of all such charges due at the time of booking and before your booking is confirmed. We will then invoice you for the remainder of the cost due before you travel, which you must pay not later than 56 days (133 days for Polar holidays) before departure. In certain cases we may request full payment more than 56 days before departure where, for example, airlines require full payment on booking. If you book less than 56 days before departure (133 days for Polar holidays), full payment must be made on booking. If you do not pay the balance by the due date your booking will be cancelled and you will forfeit your deposit plus any other relevant charges.
When you book your holiday through an approved travel agent, all communication between you and us will be made through that agent, as such please contact your agent in the first instance, as no changes can be made to your booking unless they are made through your agent.
Please note
that we do not accept payment by Amex. There will be no fee applied to payments made on any other card types.

If we accept your booking, we will issue a Confirmation Invoice. A contract will exist between us from the date we issue the Confirmation Invoice or if you book within 7 days of departure the contract will exist when we accept your payment. When you receive the Confirmation Invoice please check the details carefully and inform us immediately if anything is incorrect. Names on travel documents must exactly match those in your passports. Unless we are responsible for the mistake, we will not accept liability if an airline or other supplier refuses boarding because the name(s) shown in your passport differ from those on your ticket. Travel documents will be sent or emailed to you approximately 2-3 weeks before the departure of your tour, and will not be issued unless payment of the due balance has been received and any cheques have cleared. If you live outside the UK we will email any trip information documents. If requested in the trip information documents you must reconfirm the reservations, timings and check-in details of your flight with the airline concerned at least 72 hours before departure. This applies to your outward flight and to your return flight. If you miss a flight or suffer any disruption as a result of not following our instructions as to reconfirmation we will have no liability to you.
Your personal safety is of paramount importance to us and therefore it is imperative that you advise us at the time of booking of any condition, medical or otherwise, that might affect your or other people’s enjoyment of the trip.
It is a condition of your booking that you and all members of your party provide certain information that may be sent to governmental authorities and border control and security agencies for the purpose of security and counter terrorism. This is known as Passenger Name Records (PNR) data and/or Advance Passenger Information (APIS). For the United Kingdom, it may be referred to as ‘E-Borders’. The information you must provide will include, but not be limited to, full name – as shown in your passport or travel document, gender, date of birth, travel document type, number, country of issue and expiry date, and for travel to the U.S., your country of residence and the address for your first night’s stay. You must provide this information to the airline between 6 months and 24 hours before departure.
We may transfer your booking to another company within our group, but this will have no effect on your holiday arrangements.
3. Prices, Surcharging and Air Passenger Duty
All prices we advertise are accurate at the date published, but we reserve the right to change any of those prices from time to time. Prices include a cost for fuel that was estimated at the date of this publication.  Prices on our website are updated regularly. Before you make a booking we will give you the up-to-date price of your chosen holiday including any flight supplements, upgrades or additional facilities which you have requested. Prices quoted in this brochure are based on exchange rates published by OANDA on 06th July 2017.
Changes in transportation costs, including without limitation the cost of fuel, dues, taxes or fees chargeable for services such as landing taxes or embarkation or disembarkation fees at ports and airports and exchange rates mean that the price of your travel arrangements may change after you have booked. However, there will be no change within 30 days of your departure. We will absorb and you will not be charged for any increase equivalent to 2% of the price of your travel arrangements, which excludes insurance premiums and any amendment charges. You will be charged for the amount over and above that, plus an administration charge of £1.00 per person together with an amount to cover agents’ commission. If this means that you have to pay an increase of more than 10% of the price of your travel arrangements, you may either accept a replacement holiday from us of equivalent or similar standard and price (at the date of the change) if we are able to offer you one or you may cancel your holiday booking and receive a full refund, except for any amendment charges. Should you decide to cancel for this reason, you must exercise your right to do so within 14 days from the issue date printed on your final invoice. If any change in our costs would cause a reduction in your holiday price, we will not make refunds of amounts less than 2% of the price of your travel arrangements, which excludes insurance premiums and any amendment charges, but we will refund in full amounts exceeding such 2%, after deducting an administration charge of £1.00 per person. However, please note that travel arrangements are not always purchased in local currency and some apparent changes have no impact on the price of your travel due to contractual and other protection in place.
In all cases, we will only consider an appropriate refund of insurance premiums paid if you can show that you are unable to transfer or reuse your policy.
Dates and itineraries shown for tours departing after 1 January 2018 are indicative only and subject to change.
Air Passenger Duty “APD”, which is payable by all passengers departing from UK airports, is included in the price of your holiday/flight ticket. The price of your holiday will include APD for an economy seat. If you upgrade to a premium cabin this will be included in the upgrade cost. In view of the current volatility of world oil prices, a fuel supplement may be added to the price of your holiday at the time of booking.
4. If you Change or Cancel your Booking
4.1
If, after our confirmation has been issued, you (i) make a change to your existing booking or (ii) wish to change to a different tour or change departure date, we will try to make the changes subject to availability, provided that notification is received in writing at our offices from the lead name at least 56 days (133 days for Polar holidays) before departure, but we reserve the right to charge an amendment fee of £50 per booking for each change.
4.2
Any alteration, whether a change to an existing booking or a change to another tour or departure date, will be subject to payment by you of any costs imposed by any of the suppliers providing the component parts of the tour. If the holiday to which you transfer is more expensive than the one you originally booked, a further deposit will also be payable.  Any alteration by you within 56 days of departure (133 days for Polar holidays) will be treated as a cancellation of the original booking and will be subject to cancellation charges.
4.3
Subject to the conditions below and section 4.4, where you are unable to travel you can either (i) transfer your booking (and your deposit) to a new booking on a different trip departing within 3 years of your original departure date; or (ii) transfer your booking to another person, providing the following conditions are met:
a) you notify us in writing at least 56 days before departure (133 days for Polar holidays) and give us authority to make the transfer; and
b) your request is accompanied by all original travel documents which you have received and if you are transferring your booking to another person, the full name and address of the person to whom you wish to transfer your holiday booking (“transferee”); and
c) if you are transferring your booking to another person, the transferee accepts the transfer and these booking conditions, and fulfils any conditions that apply to the booking; and
d) your, or the transferee are able to confirm that suitable travel insurance is in place; and payment is made by you of all costs charged or levied by those supplying your travel arrangements.
Where you are transferring your booking to another person, both the transferor and transferee will be jointly and severally liable for payment of the holiday price and other associated expenses.  Please note that any request to transfer your booking (either to another date or another person) will be treated as a cancellation if such notice is received within 56 days of departure (133 days for Polar holidays) and will be subject to cancellation charges.
4.4
Some airline carriers and other transport providers treat name and departure detail changes, such as date and time changes, as a cancellation. Accordingly you may have to pay for the cancelled ticket and be required to pay for the full cost of a new ticket.
4.5
You, or any member of your party, may cancel your tour at any time providing that the cancellation is made by the lead name in writing. Notice of cancellation will be effective upon receipt by us of your written communication. As we start to incur costs from the time the contract is confirmed we will retain your deposit and in addition will apply other cancellation charges as shown below. These charges are based on how many days before your booked departure we received your cancellation notice. These charges are a percentage of the total cost of your booking, not including your insurance premium. If you want to cancel one or more passengers on the booking you will have to pay a proportion of the applicable cancellation charge based on the number of passengers you wish to cancel from the booking:


Period before scheduled departure date when notice of cancellation is received



Cancellation charge per person as percentage of total booking price



More than 56 days before departure date



Loss of deposit unless booking (and deposit) is transferred to a new booking for a different trip departing within 3 years or the original departure date



Between 56 and 42 days before departure date (inclusive)



50% of the holiday cost



Between 41 and 28 days before departure date (inclusive)



60% of the holiday cost



Between 27 and 15 days before departure date (inclusive)



80% of the holiday cost



14 days or less before departure date (or failure to join the holiday) (inclusive)



100% of the holiday cost




For
Polar holidays
cancelled within 133 days of the departure date the following cancellation charges will be made:


For Polar holidays: Period before scheduled departure date when notice of cancellation is received


Cancellation charge per person as percentage of total booking price


More than 133 days before departure date



Loss of deposit.



133 days or less before departure date (or failure to join the holiday) (inclusive)



100% of the holiday cost


For trip codes WFK and WFL, please note that cancellation charges are as follows:


More than 50 days before departure date


Loss of deposit


50 days or less before departure date (or failure to join the holiday) (inclusive)



100% of holiday cost


Please note
that for certain travel arrangements e.g. many scheduled transport providers, the cancellation charge may be higher than those shown. In certain cases a 100% cancellation fee applies as soon as the booking is made and the ticket is issued. Please ask for full details of cancellation charges at time of booking.  We strongly recommend you to take out insurance that includes cover against irrecoverable cancellation costs.  Additionally, you will remain responsible for the full amount of your insurance premium and this will not be refunded in the event of your cancellation. You may however be able to transfer this cover to another holiday.
4.6
All communications relating to this contract (in particular any requests to cancel or amend your holiday arrangements) must be from the Lead Name in writing and in English by email or sent by recorded delivery post to Exodus Travels, Ltd., Grange Mills, Weir Road, London, SW12 0NE.
5. If we Change or Cancel your Booking
We reserve the right to cancel your booking or change any of the facilities, services or prices described in our brochures or website. We will endeavour to advise you of any changes known at the time of booking.
We plan the arrangements for your tour many months in advance and may occasionally have to make changes, most of which are minor. Flight timings and carriers shown in the brochure are for guidance only and are subject to change. Your Confirmation Invoice will show the latest planned timings. Your actual flight timings will be shown on your e-ticket itinerary, which you should check carefully as soon as you receive it. A change of carrier will not be considered a major change. If a major change becomes necessary, we will advise you of the change as soon as possible. Whether a change is ‘major’ depends on the nature of the tour and may include: a change in accommodation to that of a lower category; a change in time of your scheduled departure or return flight by more than 12 hours (but not a flight delay); or a change of UK departure airport (excluding changes between London airports). A delay to your flight that we need to make within 24 hours before you are due to depart will not be considered a major change unless the change is for more than 24 hours. These changes are only examples and there may be other significant changes which constitute major changes. When a major change occurs, you will have the choice of either:
(a) accepting the change; or
(b) accepting a replacement tour from us of equivalent or similar standard and price (at the date of the change), if we are able to offer you one; or
(c) cancelling your tour, in which case you shall receive a full refund of all monies paid.
We may also have to cancel your holiday arrangements. Operation of all tours is dependent on a minimum number of persons booking the tour. If that number is not achieved, we reserve the right to cancel the tour. However we will not cancel your tour less than 4 weeks before the scheduled departure date except for reasons of  force majeure (as defined below) or failure on your part to pay the deposit and/or final balance, or any other reason beyond our control. Where we cancel your booking where you are not in breach of these booking conditions and other than for reasons of force majeure, we will offer you either a refund of the monies received by us in respect of the booking, or offer you, if available, a replacement holiday from us of equivalent or similar standard and price (at the date of the change). If we are forced to cancel your holiday after departure we will, wherever possible, make suitable alternative arrangements. If we are unable to make such alternative arrangements, or you reject these for good reason then we will return you to your point of departure and refund you for any unused services, if appropriate.
Where we make a major change to or cancel your holiday (where you are not in breach of these booking conditions), except where a major change or cancellation arises from circumstances amounting to force majeure, consolidation due to minimum numbers not being attained, failure on your part to pay the deposit and/or final balance, or for any other reason beyond our control, we will pay you, as a minimum, compensation as detailed below. Any compensation payable will be on these scales, based on how many days before your booked holiday departure we tell you of a major change or cancellation:


Period before scheduled departure date when we notify you of a major change or cancellation


Compensation payable per person


Before balance due date



Nil



Between balance due date and 14 days before departure date (inclusive)



£20.00



Between 13 days and the date of departure date (inclusive)



£30.00




This standard compensation payment will not affect your statutory or other legal rights. We will only make one compensation payment for each full-fare-paying adult in the holiday booking. Any children not paying the full adult fare will receive 50% of these amounts. Children using a free child place will not receive any standard compensation payment.
We strongly recommend that you make no travel arrangements to your point of departure, make any connecting travel that is non-refundable or non-changeable or incurs penalties or incur any costs in respect of visas or vaccinations until such time as your travel itinerary has been confirmed. If you make such arrangements which you are then unable to use due to a change in your itinerary we shall not be liable to you for the cost of those arrangements.
Circumstances amounting to "force majeure" include any event which we or the supplier of the service(s) in question could not even with all due care, foresee or forestall such as (by way of example and not by way of limitation) war, threat of war, riots, civil disturbances, industrial disputes, actual or threatened terrorist activity and its consequences, natural or nuclear disasters, fire, epidemics, health risks and pandemics, acts of God, unavoidable and unforeseeable technical problems with transport for reasons beyond our control or that of our suppliers, closed or congested airports or ports, hurricanes and other actual or potential adverse weather conditions, and any other similar events.
Under European law (European Community Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004), you have rights in some circumstances to refunds and/or compensation from your airline in cases of denied boarding, cancellation of and delays to flights. Full details of these rights are publicised at EU airports and are also available from affected airlines. However, you should note that reimbursement of the cost of a flight that forms part of your holiday is the responsibility of your holiday airline and will not automatically entitle you to reimbursement of the cost of your holiday from us. Your right to a refund and/or compensation from us is set out in this section 5. If any payments to you are due from us, any payment made to you by the airline will be deducted from this amount. If your airline does not comply with these rules you should complain to the Aviation Consumer Advocacy Panel on 020 7453 6888 or at
www.caa.co.uk
.
6. Our Liability, Conditions of Carriage & Limitations
Our obligations, and those of our suppliers providing any service or facility included in your holiday, are to take reasonable skill and care to arrange for the provision of such services and facilities. You must show that reasonable skill and care has not been used if you wish to make any claim. Standards of, for example, safety, hygiene and quality vary throughout the transport and destinations that your holiday may involve. Sometimes these standards will be lower than those which would be expected in the UK. The suppliers of the services and facilities included in your holiday should comply with local standards where they are provided.

Our liability, except in cases involving death, injury or illness, shall be limited to a maximum of 3 times the cost of your travel arrangements. Our liability in all cases will be limited in accordance with and/or in an identical manner to the contractual terms of the companies that provide the transportation for your travel arrangements. These terms are incorporated into this contract; and any relevant international convention as detailed below.  We are to be regarded as having all benefit of any limitation of compensation contained in these or any conventions.  You can ask for copies of the transport companies' contractual terms, or the international conventions, from our offices Exodus Travels Ltd., Grange Mills, Weir Road, London SW12 0NE.
We shall have no liability where the cause of the failure to provide, or failure in, your holiday or any death or personal injury you may suffer is not due to any fault on our part or that of our agents or suppliers, because it is either attributable to you, or attributable to someone unconnected with your holiday and is unforeseeable or unavoidable, or is attributable to our employees, agents, subcontractors and suppliers and their staff whilst acting outside the scope of their employment, or is due to information, however obtained, from outside sources such as independent third party websites, or is due to unusual or unforeseeable circumstances beyond our control, the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised, or an event which neither we, nor our agents or suppliers could have foreseen or forestalled.
If any international convention applies to, or governs, any of the services or facilities included in your holiday arranged or provided by us, or provided by any of our suppliers, and you make a claim against us of any nature arising out of death, injury, loss or damage suffered during or as a result of the provision of those services or facilities, our liability to pay you compensation and/or the amount (if any) of compensation payable to you by us will be limited in accordance with and/or in an identical manner to that provided for by the international convention concerned (in each case including in respect of the conditions of liability, the time for bringing any claim and the type and amount of any damages that can be awarded). International Conventions which may apply include, without limitation: in respect of international air travel, the Warsaw Convention 1929 (as amended) or the Montreal Convention 1999; in respect of rail travel, the Berne Convention 1961; in respect of carriage by sea, the Athens Convention 1974; in respect of carriage by road, the Geneva Convention 1973; and, in respect of hotels, the Paris Convention 1962. For the avoidance of doubt, this means that we are to be regarded as having all benefit of any limitations of compensation contained in any of these Conventions or any other international conventions applicable to your holiday. Other than as set out above, and as is detailed elsewhere in these booking conditions, we shall have no legal liability whatsoever to you for any loss or damage.
If you purchase any optional activities that are not part of your pre-booked itinerary, the contract for the provision of that activity will be between you and the activity provider. The decision to partake in any such activity is entirely at your own discretion and risk. If you do have any complaint about, or problem with, any optional activity purchased overseas your claim should be directed to the activity provider and not to us.  However, should you or any member of your party by misadventure suffer illness, injury or death during the period of your holiday from an activity which does not form part of the arrangements made by us or an excursion purchased through us, we shall, where appropriate and subject to our absolute discretion, try to help if we can. We may help everyone on your holiday booking up to a total cost to us of £5,000 as long as the following conditions are met:
(i) you must ask us for such assistance within 90 days of the misadventure;
(ii) you must make a claim under your insurance policy’s legal expenses or other appropriate section. You must show us proof that your insurance company has received your claim; and
(iii) in the event of there being a successful claim for costs against a third party or a suitable insurance policy or policies being in force, you must repay us the costs actually incurred by us in giving this assistance.
If you are joining the holiday locally (i.e. not starting with the group from the UK) our responsibility does not commence until the appointed time, we shall not be responsible for any additional expenses incurred by you to meet up with the group. If the group arrival is delayed to the local joining point we will provide you with the same room and board basis as will be provided to the group. If the delay is for more than 24 hours we will provide you with the same services and itinerary that were detailed on your confirmation to enable you to continue with your holiday, although you may, at your discretion, remain at the local joining point for the arrival of the group.
We may operate trips in regions where standards of accommodation, transport, safety, hygiene, medical facilities and other infrastructure may, at times, be lower than those you normally expect. Your booking is accepted on the understanding that you realise the hazards involved in this kind of holiday, including injury, disease, loss or damage to property, inconvenience and discomfort. The whole philosophy of this type of travel is one that allows alternatives and a substantial degree of on-trip flexibility. The outline itineraries given for each holiday must therefore be taken as an indication of what each group should accomplish, and not as a contractual obligation on our part. Changes in itinerary may be caused by local political conditions, flight cancellations, mechanical breakdown, weather, border restrictions, sickness, or other unforeseeable circumstances. Pro rata refunds will be given for services not utilised wherever possible.
Please be assured that our service providers will always do the utmost to ensure your safety and well-being when on tour. On certain tours on which our local service providers will on day 1 of the tour ask you to sign an ‘Acceptance of Risk’ form prior to accepting your participation on the tour. The purpose of the form is to make you aware of the risks and dangers involved with travelling in these areas, and for you to agree that the service provider and the Company shall not be responsible for any claims made by you for incidents arising due to circumstances outside the service provider’s and the Company’s reasonable control. Where this is the case details are outlined in the Trip Notes and you may request a copy of the applicable form by contacting us.
Please note that the timings of air, sea, road or rail departures are estimates only. These timings may be affected by operational difficulties, weather conditions or failure of passengers to check in on time.
We operate all our trips in accordance with the recommendations from the UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office
(FCO)
. If you are booking from outside the UK you should recognise that the
FCO
advice may not always be aligned with the advice from your own consulate or government travel authority.
Flight Notice, Flight Information & EU Blacklist
This is a notice required by European Community Regulation (EC) No.889/2002. This notice cannot be used as a basis for a claim for compensation, nor to interpret the provisions of the European Community Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002 or the Montréal Convention, and it does not form part of the contract between the carrier(s), us and you. No representation is made by the air carrier(s) or us as to the accuracy of the contents of this notice.
Air carrier liability for passengers & their baggage:
This information notice summarises the liability rules applied by Community air carriers as required by Community legislation and the Montréal Convention.
Compensation in the case of death or injury: There are no financial limits to the liability for passenger injury or death. For damages up to 113,100 Special Drawing Rights (“SDRs”) the air carrier cannot contest claims for compensation. Above that amount, the air carrier can defend itself against a claim by proving that it was not negligent or otherwise at fault.
Advance payments: If a passenger is killed or injured, the air carrier must make an advance payment, to cover immediate economic needs, within 15 days from the identification of the person entitled to compensation. In the event of death, this advance payment shall not be less than 16,000 SDRs.
Passenger delays: In case of passenger delay, the air carrier is liable for damage unless it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage or it was impossible to take such measures. The liability for passenger delay is limited to 4,694 SDRs.
Baggage delays: In case of baggage delay, the air carrier is liable for damage unless it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage or it was impossible to take such measures. The liability for baggage delay is limited to 1,131 SDRs.
Destruction, loss or damage to baggage: The air carrier is liable for destruction, loss or damage to baggage up to 1,131 SDRs. In the case of checked baggage, it is liable even if not at fault, unless the baggage was defective. In the case of unchecked baggage, the carrier is liable only if at fault.
Higher limits for baggage: A passenger can benefit from a higher liability limit by making a special declaration at the latest at check-in and by paying a supplementary fee.
Complaints on baggage: If the baggage is damaged, delayed, lost or destroyed, the passenger must write and complain to the air carrier as soon as possible. In the case of damage to checked baggage, the passenger must write and complain within seven days, and in the case of delay within 21 days, in both cases from the date on which the baggage was placed at the passenger’s disposal.
Liability of contracting & actual carriers: If the air carrier actually performing the flight is not the same as the contracting air carrier, the passenger has the right to address a complaint or to make a claim for damages against either. If the name or code of an air carrier is indicated on the ticket, that air carrier is the contracting air carrier.
Time limit for action: Any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date of arrival of the aircraft, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived.
Basis for the information: The basis for the rules described above is the Montreal Convention of 28 May 1999, which is implemented in the European Community by European Community Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97 (as amended by European Community Regulation (EC) No. 889/2002) and national legislation of the Member States.
In accordance with European Community Regulation (EC) No. 2111/2005, Article 9, we are required to bring to your attention the existence of a ‘Community list’ which contains details of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban within the European Community. The Community list is available for inspection at
http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/
.
In accordance with European Community Regulation (EC) No. 2111/2005 we are required to advise you of the actual carrier operating your flight/connecting flight/transfer. We do this by listing carriers to be used or likely to be used as follows: British Airways, Turkish Airlines, Iberia, IcelandAir, South African Airways, KLM, Air Namibia, Ethiopian Airlines, Royal Air Maroc, Swiss International Air Lines, Tunisair, Kenya Airways, Air China, Etihad Airways, Gulf Air, Sri Lankan Airlines, Qatar Airways, Japan Airlines, Royal Jordanian, Thai Airways, Jet Airways, Air Canada, Virgin Atlantic, Aerolineas Argentinas, Finnair. Emirates, LAN Airlines, Air New Zealand, Air Europa, SAS, Air France, TAM, Korean Air, Croatia Airlines, Thomson Airways, EgyptAir, Malaysia Airlines, Adria Airways, Alitalia, EasyJet, TAROM, Air Madagascar, Air Botswana, TAP Portugal, Delta Airlines, Bulgaria Air, Lufthansa, Aeroflot, Norwegian, American Airlines, United Airlines, Vietnam Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Uzbekistan Airways, Aegean Airlines, Pegasus Airlines, SATA International, Ukraine International Airlines, Eva Air, Bangkok Airways, Air Malta, Precisionair, Meridiana, Brussels Airlines, Alaska Airlines, Flybe, Aer Lingus, Austrian Airlines, Avianca, JAT Airways, Aeromexico, Air Baltic, Air Zimbabwe, Caribbean Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Cubana, El Al, Garuda Indonesia, Iran Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Middle East Airlines, Monarch, Oman Air, Lao Airlines, Vueling Airlines, Jet2
The airline may use wide and narrow-body jets. Any changes to the actual airline after you have received your tickets will be notified to you as soon as possible and in all cases at check-in or at the boarding gate. Such a change is deemed to be a minor change. Other examples of minor changes include alteration of your outward/return flights by less than 12 hours, changes to aircraft type, change of accommodation to another of the same standard.  Some flights may need to stop en route. If we know about this in advance we will tell you. Flight times shown in the brochure, on the website and on your booking confirmation are not guaranteed. Actual flight times are shown on your e-tickets. Flight times are local times based on the 24-hr system.
Please check with the airline regarding luggage allowance limits and the maximum allowable single item baggage weight. If you have a medical condition, serious illness, recently undergone surgery, or have suffered a recent accident, you must advise us and your airline and you may need to be cleared for travel by the airline which will involve obtaining a Fitness to Fly Certificate from your GP.
7. Complaints
If you have a complaint about your arrangements whilst away, you must immediately notify our local representative or your Group Leader and the relevant supplier of the service. If you are not happy with their action in response please follow this up within 35 days of your return home by emailing us at
[email protected]
or by writing to Customer Services, Exodus Travels Ltd., Grange Mills, Weir Road, London, SW12 0NE, giving your booking reference and all relevant information. We will acknowledge your written notification within 7 days and aim to provide a full response within 28 days.

We can also offer you ABTA’s scheme for the resolution of disputes which is approved by the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. If we can’t resolve your complaint, go to
www.abta.com
to use ABTA’s simple procedure. Further information on the Code and ABTA’s assistance in resolving disputes can be found on
www.abta.com
. You can also access the European Commission Online Dispute (ODR) Resolution platform at
http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/
. This ODR platform is a means of registering your complaint with us; it will not determine how your complaint should be resolved. If you prefer, you can take your complaint to the County Court or another suitable court. Information regarding complaints may be shared with other tour operators.

8. Details of Insurance
Adequate and valid travel insurance is mandatory for all clients while on one of our tours. You are strongly advised to insure yourself against any possible risk that may occur and in particular to ensure that you have sufficient insurance in respect of dependent relatives on whom your trip may depend. You are required to carry proof of insurance with you and produce it if reasonably requested by Company employees or suppliers; failure to do so may result in your being prevented from certain participating in certain activities without the right to any refund.
The insurance scheme we offer is designed to cover all activities included in our itineraries and the featured optional extras. Please note, however, that this policy may not cover you for any activities you purchase that are not pre-booked nor featured in official Exodus Travels literature. If you choose not to take our insurance you are responsible for ensuring that you are in possession of travel insurance for the entire duration of the tour in respect of at least medical expenses, injury, death, repatriation, cancellation and curtailment, with cover/benefits equal to/greater than the insurance we offer. If you make your own insurance arrangements you must ensure that there are no exclusion clauses which limit cover for the type of activities included, or the altitudes attained, in your tour. Exodus will not be responsible for costs you may incur as a result of not having valid or adequate travel insurance. It is the responsibility of all our clients to declare any material facts including known medical conditions to their insurers, as failure to do so may result in a claim being reduced or declined.
9. Visa, Health, Passport, Travel Documentation
Whilst we are able to provide basic advice to clients regarding passports and visa requirements, you should check with the appropriate embassy, consulate or the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office for the exact requirements for your chosen tour and date of travel. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have the correct passport and visas to gain access to any country/region included in the travel arrangements which you purchase from us including, but not limited to, checking that your passport has the required period of validity left on it. If you fail to do so, we have no liability to you for any cost, loss or damage which you suffer, nor will we refund you the cost of any unused portion of your travel arrangements. In some cases, countries will refuse entry to clients who have criminal records. Should you be concerned about this, please check with the embassy or consulate of the countries to which you are travelling.  The lead name is entirely responsible for ensuring that all members of the group have the correct and valid documentation for travel. We cannot accept responsibility for any failure to comply resulting in any costs or fines being incurred and we advise you to check with your passport office or the consulate in question if you have any queries. Clients travelling overland to certain destinations may need to also pass through controls of other countries en-route so this should be allowed for with any passport/visa applications.
When travelling to the U.S. you must have the correct passport to travel on the Visa Waiver Programme or have obtained the correct visa, valid for your stay. Each person wishing to visit the U.S. must have either: i) an e-passport (if your passport is issued after 26 October 2006), or a machine readable passport (containing a digital photograph) if your passport is issued after the 26 October 2005 and a Visa Waiver Form or ii) a valid passport and a valid visa which must be obtained before travel from the U.S. authorities. The U.S. authorities require passengers travelling to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Programme to register on the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA). If you have not applied for and received travel authorisation via ESTA prior to travel you may be denied boarding, experience delayed processing, or be denied admission at the U.S. port of entry. However, neither possession of a visa nor meeting the basic requirements for travelling visa-free on the Visa Waiver Programme guarantees admission to the U.S. As with most countries, the final decision is made by immigration officials at the port of entry. You can apply online by completing the application form at
https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta
and paying a fee. If you are refused boarding or denied admission at the U.S. port of entry, you will still be subject to our cancellation charges in accordance with the terms of our contract with you. For additional specifics about the Visa Waiver Programme please consult the Visa Waiver Programme information on the U.S. Embassy London website
https://uk.usembassy.gov
. We recommend that you carry your ESTA approval with you when you travel and recommend you register at least 72 hours before departure. Please Note: when you register for ESTA you must have a valid passport at the time of registration and for any travel to the USA your passport must be an e-Passport that contains the microchip and the e-passport symbol. If you have applied for a post dated passport (for example to reflect a change in name) this passport will not be valid until the effective date noted in the passport. Children and minors wanting to travel with a Visa Waiver Form must hold their own machine readable passport or e-passport. Please note that the nationals of some countries can only travel to the U.S. if they have a valid visa as they are not eligible for the Visa Waiver Programme. There is a $14 fee per person charge which is payable by credit or debit card when applying. As announced by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, this fee will recover the costs incurred by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection of providing and administering the ESTA system and is in addition to the mandatory $10 travel promotion fee established by the Travel Promotion Act of 2009. This is subject to change.

When travelling to Canada you must check with your foreign office and the Canadian authorities that you have the correct passport and comply with the visa requirements. Under Canada’s ETA program, citizens from countries other than the United States, who do not need a visa to enter Canada, will need to obtain an online authorization before flying to Canada, unless otherwise exempted. The earlier travellers get their eTA, the sooner they will benefit from knowing they have been pre-screened to enter Canada. A fee of $7 is payable for processing an application for an electronic travel authorization. An application for an electronic travel authorization must be made by means of an electronic system that is made available by the Department (Citizenship and Immigration Canada) for that purpose. An electronic travel authorization is valid for a period of five years from the day on which it is issued to the applicant or until the earliest of the following days, if they occur before the end of that period: (a) the day on which the applicant’s passport or other travel document expires, (b) the day on which the electronic travel authorization is cancelled, or (c) the day on which a new electronic travel authorization is issued to the applicant.
The Cuban authorities require proof of valid medical insurance before allowing visitors to gain entry to the country.  It is essential that you have a copy of a valid travel insurance policy, insurance certificate or other suitable evidence in your possession on arrival in Cuba.  Please ensure that you keep the policy documents easily to hand upon arrival.  U.S. residents visiting Cuba must ensure that any medical insurance policy that they purchase covers them for travel to Cuba.
Please note that for some trips we need to request special permits, and as such we will require your passport details prior to accepting your booking. Furthermore, if you renew your passport after you have booked, you may be required to take your old passport with you to maintain the validity of the permit.
We are able to advise on mandatory health requirements; however, we are not medical experts. It is your responsibility to ensure that you obtain proper and detailed medical advice at least two months prior to travel for the latest health requirements, recommendations for your destination and any costs. Where you do not do so and either are not allowed to enter any country, or suffer personal injury or death as a result, we have no liability to you for any cost, loss or damage which you suffer nor will we refund you the cost of any unused portion of your travel arrangements. Clients with existing medical problems, pregnant women and anyone who has recently visited other countries should check requirements with their general practitioner. You must advise us and you may need to be cleared for travel from your GP (who may charge you for such and, for the avoidance of doubt, we are not liable for any such charges or related costs). Some of our suppliers request you to complete a medical form which itself may require you to obtain a certificate or note from your GP at your own cost.

When assessing whether holidays will operate we use information from our local offices in conjunction with advice from the Foreign Office and other relevant government bodies. It is your responsibility to acquaint yourself with the travel advice provided by these government bodies.

For more information please visit our Travel safety page
www.exodus.co.uk/travel-safety-advice
and the government websites at
www.gov.uk/travelaware
and
www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice
for your destination country(ies).
10. Local Laws & Customs & Travel Aware
Laws and customs of the country/ies you visit can be very different to those in the UK. Be aware of your actions to ensure that they do not offend, especially if you intend to visit religious areas. There may be serious penalties for doing something that might not be illegal in the UK. You are strongly advised to check with the appropriate embassy, consulate or British and Commonwealth Office or
https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice
for further information regarding local laws and customs of the country/ies you plan to visit. It is your responsibility to familiarise yourself with, and respect local laws and customs. If you fail to do so, we will have no liability to you for any cost, loss or damage which you suffer nor will we refund you the cost of any unused portion of your travel arrangements. You are also recommended to read the Foreign Office’s “Travel Aware” guidance to familiarise yourself with Government advice for overseas travel. This advice can be found at
https://travelaware.campaign.gov.uk/

You may choose to send an email to your ‘Friends' including a link to your photo album(s) saved in your ‘My Exodus' account. To enable this link to be forwarded to your friends you will need to supply an email address for your friend(s). Exodus will not use the friend's email address supplied for marketing purposes. When you choose to share your online images with Friends, those individuals will be able to view your album. Please note, as with any email, your friends could forward the email invitation to others, who will then be able to click on the link to the album within the email, and see the pictures too.
2.    You may choose to ‘Share your album with everyone' and thereby publish your album on the Exodus Website by assigning it a 3-character trip code. Your album will then be displayed in the Images section for that trip and will potentially be visible to anyone that visits the Website.

DATA NOTICES
-Customer Data

When you make this booking, you consent to this information being passed to the relevant people. Information held by your travel agent is subject to that company’s own data protection policy.
-Caricom API Data

.
Any likeness or image of you secured or taken on any of our holidays may be used by the Company without charge in all media (whether now existing or in the future invented) for bona fide promotional or marketing purposes, including without limitation promotional materials of any kind, such as brochures, slides, video shows and the internet.
12. Leader Authority & Behaviour
On an active group holiday it is necessary that you abide by the authority of the leader, who represents the Company. If you commit any illegal act when on the holiday or if in our reasonable opinion or the reasonable opinion of the leader or another person in authority your behaviour is disruptive, threatening or abusive, causes unnecessary inconvenience or is causing or likely to cause damage to property, danger, distress or upset, disturbance or annoyance to others or puts any other traveller or our staff in any risk or danger, on the telephone, in writing or in person, we may terminate your travel arrangements without any liability on our part.
If the Captain of your flight or ferry or any of our overseas staff or agents believes that you could be disruptive or that you are suffering from a contagious disease, they can also refuse to let you proceed with your travel arrangements, restrict your movements on board, disembark you from the ferry or aircraft, or remove you from your accommodation or excursion. If this means you are not allowed to board the flight outbound from the UK, we will treat your booking as cancelled by you from that moment, and you will have to pay full cancellation charges. If this occurs overseas then you will become responsible for your own return home and any other members of your group who cannot or will not travel without you. In any of these circumstances no refunds or compensation will be paid to you and we will not be liable for any costs or expenses you incur.
If you are refused carriage because of your behaviour, or you are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, your airline may pass on your details and date of refusal of carriage to other airlines for their information. This in turn may make it difficult for you to book other airline tickets. In any of these circumstances, no refunds or compensation will be paid to you and we may make a claim against you for any damages, costs and expenses (including legal expenses) incurred as a result of your behaviour including but not limited to (i) repairing or replacing property lost, damaged or destroyed by you, (ii) compensating any passenger, crew, staff or agent affected by your actions and (iii) diverting the aircraft or ferry to remove you. Criminal proceedings may also be instigated.
If you are affected by any condition, medical or otherwise, that might affect your or other people’s enjoyment of the holiday, you must advise us of this at the time of booking.
For the purpose of this section, reference to “you” or “your” includes any person in your party.
13. Your Accommodation
Any accommodation we arrange for you must only be used by those people named on your Confirmation Invoice (or on latest Amendment Invoice issued). You are not allowed to share the accommodation or let anyone else stay there. You are responsible for the cost of any damage caused to your accommodation or its contents during your stay. These charges must be met by you and may have to be paid locally.
14. Trip Notes
If we issue detailed trip notes for your booking these trip notes and all the information contained therein will be deemed to be part of the contract.  Trip notes available from our website or by post from Exodus Travels, Grange Mills, Weir Road, London, SW12 0NE, contain up-to-date definitive information about the itinerary and travel arrangements. Should there be a discrepancy between the information in the brochure or website and the trip notes, the information in the trip notes supersedes that in the brochure or on the website and will be considered the most up-to-date and accurate.
15. Special Requests
We will consider special requests such as dietary requirements or specific rooming arrangements when you book.  We will tell you whether there is a charge for the request. We can only guarantee requests for which there is a charge, or those that are confirmed in writing. It is your responsibility to advise us of any special requirements.
16. Participation Requirements
All clients are expected to satisfy themselves prior to booking that they are fit and able to complete the itinerary of their chosen holiday as described in this brochure.

By booking an Exodus tour you acknowledge that this is an active holiday which may test your physical ability and may consist of strenuous and demanding activities. You are therefore responsible for ensuring you are aware of the nature of the associated activities and physical requirements before you book. By confirming your booking you acknowledge that you have the appropriate levels of ability, fitness and good health to safely participate in the tour.

By confirming your booking you accept that the Company’s tour leaders have the authority to prevent you from participating in any part of a tour should they have concerns about (a) your ability to safely partake in an activity or (b) your physical ability to complete an activity in the required timescale. In the event the leader deems such a decision is necessary, we will reasonably endeavour to make alternative arrangements, but we will not be liable to provide any refunds for missed activities and you may be liable for additional costs incurred.

Anyone suffering from mobility impairment, illness or disability or undergoing treatment for any physical or medical condition must declare the true nature of such condition at the time of booking and make arrangements for the provision of any medication or other treatment which may be required during the holiday. Failure to make such disclosure will constitute a breach of these booking conditions and result in such persons being excluded from the holiday in which case all monies paid will be forfeit.

No unaccompanied minors (those under 18 years of age) can be accepted however (a) minors aged between 3 -17 years may accompany their parents on tours designated as family adventures and (b) older teenagers may be allowed to join group tours provided they are accompanied by a parent or guardian who accepts full responsibility for them. (c) minors aged between 10 and 17 may accompany their parents on certain tours designated as Polar holidays.

Under European law, if you are disabled or have difficulty moving around, you can receive free assistance when you fly. Please contact us if you wish to find out more information.

Many of the flights and flight-inclusive holidays on this website are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all holiday and travel services listed on this website. Please ask us to confirm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected. Please see our booking conditions for information, or for more information about financial protection and the ATOL Certificate go to:
www.atol.org.uk/ATOLCertificate
If you book arrangements other than an ATOL protected flight or a package holiday, the financial protection referred to above does not apply. Our ATOL number is 2582 and our ABTA number is Y0751.
