Rum, revolutionaries and salsa rhythms: Cuba’s allure is impossible to resist

Adventure Holidays in Cuba

With a quixotic blend of revolutionary history, irresistible salsa sounds, vintage cars, white sand beaches and crumbling colonial beauty, Cuba holidays can be as captivating as contradictory. Explore the Havana’s steamy cellar bars and tango houses; head to Viñales, a pretty sleepy town situated in the fertile rolling countryside where they produce tobacco for Cuba’s famous cigars; and Trinidad, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its salsa, cobbled streets, and coloured houses. Of course there are museums here, but better to keep your eyes peeled as 1950s cars rattle alongside the sweeping coastline and crumbling colonial mansions.

But make your Cuba holiday happen now. For the clock of commercialism is ticking, and the the faded, time-warped naivety that has made it so special is not likely to last much longer…

Embedded video for Cuba with Exodus Travels






Cuba with Exodus Travels




In 1492 when Christopher Columbus discovered Cuba he described it as 'the most beautiful land on earth'. Cuba offers a unique cultural experience with its blend of African and Spanish influences, laid-back charm and 50 years of socialism.

Cuba’s Top Adventure Holiday Experiences

1. Havana:
photogenic, atmospheric and unique, in Havana drum beats, the sounds of strumming guitars and the buzz of local life fill every street.

2. Caribbean beach life:
crystalline waters, palm-fringed beaches and Caribbean tranquillity are to be found everywhere along Cuba’s coastline. Visit ever-popular Varadero and beautiful Cayo Saetia, until recently the restricted private reserve of high ranking communist officials.

3. The history of Santiago de Cuba:
the stage for the most important events of the revolutionary struggle makes almost every street corner of this city famous. It also holds on to clear musical routes with a hedonistic carnival every July.

4. Trinidad:
this is a UNESCO World Heritage Site awash with perfectly preserved cobbled streets, pretty churches and grand colonial mansions with painted shutters.

5. Walking and nature:
Cuba's unvisited Western Province, Pinar del Río is a paradise for walkers, bird watching and opportunities to discover tropical plants, visit small private farms and working plantations. There are plenty of beautiful beaches nearby, too.

6. Cycling Cuba:
few Cubans are able to afford cars so roads are surprisingly empty, perfect for exploring on two wheels.
