Trip:



Cape Town & the Garden Route





Garden route - south africa in nov




Two weeks at the end of November was ideal time to travel the 'Garden Route' Varied itinery. from game parks , to wine tasting, whale watching to visiting ostrich farm, museums to shopping. Includes days in Cape Town ( table mountain etc ) , lots of free time, optional extras which you could chose to do or not.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


I went shark diving in a cage !! It was a must do optional extra - costs a lot but you have to do these things once in your life. Well worth all the money ( thanks credit card )
Picked up from hotel- driven to the centre - travel out on boat for 20+ mins Safety briefings given . Wet suit + mask etc Water not that cold for the Atlantic. Although not see great white saw plenty of copper back sharks - hey a shark is a shark . Had two long sessions in cage. I loved it ... Go for it




What did you think of your group leader?


Justin was very very good. Knew his stuff . Very obviously proud of his country. Put up with a lot of ribbing from the 16 of us. Always helpful. If he is your group leader you will enjoy yourself as well as learn loads about SAfrica - whether it be animals, plants , history, geology, even politics




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Be prepared for different weather - can change - I think we were very lucky. However, did not get to Robben Island due to rough seas and were lucky to get up Table Mountain on 2nd attempt. Don't be disappointed if you not make these two trips.
In Cape town go on hop on hop off bus BUT they only run clockwise - hence do not think about going all way round then doing it again and hopping off . Blue route takes 2 + hours.
Take some tea/ coffee with you as a couple of apartments are ' self catering '
Apartments and hotels we stayed in were ideally situated- view over sea etc.
Try all sorts of food - Ostrich, warthog, springbok all very tasty as were the fish dishes.
Kayaking ( includes lilo + cliff jumping ) ok. Zip wiring - good intro as I had not done before but I think a bit tame if you had already experienced it. Whale watching approx. £40 may not be worth it especially as you can see from beach ( this opinion from group - I did not do )
Township - I did not do but there were very mixed views - many negative




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Last two weeks in nov are good time to go - still Whales around which you can see from the land
Weather good 23-30 degrees.
Lots of shops, markets to buy items - make sure you have room in your case
Wine cheap.

Trip:



Cycling Vietnam





A great trip




A great trip overall, which I would recommend. The itinerary was good, the hotels (with 1 exception) were really good, the trip leader (Le Long) was fantastic, the bikes and support team were good, the food was good, and Vietnam is very interesting. However the itinerary is very busy - although some down time is built in, there were lots of early mornings, and a lot of cycling time (good) and bus time (not so good), so there was not as much time for sightseeing and soaking up culture etc. as I would have liked - we rode past a few places I would love to have stopped an spent time exploring. There would be no solution to this other than making the trip a couple of days longer - so I am not complaining at all, just noting the reality - this is the only reason I give it 4 rather than 5 stars - 4½ would be more appropriate




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The long downhill ride on the 5th day. I loved riding through the markets and town of Dalat




What did you think of your group leader?


Absolutely fantastic - simultaneously very efficient and the life and soul of the party!




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


You might need a few days off after all this activity - especially if you are prone to jet lag problems if you are traveling from the UK or the US. I would also suggest getting to Ho Chi Minh City a day or two before the trip starts, to get over jet lag and also to explore the town a bit (there is no time for this in the trip itself) - I would recommend a back-of-the-motorbike city tour, the War Remnants Museum, the cocktail bar at the top of Bitexco Tower, among other. Vietnamese city traffic (mainly motorbikes) looks absolutely scary, but is not at all - all the motorbikes just flow around you like a school of fish, and the (relatively few) cars and trucks are very aware of 2-wheeled traffic and respectful. Everyone is friendly




Is there anything else you would like to add?


One of our overnight destinations was destroyed by the typhoon that came 2 weeks before our trip - Exodus handled this very well and the alternative accommodation was great

Manaslu Lodge Circuit





Manaslu from all sides




I’m just back in Kathmandu having completed the Manaslu Lodge Circuit. 33 years ago my late wife and I trekked the Annapurna Circuit independently which was one of the loveliest experiences of our lives. So I was prepared to be very disappointed by the neighbouring Manaslu Circuit. But not one bit. The itinerary works really well - with 13 nights to get round the circuit. Starting in warmth and luxuriance and Hindu culture; moving steadily up to the colder more spacious places of Tibetan villages with the beautiful twin peaks of Manaslu and the surrounding Himal providing glorious vistas; the long hard day crossing the Larkya Pass with the unexpected revelation of the Annapurna massif in the distance; the descent through dappled forest back to the world of flowers, butterflies, monkeys and terraced fields. Just magic! More than I’d hoped for. All made even better by having Valerie Parkinson as our leader - who could tell us what it was actually like to be the first British woman to climb Manaslu (8163m) - without oxygen. I feel very spoilt. Thank you Valerie - and thank you Exodus for another well-organised, unforgettable experience.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The first proper sighting of Manaslu and the surrounding himal and the transition to Tibetan culture.




What did you think of your group leader?


See above. Inspirational and a wonderful human being.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Definitely take a Steripen (see trip notes) - such a brilliant device.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


This was my 7th trek in the Himalayas - and, with the exception of that first Annapurna trek all those years ago, this Manaslu one has been the best trek (although having three sightings of snow leopards in Ladakh a few years ago with Exodus is a close rival!).

Discover Bangladesh





Discover Bangladesh




Bangladesh is an emerging country that has quite a bit to offer to the traveller - it does not have a well developed tourism market as yet for overseas visitors.
It has its own unique style and personality which is different from the surrounding countries. It was a pleasure to have been able to visit whilst it remains unspoilt by the overseas traveller.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Going to the Sundarbans National Park and gazing up at the night sky through binoculars and realising that we were just a very small cog in a huge galaxy. Seeing the Milky Way up close was just inspirational.




What did you think of your group leader?


Both Ed and Mr Khan were good and both re-kindling the tourism route within Bangladesh as a couple of years had been missed for various reasons.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Be aware for long drives - some roads are better than others depends upon the time of year you go. Take some binoculars for the Sundarbans National Park.
Be aware that your photo will be taken more times than you can count - the tables are turned on us as travellers as they want our photos.
Enjoy the experience remember to ask for experiences like tasting of local delicacies otherwise you will miss out.
You do not need huge amounts of money - not much to buy as in the way of mementos.
Go now before it gets spoilt.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


The group needs to be smaller than 14 due to size of the coach -tall Europeans vs the Bangladeshi people leg room is not brilliant.
Go to experience a new and developing country in view of its tourism, Try to remember that you are the novelty and that you get asked constantly for your photo to be taken.
Enjoy the experience and ask to sample different foods etc as each area has its own speciality - a gourmet trip to Bangladesh would be good combined with a much longer time in the Sundarbans.
Would rather no police escort as that drew attention to us rather than allowing us to blend into the background.
Would like to have seen different places as well and less time spent on the road - could that be substituted for air time to be able to see more of the country and to see the delta region from the sky would have been impressive. as it is so flat and vast its hard to imagine.
to go at different times of the year as Bangladesh has 6 seasons and to go just after monsoon would be fantastic to be able to sample different kinds of fruit and food available.

Beautiful Costa Rica




We have just returned from a fantastic holiday guided by Johnny Villalobos. He made the experience memorable for our group of 13 travellers. He gave 100% to us, walking early to see as much as possible, owl hunting at night and working all hours to enable us to ' maximise' our holiday ( his word ) ! The itinerary was well put together and all the lodges and hotels were carefully chosen, all different but all excellent. We particularly loved Esquinas Lodge, its remoteness and the birds of course! We saw a huge number of bird species and Johnny helped us to check the 'list' every evening in happy hour!!! We had the good fortune to be travelling with a great group of people which really made for a fun time as well. We did see quetzal too. We saw at least two males and two females and they did us the honour of performing a memorable flying display! All in all a really wonderful holiday. My only query might be a question of its rating as Leisurely 1!!!




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Baby turtles hatching and making their perilous journey from nest to sea.
The Resplendent Quetzals!
Getting very wet in Monteverdi cloud forest!
Visiting a local school and the home of Aurora for a Costa Rican lunch.




What did you think of your group leader?


Amazing group leader. His knowledge, love and pride for his country Costa Rica shone through.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


If you love birds, mammals, nature and beautiful scenery book this trip.

Essential Peru





A ‘bucket list’ trip!




This was a great trip, planned and organised to Exodus’ usual high standards, which enabled my partner and I to tick of a number of ‘bucket list’ experiences that we’d wanted to do since our ‘teens.
The only downside was the number of hours spent sitting on the comfortable coach - but Peru is such a long country, and out itinerary so diverse, that there really wasn’t any alternative. And, as usual, we were able to stop and see places too small for a final destination which we would not otherwise have seen.
Altogether, a good, thorough exploration of Central and southern Peru.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Oooh ... the Nazca Lines ... Machu Pichu of course ... floating islands on Lake Titicaca ... the food ...




What did you think of your group leader?


Daniel Torres was an excellent tour leader - possibly our best Exodus leader yet. Coming from Lima, he thoroughly understood our problems with altitude, yet his own altitude problems never once impacted on his care and attention to detail. A lovely man.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Do not underestimate the variable effects of altitude! I was short of breath (especially at night) and experienced disrupted sleep and a complete loss of appetite. At very high altitudes (during brief coach stops) I felt as though I was standing on the deck of a ship - move too fast and I was swaying. My partner also suffered disrupted sleep, but wasn’t nearly as breathless and his appetite was undiminished.
We saw the Nazca lines from a small aircraft (an optional extra which the guide arranged) - expensive, but worth it. But we were all very glad to get off the plane - cramped, of course, but did the pilot really need to bank so enthusiastically?




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Dany, our tour leader, was a real foodie, and took us to some marvellous restaurants. When we went off on our own we also found some great places - good food seems to be easy to find all over Peru.
Warning: Peruvians apparently eat their main meal at lunchtime - and portions are gargantuan! We prefer to eat in the evening - when portions are still massive. But pretty reasonable prices - expect to pay around £10 for a main course. Wine is expensive, but Cusquena dorado beer is usually reasonable.

Essential Peru





Wonderful




So much to see and enjoy. The landscape is awesome and the itinerary excellent. All of the places we visited were memorable, from Macchu Pichu to Lake Titicaca (great homestay, so friendly) to Cusco to the condor viewing.....plus many more wonderful places. Always wanted to see the Nasca lines and this was one of the few tours we could find that included it. The weather was largely kind to us so I would say it is a good month to go. We also enjoyed some really great eating experiences - thanks to our Tour Leader 'foodie' , Danny.
We really could not fault anything. The hotels were good and well located, the (sometimes long) journeys were broken up by regular stops along the way and there was some dramatic scenery to enjoy. We largely coped with the altitude but be aware that it does affect a number of people in some way.
Finally, our Tour Leader was excellent, probably the best we've ever had. All in all a fabulous tour, one not to be missed !!!




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Has to be Macchu Pichu !!




What did you think of your group leader?


Fantastic.

Highlights of Nicaragua





Highlights of Nicaragua




Nicaragua is a great country to visit for those travellers who are looking for a destination less well travelled. It has beautiful landscapes and impressive wildlife.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The three main highlights for me were: seeing nesting turtles at La Flor; a restful time on the picturesque Omotepe Island in Lake Nicaragua, and visiting a number of volcanoes, in particular, Telica and Cerro Negro.




What did you think of your group leader?


Juan is a welcoming and enthusiastic group leader. The trip was well run and Juan represented his country well.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Do not take pound sterling as your main spending money as the exchange rate is awful. You cannot change sterling at the bank (only US Dollars and Euros are accepted). The money change men will sell you cordobas for sterling, but the rate they offer is less than parity with the US Dollar (which means losing more than 30% in value if you sell pounds). Fortunately for me, there was an obliging fellow traveller on the trip (thanks Mike) who sold me his spare US dollars for sterling. It's best to take US dollars and have a credit card for back-up.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Be prepared to have rice and beans (gallo pinto) as an accompaniment with all meals, breakfast, lunch and dinner - it's the national dish.
