Home to the Masai Mara and countless species of wildlife, it's perhaps the world's most iconic Safari Holiday destination. will take you through sunset plains to see the craning necks of giraffes, hear the thunderous footfalls and braying trumps of elephants and see lions luxuriating fearlessly in the open. A Kenya Safari holiday means sun, wide open spaces, and arguably the best wildlife viewing on the planet.With cultures unchanged by the modern world, pristine beaches, snow-capped mountains, scorched deserts and the most incredible sunsets on Earth, Kenya might just steal your heart. On a holiday to Kenya you'll soak in the very essence of Africa.

Kenya Safari Holidays

Masai Mara Safaris:
undoubedly one of the best locations for an
African safari holiday
.
This national reserve is home to Maasai communities whose rituals and ancient traditions remain an integral part of their everyday life. Once fearful warriors, life is now dominated by the need to tend and protect their cattle; proud Maasai men in their bright red cloaks, carry long spears to lead their herds across the vast grasslands in search of water and pastures. And then there are the animals...

Lake Nakuru Safaris:
Lake Nakuru is a large soda lake carpeted with thousands of pink flamingo, an awe-inspiring sight made even more spectacular when the birds take flight, forming a great pink cloud above the shimmering water. A safari in Lake Nakuru National Park will live long in the memory. As an important sanctuary for the black and white rhino, they can often be seen at rest near the lake shore and under acacia trees. Out on a game drive around Nakuru, you are also likely to see huge herds of zebra and buffalo, possibly a lone leopard, prides of lion and wandering giraffes.

The Sacred Realm of Mount Kenya:
Africa’s second highest peak is regarded as the sacred realm of Ngai, god of the local Kikuyu people and known by them as the “place of light”. It’s an inspiring sight best viewed at dawn when illuminated by the sun’s early rays. Kenya holidays don't have to just be about wildlife. Trekking fans will be drawn to the challenging granite cliffs and volcanic rock of Mount Kenya’s snow-capped peak.

Life on the Great Rift Valley:
step out onto the valley’s open plains and you’ll feel a million times smaller than you ever have before. Drive by a pride of lions in a four wheel drive safari vehicle, watch a herd of elephants from the back of a horse, walk amongst herds of plains game or spot some of the 400 species of bird-life around the sparkling lakes of Navaisha and Nakuru.
