What are Tailormade Adventures?

There’s a world of life-changing experiences out there, and all our trips are hand-crafted to showcase the best, wherever you’re headed. But what happens if you want to take a detour? Linger a while longer? Or want something completely unique to you? With Exodus’ Tailormade Adventures we can tailor almost any holiday to suit you,

creating a bespoke adventure. Every element can be tailored to suit your requirements: we can sort flights and hotel upgrades, extra nights, regional departures, beach extensions, stop overs and more.

Your Adventure, Your Way

So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain; visit a particular beach; go luxe for a special occasion or even honeymoon; or team up with your cycling buddies and go exploring: let us know what and where you want to go and do as well as your dates, and we’ll do the rest. At Exodus, we know that adventures come in all shapes and sizes, so speak to one of our sales experts about flexible travel options and let's make it personal. We can tailormake an experience that fits you perfectly.

Your Words, Not Ours

"My wife and I had a fantastic holiday on an Exodus Tailormade Tour as the group tour was already full. Our guide, Krishna, has been doing these tours for about 14 years and made the whole time very easy and enjoyable for us."


Antony Wilson (
Land of the Tiger
)

"This holiday was brilliant, awesome, fantastic, incredible, surpassed expectations, and would recommend wholeheartedly."


Mary Osborn (

Your World, Your Adventure, Your Way...














Why choose a Tailormade Adventure?

Your group

Whether it’s to tick one off the bucket list with your walking club, a special birthday treat, an experience to engage and inspire your family, a structured school trip to educate young minds, a different type of holiday to share with friends or just to create lasting memories with a loved one, an Exodus Private Adventure is the best way to go with your own group.

Flexibility

Choose your ow
n departure date, go at your own pace, and let us know what you want to see and do. You might want to add extra nights before and after the main tour, stay in a luxury hotel or get off the beaten path in a remote region, visit a particular museum, or make the itinerary as demanding or relaxing as you like - it's your adventure, your way!

Expertise

Tailormade Adventures are escorted by expert personal leaders who will take you to places you wouldn’t find on your own, but in some areas we can also arrange local guides to keep the costs down or to give you more freedom to explore independently.

Specialism

With dedicated and well-travelled sales consultants to help you through the planning and booking process, and over 40 years’ experience in the activities we offer, we’re true specialists in adventure travel, so you’re in safe hands when it comes to crafting your holiday.

Planning

We do all the hard work for you – our itineraries all run as successful groups tours, and we’re constantly improving and refining them based on customer and staff feedback, so we know what works and what doesn’t. Our local partners are experts in running these tours on the ground too. All you need to do is tell us what you want, and we’ll put together the perfect rewarding and fun-packed adventure for you!
