Adventure Holidays in Uganda

Many people refer to Uganda as the 'Real Africa' and it is easy to see why. Stunning scenery, among the friendliest people anywhere, as well as
Primates
and fantastic activities makes a holiday to Uganda an exciting prospect for adventure travellers. It is also a gateway to
Rwanda
- home of the magnificent yet endangered mountain gorillas. A cruel legacy of internecine warfare had left the country with bleak tourism prospects; however firm government has made Uganda a jewel in East Africa's tourism crown. The source of the Nile at Lake Victoria provides one of the the best one-day white water rafting on this or any other continent. And there's a good infrastructure, that makes travelling easy despite the distances being long. Relaxing areas of Lake Bunyoni make a trip to Uganda filled with contrasts.

In focus: Ugandan Primates

On a trek through the
Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, guides will cut a route through the undergrowth. There's a minimum of three hours walking on rough terrain, with the possibility of climbing up to 2600m, in order to find the gorillas; steep ascents and descents over muddy slopes are the norm. But spending a magical hour with Mountain Gorillas in Bwindi is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Our Ugandan trip will also give you the opportunity to search for
elusive tree climbing lions in Queen Elizabeth National Park, and discover just how friendly the people here are.
