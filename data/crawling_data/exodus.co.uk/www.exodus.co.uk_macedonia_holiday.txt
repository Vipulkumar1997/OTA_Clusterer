Adventure Holidays in Macedonia

Macedonia, snugly tucked away in the heart of the Balkans, is sadly underrated. From the capital Skopje, surprisingly opulent for a former communist city and bursting with innumerable statues, to the expansive mirror-like lakes clean enough to swim in, surrounded by pastoral mountains dotted with villages that have remained unchanged for hundreds of years, a holiday in Macedonia is full of surprises. Here there are adventures aplenty. If you’re a keen cyclist, the borderlands of Northern Albania and Western Macedonia are a vista of sweeping gorges, crystal blue waters and plateaux rising high above lush greenery. Ancient villages, centuries old, lie along our carefully chosen route, which offers cycling that equally challenges and rewards.

Expert opinion: The Balkans

“Eastern Europe is a part of the continent that still maintains a slight hint of mystery whilst steadily becoming far more accessible and popular thanks to cheaper flights and improvements in the region’s infrastructure. Travellers are intrigued by what these countries have to offer as for many years they were behind the Iron Curtain and the modern history of Eastern Europe helped shape much of the 20th Century. Whilst the fall of the Berlin Wall might feel some time ago now, it has taken a very long time for countries in the East to be able to properly shine and allow their own unique cultural identities emerge onto the world stage. In Macedonia there are stunning views. Climb up to the stately Orthodox church St John at Kaneo, which sits on a clifftop in the historic town of Ohrid for stunning views across Albania and the terracotta-tiled Byzantine monastery of St Panteleimon. There’s also wonderful wildlife and walking: visit the forest-covered Mavrovo National Park, and look out for lynx, wolves and even the occasional bear. And try its excellent food and drink.”
