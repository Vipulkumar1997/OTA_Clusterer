Adventure Holidays in Turkey

An excellent Mediterranean climate, kilometres of unspoilt beaches, mountains, lakes, fascinating towns and villages, and a treasure house of historic and archaeological sites. A holiday to Turkey is filled with adventure. The places we visit are world-renowned: Istanbul, Ephesus, Cappadocia, Gallipoli, and Troy and each has an undisputed place in world history.

Rightly touted as a country of wonderful beaches and coastline, Turkey is also home to untouched mountains and lakes. In the phenomenon of Pammukale’s limestone ‘cotton castles’ and Cappadocia’s strange geological formations, nature displays its penchant for the beautiful and bizarre. Less well known, perhaps, is that Turkish food is rated as one of the world's great cuisines, but without doubt some of the best memories will come from contact with the local population, who are renowned for their charm, hospitality and friendliness.

Highlights of Turkey

1.
Istanbul
: the Hippodrome, the Topkapi Palace, the Blue Mosque and Covered Grand Bazaar are all monuments to the glory of the Ottoman Empire but these days you can also polish off your sightseeing with a cocktail and all night partying at trendy downtown clubs.

2.
Discover Cappadocia
: the soft volcanic rock around Cappadocia has created a fantasy landscape of lunar curves and eerie ‘fairy chimneys’. Head underground to uncover entire cities and intricately frescoed churches carved into the rock.

3.
Trek the Lycian Way
: pine-forested mountains, amazing cliff top views, ancient ruins and beautiful beaches await on this much loved long distance walking holiday route.

4.
Go sea kayaking
: just one of the wonderful ways to discover the famous fine beaches and stunning scenery of Turkey’s Turquoise Coast.

5.
Dive deep
: busy reefs, underwater caves and shipwrecks await underneath the warm waters of the Med, plenty to keep divers of all abilities happy.

6.
Turkey on two wheels
: different and just that bit more dynamic, a road tour of Turkey can take you from the fine beaches and archaeological sites of the coast high up into the hills where traditional Turkey is all around.
