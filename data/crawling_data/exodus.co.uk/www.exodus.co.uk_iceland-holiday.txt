Adventure Holidays in Iceland

Exodus offer a number of a
dventure holidays
to Iceland.
Iceland holidays
conjure up images of huge waterfalls, glaciers, spouting geysers and steaming hot pools. Reykjavik is a small but beautiful city and provides the start and end point of most trips. Outside the city lies a landscape begging to be explored.
Trekking in Iceland
is fantastic, with a wide selection of walks. Iceland trips make amazing adventure holidays with visits to the impressive Gulfoss and Godafoss waterfalls, Lake Myvatn and the Jokulsarlon Lagoon. In winter there is the chance to try snowshoeing and glacier exploration. Iceland is also one of the best destinations for
Northern Lights Holidays
, but no holiday to Iceland would be complete without a visit to the steaming waters of the Blue Lagoon.

Holidays to Iceland – Four Icelandic Essentials

1. Explore the Big Country:
while it’s not necessarily big in geographical terms, Iceland is massive when it comes to geological diversity and geographic features. The interior mainly consists of a plateau characterized by sand fields, mountains and glaciers, while many big glacial rivers stream to the sea through the lowlands.
2. Bathe in the Blue Lagoon:
after a hard day's mountaineering, there is no better place to relax and revitalise than in the warm mineral-rich hot springs of the Blue Lagoon. It's fed by heated seawater and surrounded by walls of black lava.

3. Visit Skogafoss Waterfall:
at 60m high, a white blanket of water cascades over the edge of the cliff-top, crashing down to the river below. For an alternative view, you can walk right behind the waterfall - a compelling reminder of the power of the earth’s elements.

4. Go whale watching:
Iceland holidays offer some amazing spots for whale watching, its rich waters attracting a great diversity of whale species: killer whales, humpback whales, pilot whales, white beaked dolphins, as well as sperm, fin, minke and blue whales are all regular sightings.
