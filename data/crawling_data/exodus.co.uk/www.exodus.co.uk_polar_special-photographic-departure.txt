Photographic Polar Departures

Travel photography is a passion at Exodus. On most Exodus holidays there are fantastic opportunities to get behind the lens of your camera and take those dream shots. Our style of travel means that you're up early, enjoying the best light of the day as the sun rises and sets. We have award-winning photographers in the office to provide advice pre trip, and also run a number of specialist dedicated travel photography holidays.

New 2018 Polar Photographic Departures

If you’re prepared to go to the ends of the earth for rarefied wildlife, this is the perfect temptation. Exodus’ Arctic and Antarctic photographic charters are exclusively for our travellers, and you’ll be joined by the most articulate, passionate and opinionated wildlife professionals on the planet. On board both charters will be zoologist, conservationist and award-winning author and presenter Mark Carwardine and Exodus’ resident photography and wildlife doyen Paul Goldstein. On the Antarctic one they will be joined by the BBC’s Chris Packham .  Head to
Spitsbergen
for bears, walrus, Arctic foxes and huge bird colonies and
Antarctic Peninsula
for vast penguin rookeries, huge glaciers and icebergs, whales and seals. Neither will have strict itineraries, both will maximise the many hours of daylight – we’ll see you on the ice.









Quotes from the experts:

"It’ll be a real pleasure to have several weeks to teach Paul and Chris a thing or two about photography (I know they’re both keen to learn) in one of my favourite places on the planet. And expedition adventures don’t come much more comfortable than on the Resolute.

Mark Carwardine

"One ship, three Canons…. this will be something. I cannot wait to lock horns with these ‘sometime’ friends again and help share the seventh continent with a hundred or so polar pilgrims. Will the three of us be talking at the end of it? Come and find out!”

Paul Goldstein

"You don’t have to go to the ends of the earth to get a good photo . . . but it helps! Snow and Ice, Golden Penguins, a Humpback Surprise . . . and these are just the cocktails at the bar! Seriously, this will be amazing.”

Chris Packham

Picture Perfect  - Here are a few tips:

Do you know your camera?
Make sure you know how to use your camera well before your holiday. If you are buying it especially for the trip, take it out beforehand and practice until you know how to use it without looking at the manual. You will then enjoy and capture those split-second wildlife moments.

Keep a respectful distance
It will be tempting to get close to penguins and seals for that framefilling shot but this can be stressful for the animals (and also breaks IAATO guidelines) so don’t do it! Bring a camera which has a decent zoom or telephoto on it so that you can keep your distance.
Your subject is more likely to behave in a calm, natural way giving you a photo to be proud of.

How’s your camera memory?
Good quality images need space and you will end up taking many more pictures than you thought you would. Make sure you take plenty of memory cards. Most people also take portable hard-drives or laptops to give them extra storage capacity.
Invest in a tripod or monopod
Tripods can be cumbersome to lug around, but on polar expeditions you won’t be walking around for too long and will often be taking pictures from the comfort of the ship. They are a great way of preventing blurry shots from camera shake, especially when taking pictures in strong winds or in close up. Tripods are also very useful for keeping images sharp when your camera is on maximum zoom; Polar bears don’t always walk up to the ship!

Expert help
The best way of improving your photographs is to get some training. Book yourself on to a photography course (even 1 or 2 day courses can help) or join one of our photographic charters to get expert tuition while ‘
in the field
’.
