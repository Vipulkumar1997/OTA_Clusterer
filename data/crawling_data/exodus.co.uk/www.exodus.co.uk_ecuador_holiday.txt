Adventure Holidays in Ecuador

It is often the smallest countries that reveal the greatest variety. Although Ecuador is – by South American standards – a small country both in area and in population, there's a wealth of experiences on offer within its borders. On a holiday in Ecudor, there's a lot to take in, from the Andes to the Amazon Rainforest, some of the best Pacific beaches in South America and even the rich biodiversity of the
Galapagos Islands
. The Pan-American Highway, which meanders through the central part of Ecuador, is known as the Avenue of the Volcanoes, and much of the highlands are quite fertile here: the most typical view you'll see on an Ecuador holiday will be of brightly snow-capped volcanic cones jutting out above the high paramo (the high-altitude moorland unique to tropical America) and the heavily terraced and cultivated fields of the rich farmlands. It's an adventure-seekers' paradise and Exodus run a range of exciting Walking and Activity holidays here.

Highlights of Ecuador

1. The Andes:
the backbone of Ecuador is the Andean Cordillera, a continuous chain of glaciated peaks and snow-capped volcanoes which stretches for four hundred miles from Colombia in the north to Peru in the south. The country's capital, Quito, is a colonial city of around a million inhabitants nestled 2,850m up in the mountains and overlooked by Pichincha Volcano. Its lively and cosmopolitan feel is quite a contrast to the more traditional indigenous communities which dot the highlands. The varied terrain in the Ecuadorian Andes make the mountains perfect for walkers, with treks ranging form gentle day walks to the tough ascent of Cayambe. The fabled
Devil's Nose train
is a stunning ride through eye-popping scenery.

2. The Amazon Rainforest:
to the west of the Andes, the vast expanse of the Amazon Basin stretches to the border with Brazil and far beyond until it reaches the Atlantic Ocean. The rainforest is an amazing sensory overload - all at once you'll be taking in the sights of huge trees and brightly coloured birds, the sounds of insects and animals, the smells of unique flora and the perpetually damp earth.

3. The Pacific Coast:
Ecuador's little-visited coastal lowlands offer some of the best Pacific beaches in South America, as well as the down-to-earth attractions of its largest city, Guayaquil - a major port with a colourful historic section and an almost Caribbean atmosphere. Just off the coast and easily accessible from the fishing village of Puerto López, Isla la Plata is known for its variety of bird and animal life.

4. The Galapagos Islands:
Charles Darwin and countless of his successors have been enthralled by the rich biodiversity of the
Galapagos Islands.
Each of the individual volcanic islands is home to unique species of birds, plants and animals, and the marine environment is equally diverse. Although humans have lived on the Galapagos for many years, the animals do not see them as natural predators, and so any walk on the islands is guaranteed to bring you into close contact with Blue-footed Boobies, the lumbering Galápagos tortoise, marine iguanas and albatross.
