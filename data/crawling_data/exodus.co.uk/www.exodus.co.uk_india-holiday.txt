Adventure Holidays in India

Discover the exotic flavours and kaleidoscopic colours of the Indian subcontinent with our wide range of India holidays – immersive, authentic journeys deep into the heart and soul of this mesmerising country. Whether you’re a first-timer looking to visit the iconic fortresses, palaces and ghats of the north, or a return traveller hungry to experience more of what India has to offer, we’ve got your trip to India covered.

India holidays can be almost anything; cycle through Rajasthan and its treasure troves of cultural wonders, take it easy along the languid Keralan backwaters or head into jungle on a wildlife safari you’ll never forget! While holidays to India can be a daunting prospect, the rewards are huge for those who dare.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

India: a feast for the senses

India’s cities and towns are a captivating myriad of sights, sounds and smells and our India trips take it all in. Away from the frenetic cities, India has a more serene side. For those seeking a tranquil break, head south into a land of rolling tea plantations, hill stations and golden palm-thronged beaches. Those venturing north beyond Rajasthan will find themselves in a region few have even heard of, Ladakh. It’s a land of jagged sky-scraping peaks and remote villages nestled in the lush foothills of Himalayan giants.

Then there’s the astounding sunrise over the Taj Mahal – our guides know the very best spots to watch from – or the swirl of colour along the River Ganges during morning prayers. Adventure seekers might prefer to imagine themselves standing amidst the mighty Himalaya or in a 4X4 Jeep spotting your first tiger in the wild. These are the unique experiences that holidays to India offer.

But for all its natural wonders and beauty, it’s the local people that really make India holidays truly memorable. India evokes emotion like no other place, capable of making your heart sing one moment, and cry out the next. A trip to India is less of a holiday and more a voyage of discovery, once there it will grab you and leave an indelible mark on your soul.
