Marine and Wildlife






Nature reigns supreme in this extreme environment.

Marine and Wildlife

Take a voyage to the ends of the earth, on an awe-inspiring journey to the Polar regions of the Arctic or Antarctic. Here you’ll find an icy wilderness made up of the some of the most beautiful and wild scenery you could imagine, icebergs the size of housing estates, and a range of fascinating wildlife, including Polar bears, walruses, penguins, seals and whales.

Once reserved for ground-breaking pioneers and seasoned adventurers, these days you can explore the Poles in comfort on small ships crewed by committed staff with extraordinary levels of experience and a dedicated work ethic. These are the people who make the adventure of a lifetime possible.

The wildlife in each Pole is completely different. The Antarctic is colder, and there are no indigenous inhabitants. Instead there are six million (and six species) of penguins. And the Arctic is the only place in the world where you’ll find Polar bears. Unique flora and fauna has developed in each region too.
