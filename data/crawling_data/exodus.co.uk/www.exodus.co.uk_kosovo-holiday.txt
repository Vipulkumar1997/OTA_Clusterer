Adventure holidays in Kosovo

Europe’s newest country Kosovo lies at the heart of the Balkans. From the mountainous cities of Pec and Prizen to the Gadime cave in the village of Gadimlje, there is so much to discover here, and the mix of cultures is astounding. In one visit you’ll hear locals speak Albanian, Serb, Roma, Ashkalia, Bosniak and Turkish.

The country declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and while travelling the country you’ll see many memorials, and NATO still guards the 13th Century Serbian monasteries. Its turbulent history means it’s relatively undiscovered territory, and you’ll see few other tourists, yet there’s plenty of culture and natural wonders to explore. Travelling here is a real adventure, with enough to keep you coming back for more.

Highlights of Kosovo

1. Gjakovë:
the Old Bazaar here is one of the rarest and largest in the Balkans. Over 500 stalls host a variety of tailors, silversmiths, gunsmiths and other crafters selling their wares. The market was destroyed in the 1999 war but has been reconstructed since.


2. Monastery of Decani:
a beautiful 14th-century Serbian Orthodox Church where you can learn about the dichotomous views of Kosovo by both the Serbs and Albanian population who live there.

3. Prizren, Kosovo's culture capital:
Kosovo's second biggest city is rich with history and traditions and surrounded by spectacular nature. The city is famed for its gastronomy and wines, traditional handicrafts and wonderful mix of Byzantine and Ottoman architecture. Sites to see include the Kalaja (Fortress), the Sinan Pasha Mosque, the Gazi Mehmet Pasha Hammam and the outside of the 14th-century church of Our Lady of Ljevish, a UNESCO world heritage cultural site.


4. Food:
don’t leave without tasting the famous traditional Prizren dishes such as flija, shar cheese and a selection of grilled meats. Food in Kosovo is hearty and homely, fusing influences from Serbia, Albania, Turkey and Greece into one delicious pot.
