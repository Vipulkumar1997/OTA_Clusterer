Adventure Holidays in Germany

If you think of Germany and sloshing beer tankards, sauerkraut hot dogs and brutalist cities spring to mind, its time to think again. For Germany is a rich tapestry of towering mountains, aromatic pine-forests and sapphire lakes, with enough diversity to keep adventure addicts coming back for more. On a holiday in Germany you can soak up ancient culture and bask in natural beauty. Either cycle the River Danube at your own leisurely pace, explore picturesque Bavaria’s walking trails in the chocolate box village of Oberammergau, or have an exciting Winter Adventure in the snow-dusted Black Forest. Surrounded by endless woodland, punctuated with impressive alpine vistas, fairytale castles and frozen lakes, you don’t have to be here for very long to see how the area inspired some of Europe’s ancient folk stories.

In Focus: Bavaria

1. Wildlife:
walk across to the Pulvermoos, a wildlife sanctuary and habitat for 60 bird species including Corncrake, Dipper, Whinchat and Snipe.

2. Railway:
take the funicular to the top of Germany's highest mountain, the Zugspitze, which offers a 360 degree panorama of endless peaks spanning Austria, Switzerland, Italy.

3. Caves and Lakes:
head down into the Barenhohle Cave, a 20m deep pit containing bone findings of rhinos, cave lions and bears from the Neolithic to the Iron Age. For some open-water swimming head to the warm waters of Lake Staffelsee at the foothills of the Bavarian Alps.

4. Castles:
standing aloft a Neunschwanstein Castle at dawn is like something out of a fairy tale. With its breathtaking setting on a rocky outcrop, this is one of our absolute must-sees.

5. Waterfalls:
travel up the Kolben chairlift to 1270m from where there's a choice of routes up to the spectacular Sonnenberg ridge. Your route down passes a succession of crashing waterfalls and the reconstructed 19th-century whetstone mill at Schleifmuhle.
