Adventure Holidays in Guatemala

Epic trekking routes through the jungle, white-water rafting, miles of caves and countless zip-lining opportunities: adventurers are spoilt for choice on a holiday in Guatemala. With Exodus you can hike through traditional Indian villages, coffee plantations and cloud forest, walk to the lava fields of active Pacaya and to the steaming crater of Cerro Quemado. And there are more than 1,000 classified Mayan sites to explore in a Guatemala holiday. The Mayas dedicated an immense amount of time to erecting giant monuments of stone, in the form of temples, pyramids and palaces. There are also fantastic forests, a wonderful coastline and dramatic volcanoes overlooking Lake Atitlan, which the local people proudly claim as the most beautiful lake in the world.

Expert View: the Mayan World

“While getting ready for the trip, as excited as I was, I always had at the back of my mind that this was
La Ruta Maya
, and was preparing myself to get a bit “ruined out”. But I was totally wrong. Seeing these grand structures enabled me to understand and appreciate the Mayan world all the more. These archaeological sites are so much more than the centre piece pyramids seen in guide books, and each one is unique.

“
Tikal
is striking: towering pyramids loom out of a dense forest. Covered in undergrowth, it makes you realise how this site remained hidden from the world for so long. Excavation and well thought-out restoration work now gives a good balance between how the structures looked when rediscovered and how they looked when the city was still inhabited. This tour combines sightseeing with a jungle walk, giving the chance to learn about the flora and see the wildlife all around.”
