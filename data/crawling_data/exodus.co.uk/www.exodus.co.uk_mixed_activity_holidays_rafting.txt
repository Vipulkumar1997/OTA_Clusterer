White Water Rafting Holidays

Thrill seekers look no further! White water rafting is one of the most exciting things you can do on the water. It’s a fast-paced, exciting sport where a group of people paddle a large,
inflatable raft over rough or white water. Expect spray everywhere, butterflies in your stomach and a huge grin on your face.
Chances are you’ll end up soaked, so you’ll want somewhere with pure, clean water, and maybe even some sunshine in the sky. The Socha River in Slovenia is renowned for having some of the clearest and cleanest water in Europe, making it perfect for rafting. Rafting holidays are also
a great way to get up close to the scenery, like in Costa Rica where you can go rafting right through the jungle.

Difficulty Rating

White water rafting routes are all graded, with grade 1 being the lowest. All our white water rafting days include instruction before you start so no previous experience is necessary, just a positive attitude and the desire to get stuck in! You’ll need to be prepared to do your share of the paddling, but you’ll have an instructor looking out for you at all times, so fitness is more important than skill. On many of our adventures white water rafting is offered as an optional extra so you’ll be able to pick a higher grade if you have previous experience or you’d like a challenge!
