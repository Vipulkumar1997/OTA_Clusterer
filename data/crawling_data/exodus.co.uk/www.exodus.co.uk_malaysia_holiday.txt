Adventure Holidays in Malaysia

On a holiday to Malaysia you’re spoilt for choice for adventure. There are paradise beaches, deep diving waters and wildlife packed jungles, and a Malaysia holiday effortlessly combines ancient culture with hi-tech industrialisation. The country is split into two regions, Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo, home of the
orangutan
. Malaysia's infrastructure makes it easy to get around and explore the superb beaches and national parks.
Borneo
is a territory of thick tropical jungle and raging rivers, spiky jagged mountains and huge caves. It boasts an incredible diversity of all kinds of species. Endangered orangutans and thousands of other mammals, birds, reptiles and insects all live in the virgin rainforest. The best viewing of all these creatures and the incredible environment they live in is in the series of excellent marine reserves and national parks, all well managed to minimise their impact on the environment.

Highlights of Malaysia Adventures

1. See the orangutans at Sepilok Sanctuary:
Asia’s only great ape, live in the forests of Borneo. These fascinating apes have suffered a dramatic decline in numbers over recent years, chiefly due to deforestation and palm oil plantations. Sepilok is the largest sanctuary in the world and rehabilitates orphans and captured orangutans before releasing them back into the wild.

2. Climb Mount Kinabalu:
at over 4000m,
Mt Kinabalu
is the highest peak in South East Asia. A well marked trail takes you up through a number of different vegetation zones; you start of in the rainforest floor, before moving into forests of chestnut and oak.Mists swirl all around you as you enter the cloud forest, a place dripping with orchids, pitcher plants and rhododendrons, and the views at sunrise from Kinabalu are truly spectacular.

3. Discover Deer Cave:
deep in the dark mysterious forest, Deer Cave is more than a mile long and up to 700 feet high – and home to literally millions of bats. Every night there is a mass exodus of four to five million bats. As dusk descends great swarming clouds pour out of the cave on their daily forage for food. An incredible sight, great black streaks rise up from the cave like huge floating silk scarves.
