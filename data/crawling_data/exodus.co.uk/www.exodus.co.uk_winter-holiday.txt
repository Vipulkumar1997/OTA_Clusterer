Winter Holidays

Crunching through crisp snow in an untouched landscape, there’s something otherworldly and wonderful about our Winter Adventures.

Venturing along frozen rivers and following reindeer tracks through primeval forests, bunking down for the night in a hunter’s lodge or sipping tea in St Petersburg’s stately squares, on an Exodus Winter Adventure you’ll discover that skiing is just the tip of the iceberg.

Whatever activity you choose, our winter activity program will bring you closer to nature, and offers some life-changing challenges. Imagine the sense of achievement when you realise you’ve skied 15km in a day, walked on a glacier, led a team of huskies across Lapland or simply that you stayed up all night to see the awe-inspiring Northern Lights. Snowshoeing through ankle-deep powder, cross-country skiing among snow-veiled pines, or 'mushing' huskies across frozen lakes and sharing bright-eyed smiles with Sami reindeer herdsmen, these are the memories that last forever.

If you really are looking for a Winter Holiday with a difference, then you've just found it!
