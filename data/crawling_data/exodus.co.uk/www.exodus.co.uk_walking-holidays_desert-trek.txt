Desert Treks






The ever-shifting desert dunes make for incredible trekking.

Desert Trekking

Desert trekking is, for many, the ultimate adventure, synonymous with explorers and pioneers of the past. To walk in a world without paths, without permanent settlers, is liberating. Desert treks take you deep into a land of extremes, a remote yet rewarding environment unlike any other. No people, no pollution, just the sound of the wind and vast, uncompromising expanse of desert ahead.

With Exodus you can discover
Wadi Rum
, a landscape characterised by rust-red sandstone jebels and soft, undulating dunes that inspired sets of huge Hollywood blockbusters such as Lawrence of Arabia and Prometheus. Or trek the cragged canyons and secret spots of
Oman
. Either way, with 40 years of experience then Exodus can lead the way.

Top five tips for desert trekking

Sun protection:
in Jordan, the distinct red and white chequered scarf is strongly associated with heritage and the desert culture. The scarfs are handy for protecting you from sunburn, dust and sand and they are available to purchase from the local Bedouin people for around £3. Pair with high factor sun cream and SPF lip balm.

Follow footprints:
climbing up and down sand dunes can be very taxing and a good method for walking in the desert is to follow the footprints of other walkers. The compacted sand means that you do not sink as you walk and it is a more stable surface to walk on.

Wear walking boots:
it may be tempting to wear sandals in the desert, however the sand can be very hot and walking boots provide stability and grip for scrambling up sand stone mountains. A pair of short gaiters can also help with preventing sand from entering your shoes.

Drink lots:
Carry at least 1.5 litres of water with you whilst you are trekking in the desert. Water flavouring is also a great item to bring with you as a thirst quencher and to add some variety to the water you drink.

Bring layers:
Seated together around a fire in the evenings, it was much easier to eat our evening meals with a hands free torch for using our cutlery. A head-torch was also useful for any late night toilet breaks in the desert!
