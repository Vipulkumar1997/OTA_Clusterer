Guided Group Adventure Holidays

Our groups are small, normally 8-16 people, meaning our trips aren’t disruptive to the places we visit and a smaller number of guests creates a good group dynamic.

You’ll get to know a range of people from different backgrounds with a shared interest in travel. A
nd with a local expert on every adventure, you’ll get a unique insight into local life. T
hey take all the hassle out of travel arrangements, so you can enjoy the day to day, and know the stories behind the sights you'll see. Our passionate and knowledgeable guides are famous for going the extra mile to make sure your holiday is the best it can possibly be!

In focus: guided groups

“Honestly, I never thought a holiday would top the last three experiences I had with Exodus, but this one really did. I have never said "WOW" so many times in a day! There was wildlife in abundance, and landscape was breathtaking. Getting close to two cheetah brothers under a tree; being surrounded by elephants on more than one occasions and being surrounded by a herd of zebra. And it was just so well organised, with fantastic travelling companions. Everyone was really interested in wildlife, so age made no difference at all. But it was our guide Godsun who really made it special. He was really friendly, with a great sense of humour, and nothing was too much trouble for him.”
