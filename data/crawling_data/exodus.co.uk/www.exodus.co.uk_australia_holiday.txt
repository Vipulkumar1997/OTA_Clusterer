Adventure Holidays in Australia

One of the world’s great travel icons, Australia is an exciting destination for those seeking action and adventure. There’s the dusty, endless expanse of the Outback and the rainbow of life that lives around the Great Barrier Reef. There's the verdant rainforests of Daintree to the palm-fringed beaches of Cape Tribulation, and the shimmering Gold Coast. And not to forget an indigenous culture dating back 50,000 years, alongside the all-but-forgotten outback towns to shining new cities, a vibrant youth culture and world class eating and dining. Australia is vast, and yet one of the least densely populated places on Earth, with landscape so wild and varied as to include multiple climatic and time zones. To get there may be an epic journey, but it’s one that’s well worth taking.

In focus: Rainforest and Reef

The Reef: according to David Attenborough it’s one of the “most exciting natural history experiences in the world” and who are we to argue? It’s bigger than the Great Wall of China, and visible from space! Made up of over 3000 individual reef systems, it supports the most wonderful array of marine life. There are hundreds of picturesque tropical islands here – including the Whitsundays – and some of the worlds most beautiful sun-soaked, golden beaches. With Exodus you’ll spend a full day snorkelling, diving and sailing on the Great Barrier Reef.

The Rainforest: Mossman Gorge In Daintree National Park contains the oldest surviving rainforest on earth with cool streams, towering mountains and a dramatic gorge. Take it all in on the leisurely Rainforest Circuit Walk under the towering canopy of the rainforest, beautifully framed by the striking mountains and ice-cool water holes. This is a centre for eco-tourism and we stay in a secluded Rainforest Lodge, set in the quiet peacefulness of the rainforest and perfect for bird and butterfly spotting. Here you can swim with jungle perch and turtles in the untouched crystal clear Cooper Creek which winds through the lodge on its way from the mountains to the sea.

































Responsible Travel

We offer more than 500 holidays across 100 countries on all seven continents. And although we’ve grown in the last 40 years, our philosophy stays the same: to bring like-minded people together on authentic adventures, with minimal impact to the environments and cultures we visit. We only work with reputable partners, with whom we’ve built longstanding relationships, and work on various community and environmental projects around the world.
