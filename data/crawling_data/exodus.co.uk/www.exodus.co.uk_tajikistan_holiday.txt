Adventure Holidays in Tajikistan

With the Fann Mountains in the north and the Pamir Mountains in the south, Tajikistan is a land of high peaks and alpine lakes. Its Soviet heritage is visible in the cities and its history stretches back to the age of the Silk Road, the Persians and Alexander the Great. Though the main draw here is definitely in its mountains for spectacular vistas.
