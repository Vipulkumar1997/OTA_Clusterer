Adventure Holidays in Lithuania

Journey to the centre of Europe and discover the secrets of Lithuania, the southernmost country in the Baltic states. A former Soviet bloc nation lying on the border of Poland, Latvia and Belarus, the country has a rich history. This is a place of wonder, with castles, lakes and forests; vast plains parted by hills; and sand dunes along the Baltic shore. Meanwhile the towns are full of eccentric shops and bohemian galleries.

Adventurers can hike or cycle the countryside around the Curonian Lagoon or take a boat trip in Trakai National Park. Before you leave don’t forget to savour the national dish, Zeppelin, consisting of meat and potato dumplings, or fresh-off-the-line seafood washed down with a glass of local midus, a type of honey mead.

Expert view

From the seaside beach town of Palanga to the unusual UNESCO World Heritage Listed Curonian Spit sand dunes known as the ‘Lithuanian Sahara’ and the dense green forests of the Vente Cape, nature and wildlife are abundant in Lithuania.

“On a secluded island, just off the shores of tranquil Lake Galvė in Lithuania, stands the orange-hued castle of Trakai. Don’t be fooled by its quaint demeanour, though – Trakai Castle has a long history of intrigue and warfare, stretching back to the fourteenth century. After crossing the long footbridge to the castle proper, you’ll be greeted by majestic Eastern European architecture and a treasure trove of culture and history, just waiting to be discovered.”
