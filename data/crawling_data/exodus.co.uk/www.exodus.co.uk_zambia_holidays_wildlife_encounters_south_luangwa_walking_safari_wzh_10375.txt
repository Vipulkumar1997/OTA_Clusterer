Itinerary

Day
1










Depart London
















Day
2










Arrive Lusaka; fly to Mfuwe; transfer to our luxury lodge.







Following the arrival of the group flight, we connect immediately with a short internal flight to Mfuwe. On arrival we will transfer by road to Mfuwe Lodge - a journey of approximately 45 minutes on mainly good quality, tarmaced roads. The afternoon is free to relax and recover in the lodges beautiful surroundings.

Accommodation: Mfuwe Lodge or similar
Comfortable Hotel
















Days
3-7










Walking safaris and game drives in South Luangwa N.P.; time is split between two luxury bush camps.







These five days are the core days of the trip, each will consist of roughly the following itinerary, however as with all safari trips a degree of flexibility is required to accommodate for local weather and wildlife conditions and the location of our accommodation.
We start each day bright and early before sunrise with a wake-up call from the guides, and after breakfast we head out on our morning activities just as the sun peaks over the horizon. The morning activity will usually be a long bush walk where you'll learn about the native flora and fauna of the South Luangwa Valley.
The walk will usually be between three and four hours in duration, with plenty of stops to take in the beautiful surroundings. Local armed escort scouts and guides accompany all walks, as you may come across some of the parks bigger animals: it is not uncommon to see giraffe, elephant or lion. The morning walk is a good time to spot where there has been nocturnal activity; it is also at this time of day, before the heat builds up, that much of the parks wildlife is on the move.
We return to camp around 10:30 to 11:00 am at which point brunch is served. You will eat with your guides and camp manager who will be happy to discuss subjects as diverse as the local habitat or Zambian culture, or specifics about the wildlife.
After brunch there is time to relax during the heat of the day, retiring to your room to catch up on rest or to simply watch the wildlife from the comfort of the bushcamp veranda or your own room. Each camp is well situated with views over the surrounding plains, river or a local water hole. Before the afternoon walk or game drive, afternoon tea and refreshments will be served.
In the afternoon we will usually go on a game drive (sometimes a short walk instead) which will end at the perfect spot for 'sundowners' - here a small bar will be set up with plentiful drinks and snacks, and as you watch the sunset over the African bush the memories of the day’s magical moments will inevitably be discussed. Like the morning walk, which takes place before the sun gets too high, this game drive makes the most of the low light - ideal for photography - and also the cooler climate as the heat drops out of the day, again it is the perfect time to see some of the local inhabitants at their most active.
Following sunset, depending on which camp we are at, we'll either return to camp to relax around the fire with pre-dinner cocktails or take a short night game drive.
On days when we move from one camp to the next all luggage and personal belongings will be transported for you. At all camps a vehicle is available for those who would prefer a game drive.

Essential Info

Visas


Zambia





British, European, N. American, Australian and New Zealand passport holders require a visa to enter Zambia. Single entry visas are available at all ports of entry. The visa fee for British nationals is currently USD50 for a single entry visa.






Vaccinations


Zambia





There are no mandatory vaccination requirements. Recommended vaccinations are: Polio, Tetanus, Typhoid, Hepatitis A. Malaria prophylaxis is essential and we suggest that you seek advice from your GP or travel health clinic about which malaria tablets to take.






Eating and Drinking




7 breakfasts, 7 lunches and 7 dinners included.

Meals are generally buffet style and plentiful, comprising of fresh local ingredients. Vegetarians are well catered for, while most other dietary requirements can also be looked after as long as we are notified in advance.

Below is an example menu from one of the bushcamps - this is provided for demonstration purposes only.

Breakfast - selection of cereal, piping hot porridge, muffins and toast, fresh fruit and freshly brewed tea and coffee.

Brunch - buffet style with an impressive selection of salads, pasta, meat and vegetarian dishes, plus delicious deserts.

Afternoon tea - complete with freshly made cakes.

Sundowners - drinks and snacks at sunset.

Dinner - plated dinner of delectable local cuisine, often comprising soup, a traditional braai (BBQ) and freshly prepared desert.

Weather




Zambia is generally warm (if not hot) all year round with temperatures ranging between mid-20's to mid-30's centigrade.

The coolest months are between May and August; this also coincides with the main dry season. At this time of year temperatures drop considerably at night, and as such the early morning and late evening game drives can be cold.

May and early June are the early months of the dry season - where the plains are lush, and the grasses high - this is an amazing time to visit but wildlife can often be harder to spot.






Lusaka, Zambia







Is this trip for you?



You should be confident in your ability to walk on undulating ground (with no footpaths) for three to four hours, twice a day, at a slow pace.
Accommodation is some of the best and most comfortable that we use anywhere in the world. Rooms are well equipped and food is delicious and plentiful.
This is a true Premium Adventure for those after a more traditional African safari experience.

Accommodation






Lodge & Luxury Camps


























On all departures we will stay in Mfuwe Lodge for at least two nights, usually one night at the start and one night at the end. The lodge is well equipped with en suite facilities; each room has a fan, mosquito net and tea making facilities.
On the walking safari we will utilise some of the most exquisite bushcamp accommodation in all of Africa.
Kapamba
- Located on the banks of the Kapamba River, the chalets comprise 3 stone walls, with a lattice-work metal grate as the fourth wall, providing a spectacular view of the African sky at night.  Each room has a large double-sized sunken bath with excellent views of the Kapamba River where hippos wallow close by. This is a small camp, comprising of just four chalets, with a well-positioned communal area and bar.
Zungulila
- Overlooking a floodplain and the Kapamba River, the four tented chalets each have a luxurious outdoor bathtub, as well as an outdoor shower.  Each chalet also has its own veranda/deck with sunbeds, perfect for relaxing and watching the prolific game coming to graze on the floodplain. Zungulila is a charming  camp that hearkens back to a simpler time (but with all the modern amenities!). This camp also has a large communal area and well stocked bar.
Bilimungwe
- Set around three waterholes, with just four chalets constructed on raised platforms, each room has its own private viewing veranda/deck where guests can relax whilst watching the variety of birds and animals that visit daily to drink. With the main Luangwa River and an open, grazing plain also on the doorstep there is never a shortage of great game-viewing. A riverside breakfast boma is the perfect place to start your day off right!
Chindeni -
Set on the edge of a permanent lagoon, with the beautiful Chindeni Hills providing a natural backdrop, the central lounge and dining area contains multiple levels within the ebony trees and has a central firepit perfect for morning coffee or evening G & Ts, boasting excellent views of the active lagoon. The four opulent tents are privately situated along the high banks of the lagoon. These spacious canvas structures have vaulted ceilings, and are constructed on wide, wood panelled platforms with private decks, each with tempting sunbeds and beanbags in which to relax.
At the time of publication, the itineraries on each 2018 date are scheduled to be as follows.
27 Apr – 1 Night Mfuwe Lodge, 2 Nights Zungulila, 3 Nights Kapamba, 1 Night Mfuwe Lodge
08 June – 1 Night Mfuwe Lodge, 2 Nights Zungulila, 3 Nights Kapamba, 1 Night Mfuwe Lodge
28 Sep – 1 Night Mfuwe Lodge, 3 Nights Bilimungwe, 2 Nights Chindeni, 1 Night Mfuwe Lodge
12 Oct – 1 Night Mfuwe Lodge, 2 Nights Zungulila, 3 Nights Kapamba, 1 Night Mfuwe Lodge
16 Nov – 2 Night Mfuwe Lodge, 2 Nights Zungulila, 2 Nights Kapamba, 1 Night Mfuwe Lodge
Please note: each bushcamp only has room for 8 clients, with a mix of twin and double rooms; we therefore strongly recommend booking early to guarantee availability and the correct room type.
Due to the limited size of the accommodation used on this itinerary, single supplements are compulsory.

South Luangwa Walking Safari - Premium





An experience that will never be forgotten




A most wonderful holiday in all aspects. The wildlife was exceptional, with each encounter whether it was a pride of lions or a group of puku we were able to spend time watching their behaviour without being disturbed by other trucks. It was as if it was our own private park! The walking safaris were really exciting and we learn't many things about the wildlife from many signs. For anyone who is familiar with safaris in Kenya and Tanzania this trip offers a much more intimate experience




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


So many really but seeing the Wild dogs stood out for me as I have been to many parts of Africa and failed to see them. Another great moments was having sundowners amidst hundreds of Carmine bee eaters who performed beautifully for us.




What did you think of your group leader?


Stephen our group leader was outstanding in every way. His knowledge of his country and wildlife was second to none. He never failed to find us something inspirational to see. It was great to have him dine with us and share his knowledge about the days viewing.
I must say that all the staff we encountered from the Bushcamp company were exceptional and showed us great hospitality and kindness.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Stock up on sleep before you go if you can as there is so much to see and hear both during the game drives and in the camp at night. Sleep for me was limited as I found every minute exciting.
You will need few clothes as the camps offer a free laundry service. Take lots of memory for you camera and binoculars are a must, because you will find yourself trying to spot something before the guides do!




Is there anything else you would like to add?


If you love safaris then this trip is a must. I would love to return after the rains to see a whole different South Luangwa

South Luangwa Walking Safari.




This is one of the best safari holidays I have done. The excitement of seeing animals on foot surpasses any experience in a vehicle. The accommodation was fabulous and contributed to the whole interaction with the wildlife. The camps were well organised; the food was fab and the staff were all very helpful. It was a joy from start to finish.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


One afternoon as I was chilling out on my verandah and a group of elephants arrived in my garden to feed on the monkey bread pods. For about 30 minutes I stood on my bed peeking out at them feeding. They were less than ten metres away. I loved the proximity of it. I could not have moved anyway as they were right on my exit.
I also laughed at the moment on my date of departure when the man who arrived for my wake up call told me "not to leave my lodge as there were 2 lion cubs on my doorstep!"




What did you think of your group leader?


Steve was very knowledgable on all aspects of wildlife. He was well organised, courteous and responsive to our wishes. He gave us plenty time to take photographs and tried to get good positions for us to view the animals often by anticipating where the animals would move to. It is worth noting the vehicles have built in beanbags to rest your camera on so no need for tripods. Our "spotters" and the Park Guard on the walk were also excellent. They found leopard in a tree, porcupine and great views of lions. They also mixed a mean gin and tonic at sundowners!




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Pack lightly. The laundry service is free. Make sure you wear the right muted colours on the walks. Take dollars as this is the most useful currency for taxes and tips. Yellow Fever Certificates were asked for although we were low risk.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


For a mixture of adventure and luxury this was a top trip. I arrived very tired after a heavy spell of work. The outside world melts away here. Lying in a plunge pool watching wildlife whilst listening to the soundtrack of "Out of Africa" (what else!) was heaven. It is not a cheap trip but it is a quality one

SOUTH LUANGWA WALKING SAFARI




This was without a doubt THE most amazing holiday I was ever on!And I have been on quite a few.I have always maintained that the world is too big , that are too many places to see, to ever go back to the same place twice, but........ I will definitely go back here.. What an experience.From the standard of the accommodation( which is absolutely fantastic), to the quality of the food, the wildlife,it was just surreal, so good.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Every day was filled with yet another 'most' inspirational moment. **Seeing a pack of wild dogs near Bilimungwe camp**An entire herd of elephants drinking at the waterhole right  beneath my balcony on Zungulila Camp**Sundowners complete with white tablecloth, glasses and freshly made popcorn in the middle of the Kapamba River** Being so close to a lion kill that we could hear  the crunching of the bones and heard the lions breathing...** Seeing a leopard kill high up in a tree** Eating out in the middle of the bush with perfect white tablecloths, glasses and gourmet food Where do I start and where do I stop?! One moment was more amazing than the other. &nbsp;




What did you think of your group leader?


Stephen or Lee Stephen was absolutely the very best guide that I have encountered in my travels. He was like a walking encyclopaedia of Zambia. Whether is was about birds, animal tracking, plant life, astronomy ,climates. Stephen was nothing short of a genius! If there ever was a 'best guide in the world' competition, he would have my vote!&nbsp;




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Just go! This trip will change your life.By walking you are 'on the ground' and feel much more one with nature.The combination of the walks and the drives was just perfect.I cannot wait to go back.Do not take too many clothes. The laundry service is excellent, and there is no need to dress for dinner.As there is no electricity in the bush camps, no need to bring hairdryers etc.There are solar panels, so there is always hot water and lights, but no  plugs.Batteries etc will be charged by the management of the camps in their offices.&nbsp;




Is there anything else you would like to add?


I would personally rate this trip as ' leisurely'Do not be put off by the term 'walking safari'. The walking is so gentle and so slow( there is so much to see) that it is no effort at all.The combination of the walks and the drives is just perfect.It may seem obvious, but keep in mind that this holiday is all about being one with nature.Teenagers will have no nightlife, no place to go etc. But if you are a nature, wildlife lover, and if you love good food, you will feel that you have gone straight to heaven!

SOUTH LUANGWA WALKING SAFARI




This was my first trip to Southern Africa and it was AMAZING!The animals and accomodation  exceeded expectations, the camp staff  were lovely and we had a great Guide and group too.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The group tracking lion on foot with the Guide, spotter and armed Scout. It is incredible to learn how to read the landscape by looking at tracks in sand and listeing to the alarm call of mammals and birds. It's also fascinating what can be learnt from animal dung!




What did you think of your group leader?


We didn't have one but our local Guide,Steve, was fabulous - he had encyclopaedic knowledge of animals and birds!




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Ensure you have the right coloured clothing (see trip notes). It's really important when tracking on foot. Smart gear not needed. Laundry service excellent so you can take less.It's wise to padlock luggage. Beware atm machines at Mfuwe airport! Check the accuracy of the trip notes for details regarding departure taxes and take plenty of dollars to change into local currency in case of unexpected taxes or requirements for payment in a specific currency. Check arrangements regarding group leader and specifics regarding air routes.Tribal Textiles is well  worth a visit . Mfuwe will arrange transport.

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Daylight sighting of the rare Pel's Fishing Owl, looking like Garfield the catDaylight sighting of a pack of seven wolf like wild dogs on the river sandbanks near Bilimungwe Bush Camp A mid-day parade of elephants passing by as I sat in my plunge pool at Zungulila BushcampSundowners complete with a white table cloth and real glasses in the middle of the Kampamba River, cooling toes and watching a red Luangwa sunset dipping behind charcoal tree outlines &nbsp;




What did you think of your group leader?


Mechek was simply the best.   We were a keen set of bird watchers and he knew everything.  He kept us on our toes and stretched us all the time.   He was always enthusiastic and fresh, he didn't seem weary of his job in any way.  His English was subtle and well nigh perfect and he had a delightfully low key sense of humour.  We even had a light hearted quiz to test what we remembered of his ever interesting talk.   The walking safaris were particularly rich and informative, for birds and flora and fauna.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Take this trip, it will change your life.   You will marvel and be humbled by the infinite variety of nature and the majesty of the African bush.  Not to mention the luxury of the camps, the delicious meals and the impeccable and friendly service.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Have you seen a cross section of the sausage tree fruit?  The Guide will show you.Did you know that crocodile poo looks like pure white chalk.  It's because they eat the bones et al!A herd of zebra is called a dazzle.Thousands of Carmine Bee-Eaters live in holes in the sandbanks for the River Luanagwa and Kampamba,   Darting, fluttering bunches of bright pinkish red feathers  A lazy female leopard stretches out and rolls over in the headlights of the night safari jeep

South Luangwa Walking Safari - Premium





SOUTH LUANGWA WALKING SAFARI




It was an amazing trip which gave a totally different feel to the safari experience as we were able to enjoy the smaller species as well as tracks and signs. Of course we also got to enjoy the stars of the safari such as lions and leopard.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The whole trip was fascinating. Every day brought new sights and sounds to enjoy. We saw and experienced so much that it is hard to name one moment. We really enjoyed being shown how to read the footprints by our guide when we were walking. We also had some fabulous game drives where we were able to appreciate the density of the wildlife in South Luangwa. Listening to a male lion make his way towards camp between 2 and 5 am was pretty special - it sounded like he was right outside our tent.




What did you think of your group leader?


Fanuelle was brilliant. He was extremely knowledgable and vey caring. He showed a high level of respect towards the wildlife.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


No need to pack lots of clothes as the laundry service in Lodges and camps is superb.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


This trip supassed our expectations. We saw all that we wanted to and more.

SOUTH LUANGWA WALKING SAFARI




We had the most fantastic time imaginable. And 4 months later I can honestly say that there is not a day that has passed when we dont look back with fond memories.&nbsp;




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Every sunset, every sunrise. And knowing that around every corner might be a lion, leopard elephant or giraffe.




What did you think of your group leader?


James was a charming knowledgeable host perfectly able to make us all feel pampered whilst always being aware that we were in Africa, and priviledged to be there. Peter was a guide with an obvious passion for his vocation and his country. His ability to make every day a fresh and exciting adventure and to always find us something new was extraordinary.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Dont take too much with you. Bush Camp offer an excellent free laundry service and there is little need to dress for dinner as open air eating though always very enjoyable was often very dark.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Superb throughout and everyone we speak to is extremely jealous. Photos are great too!

General Flight Information












An overview of flight options
Exodus is committed to making joining our tours as easy as possible, wherever you live. We generally only block book seats from London, but this certainly does not mean that you need to fly from there. Depending on the route and airlines available, there will usually be various options available for those who want to fly from their local airport.
This page aims to provide a useful overview of the options available to our clients. However, the best flight arrangements should be tailored to your personal requirements, so please contact our Sales team for expert advice.

What kind of options do I have ?
1. We can book for you: Flights from anywhere in the world - not via London

Depending on the route, this may be direct or via an overseas hub like Amsterdam, the Middle East or elsewhere. On short haul routes there may be direct flights with low cost airlines, charter flights or scheduled airlines. Exodus can book most, but not all, of these for you. The most appropriate airline may be different to that which we use for the group flight from London, but many people now travel on different airlines and meet up with their fellow passengers at the destination.
Pros

Cons
May be the most direct route
Often the extra fare compared to the London flight is minimal.
As you will be in the hands a single airline for your entire journey, the airline will be responsible for your bags and your connections.
You may not be able to join the group transfers. However, we can usually arrange private transfers, or book your flights to try and coincide with the group transfers. See notes on
transfer arrangements
below.

2. We can book for you: Connecting flights from your local airport to London
Exodus can book connecting flights to London so you can join the group flight there. Connecting times will be followed according to airline advice, or as requested by clients. There are two types of fares we can use for this option: a 'through-fare' or a 'published fare'.

a) A 'through-fare' is where you will be in the main airline's care throughout. You change planes, but your bags are checked all the way through to your final destination.

b) A 'published fare' ticket is completely seperate from your onward ticket from London. It is usually cheaper than a through-fare but will need to be paid for and issued as soon as it is booked. This can be a problem if your tour has not yet reached minimum numbers. On 'published fares' neither airline is aware that you have connecting flights, so Exodus is responsible for timing your connection, not the airlines involved. The tickets are also usually non changeable and non refundable.
Pros

Cons
Depending on the fare type, Exodus or the airline is responsible for flight connections.
Through fare tickets can be expensive.
On a published fare, tickets must be issued immediately; tickets on published fares can be very difficult to change if onward flight times change; bags are not checked though to your final destination.
Published fares are non-refundable.

3. Booking some or all of the flights yourself
You can also book connecting air travel yourself, either to London, or all the way to the start point. There may be certain airlines or routes we don't have access to, so this is always an option. However, if you make your own travel arrangements you become liable for any delays, cancellations or missed connections, and Exodus is not required to offer refunds if you have trouble reaching the start of your trip.
Pros

Cons
You might find cheaper fares, or routes not available to Exodus.
You are responsible for any delays or missed connections, and the cost of the tour is not protected should you miss your flight be cancelled.

Notes on transfer arrangements
Sometimes it is possible to travel on a different airline to the group flight from London. Where this is the case, we need to think about ensuring you meet up with the group with minimum extra cost and hassle.
On certain trips, it is easy to arrive on a different flight and still meet the group at the hotel with time in hand. We can usually arrange private transfers (at extra cost) or offer advice on taking a taxi to the start hotel.
On other trips (especially in Europe), the transfer meets the group flight and then travels some distance to the first night's accommodation. Where this is the case, our Sales team will try to arrange flights that arrive before (and depart after) the group. However, we do have to make it clear in your final documentation that if your flights are delayed, the transfer cannot wait for you. While Exodus or our local operators will do what we can to help you reach the start point of the tour, any additional costs must be paid by the client.
