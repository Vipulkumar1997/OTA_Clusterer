A lesser-known circular trek around one of the world's highest mountains









This spectacular and fairly isolated circular trek skirts around the eighth highest mountain in the world, the formidable Mount Manaslu (8,163m). We follow the mighty Buri Gandaki River as it narrows into a spectacular gorge, passing through tiny villages perched on the valley sides. Eventually the gorge opens out into alpine meadows which are inhabited by a cluster of Tibetan communities below Manaslu's north face. Crossing the Larkya Pass (5,130m) we see the snow-capped peaks of Himalchuli, Manaslu, Cheo Himal and Himlung Himal, before descending through forest to join the main Annapurna Circuit route.

Responsible Travel










At Exodus we believe in the power of Responsible Travel.

Exodus has a longstanding relationship with our local partner in Nepal, having worked with the family business, passed from father to son, for over 30 years. We employ local leaders, guides and staff throughout and work with family-run hotels, such as the Hotel Royal Singi wherever possible.

Exodus has set up and supported many projects in Nepal over the decades, from installing solar cookers and donating smokeless stoves (a safer means of cooking, which helps prevent eye and lung problems), to supporting a tree nursery in Braga (Annapurna’s) and helping supply water and hydro-electric power to several villages.

Following the 2015 Nepal earthquake, Exodus’ emergency fundraising appeal raised over a quarter of a million pounds thanks to our loyal customers and friends. This enabled us to provide emergency relief (shelters, food and medical supplies), to rebuild homes and schools, and to run a
medical camp
in spring 2016 in the remote village of Thulopatel in partnership with volunteers from Nepal Medical College. Over 1,500 patients from rural communities were treated for a variety of ailments, to whom medical facilities are not normally readily available. Many of our previous projects (both water pipes and stoves) were damaged in the earthquake - in 2017 we started repairing and replacing these.

Exodus also worked with Health Partnership Nepal and sponsored their medical camp in Charikot in 2017 as well as sponsoring more than 400 Freedom Kits (providing sanitary wear) for women in Nepal – we will be continuing with this project in 2018.

Day
1










Depart London.







The group flights depart London this evening.
















Day
2










Arrive Kathmandu.







The group flights are scheduled to arrive in the afternoon and those travelling on them will be met and transferred to the hotel. Free arrival transfers are available for any flight, provided you have supplied Exodus with your flight details in advance and have requested a transfer. There are no planned activities today so if making your own travel arrangements you may arrive at any time - however bear in mind that tomorrow is a long drive so it's better not to arrive too late.

Upon arrival to the hotel please look out for an Exodus noticeboard with details of where and when the welcome/trek briefing will be held this evening.

Day
3










Drive to Arughat Bazaar.







After breakfast we have a long drive to Arughat Bazaar (8-10 hours). We drive out of the Kathmandu Valley and head west following the Trisuli River towards Pokhara. At Dading we turn off the main road and drive to Dading Besi, where we have lunch. After lunch the road condition deteriorates and it is a bumpy and dusty drive north to Arughat in the Buri Gandaki Valley. (Occasionally the road to Arughat is blocked so we may have to drive via Gorkha).

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
4










Trek through forest and fields to Lapu Besi.







Our route begins by following the Buri Gandaki Valley north. Today is a fairly easy walk passing several small villages and cultivated fields. There is a jeep track to Soti Khola, shortly after which the road ends. We continue to follow the Buri Gandaki through Liding and across a landslide to Lapu Besi. Although we do not gain much height today the walk can be hot, humid and dusty.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
5










Follow the Buri Gandakhi River up to Dovan.







Throughout the day the rocky trail undulates, sometimes by the river and sometimes high above the river, passing several small hamlets and farms. The valley narrows and there are some spectacular waterfalls. Passing through Khanibesi, as the trail continues to undulate, we get glimpses of the Shringi Himal ahead. We have a tea break at Machha Khola (fish river), which is a tributary running into the Buri Gandaki. Continuing up the valley, a short climb followed by a descent brings us to Khorla Besi for lunch. From here a rocky trail climbs up through the forest to Tatopani (which means 'hot water'). The water from the natural hot springs here is funnelled through a few taps in the centre of the village. Crossing the river by bridge the trail wiggles its way to Dovan, where there are a few lodges.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
6










Ascend through bamboo and rhododendron forest to Jagat and on to Philim (1,565m).







We continue heading north and after an hour we pass through Shyauli from where there are more ups and downs (some quite steep sections), until we drop to the river at Yaruphant. The trail levels out for a while and then we cross a suspension bridge after which the trail undulates to lunch at Jagat, a well-kept paved village. From Jagat the trail continues up the valley to Sirdabas, offering great views of the Shringi Himal ahead. We then drop down to the river, cross a long suspension bridge and climb steeply up to Philim.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
7










Trek through terraced hillsides to the Gurung village of Deng (1,860m).







The trail starts today by undulating spectacularly with impressive waterfalls on either side of the valley. Passing the small settlements of Chisapani and Eklabatti we descend a little and cross the river by bridge. At the bridge the trail splits, the trail on the right-hand side of the valley leads to the remote Tsum Valley. We cross to the left and continue following the Buri Gandaki, climbing up at first as the trail rounds the valley, which becomes narrower. We cross the river twice more as we undulate up the valley through forest to Phewa, and further on to the small village of Deng.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
8










Cross the river and ascend via a magnificent valley to Ghap (2,110m).







An easy day today. From Deng we descend to the river and cross by bridge. After the river our route climbs, steeply in places, up onto a spectacular trail. We pass through some small settlements as we ascend the impressive valley. We will see mani stones (prayer stones) carved into wayside rocks, a sign that we are now in a Buddhist area. We pass through the small settlements of Rana and Bihi Phedi. The trail continues ascending (sometimes steeply) but at one point descends to cross the river. We will get to Ghap by lunchtime and in the afternoon the energetic can walk up to the monastery at Prok.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
9










Continue to Lho (3,180m), offering fantastic views of Manaslu North.







Today is quite a strenuous day with a lot of ascent. The valley now becomes wider and there is extensive farmland all around where we may see the occasional look-out platform, built to ward off bears. From Ghap we cross the river three times and have a long steady climb through the forest (look out for langur monkeys), to Namrung. A short descent followed by another climb brings us to Lihi, where we will have lunch. Another descent to the river and climb brings us to Sho, after which we climb further to Lho. We are now passing through Tibetan style villages and we start to see the magnificent mountain views all around. From Lho we get our first view of Manaslu, Naike and Larkya Peak.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
10










Climb to Samagaon (3,530m).







A short but magnificent walk as we continue up the valley and gain altitude. The trail climbs out of Lho and follows the valley with great views of Manaslu ahead. The trail climbs for a couple of hours to Shyaula village, from where we are surrounded by amazing views. Manaslu is ahead and we can also see Himalchuli, Peak 29, Maike and Larkya Peaks. Soon we reach the fields and stone houses of Samagaon (3,530m), where we stay for the night. From the lodge there are magnificent views of Manaslu. We should arrive at Samagaon by lunchtime so there will be time to explore the village and visit the monastery in the afternoon.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
11










Trek to Samdo (3,860m).







The trail crosses grazing areas and gradually climbs the valley. We have fantastic views of the mountains especially Himalchuli behind us. We can also see Baudha and Ngaddi Peaks and as we reach our destination Samdo Peak rears up behind us. It’s an easy half day walk to Samdo, the last permanent settlement in the valley. This remote village is only a day's walk from the Tibetan border. In the afternoon, there will be time for an acclimatisation walk and time to explore the village. (Please note the lodges in Samdo are basic).

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
12










Ascend to Dharamsala (4,480m).







Leaving the village we cross a stream (the last time we see the Buri Gandaki) and climb steadily to the deserted Larkya Bazaar. Years ago this village thrived off trade with Tibet. Behind we can see Samdo Peak and as we climb Manaslu comes into view to our left and we can see the whole spectacular climbing route to the summit. Climbing all the time with a few steep sections, we reach a very basic lodge at Dharamsala at 4,480m, which is the last place to stay before the pass. Look out for Blue Sheep which often come down to the small stream near the lodge. In the afternoon, the energetic can climb a hill behind the lodge for even better views of the surrounding mountains.

(Please note there is only one very basic lodge at Dharamsala and most of the sleeping accommodation is in fixed tents with beds and mattresses).

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
13










Cross the Larkya La (5,130m); descend to Bimthang (3,700m).







An early start (usually in the dark). Today is a long day and if there is any snow it can take us a long time to cross the pass, especially the descent. The trail leaves Dharamsala and climbs steeply at first but then more gradually by the side of the moraine of the glacier with great views of Larkya Peak. The ascent is gradual most of the way and is fairly easy if there is no snow (if there is snow or ice it will take us longer). As dawn nears Hindu Peak glows orange with the first rays of the sun. It’s a long and rocky ascent on the moraine with some short steeper sections all the way to the top of the Larkya Pass (5,130m). The first area of prayer flags at 5,130m is the official Larkya La from where the views are outstanding - a wonderful panorama of peaks including Larkya Peak, Cheo Himal and Hindu Peak and in the distance we can see the tip of Annapurna 2. From the top there is a 10 minute almost level walk to the second summit (which is a little higher and is also marked with a few prayer flags). From here the long very steep descent starts. We need to take care as the path is steep and narrow. It is a sandy scree trail when there is no snow but if there is snow and ice we need to take care on the descent. There is a landslide which we must cross carefully. The steep part of the trail eventually eases off onto a path which takes us down to the glacial moraine. The views are superb as we descend and we can just spot Ponkar Lake, a brilliant blue glacial lake amidst the three glaciers below us. We stop for a well-deserved rest at the bottom of the steep part of the descent surrounded by immense snow-capped peaks. The descent now becomes a bit easier, but no less spectacular, as we descend the valley to Bimthang, where we stay tonight at 3,700m. If it’s clear we can just see the summit of Manaslu high above camp.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
14










Daywalk to Pongkar Lake or spare day as required.







A spare day to be used as and when required - if the weather is good and everything runs to schedule then we will spend the day exploring the area around Bimthang and resting after the pass. There is a daywalk to a beautiful glacial lake, Pongkar Lake, which we can do in the morning, then return to the lodge for lunch and have a free afternoon to rest.

If however there has been a delay earlier in the trek, the group needs more acclimatisation or rest before the pass, or if there is poor weather, your leader may decide to use the spare day earlier in the trek. This is at the leader's discretion.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
15










Spectacular walk to Tilje (2,240m).







From Bimthang we cross high pasture land and have a magnificent walk down into the valley of the Burdin Khola. The walk from Bimthang is one of the most spectacular of the trek as a wall of mountains lies behind us and in front of us. We pass the terminal moraine of the Cheo Himal and cross a small wooden bridge. Ahead we have our last magnificent views of Manaslu. We now descend into rhododendron forest and follow a trail through a narrow valley to Karche and the Soti Khola. A short climb past terraced fields brings us to the Karche La from where we will be in sight of the Marsyangdi River below. Descending through forest we come to Tilje, where we spend the night.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
16










Join the main Annapurna Circuit trail at Dharapani; on to Jagat.







From Tilje we have an easy descent, and cross two bridges to Dharapani, where we join the main Annapurna Circuit trail and the Marsyangdi River. We descend the valley to Tal for lunch. A short climb out of Tal brings us to a long descent to cross the Marsyangdi by bridge followed by a short climb to Chamje and then a last short walk along the new jeep track to Jagat.

Teahouse










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
17










Short walk to Syange; jeep to Besisahar; transfer to Kathmandu.







Leaving early we have a short 1-1.5hr walk to Syange, where we pick up local jeep or bus transport to Besisahar. Although the distance is not great, the road is quite rough and bumpy. From Besisahar we continue by private bus to Kathmandu (approx. 7hrs). We will arrive at our hotel in the evening.

Essential Info

Visas


Nepal





Most nationalities require a visa for Nepal, which can be obtained in advance or on entry. If you wish to apply before departure the current visa cost is £20 for a 15 day visa and £35 for a 30 day visa for UK passport holders. The current cost of a visa on arrival is US$25 for 15 days, US$40 for 30 days or if extending your stay $100 for 90 days. All are multiple entry. The visa on arrival fee can be paid for in cash in US Dollars, Pounds Sterling or Euros. You will also need a passport photo. Application forms are available in the immigration hall (or for electronic passports there are visa registration machines which, after inserting your passport, automatically fill out a form for you). You must firstly join the queue to pay the visa fee, and then go to the relevant immigration desk to obtain your 15, 30 or 90 day visa stamp. There can be long queues for visas on arrival.

Non UK nationals should check requirements with their nearest embassy (a few nationalities are not permitted visas on arrival).






Vaccinations


Nepal





There are no mandatory vaccination requirements. Recommended vaccinations are: Polio, Tetanus, Diphtheria, Typhoid, Hepatitis A.

There is low to no risk of malaria throughout Nepal and antimalarial tablets are not usually advised although may be considered for certain higher risk groups; you may wish to consult your GP or travel health clinic for further advice. The risk is highest in the low lying southern ‘terai’ districts bordering India.

A yellow fever certificate is only required if travelling from a country with risk of yellow fever transmission or for travellers having transited for more than 12 hours through a country with risk of transmission.

Dengue fever is a known risk in Nepal. It is a tropical viral disease spread by daytime biting mosquitoes. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available for Dengue, and therefore the best form of prevention is to avoid being bitten. We recommend you take the usual precautions to avoid mosquito bites.

Most of our trips to Nepal go to high altitudes where there is a risk of being affected by Acute Mountain Sickness. Our itineraries are designed to enable everyone to acclimatise to these altitudes, but you should be aware that it is still possible for you to be affected. Please refer to the Altitude Warning within the Trip Notes for further advice on AMS.






Eating and Drinking




Breakfast is included throughout the trip.

On trek the breakfast will be a set menu usually consisting of porridge and toast. Any additional items that are not included in the set menu should be ordered and paid for separately. We do not include lunch and dinner on trek allowing you to choose what you want to eat and when. Although most lodges have almost identical menus, they are reasonably extensive and offer a varied selection, ranging from traditional Nepalese dhal bhat to pizza and apple pie.

Although meat is available in the teahouses, we advise against eating it on trek. The meat has often been carried in the heat from lower altitudes for several days before reaching the lodges, and can cause stomach upsets or illness. Germs can also be spread by handling dirty money - we recommend using hand sanitiser.

If you buy imported food and drink whilst on trek you will spend more than the suggested amount.

Drinking Water

Staying hydrated is important when undertaking any physical activity but particularly so at altitude where it is generally recommended to drink at least 3-4 litres per person per day.

We strongly encourage you not to buy bottled water on trek as this contributes to the growing problem of plastic pollution in Nepal’s trekking areas.

All teahouses will provide cold water free of charge, if requested. Although this should not be drunk untreated, we recommend that you bring a reusable bottle with a wide opening (Nalgene or similar) with you and use a SteriPEN to treat it with. A SteriPEN is a handheld UV water purifier – small, lightweight and battery powered so easy to pack for a trek. In Nepal’s trekking regions most of the bottled water isn’t strictly ‘mineral water’ anyway but is UV treated, so it’s exactly the same technology. It’s quick to use, far more effective than purification tablets, and the water is ready immediately. It’s fine to use a SteriPEN on non-boiled water so long as it isn’t cloudy or full of sediment (which is uncommon in these regions).

SteriPENs are widely stocked on Amazon, outdoor shops and other online retailers; look for the latest models but avoid USB charging ones. Better still, a SteriPEN will pay for itself over the course of the trek and you won’t leave behind a single plastic bottle – you will end up spending the same or even less than you would on bottled water, plus you can keep it for future trips.

If you prefer not to invest in a SteriPEN, the teahouses also sell boiled water for approx. Rs150-300 per litre (the price increases the higher you trek) which should not require treating. This is also perfect for a bedtime refill as it can double up as a hot water bottle.






Weather




The main trekking season in Nepal is from October to mid-May when daytime temperatures at most altitudes are generally comfortable for walking, the sky is clear much of the time and rain and snow are occasional occurrences. Daytime temperatures will vary from 15ºC to 35ºC in the Kathmandu Valley to around 10ºC at 3600m and progressively lower the higher we go. Different seasons offer different advantages for trekking:

Post Monsoon/autumn: Mid-September to November
. This is the main trekking season in Nepal. Day temperatures in Kathmandu are approximately above 20ºC. For the first few days of the trek at the lower altitudes the temperatures can be very hot (up to 30ºC) and it can be very humid. Once you are over 2000m the temperatures are more pleasant. Skies are usually clear and days on trek are sunny and mild with clear mountain views. Nights will be colder with temperatures dropping as low as to minus 5ºC or lower at the higher altitudes.

Pre-monsoon: March to May.
Both day and night temperatures will be warmer in general but haze will often build up in the afternoons. It is very hot and humid at the start and end of the trek at the lower altitudes and temperatures rise to 30/35ºC in Kathmandu and the lower parts of the trek. Flowers bloom in this season and this is one of the reasons people chose to trek in spring.

The crossing of the Larkya La is cold at any time of year. There is sometimes a high wind over the pass which makes the crossing extremely cold and you must have adequate protection for very low temperatures for this section. There is sometimes snow and ice on the pass. You need to be prepared for this. We recommend you carry yaktrax/microspikes in case of snow on the pass.

Snow can be expected on any departure, usually at the higher altitudes above Samdo.

In any mountain area the weather is never wholly predictable and you should be prepared and equipped to deal with any differences in weather beyond the conditions described above.






Kathmandu, Nepal







Is this trip for you?



This is a Challenging grade (activity level 5) lodge-based trek with 13 days point-to-point walking and full porterage throughout - you need only carry your daypack. A description of our
activity levels
can be found on our website.

The itinerary is very well staged for acclimatisation. There are some long days at the lower altitudes and as we get higher the days are shorter to allow for acclimatisation. The maximum altitude is 5,130m, and the average is approx. 2,700m. As this trip spends considerable time at altitude, we ask you to refer to the altitude warning within the Trip Notes.

Much of this trek is on established trails and is within the capabilities of a fit and experienced walker. The first half of the trek is at low altitude with approximately five to eight hours walking a day on reasonably well-maintained trails. However, it can be very hot, dusty and humid at the lower altitudes (especially in the spring) and there are some narrow and steep sections on the trails. The crossing of the Larkya La is over rough rocky glacial moraine and some of the descent is very steep. The day over the pass is approximately eleven hours. You should be a confident walker and be comfortable walking for five to eight hours a day, with an occasional longer day. The trails in the Manaslu region are less well used than those in the Everest and Annapurna regions and are often rocky and uneven, requiring steady-footing and concentration. This area was quite badly affected by the earthquake in 2015. Many of the trails have now been repaired but there are still some landslides to cross and there may be some changes to the descriptions below.

The trail crosses numerous modern suspension bridges over rivers and valleys; all have mesh sides, however, anyone with a strong fear of heights or vertigo may find them difficult.

Walking & Trekking Fitness Training Guide

Accommodation






Hotels and teahouses


























Thirteen nights on trek are spent in lodges, one night in Dharamsala is usually a fixed tent, and there are three nights in a comfortable hotel in Kathmandu.

In Kathmandu we usually stay at the Hotel Royal Singi, located within walking distance of the Thamel district. All rooms have en suite facilities and there is a restaurant, a bar and an outdoor courtyard. There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby and login codes for the rooms are available at reception.
There is an Exodus desk in the hotel reception area and an Exodus representative will usually be available daily in the mornings and evenings.

The teahouses are basic (especially the ones in Deng, Samdo and Dharamsala) but adequate; please be realistic about what to expect in the mountains. We ask that you read our
Nepal Destination Guide
for further details about the lodge facilities. In Dharamsala we often use the fixed tents rather than the rooms as they are warmer and more comfortable. The tents are twin A-frame tents and come with foam mattresses.

The hub of the teahouse is the dining room, usually decorated with colourful traditional rugs, sometimes with a stove or heater (some lodges charge a fee to put the heater on). Most teahouses sell snacks and other essentials such as tissues, soap and toilet paper. Almost all lodges have electricity but it is not wholly reliable and lighting may not be bright enough to read by – a torch is essential. Electrical charging facilities are generally available only in the dining room (charged at approx. Rs150-350 per hour per device).
Many of the lodges use solar power so sometimes there is not enough electricity for charging. Many lodges have Wi-Fi these days – in some areas it works well but in others it is slow and temperamental.

The bedrooms are now almost all twin-share (although very occasionally during peak seasons you may be asked to sharewith three to a room for the odd night). Beds with foam mattresses, bedsheets and a pillow are provided. Bedrooms are unheated and can get cold at night so you will need to bring or hire a sleeping bag.

Most lodges have only one or two basic toilets and sometimes these are located outside the main lodge building. Toilets are usually Asian ’squat’ style; although some lodges have now installed ‘western style’ seated ones. Toilet paper is not provided so you should bring your own or buy it locally (please dispose of it in the bin provided – do not put it in the bowl). If there is not a flush handle, there should be a container of water to pour down – if it is empty (or frozen) please either refill it or ask the lodge to.

Some lodges now have hot 'showers' (charged at approx. Rs250-500 per shower). Sometimes a hot shower is simply a bucket of hot water and not a shower head.

Standards of cleanliness vary, especially in the peak trekking season and in winter when the water freezes at night. Please report any problems to your leader or the lodge and be vigilant in your personal hygiene regime – use soap or hand sanitizer gel before and after toilet breaks, snacks, meal times and after handling money.

As a general rule, the higher altitude you go to, the more basic the lodges and the more expensive food and services become.

Extra accommodation

If you would like to extend your stay, Exodus can book extra nights before or after the tour for you in Kathmandu - please enquire at the time of booking.

Single Supplements

If
you prefer your own room, we offer a single supplement for the three nights in Kathmandu only (subject to availability) - please request this at the time of booking. While in the tea-houses, single rooms cannot be guaranteed but if a single room is available that night, you can pay locally on a day by day basis.

Manaslu Lodge Circuit





Manaslu from all sides




I’m just back in Kathmandu having completed the Manaslu Lodge Circuit. 33 years ago my late wife and I trekked the Annapurna Circuit independently which was one of the loveliest experiences of our lives. So I was prepared to be very disappointed by the neighbouring Manaslu Circuit. But not one bit. The itinerary works really well - with 13 nights to get round the circuit. Starting in warmth and luxuriance and Hindu culture; moving steadily up to the colder more spacious places of Tibetan villages with the beautiful twin peaks of Manaslu and the surrounding Himal providing glorious vistas; the long hard day crossing the Larkya Pass with the unexpected revelation of the Annapurna massif in the distance; the descent through dappled forest back to the world of flowers, butterflies, monkeys and terraced fields. Just magic! More than I’d hoped for. All made even better by having Valerie Parkinson as our leader - who could tell us what it was actually like to be the first British woman to climb Manaslu (8163m) - without oxygen. I feel very spoilt. Thank you Valerie - and thank you Exodus for another well-organised, unforgettable experience.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The first proper sighting of Manaslu and the surrounding himal and the transition to Tibetan culture.




What did you think of your group leader?


See above. Inspirational and a wonderful human being.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Definitely take a Steripen (see trip notes) - such a brilliant device.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


This was my 7th trek in the Himalayas - and, with the exception of that first Annapurna trek all those years ago, this Manaslu one has been the best trek (although having three sightings of snow leopards in Ladakh a few years ago with Exodus is a close rival!).

Manaslu Lodge Circuit





Fantastic, incredibly varied off the beaten track teahouse trek




Highly recommended. By far the most varied trek I've ever done and excellent for gradual acclimatisation. Starting from around 600m, the heat (30degC) and almost tropical lowland scenery was quite unexpected and we passed some beautifully quaint Nepali villages surrounded by terraced hillsides, padi fields and banana trees. The route follows the Buri Gandaki River Valley for the first week, which at times steepens and narrows to form a spectacular gorge with cascading waterfalls. You cross some amazing high suspension bridges over the river. As you climb gradually higher the vegetation changes to bamboo thickets, rhododendron and alpine forest and eventually you get above the treeline, where yak pastures, stark hillsides and snow-capped mountains dominate. The villages and people themselves also change as you near the Tibetan border. Crossing the Larke Pass (over 5000m) is a gradual ascent on undulating moraine – the best mountain views are from the ‘second summit’ (past the prayer flags) - save enough energy for the long descent!




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


On our rest day in Bhimtang after the pass, our team of porters decided to collect firewood and host a bonfire for everyone. It was a lovely gesture and all the more special under a starlit sky - the Milky Way a clearly visible streak above us. After sharing the local millet wine (rakshi) we plucked up the courage to join in with the dancing and singing (plus keeping on moving helped us stay warm). It was lovely to see our support team or porters, guides and Tenzi (our tour leader) relaxing and enjoying themselves, having been working so hard to look after us. Music and dancing is very much part of the Nepali culture and it was great to be a part of it. Two of our porters were students and spoke some English - they challenged us to sing a song for them in return...we agreed we would but on the last night. We adapted the lyrics of a song to have one verse about each of our guides - it went down a treat at the time but I think we're all hoping there's no video evidence!




What did you think of your group leader?


Tenzi Sherpa, also known as 'The laughing Sherpa' or 'Haha Tenzi' (owing to his distinctive and incredibly infectious laugh and gleaming white ear to ear smile), was a fantastic leader - I would request him next time. Attentive and safety conscious at all times, very well organised and managed the different walking paces within our group as well as possible. He was quietly knowledgeable if you asked him about something but without overloading you with information.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


You will experience a huge range of temperatures on this trek as you climb from 600m to over 5000m - bring lightweight layers for the lowlands and high SPF sunscreen and lip balm as well as a warm fleece/down jacket for higher up. Bring mosquito repellent for the lowlands too. There are some very narrow trails and numerous high suspension bridges so I wouldn't consider this if you have a fear of height/vertigo. Not all of the lodges have electrical charging facilities so bring a power bank or solar charger / use lithium batteries if possible as these last longer in the cold. Bring lots of wet wipes - it's not practical to have a proper wash every night or when it's very cold. Travel games/cards are good for the evenings. Ear plugs are useful in the teahouses as the walls are very thin.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


There have only been teahouses in the Manaslu region for a few years and many are still very basic (especially at Deng, Samdo and Dharamsala), although that said, there are also some nicer ones dotted along the way which seem like relative luxury (i.e. hot showers, or occasionally WiFi). Some rooms are simply small box rooms with plyboard walls and ceilings with two beds - that's it. Every room had clean bedsheets and pillows. There are only one or two lodges in each village (although more are being built) so there is little/no choice in where to stay and although the trails are quiet compared to the main Annapurna and Everest regions, the lodges can be busy simply because there are so few of them.

Manaslu ciruit




a fantastic trek in a remote, beautiful part of Nepal. the Northern part of the trek is very close to the Tibetan boarder and hence has a very Tibetan feel, which is interesting and quite different from the more Southerly, Nepalese villages, people & animals.
not to be underestimated. high altitude, although very good acclimatisation (& I took Diamox)
and basic accommodation - very basic as you get more remote, nearer to the pass.
the first and last parts of the trek are well worth it in their own right. fantastic landscape & people. very Autumnal when we were there in November; very fertile & well populated. a marked contrast with the wilder, more remote areas further North.
a very well organised, well balanced trek. far better than Annapurna sanctuary for example, which has become over popularised.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


every day brought something new & inspiring




What did you think of your group leader?


excellent leader & trek staff
we were well looked after & I felt very confident in the leader's experience & abilities
a better standard of English would add to the trip. being able to ask questions about the area & it's people has added to previous treks but otherwise excellent




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


do it!! go, now, whilst it's still relatively unknown & unspoilt
but you do need to be aware of the altitude and be prepared to rough it around the pass days. no technical difficulty to speak of. a trek for experienced mountain walkers upwards

Manaslu Lodge Circuit





MANASLU CIRCUIT




This was to be my third trip to the Himalayas, the last being the Annapurna Circuit in 2006 (before road building started on the circuit).  I was looking for something different this time, a remote camping based trek off the beaten track and away from the relatively crowded paths and overstretched teahouses of Annapurna and Everest Base Camp.  Manalsu more than met my expectations.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


There were too many to recall! Those that spring to mind include:The nerve wreking bus trip over mountainous tracks to Arughat BazarWalking between rice paddies on beautiful sunny and warm mornings on the lower reaches of the Budni Gandaki Nadi river valley; the exotic sights and smells of the local farming communitiesReaching Jagat, the first truely Tibetan village we were to meet on a cold windswept evening after walking with goat herds on a narrow track in a steep sided river gorgeEarly on a sunny morning, the first glimpse of the snow covered Manaslu peak breaking above the clouds from the campsite above the monastory in LhogaonBreakfast in the sunshine after a bitterly cold night in Samdo seeing the footprints of our tents in the snow as they were being packed away and watching the yak herds being driven out to the early spring pastures.Trekking up to Larke Phedi in the bright sunshine between snow covered peaks towering above as far as the eye could see; enroute sighting the rare and protected &quot;blue sheep&quot; high above our path Reaching the prayer flags at Larke La after trekking for six hours up snow and ice covered scree and then facing the steep descent in a full-on blizzard; arriving in Bimtang to a hot bowl of noodle soup six hours later.Sheltering from the blizzard and huddled around a juniper fire with Pasang and his sherpas after dinner in one of the few small stone-built tea houses in Bimtang; awaking to a snow covered campsite on the following sundrenched morning.Walking down through the snow covered conifer forests towards Karche on a sunny morning under the ever present Manaslu towering above with occasional views of early flowering rhododendrums.Washing under village hose pipes or the occasional waterfall when the opportunity arose; the waterfall at Tal was very memorable although very cold!The amazing sights of the destructive force of nature in the two main river valleys; the Budni Gandaki in the east and the Marsyangdi in the west; very deep, steep sided and scoured gorges, recent landslips hundreds of meters high and wide and the massive amounts of natural debris including whole trees and huge rocks stranded in the river beds.  The constant noise of rushing water.Cooking was inspirational and every meal was greatly anticipated and appreciated: lids were whipped off aluminium pots from which emerged an amazing choice of well prepared and tasty food including porridge, omlettes, home-made bread, various hot and spicy soups, yak stew and curried yak, tuna, fried spam, lentels, greens, cauliflower (the best we had ever tasted), dumplings, pancakes, curried potatotes and chips, cinnamon cake...........the list goes on.The evening at the last campsite in Bhulbhule where we all realised how lucky we were to have been in the company of Pasang and his team of sherpas, cooks and porters for such a challenging and magic sixteen days.  The mutual support and enjoyment of my four trekking companions where very fortunately we all appreciated and undertook the trek in the same spirit.




What did you think of your group leader?


Pasang, a very experienced trekker and mountaineer was a truely gifted leader.  Apparantly Manaslu, unlike Annapurna to the west is known for having unstable and unpredictable weather.  On the days leading up to crossing the pass, the weather started to deteriorate as the wind picked up and although we had many sunny mornings, the cloud brought snow flurries at dusk. Pasang correctly assessed the weather and the ability of our small trekking group and decided to dispense with the normal rest day at Samdo and keep heading for the pass in order not to be caught by the impending bad weather.  The crossing was very arduous taking twelve hours instead of the normal eight or nine caused chielfly by recently fallen snow and ice underfoot.  It was only when we got to Bimtang that we realised how well Pasang had read the weather conditions, assessed our team and lead us safely with a minimum of fuss over the pass.  In 10 years of crossing Larke La, these were the worst conditions he had encountered; the pass was virtually closed to all except for a couple of mountaineering groups for the best part of a week afterwards.  He constantly and quietly encouraged our group and his own team through long and tough days with great humour, anecdotes and authority always ensuring we were comfortable, not over-stretched, well rested and most importantly well fed. I think we were very lucky to have him as our guide.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


When it comes to what equipment you should take, you should follow the Exodus advice closely.  For example two of our group did not have the recommended trekking pole arrangements and I think they may suffered for it.I did not bring a spare memory card or battery for my camera thinking I would be OK; I wasn't so as a result I was unable to take photos on the last four days of the trek. I now understand that extreme cold drains older batteries down quite quickly. Exodus arranges occasional evening meetings in London where a famous wildlife photographer gives great advice and tips for amateurs like myself.  Sadly I didn't go (not knowing about it) but two of my fellow trekkers went and greatly benefitted.If you are travelling on our own, you might consider going &quot;solo&quot;, i.e. having your own tent.  Luckily I was the odd man out and had a tent to myself.  Being somewhat awkward in confined spaces and valuing my own privacy, I don't think I could have managed sharing a tent with anybody else for sixteen days.  Follow the Exodus advice for getting fit and preparing for this challenging trek if you want to get the maximum pleasure from it.  I am in my sixties and knew before going that I was older than my four travelling companions and didn't want to let anybody down so I made an extra effort to get fit (it helps when you are retired!) and it paid off.If you are in any way interested, it might be wortwhile before you travel reading up on the various cultural groups you will encounter enroute and the flora, fauna and geology of the Himalayas; it certainly adds to the enjoyment of the trek.  Also bring a small pair of binoculars (fortunately we had a pair between us).




Is there anything else you would like to add?


This was a truely rewarding experience for our small group of five trekkers.  Having stayed in teahouese on my two previous occasions in Nepal, camping for me is now the preferred way to go if at all possible.  We had a great Exodus team including our leader, two sherpas, a cook and four kitchen helpers and seven porters.  These guys made our trip memorable in way that a teahouse trip could not.  You soon get into the daily rhythm and routine of a camping trek, what is expected of you and what you expect of the others, both your co-trekkers and the Exodus team. The success of a trek depends on this mutality which I had not fully appreciated at the outset; Pasang's great skill was to ensure this mutality.

Manaslu Lodge Circuit





Manaslu Circuit Camping




A great introduction to trekking in Nepal without the crowds on the Annapurna circuit. The Manaslu Circuit is certainly the path less well traveled - and by all accounts almost as dramatic as the Annapurna circuit, but as the circuit only opened up to trekkers a few years ago - there are virtually no lodges, so you get to enjoy camping every night!




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The views of the glaciers as we got up to the northern part of the circuit were dramatic, along with the occassional crack as we heard chunks of ice breaking off. The views of the mountains along this part of the circuit were also fantastic, and made up for the few days we spent trekking through the valleys on the way up. Crossing the pass was also a key point to the trip - and it was good that the descent was fairly rapid - taking a lot less time than the climb up. I enjoyed the fact that most of the time we had the trail to ourselves - which isn't the case on the Annapurna circuit these days.




What did you think of your group leader?


Our leader was great fun - with a good sense of humour, and did a good job of communicating, getting us moving, trekking, and fed (almost over fed).




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Don't worry about the food - on this trip you get to travel with your own kitchen staff (including an egg man - there were plenty of eggs) - and they work hard to prepare wholesome food. We had some Dhal Bhat - but most of the food was more varied (and certainly more interesting). There was always more than enough - so don't worry about going hungry!A good hiking pole is recommended and can be purchased from Kathmandu before the trip if you don't have one in your luggage (although the big-brands can be hard to find). I'd also suggest taking something like the Kahtoola MICROspikes just in case the route down from the pass is icy (although I didn't need mine). Being walking-fit before the trip will make your trip more enjoyable, however we did start-off pretty slowly - so don't expect a challenging walk from day one. The most challenging section was the cold as we left early to get to the pass, and the LONG descent after the pass itself. The descent was somewhat slippy due to gravel/scree on the path - so hiking poles were useful.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


The worst bit was the coach travel into the start point with a long &amp;  bumpy coach ride; however this unavoidable (unless the trip were extended with another week's walking). If you're tall - don't sit at the back of the bus.Take a look at my travel photos and a longer description of the trip on my website:-http://andy.bryant.name/blog/2011/1/23/manaslu-circuit-nepal.html

An overview of flight options
Exodus is committed to making joining our tours as easy as possible, wherever you live. We generally only block book seats from London, but this certainly does not mean that you need to fly from there. Depending on the route and airlines available, there will usually be various options available for those who want to fly from their local airport.
This page aims to provide a useful overview of the options available to our clients. However, the best flight arrangements should be tailored to your personal requirements, so please contact our Sales team for expert advice.

What kind of options do I have ?
1. We can book for you: Flights from anywhere in the world - not via London

Depending on the route, this may be direct or via an overseas hub like Amsterdam, the Middle East or elsewhere. On short haul routes there may be direct flights with low cost airlines, charter flights or scheduled airlines. Exodus can book most, but not all, of these for you. The most appropriate airline may be different to that which we use for the group flight from London, but many people now travel on different airlines and meet up with their fellow passengers at the destination.
Pros

Cons
May be the most direct route
Often the extra fare compared to the London flight is minimal.
As you will be in the hands a single airline for your entire journey, the airline will be responsible for your bags and your connections.
You may not be able to join the group transfers. However, we can usually arrange private transfers, or book your flights to try and coincide with the group transfers. See notes on
transfer arrangements
below.

2. We can book for you: Connecting flights from your local airport to London
Exodus can book connecting flights to London so you can join the group flight there. Connecting times will be followed according to airline advice, or as requested by clients. There are two types of fares we can use for this option: a 'through-fare' or a 'published fare'.

a) A 'through-fare' is where you will be in the main airline's care throughout. You change planes, but your bags are checked all the way through to your final destination.

b) A 'published fare' ticket is completely seperate from your onward ticket from London. It is usually cheaper than a through-fare but will need to be paid for and issued as soon as it is booked. This can be a problem if your tour has not yet reached minimum numbers. On 'published fares' neither airline is aware that you have connecting flights, so Exodus is responsible for timing your connection, not the airlines involved. The tickets are also usually non changeable and non refundable.
Pros

Cons
Depending on the fare type, Exodus or the airline is responsible for flight connections.
Through fare tickets can be expensive.
On a published fare, tickets must be issued immediately; tickets on published fares can be very difficult to change if onward flight times change; bags are not checked though to your final destination.
Published fares are non-refundable.

3. Booking some or all of the flights yourself
You can also book connecting air travel yourself, either to London, or all the way to the start point. There may be certain airlines or routes we don't have access to, so this is always an option. However, if you make your own travel arrangements you become liable for any delays, cancellations or missed connections, and Exodus is not required to offer refunds if you have trouble reaching the start of your trip.
Pros

Cons
You might find cheaper fares, or routes not available to Exodus.
You are responsible for any delays or missed connections, and the cost of the tour is not protected should you miss your flight be cancelled.

Notes on transfer arrangements
Sometimes it is possible to travel on a different airline to the group flight from London. Where this is the case, we need to think about ensuring you meet up with the group with minimum extra cost and hassle.
On certain trips, it is easy to arrive on a different flight and still meet the group at the hotel with time in hand. We can usually arrange private transfers (at extra cost) or offer advice on taking a taxi to the start hotel.
On other trips (especially in Europe), the transfer meets the group flight and then travels some distance to the first night's accommodation. Where this is the case, our Sales team will try to arrange flights that arrive before (and depart after) the group. However, we do have to make it clear in your final documentation that if your flights are delayed, the transfer cannot wait for you. While Exodus or our local operators will do what we can to help you reach the start point of the tour, any additional costs must be paid by the client.
