Adventure Holidays in Norway

This is wild country: whether you prefer a summer holiday to Norway for the emerald and jade shimmer of the world-famous fjords; or begin your Norway holiday in winter to cross-country ski across this pristine snow-covered Eden, or even venture far north into the clutches of the unforgiving and unimaginably beautiful Arctic, a trip to Norway is about the landscape. Indeed, their national anthem says it all:

"Rising storm-scarr'd from the ocean,
Where the breakers foam…"

With less than 5 million inhabitants, Norway is very sparsely populated, leaving huge stretches of wild, frozen scenery ready to be explored. This is the birthplace of skiing, and to glide across the frozen lakes, ancient forests and secluded valleys borders on a rite of passage for all snow devotees. For a slightly less tranquil winter, adrenalin seekers can hurtle down the Olympic Bobsled track at Lillehammer.

In focus: summer holidays in Norwary

Summer sees the snows melt, and for walkers, this frees up the world famous fjords for world-class hiking – head up the quiet yet no less dramatic Lustrafjord to escape the huge cruise liners and have the views to yourself.
Walking the Fjords
is based in the nearby Nes Gard Lodge, a short hike from Feigumfoss waterfall and a stone’s throw away from Urnes Stave church, the oldest church in Norway, and one of the most beautiful. UNESCO listed, it is built almost entirely of wood, and intricately carved with arched gables and entwined vine reliefs. You'll also see the Jostedalsbreen ice cap both on foot and by boat, from the backdrop of the Jostedalsbreen National Park and then from the waters of a glacial lake.

Naeroyfjord is the narrowest of the fjords – only 250m between the dramatic escarpments at its thinnest point. This UNESCO World Heritage Site takes its name from ‘Njord’, the Norse god of the sea. Nowhere else does the infinite power of the gods seem more appropriate; the sheer walls of the fjords impose more than as you creep between the towering rocks. This is a mythic landscape, one where folkloric fantasies ignite the imagination. The Jostedalsbreen –
the Biggest
The largest glacier in continental Europe, the Jostedalsbreen ice cap is a staggering 50 miles long and up to 600m at the thickest point.
