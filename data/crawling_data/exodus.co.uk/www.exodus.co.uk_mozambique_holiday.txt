Adventure Holidays in Mozambique

Untamed, unspoilt, and with 1500 miles of rugged coastline to explore, a holiday to Mozambique has much to offer. Its fantastic beaches have been a well-kept secret for some time now, and the country is beginning to get a reputation for adventure travel too, as scars from its war-torn past heal.

The fence of South Africa's great Kruger National Park has been now been taken down, and animals roam freely across the border. Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park is an insider’s tip for an off-the-beaten-track safari. But while Africa is far from unusual for a wildlife holiday, an ocean safari in Mozambique is off many people’s radar. From encounters with dolphins, colossal whale sharks, five of the world’s seven species of sea turtle, graceful Manta rays and the largest dugong population in the region, this is a marine odyssey guaranteed to amaze.

In focus: the Bazaruto Archipelago

Famed for its coral reefs, offers clear, turquoise waters filled with iridescent fish, and tranquil beaches to relax and watch the unforgettable, majestic African sunset. Spending time here makes you feel closer to nature than ever before.

“Set sail on the azure waters of the Indian Ocean aboard a traditional dhow boat and explore before settling into your beach camp for the evening. Snorkelling around the colourful coral reefs laced between the six small islands offers the chance to see a kaleidoscopic array of life, from dainty Butterfly Fish and Moorish Idols to petrol blue Parrot Fish and turtles. After the day’s aquatic activity, head to the idyllic shoreline where your torch-lit beach camp awaits. Sit around the fire to watch the sun set, admire the star-studded sky and fall asleep listening to gentle lapping waves… heaven on Earth? It just might be!”
