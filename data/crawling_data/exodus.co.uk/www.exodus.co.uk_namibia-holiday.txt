Adventure Holidays in Namibia

Here lies the finest desert wilderness on the planet. Four times the size of England yet with only 1.6 million people, Namibia trips combine much of what we think of as Africa. Whether it's the massive sand monoliths of Sesriem, the extraordinary rock formations of Damaraland or the otherworldly Skeleton Coast, a holiday to Namibia is a dream for those in search of wilderness and adventure.

It is not all desert though; on a Namibia holiday you'll find the is the coastal resort of Swakopmund – now vying with Victoria Falls and Cape Town as the adventure capital of Africa – with quad biking, sand boarding, parachuting, shark fishing, scenic flights and balloon trips. Etosha National Park is the third largest in Africa, centred on a huge salt pan. It’s one of the best places to watch wildlife in Southern Africa, with big cats, elephants and black rhinos. Plus you can see desert-adapted elephants and lions in Damaraland.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

Expert insight: a Tailormade Adventure to Namibia

Exodus MD Pete Burrell and his wife Clare took their teenage children Anna, Alex and Rachael on a Tailormade Adventure to Namibia – an experience they’ll remember as the adventure holiday of a lifetime.

“I have a love of the world’s wild places and have long wanted to visit the wide open spaces of Namibia. The allure of campfires, wildlife watching, sand dunes and a hot smoky braise – that’s a BBQ to you and me – was too strong to resist. We went tailormade to make sure we ticked everything on our list: exploring the highest dunes in the world, meeting and understanding how the local people live, lots of wildlife, and spotting shipwrecks on the spooky Skeleton Coast. But there were still surprises in store - discovering ancient rock carvings of penguins in the middle of the desert, the birding knowledge of the local guide on our walking safari, or the magical afternoon we spent on quad bikes across endless plains full of oryx, the finale of which was watching the sun set on the red rock mountains. One night I’ll never forget was in Etosha National Park, where we sat around a watering hole watching giraffes stoop to drink whilst we dined on the biggest steaks we’ve ever seen and a local band played African music nearby.”
