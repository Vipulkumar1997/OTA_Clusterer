Adventure Holidays in Peru

Venture to the land of the sun on a trip to Peru and you’ll be richly rewarded with world-class trekking, mysterious ruins, vast natural wonders, a majestic rainforest, seemingly-magical floating islands, and mind boggling ancient riddles… for Peru is a country that’s only just beginning to offer up its secrets. Once home to the sun-worshipping Inca civilisation, bought to its knees by gold hungry Europeans, the glorious mountaintop citadel of Machu Picchu was only uncovered in the last century.

On a Peru trip with Exodus, there are a wide range of adventure and activities. Aside from some of the world’s best trekking, there’s rafting, zip wires and bike trails, all yours for the taking. A backdrop of the wildest imaginable landscapes, from frozen peaks peeping through clouds to the deepest rainforest – where you can sleep in a riverside jungle lodge – is home to a wonderful selection of wildlife.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

Must-Do Peruvian Adventures

1. Tackle the Inca Trail:
trekking the Inca Trail will leave you gasping with astonishment. Pass through Inca ruins and exotic cloud forests as you walk the worn Inca pathways to the glorious citadel of Machu Picchu.

2. Marvel at Machu Picchu:
a mysterious lost city hidden for hundreds of years above the clouds, the view stretching from Machu Picchu across the Andean mountains is perhaps the most famous in all the world.

3. Island hop on Lake Titicaca:
clear azure blue waters are punctuated by ancient manmade floating islands, where indigenous communities with centuries-old customs await.

4. Gaze over Colca Canyon:
a 100-km long, 3000-metre deep canyon surrounded be volcanoes with snow peaked mountains in the distance. It’s home to decoratively adorned Quecha women, traditional Peruvian villages, and families of condors cruising on thermals above.

5. Solve the mystery of the Nazca Lines:
super-sized neoglyphs of animals, abstract symbols and geometric shapes etched into the desert, the Nazca Lines are spread across an astounding 500 sq km, and only visible from the sky.
