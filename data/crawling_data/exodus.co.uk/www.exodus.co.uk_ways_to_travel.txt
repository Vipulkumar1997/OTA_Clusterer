Your adventure, your way

We are the experts in small Guided Group Holidays, and our leaders are carefully chosen to help you uncover the real nature of a destination. After all, that’s how we began over 40 years ago. But our adventures are for everyone, no matter how you want to travel. We have a selection of Self-Guided Adventures, and offer new Tailormade service, which are totally bespoke and give you complete flexibility.
Just as no two people are the same, no two holidays need to be either. With so much of the world to explore and so many things to consider, the variety of travel and activity options we offer will ensure that your holiday is just as unique as you are. Because for us, it’s personal…

In identifying the right holiday style for you, consider how you want to travel, and who with. In a group of like-minded travellers, independently, or in your own private group with friends or family. And if you don't see exactly what you want,
let us know and we can help! See our
Tailormade Adventures
page for more information.

Guided Group Adventure Holidays

Our groups are small, normally 8-16 people, meaning our trips aren’t disruptive to the places we visit and a smaller number of guests creates a good group dynamic.
