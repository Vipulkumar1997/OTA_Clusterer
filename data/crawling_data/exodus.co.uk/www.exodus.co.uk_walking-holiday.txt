Walking & Trekking Holidays

Walking. Sometimes it’s the only way to see the world. Come within a hair’s breadth of an orang-utan on a rainforest trail or challenge yourself with a trek through clouds to a volcanic crater. Meander through Bhutan’s lush meadows, or climb down craggy cliffs to a Sardinian beach cove. Even tackle some of the world's highest peaks. Our range of Guided and Self-Guided Holidays lets you take it all in, at your own pace.

Walking and trekking is in our DNA. With humble beginnings over 40 years ago when we took some of the first group treks through the Nepalese Himalaya, we now offer the best range of walking holidays worldwide. Our trekking leaders are some of the most experienced trekkers on the planet today, and long-running relationships with our local partners in each country ensure we are always giving back to the communities we visit. We use local leaders where possible, stay in locally-owned accommodation and pay some of the highest wages on big peaks like Kilimanjaro.
