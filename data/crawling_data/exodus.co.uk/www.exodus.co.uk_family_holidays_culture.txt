Cultural Family Holidays

At Exodus we believe that Family Adventures should be more than just lying on a beach. There are so many fascinating places, cultures and experiences out there which can provide kids (and parents!) with an appreciation of the world around them and encourage them to discover more for themselves. Most importantly though, we know that family holidays should be about fun! Our passionate and knowledgable local leaders know the stories behind the sights we see, and are always on hand with a plan B, when kids need an ice-cream or swim...

Leader in the Spotlight

"China has a long history, that can be confusing. But I share stories about my friends, my family and ancestors. I can't speak for the whole country, but I can tell them about my people and the people I know, and what they think about certain things. I say to children, 'This is what we did in school; this is how we lived; this is what we ate.' And I tell them about my parents’ generation too, which puts the history into context. With the itinerary I always have a plan B – a swimming pool nearby if it’s too hot, an ice cream parlour – and I can juggle round plans if the kids just want to chill out. Even when they start the trip nervous, you see them blossom: in the Temple of Heavens park they are the first to mingle with the local people. They’re little superstars!"
