Adventure Holidays in Vietnam

Vietnam holidays are made up of kaleidoscopic images: neon-hued cities, lush paddy fields, vast stretches of undisturbed white sandy beaches, and dramatic seascapes. Located in the South China Sea, Vietnam stretches almost 1,500 miles from the Mekong Delta to the highlands bordering China, and covers a wide range of climates, countryside and ethnic groups. Its history is punctuated by the Vietnam War, Ho Chi Minh and the French occupation.

Holidays in Vietnam are as diverse and exciting as the country itself. Whether you’d prefer to cycle long, winding roads through tea plantations which drape themselves over mountainsides; paddle through the still waters of Ha Long Bay; explore the tree lined boulevards of the capital Hanoi – ducking and diving into backstreets, trying some of their world-famous street food along the way – or immerse yourself in the frenetic pace of Saigon: Vietnam trips have an impossible energy.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

Insider guide…

Our local leaders are passionate about the places they visit, and their knowledge gives guests unique insight that is impossible to get elsewhere. Cong Nguyen has been leading tours nine his home country for 10 years. Here’s his insider guide to Vietnam:

"My favourite food is green mango salad. People normally eat them sweet and ripe, but in Vietnam we pick them green to make a savoury salad. And there’s beautifully fresh seafood – I show my group how to steam fish in banana leaves. The Hanoi water-puppet show is very colourful with lions, dragons, unicorns, live music and folk songs. It was traditional entertainment for villagers when the rice flooded. The stories are acted out using a pool of water as the stage. Fantastic silk is made here, so you can find beautiful scarves to buy. Or you can bring an item or picture to copy, you can get clothes tailor-made in Hoi An."


















A great trip overall, which I would recommend. The itinerary was good, the hotels (with 1...
