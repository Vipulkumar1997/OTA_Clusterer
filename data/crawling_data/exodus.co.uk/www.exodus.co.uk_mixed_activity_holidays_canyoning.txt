Canyoning Holidays

Canyoning is the act of getting from one end of a beautiful canyon or gorge to another – by any means necessary! Expect to be jumping off ledges into deep, clear pools, scrambling over rocks, tumblin
g into the water, slithering and sliding down chutes pummelled smooth by water erosion, wading through knee deep water and swimming with the current. Canyoning is one of the most fun, exhilarating ways to spend a day in the mountains.

Where should I go?

The emphasis with canyoning is always the mountains. It’s an adventurous, unusual way to see the beauty and magnificence of the environment. It will test your mettle, but it’s focused on having fun rather than an arduous physical challenge. Canyoning with Exodus requires no previous experience, just a willingness to give it a go! All you really need for canyoning is a spectacular canyon or gorge – generally steep-sided, dramatic and beautiful – with a river rushing through. There are many locations worldwide, but we choose destinations with warm, sunny climates to keep your temperature up whilst you enjoy the water! Mediterranean sunshine in places like Turkey and Slovenia makes all the difference in running water.
Exodus will ensure you’re kitted out in the right gear – wet suit, helmet, sticky soled shoes – and our experienced leaders will make sure you are safe and looked after throughout, so you can focus on having fun and leave the rest to them. Get ready to take the plunge!
