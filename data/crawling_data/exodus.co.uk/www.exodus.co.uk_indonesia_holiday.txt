Adventure Holidays in Indonesia

Indonesia is located on a hotspot of tectonic activity in the Pacific Ocean, with 129 resulting volcanoes, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire. Travel to the lush islands of Java and Lombok – where you’ll summit Mount Rinjani –

seeing spectacular sunrises, ancient temples and wandering through local villages along the way. On a holiday to Indonesia, you'll also explore it's fascinating customs and culture.
With a population of around 238 million people, it is the world's fourth most populous country, and across its many islands, Indonesia consists of distinct ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups. There are also white palm-fringed beaches, verdant rainforests, exotic wildlife, incluging orang-utans, and a certain sense of zen. On an Indonesia trip you'll come across impressive Hindu temples, stunning rice terraces – the result of more than 2000 years of cultural exchange between India and Southeast Asia – and Borobudur, the largest Buddhist temple in the world.

Expert opinion: Bromo Volcano


This explosive volcano in East Java is the active cone inside the giant Tengger caldera, one of East Java’s most jaw-dropping destinations, an absolute must-see on your holiday to Indonesia.

“
There are sunrise views and then there’s watching the sun rise over Mount Bromo. As the day breaks the otherworldly peaks of Mount Bromo and Batok rise from the crater floor with Mount Senaru in the background, often reaching out from a sea of clouds with plumes of smoke drifting towards the brightening sky. The brutality of active volcanoes intertwined with the serenity of the rising sun is truly awe-inspiring.”
