Adventure Holidays in Oceania

From the snowy peaks and glaciers of New Zealand, the rainforest and red deserts of Australia, to the lush jungles of Papua New Guinea, taking in lost lagoons, pristine beaches, along the way.

A holiday to Oceana is pure adevnture. Oceania is named after the ocean, for most of its landmass is under the Pacific, and is made up of thousands of islands scattered across the Central and South Pacific.

Here lie some of the last unexplored regions of the world, along with otherworldly stories of cannibals, magic plants and mystical beasts, jaw-dropping scenery, spectacular mountains, birds of resplendent plumage and so much more. It might be on the other side of the world, but it’s a journey well worth taking…

Top Oceania experiences:

We offer a range of walking, trekking and cultural Oceania holidays, and will be adding even more soon.

Adventure:
Visit an active volcano at New Zealand’s
Tongariro World Heritage Are
a, and hike through a moon-like valley of contorted lava flows and ash fields before climbing up the last steep section to the Emerald Lakes. The scarlet moonscape is dotted with turquoise and blue-green crater lakes, adding surreal colours to the landscape.

Watersports:
Kayak in New Zealand’s majestic fjords; embark on a sailing adventure around the Whitsunday Islands; or spend a full day exploring the Great Barrier Reef,
snorkelling over a great underwater spectacle.
It’s up to you…

Camp:
In Fiordland National Park stay the eclectic historic cabins at the 'Hollyford Valley Camp’. The huge glacial lakes of Te Anau and Manapouri are the border of Fiordland
’
s dramatic inland coast. The area is dominated by water, either in the form of lakes, ocean fiords or as falling rain – which has enabled the establishment of temperate rainforest.

Reef and rainforest:
A sailing adventure around Australia’s Whitsunday Islands, a full day exploring the Great Barrier Reef, and two nights in Daintree and Cape Tribulation National Parks, a remote headlands which beautifully combine rainforest, beaches and glistening corals.

Where Adventure Begins

Exodus began life in 1974, when two friends got together to provide an overland truck to the Minaret of Jam, the most inaccessible of the world’s great monuments. It was the hippy-trail heyday and the journey from Calais to Kathmandu departed from London in Autumn, returning in Spring. Soon we were also travelling to South Africa, and taking hardy adventurers to the Amazon Basin as well.
