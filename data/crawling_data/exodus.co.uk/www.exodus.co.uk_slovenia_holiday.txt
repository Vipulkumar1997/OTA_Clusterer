Adventure Holidays in Slovenia

Introducing Slovenia. One of Europe’s newest – and least visited – countries, the northernmost province of the former Yugoslavia is a small but beautiful place. There’s an amazingly diverse array of scenery, with the ragged ribbons of the Julian Alps running through it; the dark and ancient forests of the Triglav National Park; fabulous gothic churches; and an indisputable vibrancy of colour. Also found here are the crystal clear waters of lakes Bled and Bohinj, and a second major mountain range, the Karavanke Mountains.

Here you can gently walk in and around the foothills, or take on a much tougher challenge trekking in the highlands. The rivers provide a perfect location for water-based activity holidays, with kayaking, rafting and hydrospeeding. And then there’s rock climbing, mountaineering, cycling and canyoning. And when you’re feeling hungry after a full day’s activity, food here is hearty: surrounded by the Mediterranean, Italy, Austria and Hungary, it’s a delightful culinary mix.

Highlights of Slovenia

1. Lake Bled:
a glacial lake in the Julian Alps in northwestern Slovenia, where it adjoins the town of Bled. High above the tree line, the lakes reflect the white shards of karst-like rock in the mirror-like waters.

2. The Julian Alps:
Named after the conquering emperor Julius Caesar, these limestone peaks rule this corner of Europe, their jagged peaks forming a rocky crown against the sky. It’s possible to spend a day here and not bump into another trekker all day.

3. Triglav:
At 2,864m it’s Slovenia’s highest peak, and ever since the first recorded climb in 1778 reaching the summit has been regarded as a rite of passage for Slovenians. Indeed, some of the world’s most famous mountaineers and alpinists hail from this area.

4. The Soca River:
On the banks of the Soca River, the small town of Kobarid is a mecca for adventure seekers. Running down from the Julian Alps, the crystal-clear waters offer ideal conditions for a variety of adventurous activities. Here you can enjoy whitewater rafting, canyoning and kayaking, as well as mountain biking and there’s one of Europe’s largest and most thrilling zip-lines, high above the valley floor.

5. Lake Bohinj:
Lake Bohinj lies between Bohinj's mountains, which rise from 1,600 to 2,000 meters, and is Slovenia`s largest glacial lake. It is 4.2 kilometres long, one kilometre wide, and forty-five meters deep.
