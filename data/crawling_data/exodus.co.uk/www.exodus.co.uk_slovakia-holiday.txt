Adventure Holidays in Slovakia

From the
High Tatra Mountains
, flanking the Polish border, to the lower but equally dramatic massifs of the Mala Fatra and the Low Tatras, Slovakia arguably has central Europe's most spectacular mountain scenery. Whether it’s skiing down pristine slopes with the pink sunrise reflecting on the snow, or standing at the top of Lomnicky Peak overlooking the vast mountainous landscape from almost 3000 metres, Slovakia has lots to offer the intrepid traveller.

The eastern half of former Czechoslovakia, Slovakia was only recognised as an independent country in 1993. Thus, the capital Bratislava retains much of its historical charm, as do smaller towns such as Levoca and Kezmarok.

Expert view:

“The destinations you can reach when you go cross-country skiing can be really quite remote and remarkable. Even in the Tatras, which can be quite popular, we’re able to explore some hidden corners, visiting charming medieval villages. And there's much more to enjoy than just skiing: dogsledding, thermal baths, snowshoeing and winter picnics all lie in store. The High Tatras’ snowy peaks are etched high above valleys seemingly untouched by the passage of time.”
