Adventure Holidays in Costa Rica

Discover the full spectrum of Costa Rica's wildlife – for this gloriously diverse ecosystem accounts for 5% of the world’s plant and animal species – through a range of activities on your Costa Rica holiday: zip line through the mist-shrouded canopies of the cloud forest, where howler monkeys’ roars resonate around the hills, or glide through the tranquil canals of Tortuguero National Park. On summer trips to Costa Rica, you might even see green turtle hatchlings scramble across the beach towards the Caribbean Sea…. Oh, and did we mention the beach? Trips to Costa Rica is for those who have a true love of nature, and many of the places we visit are privately owned lodges, set up to protect the land and to enable the visitor to enjoy the wildlife, concentrating particularly on only permitting small groups at any one time.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

Costa Rica Top Four Attractions

1 Arenal:
this as Costa Rica's most active volcano until fairly recently, when it entered a resting phase. There is still a lot of geothermal activity in the area and Arenal Volcano can be viewed while relaxing in the soothing waters of one of the area's many hot springs.

2 Monteverde:
the cloud forests of Monteverde are a misty, verdant paradise, home to countless plant species and an amazing array of wildlife, including the notoriously shy Resplendent Quetzal. The local reserves have miles of walking trails, and there's zip lining over the forest canopy.

3 Manuel Antonio National Park:
although Manuel Antonio is the smallest national park in Costa Rica, it boasts some of the country's best and most beautiful beaches.

4 Tortuguero:
the remote town of Tortuguero, on the Caribbean coast, is one of the world's major nesting grounds for both Green and Leatherback Turtles, and in the nesting seasons (April - May and July - October) it's possible to see groups of turtles laying eggs in the sand.
