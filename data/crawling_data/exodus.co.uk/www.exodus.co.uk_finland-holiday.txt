Adventure Holidays in Finland

Crisp fresh air, the call of the beautiful Lapland wilderness, and thrilling winter – and summer – activities. Sounds good right? Finland holidays take place in a wild land of dense forest, crystal clear lakes, and Arctic frost.

Stay in cosy cabins on the edge of the Oulanka National Park, where vast forest landscapes are blanketed by snow and punctuated by frozen ice-blue lakes. To the north exists a vast unspoilt wilderness, a magnet for trekkers and Arctic adventure holiday hunters. On a holiday to Finland you can discover it by snowshoe, snowmobile or very own team of huskies. Free from the icy clutches of the winter, summer holidays in Finland reveal a stunning new landscape of crystal-blue lakes and pine forests as far as the eye can see. On a trip to Finland you may even spot the elusive brown bear come out from hibernation.

Highlights of Finland's Activity Holidays

1. Stay in a wilderness camp:
a Finnish ‘wilderness camp’ – an ideal base for a variety of arctic holiday activities such as dogsledding, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. Learn the traditional techniques of ice fishing and igloo building to get your hands stuck into arctic life.

2. The Northern Lights:
the most northerly reaches of Finland are one of the best places to catch nature’s ultimate light show: the awe-inspiring
Northern Lights
. At the end of a snowmobile safari or an arctic trek, the spectacle is all the more inspiring.

3. Drive a husky team:
there’s nothing quite like feeling the fresh air in your face as you dogsled through the frozen forests of Finland. Get the dogs up and running, release the brake and watch the winter scenery fly by.

4. Visit Oulanka National Park:
Oulanka
is one of Finland’s most scenic areas – a wild region of rivers and ravines, of lush flowering meadows and alpine forests. During the winter it’s a Narnia-esque paradise, perfect for dogsledding, snowmobiling or reindeer sleigh rides.

5. Wildlife spotting:
in winter you’re likely to see reindeer, arctic hares, elk, black grouse, white willow grouse, wood grouse and the golden eagle. Sometimes you may meet tracks from lynx, wolfs and foxes, and in late spring even the brown bear can cross the trails.

The
winter activity
experts at Exodus can suggest a number of activities for you to try which will suit your ability level.
