Adventure Holidays in Zimbabwe

Welcome to Zimbabwe. It may not be the first place you think of when booking a holiday, but with Exodus on side it’s a safe, holidays to Zimbabwe are warm and welcoming, completely unspoilt by tourism.  This is a country that has it all, from dramatic, jagged peaks reaching for the sky to vast grasslands rippling in the wind, the mighty thunder of the Victoria Falls to the grace of an elephant wandering the plain. Every sight is a spectacle, and every trail an experience to remember.

Highlights include the vast and wildlife-rich Hwange National Park, Matobo with its curious granite rock formations and prehistoric cave paintings, and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe which reveal the ancient splendours of a kingdom that used to be Southern Africa's most important trading centre.

Expert opinion: walking and wildlife in Zimbabwe

“At no point did I feel nervous or unsafe and I would 100% encourage people to come here. Everyone was so warm, welcoming and friendly! The landscape was dramatic and varied. We were walking in the mountains and we didn’t see another soul all day, and were all alone on the summit of Mount Nimbube. Plus we got to stay in remote locally owned lodges where there were no other guests. It's pretty much and unspoiled – for the first six days we didn’t see any other tourists – and it felt so special being there. The walking was great. We summited the highest peak in Zimbabwe, and came across a group of white rhinos in the National Park – as we were on foot we were able to get really close. At the end of the trip we visited the stunning Victoria Falls, known as Mosi-oa-Tunya – The Smoke That Thunders – captures the drama and majesty that is southern Africa.”


Exodus Product Manager Chloe Knott visited Zimbabwe in 2017. Read more insights from our experts
