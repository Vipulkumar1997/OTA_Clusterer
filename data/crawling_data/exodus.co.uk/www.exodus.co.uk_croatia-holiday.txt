Adventure Holidays in Croatia

Shimmering blue seas – the clearest in the Mediterranean – a handsomely wild coastline, thousands of tiny islands, and picture-perfect towns and villages make Croatia holidays an alluring prospect.

Whether you’d like to explore the walled Renaissance city of Debrovnik on foot, before heading up into the mountains to trek the its stunning National Parks; freewheel along the Dalmatian coast stopping only to bath in the crystaline waters of the Adriatic; or try some of the region’s delicious food, a Croatia trip has it all.

And they are spectacular beaches too. But don’t go hoping for acres of sand. Croatia’s beaches are pebbled, which makes them just perfect for snorkelling, kayaking and swimming adventures. Because our Croatian holidays are about so much more than time on the beach.

Ten reasons to visit Croatia

1. Dubrovnik:
a joyous jumble of narrow cobbled streets, baroque buildings and ancient city walls, it’s no wonder that Dubrovnik is a world heritage site.

2. Wonderful Walking and Trekking:
the landscape quickly becomes mountainous making it a paradise for walkers with a large network of trails.

3. Incredible National Parks:
the Sutjeska National Park boasts one of Europe’s last primeval forests, as well as the mighty Durmitor Mountains.

4. Game of Thrones
……and atmospheric Roman remains. Diocletian’s Palace in Split was used in Game of Thrones, as was the Renaissance city of Dubrovnik.

5. The climate:
Croatia boasts one of the sunniest climates in Europe. With Exodus, we tend to travel off-season, when it’s cooler and less busy.

6. It’s easy to get to:
flights from the UK are around 2.5 hours.

7. Marvellous Cycling:
with its island-scattered bays and pine-clad hillsides, the Dalmatian Coast offers mile after mile of quiet coastal routes.

8. Pretty islands and coastal towns:
a little way offshore lie the beautiful islands of Hvar, Korcula and Mljet where pretty coastal villages and mediaeval towns are set against a backdrop of pine forests and mountains.

9. Off-the-beaten-track adventures:
although more Brits are going to Croatia than ever before, and it regularly appears top destination guides, on many of our Exodus adventures you won’t see another sole.

10. It’s a foodie paradise:
our self-guided cycle trip around the Istrian Peninsular allows you to take things at your own pace so you can try all the things Istria is famous for: truffles, olive oil and asparagus.
