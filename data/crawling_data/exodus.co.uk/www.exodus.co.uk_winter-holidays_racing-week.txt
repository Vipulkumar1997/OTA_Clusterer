Take cross-country skiing to a new level - try a marathon!

Cross-Country Ski Racing

Our unique ski marathons include tuition to help you achieve this incredible sporting challenge and complete one of the famous ‘Worldloppet Series’ races. Feel the adrenaline racing along the loipes, challenge yourself to get your best time or simply enjoy being part of this exhilarating and memorable event.

At Exodus, all of our cross-country ski marathons form part of the Worldloppet calendar, a series of 20 world-class ski races over four continents, including Europe, Asia, Oceana and America. Each country is allowed to enter one race, each with its own history, landscape and traditions. The events attract 80,000 competitors a year, including the world’s elite cross-country skiers. Although it’s a physical and technical challenge skiers from professional athletes to 80 year olds, come together to share the experience. Once you’ve completed your first race you’re entitled to a Worldloppet Pass Book which logs your time, and gets stamped after completion of each race allowing a seeded start in future races.

In focus: Bieg Piastow Ski Marathon

Although
Engadin
– with broad trails and relatively easy terrain – is generally everyone's first choice, this year we've added the
Bieg Piastow Ski Marathon in Poland. It runs for 50km through a huge forested area. Famous for its natural undulating tracks, there's no doubt that this is a challenging trip, so you’ll need previous cross-country skiing experience. But the rewards for your efforts are many: gorgeous views across the Jizera Mountains, hearty food on which to refuel and a new-found love of this memorable region thanks to your expert leader. It's with them, and a group of like-minded companions, that you'll tackle the race itself.

















The trip to Switzerland to do the Engadin Ski Marathon was one of the best trips I have taken....
