Adventure Holidays to the Arctic

A pristine wilderness for only the most intrepid of travellers, a holiday to the Arctic region is an adventure holiday like no other.

Trips to the Arctic are best taken in the summer months when it’s bathed in perpetual daylight, although during winter you stand a good chance of seeing the
Northern Lights
do their otherworldly dance in the night sky. On an Arctic holiday you'll see both wonderful scenery, and remarkable wildlife, including Polar bears, whales and walruses.

Exodus offers a wide range of adventure, activity and wildlife holidays to the Arctic, and it’s a wonderful location for photography holidays. Come with us and you could capture Polar bears on ice in the ghostly midnight sun. Spectacular is no overstatement.

In focus: The Arctic States

There are eight Arctic states, including Canada, Russia, Alaska, Finland, Iceland, Sweden, Greenland and Norway. In the high Arctic – midway between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole – frozen islands and frigid seas harbour a surprising amount of wildlife. Look out for arctic foxes, whales and the mighty polar bear.

Although you may think of it as one big Arctic wilderness, there’s a surprising variety here. Greenland, the world’s second-largest island, is covered in a huge ice sheet, three kilometres deep, with towns clinging to its rocky coast. Svalbard, a jagged scatter of islands, is the outlying territory of the Kingdom of Norway - home to the world’s northernmost town, Longyearbyen. Head to the Canadian Arctic for dramatic scenery and historic stories of the search for The Northwest Passage. Spitsbergen is better for wildlife spotting, as the landmass is smaller and animals more concentrated. When travelling with Exodus you’ll be on well equipped, comfortable boats with expert crew. For a once-in-a-lifetime journey like no other, we offer the chance to journey to the North Pole where there’s the opportunity to land by helicopter.
