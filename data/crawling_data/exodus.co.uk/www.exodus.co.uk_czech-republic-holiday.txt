Adventure Holidays in the Czech Republic

Europe's most beautiful capital, Prague, vies with the Carpathian and Tatras mountains for attention in this magnificently contrasting country.
Straddled by Poland,
Slovakia
,
Austria
and Germany, the Czech Republic's geography changes in a short distance from open pastures and dense pine forests to bare mountain ridges to jagged alpine peaks. It has some challenging walking but the mountain peaks, although beautiful, are not huge in terms of altitude. For anyone visiting the country it is essential to have at least two days in Prague and walking is the best way to discover this picturesque city with its maze of streets and ornate squares. To combine a walk in either of these mountain ranges with
Prague
or even
Krakow
in neighbouring
Poland
is a perfect combination holiday.

In the spotlight: cycling Prague to Budapest

This iconic route through central Europe is best undertaken by bike. From the cobbled streets and C14th bridges of Prague, affectionately called the City of a Hundred Spires, freewheel your way through four countries on your way to Budapest, famous for its quirky ruin bars and soothing thermal baths. On the way you’ll pass world-class architectural masterpieces, UNESCO World Heritage Sites and sleepy hamlets where life has remained almost unchanged for generations.
