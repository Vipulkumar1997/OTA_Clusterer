Adventure Holidays in Nepal

When it comes to Nepal, one word says it all: The Himalaya. For this magical kingdom sits high on the spine of the world’s most famous mountain range. Nerve-tingling scenery, a complex culture and some of the best walking trails in the world make Nepal a mecca for the adventure traveller. Here you can trek to the top of the world, raft down raging rapids, cycle awesome mountain passes or simply contemplate the meaning of life as you listen to monks chanting.

Life in Nepal adds new meaning to living on the edge, a delicate balance of high altitude, hard work and social festivities, all steeped heavily in ancient tradition. And although poor, Nepal's culture is rich. It’s not hard to see why this is a haven for Buddhism, and you’ll come across monasteries, village temples, and prayer flags atop passes and houses wherever you go. The people leave an indelible impression too.



Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

Expert view: essential Nepal Activity Holidays

Asia Base Camp Manager Valerie Parkinson has been leading treks in the Himalaya for more 30 years, and has spent over 50% of her life surrounded by the most magnificent mountains on earth.

1. Trekking Everest and the surrounding mountains:
“Straddling a ridge with breathtaking views of Everest, Thyangboche Monastery is the holiest place in the Sherpa Highlands. En route to Everest, Hillary and Tenzing paused for a blessing. We stay in the teahouse next door, so close you can hear monks chanting.”

2. Cycling holidays in Nepal:
“The highlight of cycling in Nepal is undoubtedly Khardung La. At 5,602m it’s the highest drivable road in the world. Get to the top and be rewarded by close-up views of the Karakorums, and an exhilarating 40km ride down.”

3. The Annapurna Circuit – in luxury:
“Not all Himalayan trekking holidays require roughing it. Our low-altitude route through villages and farmland to the Annapurna foothills includes two nights at Himalaya Lodge. Where the snow-capped Annapurna peaks feel close enough to touch and there are fluffy duvets…”

4. Wildlife holidays in Nepal:
“Follow in the footsteps of the BBC's Planet Earth and track snow leopards with guides – with an 80% success rate – in Hemis National Park. You’ll also see Tibetan ibex, blue sheep, red foxes and wolves on your journey, and visit a monastic festival.”

Nepal: One Year On...




One year on since the earthquake that devastated Nepal struck, we sent our very own filmmaker Olly Pemberton out to the beautiful mountain nation to find out how the funds raised by our Emergency Appeal are being used to help remote communities where the big aid agencies don't go.


































Valerie has also initiated various
Responsible Travel
projects, and following the devastating earthquakes in Nepal in 2015 helped Exodus raise over £270,000. “The money has supported our local staff, built five schools and funded two medical camps," she explains, and we put money back into the community every time you book. Exodus offers more than 500 holidays across 100 countries on all seven continents. And although we’ve grown in the last 40 years, our philosophy stays the same: to bring like-minded people together on authentic adventures, with minimal impact to the environments and cultures we visit. We only work with reputable partners, with whom we’ve built longstanding relationships, and work on various community and environmental projects around the world. Read more about our
Responsible Travel
initiatives
