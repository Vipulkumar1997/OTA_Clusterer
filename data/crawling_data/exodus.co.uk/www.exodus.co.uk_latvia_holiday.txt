Adventure Holidays in Latvia

Step into a fairytale, and take a trip to Latvia. With its enchanting architecture, history and art and its wild, breathtaking national parkland and coastal resorts, the eastern European country has something to feed every traveller’s imagination.

Whether it’s Cesis, an old town with cobbled streets on the Gauja River famous for it’s preserved Medieval castle, or the Gutmanis caves down river, there is plenty to explore on an Exodus trip to Latvia. And if you’re an architecture geek, Rundale palace is a must. Commissioned by the Duke of Courland in the 18th century, the palace was designed by Italian architect Rastrelli, who also designed the world renowned Winter Palace in St. Petersburg.

Cycling












Expert view: Cycling in Latvia

Cycling through Latvia means meandering through beautiful national parks and along idyllic coastal paths. A holiday to Lativia will take you through the bustling medieval town of Riga, Latvia’s largest town and capital city famous for it’s art nouveau architecture, then on to the beautiful town of Jurmala, with it’s unique wooden architecture and 19th-century Russian villas.

“Fantastically flat, and covering three seriously underrated countries, our Cycle the Baltics trip is a tour de force of experienced traveller kudos. Not many venture to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – which is half the appeal of these pleasingly quiet countries. Winding backroads reward relatively little effort with fantastically varied countryside, from wide windswept beaches to hushed pine forests, glistening lakes to picturesque castles perched atop hills. And you’ll hardly have to share it with a soul.”
