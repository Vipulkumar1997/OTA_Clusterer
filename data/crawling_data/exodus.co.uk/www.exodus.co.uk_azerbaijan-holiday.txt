Adventure Holidays to Azerbaijan

Azerbaijan – the Land of Fire. Is one of Europes least visited countries. Sitting on cross roads of Asia and Europe for almost two millennia, welcoming merchants and travellers from both continents as they travelled the ancient Silk Road.

The capital, Baku expanded dramatically after the creation of the first oil wells in 1846, and has been an oil-rich boom town ever since. As a result the city is now an eclectic mix of grand mansions, brutal Soviet-era architecture and gleaming new skyscrapers. However unlike so many other oil rich nations Azerbaijan is keen to maintain its cultural heritage with the 12th Century Old Town being made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000. Outside the capital, Azerbaijan is a land of green valleys, soaring mountains and semi-arid desert.
