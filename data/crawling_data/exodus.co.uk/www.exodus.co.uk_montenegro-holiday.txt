Adventure Holidays in Montenegro

Montenegro is a tiny – often overlooked – Balkan country sandwiched between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Albania. It’s blessed with a beautiful strip of Adriatic coastline, rugged mountains, and medieval villages. In the morning you can wake up along the beautiful Adriatic coast, eat lunch on the banks of Skadar Lake, and enjoy an evening hike in the Montenegrin mountains.

The country’s recent, turbulent history is never far from the surface but Montenegro rewards the curious traveller with natural wonders. In Montenegro the tranquil Luštica Peninsula is a rural headland of hidden beaches and remote villages wrapped by olive groves. The Old Town of Kotor, heart of the country’s wine-growing region, will enchant you. Its sheltered bay attracts the yachting set, but fjord-like in its beauty and dotted with coastal churches, it’s a refreshingly un-glitzy place.

Must-see Montenegro

1. Kotor:
included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites for it's 4.5km-long fortification walls and many churches and palaces

2. Perast:
once owned by the Venetians, this town has a distinctly Italian feel. See the 17th-century church of St Nikola, protected by a Venetian fortress and surrounded by beautiful palaces and gardens once built by the famous sea captains of the Adriatic, and have lunch overlooking the bay.

3. Cetinje:
located at the foot of Lovcen Mountain, this was the ancient capital of Montenegro. Since 1485 Cetinje has been the sacred centre of Montenegro, and as a result the city houses more museums and cultural heritage sites than any other in Montenegro.

4. St.Vasilije holy shrine, Ostrog Mountains:
intricately carved into the rising rock face, the Ostrog Monastery is considered by many to be the most inspiring Orthodox sacred place in the former Yugoslavia. The monastery has become the largest religious pilgrimage site in the country, with many Orthodox Christians as well as Catholics and Muslims paying homage to St. Vasilije, the founder of the 17th Century monastery.

5. Zabljak:
located in the Durmitor National Park – home to bears and wolves – Zabljak sits neatly on a plateau at 1500m, surrounded by beautiful pine wood forests, high alpine mountains, and the 1,300m-deep Tara River Canyon. Take a gentle walk around Zabljak Plateau with its glacial lakes and traditional highland villages.
