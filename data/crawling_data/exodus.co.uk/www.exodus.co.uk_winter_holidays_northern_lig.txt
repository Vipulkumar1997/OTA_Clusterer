Northern Lights Holidays

The elusive otherworldly glow of the Aurora Borealis – commonly known as the Northern Lights – are described by some as the

the greatest light show on earth. Visible above 65 degrees north, the snowy wilds of European Lapland are an excellent viewing spot.

In Iceland and Scandinavia it’s possible to see the heavens ablaze with swirly, smokey light them from late September to early April.
The mesmerising lights are formed from fast-moving, electrically charged solar particles driven towards the Poles by the earth’s magnetic field. When they collide with atmospheric gases they create colourful curtains of light, like nocturnal rainbows, that seem to dance in the sky. But you can't take them for granted. You'll have the most chance of seeing them in
December, January and February, when there's the longest hours of darkness, and for the clearest views, avoid dates when there is a full moon.

Northern Lights: top tips

Head to Arctic Scandinavia:
it's the place to be to track down the Northern Lights. Whilst it is impossible to guarantee, the best ways of ensuring a good sighting of the lights is to be under a cloudless sky and as far from natural sources of lights as possible – which is why our itineraries take you to more remote locations, a big advantage over a quick city break. Step into a frozen wilderness far from crowded cities to ensure the best chances of seeing the greatest light show on Earth. We have trips in
Sweden
,
Iceland
,
Greenland
and
Norway
.

Photographing them can be tricky:
if all you have is a small point and shoot camera, the best photos you'll get will be the dark of the night sky with an extremely faint green glow on the horizon. For that “National Geographic-esque” shot then you will need a good-quality digital SLR, preferably a wide angle lens. A sturdy tripod and a remote shutter release are essential due to the long exposure time required.

Pick a trip with plenty of daytime options:
from a mixed activity week in the Finnish wilderness of Oulanka National Park, to trips that focus exclusively on dogsledding or snowshoeing
.
