Day
1










Depart London.







The group flight overnights in Miami in the USA before connecting tomorrow morning with a flight to Belize City. Hotel accommodation will be organised in Miami but a leader will not be present with the group during this overnight stay.
Comfortable Hotel
















Day
2










Fly to Belize City; to Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary.







Clients on the group flight will arrive in Belize City today. Land only clients should be at Belize City airport by the specified meeting time in order to join the rest of the group. Together we will transfer (approx. 1 hour) to the Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary, our base for the next two nights. Known for being a great destination for birds, the wildlife sanctuary gets its name from the 'crooked' cashew trees that grow around the lagoon. Wetland areas weave through the sanctuary, providing habitat for some 286 species of birds, the migratory Jabiru stork being the most famous of these. Crocodiles, monkeys, otters and freshwater turtles also reside in the sanctuary. It's a peaceful destination with an interesting community and history; the village of Crooked Tree is thought to be the earliest European settlement in Belize.

Comfortable Hotel
















Day
3










Boat trip on the lagoon.







Wake up fresh this morning to beautiful bird songs! In the morning we join a 3 hour guided boat trip on the lagoon in search of wildlife. Migratory birds tend to flock to the area between December and May, but plenty of resident species can be seen throughout the year. From our small boat it's easy to appreciate the tranquillity of the sanctuary. You can then spend the afternoon at your leisure getting to know the area, or join an optional excursion to the Community Baboon Sanctuary. This grassroots project is actually a reserve for the endangered Black Howler monkey (there are no baboons in Belize but this is the name used in the local Creole dialect), providing them with 20 square miles of forest to roam freely in. It is estimated that there are now 2,000 Black Howler monkeys living in this area - you'll certainly hear their calls as you enter the reserve!

Comfortable Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
4










To Uaxactun in Guatemala; sunset tour and camp at ruins.







After breakfast we begin our journey (approx. 6-7 hours) to Guatemala and the archaelogical ruins of Uaxactun (pronounced wash-ak-toon), which lies within the boundaries of Tikal National Park. Uaxactun is a remote Mayan site set amongst 47 hectares of dense tropical forest in the lowlands of Guatemala. The alignment of the temples has been found to have important astrological connections, with the 3 smaller pyramids marking the equinox and the summer and winter solstice when sunrise hits the large temple on these important days. In order to fully appreciate the beauty and remoteness of Uaxactun we camp overnight near the ruins. Tonight we'll enjoy sunset at the site, after which candles will likely be lit to illuminate the ruins.

Comfortable Camping










Meals included:


Breakfast

Lunch

Dinner










Day
5










Uaxactun community tour.







The calls of Howler monkeys in the jungle canopy are likely to wake us up this morning. We start early for a sunrise tour of Uaxactun, which gives us a chance to have the site to ourselves before the park is officially open. Afterwards we have a tour the Uaxactun Community, where we learn about the various ways they make a living from the rainforest whilst also protecting it for future generations. Nowadays many of Uaxactún's residents make their living from gathering forest products such as chicle (gum exported to Japan), allspice and xate palm leaves (ornamental plant exported to the US and used for floral arrangements). Afterwards, we return to our campsite at Uaxactun for another chance to gaze at the stars!

Day
6










Explore Tikal ruins; to San Ignacio in Belize.







In the morning, we transfer (approx. 45 minutes) to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Tikal. Tikal is the most famous and probably the most impressive of all Mayan sites; nearly 20 square miles of classic ruins are surrounded by the dense jungle of Petén. We take a tour of the city, visiting the main temples, palaces, squares, tombs, residences and religious monuments. The area was thought to support a population of 90,000 Mayans at its peak and there are some 3,000 separate buildings to be explored. Tikal is also a superb area for observing wildlife in the jungle environment and visitors regularly see Howler monkeys, Spider monkeys, toucans, Weaver birds, coatimundis and even tarantulas (if you know where to look and wish to find one!).

We leave Guatemala behind this afternoon, as our journey heads back to Belize to the small town of San Ignacio. Sometimes known locally as 'Cayo', which means island in Spanish, the town was given this name for its location on the west bank of the Macal River. Before the arrival of roads in the area, like many small towns, San Ignacio was only accessible by boat. This laid back town, with its mixed population of Mestizo, Creole, Lebanese, Chinese and Mennonites, is a great example of multicultural Belize.

Meals included:

Day
7










Visit the Actun Tunichil Muknal (ATM) caves.







Today we venture into the Mayan underworld at the Actun Tunichil Muknal (ATM) cave. A 45 minute journey from San Ignacio brings us to the Tapir Mountain Nature Reserve, in which the caves are located. They were discovered only very recently, in 1989, at which point archaeologists began exploring the site, before officially opening it to visitors in the late 90s. The intention has been to preserve the area as much as possible; the majority of cultural artefacts found in the caves are still in their original position and only a select number of guides have permits to lead excursions in this area. The ATM cave was a sacred site to the Mayan people during the Classic period (AD250 - 909). They are thought to have believed that gods resided in the cave and that its chambers led directly to the underworld. Human sacrifices took place in the caves as a way of appeasing the gods, with the hope of creating a more fertile land. We'll hike through sticky jungle to reach the entrance to the cave, which is partially hidden by leaves and branches but opens like a keyhole, allowing a stream to pass through the entrance. Prepare to wade or swim through water to enter the cave! Once inside, our guide will explain their history and we'll see some of the famous artefacts that have been discovered, such as the 'The Crystal Maiden', the crystalised skeleton of a young woman whose bones have calcified and taken on a sparkling appearance.

Day
8










Morning Maya Cocoa; afternoon to Dangriga, visiting the Blue Hole en route.







We leave San Ignacio behind this morning and start our journey to Dangriga. En route we will visit Maya Cocoa, a family run cacao farm, where we will see how chocolate is made, from picking the fruit through to sampling the final product! After this visit, we make a stop at the Blue Hole National Park, just off the Hummingbird Highway. The park is famous for its large, sapphire sinkhole, which came about after the collapse of an underground river. The cool waters of the sinkhole make for a refreshing dip on a hot day! Several caves can also be found in the park and there are steps leading down to the 25ft deep pool, which is surrounded by hanging foliage and vegetation.

After a refreshing swim we continue towards Dangriga, located on the southern coast of Belize at the mouth of the North Stann Creek River. Dangriga was settled before 1832 by Garinagu (Black Caribs, as they were known to the British) from Honduras, considered for years the second largest population centre in the country behind Belize City. Since the early 1980s Garífuna culture has undergone a revival, so part of the town was renamed Dangriga, a Garífuna word meaning 'standing waters'.

Standard Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast

Lunch










Day
9










Free day for optional activities.







Today we have a free day to enjoy Dangriga and the surrounding area. There is a choice of several optional activities including a visit the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary: a nature reserve in south central Belize established to protect the forests, fauna and watersheds of an approximately 400 square kilometre area of the eastern slopes of the Maya Mountains. The reserve was founded in 1990 as the first wilderness sanctuary for the jaguar and is regarded as the premier site for jaguar preservation in the world.

Standard Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
10










To Caye Caulker.







This morning we head to Caye Caulker or 'Cayo Hicaco' (in Spanish) referring to Hicaco Plum (Coco Plum) which grows in the island and was gathered by Spanish seafarers to combat scurvy. Our journey takes us to the Belize City Water Taxi Station where we take a boat towards Caye Caulker. Caye Caulker is an island paradise in the Caribbean Sea. The delicate coral of the Belize Barrier Reef provide food and shelter to a dizzying number of tropical fish, with manatees, Nurse sharks, stingrays and turtles sharing the warm turquoise waters.

Standard Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
11










Half day snorkel tour in Hol Chan Marine Reserve.







Just off the southern part of Ambergris Caye, the largest island in Belize and a few minutes boat ride from Caye Caulker, is the Hol Chan Marine Reserve, meaning 'Little Channel' in Mayan, because of a natural break in the reef. This area is now an important marine habitat providing refuge for a huge number of fish, coral, several species of sea turtle, the West Indian manatee and two species of dolphin. Nurse sharks also congregate in an area called 'Shark Ray Alley', now a popular dive site. We join a snorkelling tour in the reserve to see a selection of the marine life living in these tropical waters.

Standard Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
12










Free day for optional excursions.







Today has been left free as there are many excursions available to match different interests. If you're a diver we recommend taking an optional excursion to the Great Blue Hole on the Belize Barrier Reef. Not to be confused with the sinkhole located inland, the Great Blue Hole is 60 miles out to sea within the Lighthouse Reef System. This perfectly circular limestone sinkhole drops to a depth of 124m and is fringed by coral reef, a perfect environment for divers (Jacques Cousteau declared it one of the top 10 dive sites in the world) and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Please note that you will have to add an extra night's accommodation to the end of your trip if you plan on going scuba diving, as you cannot fly for 24 hours after diving.

Standard Hotel










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
13










Transfer to Belize City; depart.







This morning we wave goodbye to our island paradise and return to Belize City by water taxi. Those on the group flights will be transferred to the airport in time for their return flight. Land only clients will leave the trip in Belize City.










Meals included:


Breakfast










Day
14

Essential Info

Visas


Belize





Holders of British, Australian, New Zealand, US, Canadian and most EU passports do not require visas for Belize. However, please note that if flying via the USA, you will have to clear immigration during transit. In this case, you will be required to get an Electronic Travel Authority (USD14) prior to flying if travelling via the USA under the Visa Waiver Scheme (as is the case for most UK citizens). Please see
www.exodus.co.uk/USVisa
for more information. Zika fever is a mosquito‐borne viral disease and a known risk in places visited on this trip. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available and therefore the best form of prevention is to avoid being bitten. We recommend you take the usual precautions to avoid mosquito bites. For the latest information please visit
www.exodus.co.uk/zika
‐virus‐q‐a .







Guatemala





Holders of British, Australian, New Zealand, US, Canadian and most EU passports do not require visas for Guatemala.






Vaccinations


Belize





There are no mandatory vaccination requirements. Recommended vaccinations are: Typhoid, Hepatitis A. The risk of malaria is slight but you may wish to consult your GP or travel health clinic for further advice.







Guatemala





There are no mandatory vaccination requirements. Recommended vaccinations are: Tetanus, Typhoid, Hepatitis A. The risk of malaria is slight but you may wish to consult your GP or travel health clinic for further advice. Dengue fever is a known risk in places visited. It is a tropical viral disease spread by daytime biting mosquitoes. There is currently no vaccine or prophylaxis available for Dengue, and therefore the best form of prevention is to avoid being bitten. We recommend you take the usual precautions to avoid mosquito bites. The above information can change at short notice; as we are not qualified to answer all your questions about travel health we strongly recommend you contact your Medical Professional or a Travel Health Clinic at least 8 weeks prior to departure for up‐to‐date information.






Eating and Drinking




11 breakfasts, 3 lunches and 2 dinners included.

Breakfast is always provided in hotels and generally consists of bread, eggs, ham, fruit, juice and coffee. Whilst at the tented camp in Uaxactun, our camp staff prepare hearty breakfasts and dinners (usually a real highlight!), and packed lunches are provided. Although meat plays a key part in many Central American dishes, vegetarians can be well catered for. Please advise us on booking of any special dietary requirements you may have.






Weather




Due to its location in the Caribbean, Belize has a sub-tropical climate with a wet and dry season. Dry season falls between January and May and wet season between June and December. During the wet season, there are often daily downpours although these tend to be quite short so there is still plenty of bright sunshine. For this reason, midsummer is not necessarily a bad time to go. Even during the dry season, rain is possible! Temperatures remain fairly consistent all year round, rarely falling below 20ºC and usually not going much above 32 ºC, with an average 75 - 85% humidity. Along the coast the sea breeze eases the humidity, but in the Belizean jungle (and that of Guatemala), it can be pretty sticky. The main hurricane season is between August and October. Water temperatures remain a relatively constant 23ºC.






Belize City







Is this trip for you?



This is an active trip

It is suitable for those with a spirit of adventure, however the pace is manageable and the included activities are suitable for beginners if you have no experience of them already (e.g caving, snorkelling). In order to visit a number of areas of natural beauty, some long drives are necessary, sometimes across bumpy roads. We will also travel by boat to and from Caye Caulker. Please be aware that border crossings can sometimes be delayed with significant queues and formalities. Being in the tropics, most of the region is hot and humid, particularly during the summer months and inland.

Adventures in Belize





Definitely belieze the hype!




Picked this trip because I'd loved a previous visit to Costa Rica and Belize and Guatamala seemed to offer something similar, but with Tikal and the world's 2nd largest barrier reef for good measure. Good decision! While I think CR has the edge for wildlife, Tikal surpassed all expectations, the reef experience knocked the socks off Australia's and Belize was beautiful, diverse, interesting and easy for non-Spanish speakers. The trip itinerary was varied and mostly very successful.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Tikal - I'd wanted to see it for a long time and I couldn't believe the scale of the site and the complexity of the Mayan civilisation. Only downside was the very limited time we spent there.
Snorkelling in the reef at Caye Caulker was also an amazing experience.




What did you think of your group leader?


Fidelio was a fantastic group leader. He is extremely knowledgeable about archaeology, an excellent naturalist and gave us really interesting insights into local history, culture and politics. He looked after us all really well and was always friendly, helpful and good company.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Beware of sandflies at Dangriga! They're tiny so easy to miss, mosquito repellent doesn't work with them - needs to be something oily - and their bites can turn into painful blisters and swelling.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


We stayed on for a few days at Ambergris Caye after the tour finished, hoping to do some sea kayaking. Unfortunately even Fidelio's extensive knowledge and contacts couldn't source us proper kayaks to hire and Caye Caulker would have been a much nicer option for simply 'chillin'.

A well balance exploration of what Belize & Guatemala has to offer. We had an amazing guide who had a vaste knowledge of the countries, their history, culture and wildlife. The trip was organised at a good pace, the Mayan culture was fascinating as was the wildlife -birds in particular. Snorkelling was great, imagine swimming within 3m of a manatee. Then there are the rays, nurse sharks and all the varied species of fish. A thoroughly active and worthwhile holiday.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The ATM caves. Doing it and finding out about the culture that lay behind it.




What did you think of your group leader?


A bloody miracle. Every group leader should be like Fidelio!!




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Travel lite and take a towel. Water type shoes essential.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Do it,

Belize and Guatemala - Amazing Trip!




Belize is like a hidden gem - very few tourists, stunning Caribbean beaches and incredible Mayan relics. It is a small country so you see a lot of it, but there is loads to do, and dipping into Guatemala for 2 days is also a treat to see the mighty Tikal and Uaxactun ruins. You get a mixture of beaches, culture, water-activities and sight-seeing on this trip, and was a wonderful trip.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


The best part of this trip was the ATM cave. I haven't done anything like it - wading deep into the Mayan underworld to discover artifacts and skeletons that haven't been touched for 1000 years. It really felt like we were archaeologists exploring the cave for the first time! Other highlights include climbing one of the pyramids at Tikal, tubing down a serene river at Cockscomb National Park and snorkelling amongst manatees, sting rays, turtles and nurse sharks in the sea.




What did you think of your group leader?


Hugo really knew his stuff. He showed us some brilliant local restaurants, told us so much about Mayan history and the current politics of Belize and Guatemala, and was generally a nice person to be around. He was always there to help and suggest things if you needed it.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


If you want to dive the Blue Hole, stay on an extra day as the group flight leaves at 11am the following morning so could potentially be dangerous. Take reef shoes for the ATM cave (although you can buy them in San Ignacio) and just go with an open mind and enjoy it!

A fantastic holiday with a really good mixture of culture, adventure and wildlife.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Too many to say. ATM cave was incredible, Tikal fascinating, and loved visit to iguana sanctuary and river tubing (an option offered by our brilliant guide Hugo.) Trip to Goff's Kaye (which we booked as a group) was a fantastic end to a fantastic holiday.




What did you think of your group leader?


Brilliant. Hugo couldn't have done more




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Be prepared for a charge ($19 per person) to leave Belize when heading for Guatemala. Also take an umbrella. Much better then waterproofs.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


This trip will appeal to anybody with a great mixture of things to do. Remember to budget for some brilliant optional extras that are available.

Simply splendid!! I took advantage of the many optional extras (not listed in the trip notes) and had a full on 2 weeks with great food (mmmm those fry jacks!) great activities (you have to do the tube rafting!), and a wonderful introduction to Belize and Guatemalan communities .... Friendliest of smiling people. From jungle to paradise island seeing amazing wildlife wherever we went, and marvelling at the remains of an epic Mayan civilisation.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Definitely the camping on a candlelit site in the Jungle of Guatemala and visiting the community projects which ensure sustainability. Or maybe it was the swimming and climbing deep into the Mayan cave to see at close up the skulls, skeletons and remnants of the people. Or could have been snorkelling at arm's length with turtles, sharks and manatees. But maybe it was trekking through jungle and then floating down the river tube rafting, watching the jungle scenery and birdlife quietly meander by me. Hard to tell. So many wow moments.




What did you think of your group leader?


Hugo was a great leader - organised, caring, full of answers to our relentless questioning. A calm peaceful guy whose quiet nature could be interrupted with teasing and laughter. He offered so many additional activities and always recommended safe local places to eat. I was the oldest in the group (old enough to be his and all the others' mother!) but he (and the rest) took great care of me in such a easy way.
He was a gent and I trusted him totally.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Take a torch for the camping and night treks back from the local bars! Don't bother with a rain jacket - an umbrella is far more use.
Do frequently apply sunscreen to the back of your legs on the snorkelling trip ...,.., there were many raw legs on our trip!
Allow 3/5 local dollars for the many guides you have.
The ATM caves are quite a climb over slippy steep rocks - not easily achieved if you have any mobility difficulties.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Don't hesitate ........ Just book it!!

Adventures in Belize




A varied and interesting trip which was well organised. I thoroughly enjoyed it. There were a couple of free days in places with not a lot to do, but I'm not sure if the schedule would work otherwise as I enjoyed the relaxed approach. I thought it was a good mixture of fun activities with some R&R time.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


I really enjoyed the ATM caves. Having never caved before I thought I would've been nervous, but it was a fun and interesting trip.




What did you think of your group leader?


Hugo was good, helpful and very knowledgeable, if a little bit quiet.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Don't expect full on action for this trip. It is classified as 'leisurely' which I think is fair and is why I booked it, as I wanted a rest but with some fun activities mixed in.

A great trip with lots of variation from culture and history to wildlife to beaches.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Seeing the human sacrifices in the ATM cave was a wonderful insight into such a different system of beliefs.
Snorkelling with stingrays and nurse sharks in horrible weather was amazing and a bit scary.




What did you think of your group leader?


Hope you get David, he is a great trip leader but doesn't always work for Exodus.
Hugely knowledgeable about Tikal and the Mayan culture (past and present), he was also able to spot and name an interesting bird at 50mph whilst smoothly organising the trip and enjoying a joke.
A really excellent group leader.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


For the ATM caves take closed toe shoes (required) and a pair of old socks. You can buy reef shoes locally, but they had a limited supply of the popular sizes.
Take a sleeping bag liner or sheet for the camping as the local bedding didn't arrive to plan.
Take as much of the strongest insect repellant you can. The local insects seemed delighted with the fresh blood and feasted on everyone who wasn't soaked in repellant.
Track down the rest of the group on the flight before you leave Miami airport as it will be almost impossible at the hotel. Some of us managed to meet and shared a cab to South Beach, but at over US$100 return this is expensive on your own. There is little to do around the Ramada Inn hotel.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


Get used to working in two currencies. There are 2 Belizean dollars to the US dollar and are highly interchangeable.
Rice and Beans is completely different from Beans and Rice, but unlike some central american countries the food was far from bland and good food was found everywhere.

ADVENTURES IN BELIZE




Brilliant holiday. Very non-touristy (apart from the last 3 days. but by then we really deserved just lying on the beach or doing touristy things such as snorkelling and shopping!)




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


When our camp was flooded and we had to sleep in 'emergency' accomodation in the local village.It wasn't the best night sleep as roosters, howler monkeys and jungle birds kept us awake all night, but it was an exciting event demonstrating both the wildlife and how the local people live. This was a real life experience that you won't find in a holiday resort. There were so many more moments I found inspirational- Going into the ATM cave with all of the Mayan relics and sacrificial remains (unmoved since 200-600AD, where else can you see that?), dinner by candle light in the Guatemalan jungle prepared by a local cook,  snorkeling with nurse sharks, stingrays and many other brightly coloured fish on the coral reef, learning to make chocolate the proper way, the wildlife-spotting boat trip along the river near Crooked Tree and many other activities besides.




What did you think of your group leader?


David was brilliant. Whenever there was a little issue, he solved it before it became a problem.His calmness and his sense of humour definitely contributed to our experience and made even unexpected setbacks such as flat tires in the middle of nowhere and a flooded campsite an exciting holiday.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


Belize is very un-touristy (apart from the Cayes). travellers should be able to put up with very basic but clean accomodation in certain areas.Also, I always thought the rainy season is not a good time to travel...due to the high humidity, I think all group members were actually pleased when it did start raining though as the heat was incredible.




Is there anything else you would like to add?


All in all, this holiday had something for everyone and if you like a reasonably easy-going holiday (though with some early starts in the morning) with lots of nature-watching, you'll really enjoy this.  Tourism is (deservedly) on the increase here but still in a developmental stage.  If you go now, your experiences (and photographs!) will be largely free of other tourists which is a real bonus.  Bare in mind this is a laid-back Caribbean country so take your foot off the pedal and relax on this trip, you may get frustrated at lack of immediacy if you don't.

An excellent trip that covers a lot in two weeks.  Mayan Ruins at Tikal, caving underground at ATM cave, the birds of Crooked Tree and snorkeling with sharks and stingrays.  This trip has it all.




What was the most inspirational moment of your trip?


Wading through water and climbing rocks to visit the Crystal Maiden skeleton in ATM cave.  Four hours of effort traveling underground was worth every step to visit this amazing site.Also - swimming with nursh sharks, stingrays and loggerhead turtles in Hol Chan.




What did you think of your group leader?


David was a very good leader with an impressive breadth of knowledge, from Mayan history to local wildlife.  When things went wrong (burst tyres, hospital visits, washed out camp site, we had it all!) he always managed the situation calmly and things were sorted with the minimum of fuss.  Just what you want from a leader.




Do you have any advice for potential travellers?


This is a busy and active trip.  You will be tired.  You will be hot. But you will enjoy it and have a great time.ATM cave is challenging and not for the feint-hearted, but our whole group managed to do it.  Can you do it? Yes you can!

An overview of flight options
Exodus is committed to making joining our tours as easy as possible, wherever you live. We generally only block book seats from London, but this certainly does not mean that you need to fly from there. Depending on the route and airlines available, there will usually be various options available for those who want to fly from their local airport.
This page aims to provide a useful overview of the options available to our clients. However, the best flight arrangements should be tailored to your personal requirements, so please contact our Sales team for expert advice.

What kind of options do I have ?
1. We can book for you: Flights from anywhere in the world - not via London

Depending on the route, this may be direct or via an overseas hub like Amsterdam, the Middle East or elsewhere. On short haul routes there may be direct flights with low cost airlines, charter flights or scheduled airlines. Exodus can book most, but not all, of these for you. The most appropriate airline may be different to that which we use for the group flight from London, but many people now travel on different airlines and meet up with their fellow passengers at the destination.
Pros

Cons
May be the most direct route
Often the extra fare compared to the London flight is minimal.
As you will be in the hands a single airline for your entire journey, the airline will be responsible for your bags and your connections.
You may not be able to join the group transfers. However, we can usually arrange private transfers, or book your flights to try and coincide with the group transfers. See notes on
transfer arrangements
below.

2. We can book for you: Connecting flights from your local airport to London
Exodus can book connecting flights to London so you can join the group flight there. Connecting times will be followed according to airline advice, or as requested by clients. There are two types of fares we can use for this option: a 'through-fare' or a 'published fare'.

a) A 'through-fare' is where you will be in the main airline's care throughout. You change planes, but your bags are checked all the way through to your final destination.

b) A 'published fare' ticket is completely seperate from your onward ticket from London. It is usually cheaper than a through-fare but will need to be paid for and issued as soon as it is booked. This can be a problem if your tour has not yet reached minimum numbers. On 'published fares' neither airline is aware that you have connecting flights, so Exodus is responsible for timing your connection, not the airlines involved. The tickets are also usually non changeable and non refundable.
Pros

Cons
Depending on the fare type, Exodus or the airline is responsible for flight connections.
Through fare tickets can be expensive.
On a published fare, tickets must be issued immediately; tickets on published fares can be very difficult to change if onward flight times change; bags are not checked though to your final destination.
Published fares are non-refundable.

3. Booking some or all of the flights yourself
You can also book connecting air travel yourself, either to London, or all the way to the start point. There may be certain airlines or routes we don't have access to, so this is always an option. However, if you make your own travel arrangements you become liable for any delays, cancellations or missed connections, and Exodus is not required to offer refunds if you have trouble reaching the start of your trip.
Pros

Cons
You might find cheaper fares, or routes not available to Exodus.
You are responsible for any delays or missed connections, and the cost of the tour is not protected should you miss your flight be cancelled.

Notes on transfer arrangements
Sometimes it is possible to travel on a different airline to the group flight from London. Where this is the case, we need to think about ensuring you meet up with the group with minimum extra cost and hassle.
On certain trips, it is easy to arrive on a different flight and still meet the group at the hotel with time in hand. We can usually arrange private transfers (at extra cost) or offer advice on taking a taxi to the start hotel.
On other trips (especially in Europe), the transfer meets the group flight and then travels some distance to the first night's accommodation. Where this is the case, our Sales team will try to arrange flights that arrive before (and depart after) the group. However, we do have to make it clear in your final documentation that if your flights are delayed, the transfer cannot wait for you. While Exodus or our local operators will do what we can to help you reach the start point of the tour, any additional costs must be paid by the client.
