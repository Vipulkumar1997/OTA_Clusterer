Cycling Holidays

One world, two wheels. Our cycling holidays come in all shapes and sizes; from gentle cycling in the Loire region of France, descending through the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco on a fully-supported mountain bike expedition, peddling the length of Vietnam and getting under the skin of the unique culture and cuisine of Southeast Asia to emulating the pros on a leg-burning tour through the Pyrenees.

All our cycling holidays are graded to indicate the difficulty level, with the percentage of on and off-road riding, and amount of vehicle support indicated in the trip profile to help you find the perfect holiday. What better way to explore the countryside and small villages of the remote corners of the planet? On a cycling holiday you can fully engage with your surroundings and really immerse yourself in a destination. Travelling further than you can on foot and with the freedom to stop whenever you want to explore hidden areas that are inaccessible to cars and buses.
