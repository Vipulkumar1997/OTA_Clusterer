Adventure Holidays in Chile

Exodus offer a wide range of adventure and activity holidays to Chile. Holidays to Chile and
Easter Island
are an exploration of the 'thin' country at the southern end of the world is one of the great rewards for the adventure traveller.
Patagonia
is a heady cocktail of lakes, peaks, deserts, glaciers and no shortage of wildlife. It is a feast of wild places and astonishing scenery tailor made for walking. The biggest icons are the lakelands, dominated by the great Pucon volcano, the
Atacama
desert (the driest in the world), the vineyards,
Torres del Paine
, Tierra del Fuego and the marine life of the south Pacific Ocean. The magnificent mountains are bordered by windswept grasslands, with millions of sheep tended by a few intrepid gauchos who live under the spine of the continent - the imperious
Andes
. Photogenic, breathtaking and a true wilderness, Chile holidays seldom disappoint.

Or why not try a Tailormade Adventure?

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All Tailormade Adventures still get a local guide where appropriate and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.

In focus: Chile's lunar horizons

It’s a slim country, but Chile manages to find space for real wide screen wonder within its borders. From the jagged peaks of the Andes – South America's rugged back bone – to the otherworldly expanse of the Atacama desert (the world most inhospitable), this is a land full of wild, remote and extreme beauty. And that’s before we reach the ice fields, fjords and big skies of Patagonia: the fantastical flourish of South American landmass.
