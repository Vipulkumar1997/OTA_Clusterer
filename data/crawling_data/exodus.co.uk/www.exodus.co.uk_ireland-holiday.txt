Adventure Holidays in Ireland

Ireland is a true beauty, with glorious landscapes steeped in history, mythology and traditional Irish culture, wherever you look. There’s the wild and windswept Aran Islands in County Galway, to the lush green mountains, valleys, lakes and streams of Connemara; Killarney National Park, with its reflective lakes, waterfalls, castles and population of wild red deer, to County Clare’s stunning Cliffs of Moher, stretching into the distance. There’s fabulous walking and trekking to be had here in the Emerald Isle, and a famously warm welcome wherever you go. You can feel the lyrical nature of the place everywhere from its verdant landscapes to its hearty pubs, for this is a culture rooted in music and verse.

In focus: the Wild Atlantic Way

You could spend a lifetime exploring the soaring cliffs, buzzing towns and hidden beaches of The Wild Atlantic Way – but an eight-day adventure will do. This rugged stretch of coastline passes through nine counties and three provinces on Ireland’s dramatic west coast, and other than walkers and hardy surfers, it’s most regular guest are whales, porpoises, and dolphins. Here are some highlights:

Connemara
:
an imposing landscape of lakes, moorland and rugged mountains, there’s a rich variety of heaths and heathers here. The landscape is dominated by two mountain ranges, the Maamturks and the Twelve Bens, and there’s Kylemore Abbey, one of the great neo-Gothic castles of the country and now a Benedictine abbey run by the nuns.

The Aran Islands:
the ferry to Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands, can be a rocky ride, but it’s well worth it, if only to visit the spectacular prehistoric forts, the most famous of which is the World Heritage site Dun Aonghasa on a dramatic cliff edge.

The Cliffs of Moher
:
this is nature at it’s wildest. The rugged Cliffs of Moher rise 120m from the Atlantic Ocean at Hag’s Head, and 214m at O’Brien’s Tower, with the ocean crashing below. From here you can see stunning views across the sea to the Aran Islands out in Galway Bay.

Galway:
the cobblestoned town town itself is charm personified. Visit Claddagh, an area by Galway Bay surrounded by cute colourful houses.














Tailormade

We can tailor almost any holiday to suit you, perfect if you’d like to change the dates, itinerary, or simply want a private adventure with a group of friends, family or fellow enthusiasts. All
Tailormade Adventures
run with a minimum of two people, but the more who travel, the less it costs per person – and you’ll still get a local guide and all the other Exodus benefits. So if you’d like to celebrate your birthday at the top of a mountain, or visit a particular beach, let us know your dates, and we’ll do the rest.
