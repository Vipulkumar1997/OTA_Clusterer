Adventure Holidays in Zambia

Zambia is a large country, filled with diverse wildlife, dramatic scenery and is one of the finest providers of
Safari
Holidays in the world. Holidays in Zambia are focused around South Luangwa, the mighty Victoria Falls and the Lower Zambezi.
South Luangwa
is a classic wilderness reserve with outstanding bird life and an enviable leopard record. There's canoeing along the game-rich waterways of the Lower Zambezi, which allows you to enjoy the wilderness at its most raw; large pods of hippo vie with shy crocs along the banks and herds of elephant come to the water to drink and browse the vegetation. Carmine bee-eaters nest in sandy patches of riverbank and Goliath heron fish in the shallows. There are excellent chances of predator sightings as well as over five hundred species of birds. And you need at least two days to explore Victoria Falls, where you can walk in the National Park, or try some of the many activities like rafting and bungee jumping.

In focus: walking safaris in Zambia

By far the best way to experience Africa’s incomparable wildlife is on foot, and a walking trip to Zambia must be one of the best. Comfortable lodges, expert guides, the wide open spaces of South Luangwa National Park - one of the best in Africa, but not so well-known – and you have all the ingredients for a superb walking holiday. Zambia may not be as famous for wildlife as its neighbours, but it certainly deserves a visit, and a walk in the park must be one of the ultimate safaris.
Here you can enjoy a spectacular walking safari with expert guides, moving on from one magnificent small camp to the next. You will experience Africa's wildlife up close and at eye level. The park is home to elephant, buffalo, hippo, zebra and giraffe, as well as lion and hyena. but perhaps its most famous residents are the leopard and the most colourful bird life in southern Africa. We offer Premium Adventures in Zambia, which give you the opportunity to relax in some of the most exclusive, small luxury bush camps in Africa.
