Cycling Holidays for Families

As a parent it’s a proud moment when your child wobbles off on two wheels for the first time. And we all know that once they've started there's no stopping them!

If you’re a freewheeling family then one of our Family Cycling Holidays is just the ticket. They’re all on self-guided routes, carefully planned to avoid traffic-heavy spots so you and your family can cycle in safety, and going self-guided gives you the freedom to go at your own pace. You’ll be able to cycle as fast or as slow as you like, without anyone else dictating the pace, and all your bags will be transferred ahead so you can pack without worrying about the weight slowing you down.

All our trips have a recommended minimum age, an activity level dial and a daily distance chart to give you a good idea of how demanding a trip is, so you can be sure to pick one that’s right for your family. And if you’re not sure, our friendly sales team will be able to help with any questions.
