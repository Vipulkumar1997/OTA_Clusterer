New Walking & Trekking Holidays

We have secured the most experienced local partners, the most suitable accommodation and the best leaders for all of our walking tours. And we are always scouting around for new trips to add to our itinerary. That’s because we’re passionate about Walking & Trekking. In addition to a specialist sales team, our Managing Director and the Heads of Product, Operations and Marketing were all Walking & Trekking leaders prior to joining our office staff.

We are the world’s leading Walking & Trekking holiday specialists – it’s no wonder that more people trust us more than any other tour operator and so many of you keep coming back for more. We pride ourselves on offering the most comprehensive and innovative range of adventure trips on the market, and for 2017 we’re launching even more Walking & Trekking holidays.

Many of the flights and flight-inclusive holidays on this website are financially protected by the ATOL scheme. But ATOL protection does not apply to all holiday and travel services listed on this website. Please ask us to confirm what protection may apply to your booking. If you do not receive an ATOL Certificate then the booking will not be ATOL protected. If you do receive an ATOL Certificate but all the parts of your trip are not listed on it, those parts will not be ATOL protected. Please see our booking conditions for information, or for more information about financial protection and the ATOL Certificate go to:
www.atol.org.uk/ATOLCertificate
If you book arrangements other than an ATOL protected flight or a package holiday, the financial protection referred to above does not apply. Our ATOL number is 2582 and our ABTA number is Y0751.
