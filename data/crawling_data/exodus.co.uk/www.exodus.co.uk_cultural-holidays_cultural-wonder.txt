Cultural Wonders

Unearth lost secrets on one of Exodus’ historical sites and archaeological holidays. Our planet is covered with ancient archaeological sites created by civilisations relatively unbeknown to the majority of us. But an Exodus archaeological adventure will unveil their hidden depths and mysteries; with our use of local guides offering the tours an intimate and knowledgeable distinction. Whether it's the Treasury in Petra, The Valley of the Kings in Luxor, The Great Wall in China or Inca Ruins at Machu Picchu Exodus offer over 250 adventures that provide an array of ancient archaeological sites to discover.

In focus:
Imam Square, Iran


“Isfahan’s main square is among the world’s largest, and is something really special. Surrounded by archways leading to bizarres, mosques and palaces on all sides, it's grandiose and the local Iranians hangout in the square on park benches. It’s vibrant and full of life, and the people so friendly and hospitable. It’s amazing being in a place of such politics and culture in the midst of a vast landscape of mountains and deserts. A visit here completely takes you out of yourself and exposes you to something completely new. We sample the amazing local hospitality by eating at a local restaurants and have the opportunity to sample a homemade meal inside one of the cave-dwellings in Maymand.”
