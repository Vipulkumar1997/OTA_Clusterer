Adventure Holidays in Greece

To think of Greece is to think of white-sand beaches, Mediterranean sunshine, and islands forgotten by time. But you don’t have to be a beach bum to enjoy a holiday in Greece. This is a place wrapped in legend, and the country is veritably scattered with wonderous ancient ruins. Exodus will get you way from the crowds, help you take it all in at your own pace. Whether that’s gently walking among the idyllic scenery and remote villages of Paros, Santorini and Naxos, or cycline along the Peloponnese coastline taking in its fascinating classical history and superb variety of landscapes – from the azure blue sea to the green olive trees and vineyards.
And you can trust us to know the tiny tavernas where the real Greeks eat – you know, the ones where the wine is plentiful and the calamari crisp – the myths behind the ancient ruins and epic historic sites, and exactly the right spot to stand on to get that blue-roofed church picture…

In focus: Evia

The island of Evia is one of Greece’s largest, yet at once its least known. Surrounded by cyan seas, beaches and coves, and a mountainous interior of rivers, streams and forests, scattered with ancient monuments, it’s a walkers’ paradise. Each night eat in a different taverna, where succulent octopus, sizzling grilled cheeses, locally produced wines, and golden-hewed honey are all on the menu. There’s marvellous walking here, and a wealth of Byzantine churches and Frankish castles ringed by olive groves, cypress trees and watermills.

















Walking was lovely and easy with enough challenges to enjoy. ...
