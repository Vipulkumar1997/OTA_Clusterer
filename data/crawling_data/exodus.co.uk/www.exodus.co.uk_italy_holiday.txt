Adventure Holidays in Italy

Italy epitomises everything a traveller could want. Sumptuous food, shimmering seas, secluded mountain walks, and a fascinating culture, means holidays in “the beautiful country” – as it’s affectionately known by Italians – certainly pack a punch.

Our Italian holidays take in Roman history, Renaissance art, romantic landscapes and delicious food. We can take you under the skin of the ghostly ruins of Pompeii and the Renaissance city of Florence; explore the iconic Tower of Pisa and floating Venice. But move away from the cities and you’ll find another side to Italy. From walking the breathtaking Amalfi Coast to exploring the Apuane Alps in Tuscany, cross-country skiing in Dobbiaco or a foodie cycling tour through Barolo, there’s so much to explore on an Italy trip.

Highlights of Italy


1. The Amalfi Coast:
with its shimmering sea, soaring cliffs ad sparking coves, Italy’s Amalfi costume is enchanting. From secluded mountain paths to rural farmhouse lunches, our local guides know all Amalfi’s best kept secrets, like just where to get the best slice of pizza, or freshly squeezed lemonade.

2. Tuscany:
here the soft, sumptuous landscape is filled with sunflower yellow, olive green and the scent of cypress trees. Exodus takes you away from the tourists, to unearth the hidden Tuscany – which you can explore by bike or on foot, on a Guided or Self-Guided Adventure.

3. Sicily:
we get under the skin and explore the secrets of Sicily on Exodus holidays to Italy’s largest island. Highlights include its stunning beaches, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, ancient ruins, mediaeval churches and prehistoric caves. And then there’s the food: believed by locals to be the best in Italy it’s truly outstanding.

4. The Dolomite’s Via Ferrata:
in the heart of the Dolomite Mountains, spectacular mountain routes are linked together by a series of fixed cables, ladders and bridges. Ranging from simple to technically difficult, they give the opportunity to explore spectacular mountain scenery on Walking and Trekking Holidays.

5. Puglia:
Located in the heel of Italy’s boot, Puglia will surprise you with its picturesque landscape, ancient hilltop towns, emerald waters, and lush farmlands dotted by ancient olive trees and trullo, strange conical shaped shepherd’s huts.

















This is a very good tour for those who don't wish to walk a long way everyday. Very well...

Cycling in Tuscany with Exodus Travels




Some of the best road cycling in Tuscany can be found in the north of the region. On this trip we discover the iconic city of Pisa, ride through quiet mediaeval villages and the glorious landscape that connects them and savour a huge range of delicious food and wine. What better way to explore the ‘Bel Paese’ (Beautiful Country)?
