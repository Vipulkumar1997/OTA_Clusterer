Adventure Holidays in North America

Make a voyage of discovery into a vast land that encompasses scenic coastlines, majestic mountains, stunning National Parks, and an awe-inspiring variety of wildlife, culture and activities. When it comes to North America holidays, it’s the joy of the journey that matters.

Pioneers have long been drawn to North America’s rugged frontiers, and those travelling here will find lakes, forests, mountains and a rich diversity of wildlife. This is the stuff of legend, and against some of the world’s most impressive backdrops, it won’t be long before you’ve set your inner cowboy free. From the wildlife watching in Alaska, to Canada’s awe-inspiring Rocky Mountains, or exploring some of the world’s most wondrous National Parks in the United States, or Mexico's impressive Mayan ruins, Exodus provides a wide range of adventure and activity holidays across the North American continent.

Top five National Parks in North America

1. The Grand Canyon:
we'll get you there just as the sun is rising causing an explosion of colour, turning the rocks shades of red, orange and bronze. If you're lucky, you might spot Californian condors soaring overhead.

2. Yosemite and Monument Valley:
a wast wilderness area, famed for its waterfalls and giant sequoia trees, known as The Ancient Ones by Native Americans. Hike under the world's largest sandstone cliffs at Zion Canyon, and swim in the clear blue waters of Lake Powell.

3. British Columbia:
Canada’s westernmost province is defined by its Pacific coastline and mountain ranges. There's fantastic hiking and biking trails, as well as camping, and sensational wildlife. Whales and bears are the main attraction.

4. Canadian Rocky Mountains:
the Canadian Rocky Mountains preside over four National Parks, Banff, Jasper, Kootenay and Yoho. Visit them and you’ll have the opportunity to raft, hike, bike and canoe while exploring canyons, glaciers, and mountain passes, as well as the brilliant turquoise waters of Lake Louise.

5. Yellowstone:
spreading across Wyoming, Montana and Idaho, Yellowstone is deep in cowboy country. Here you’ll find everything from colourful meadows with wildflowers and alpine rivers, to mighty canyons and rocky spires, as well as glacial hot springs and explosive geysers, of which Old Faithful is just one.

Where Adventure Begins

Exodus began life in 1974, when two friends got together to provide an overland truck to the Minaret of Jam, the most inaccessible of the world’s great monuments. It was the hippy-trail heyday and the journey from Calais to Kathmandu departed from London in Autumn, returning in Spring. Soon we were also travelling to South Africa, and taking hardy adventurers to the Amazon Basin as well.
