Location













The Achterhoek region


The Achterhoek is a region in the eastern part of the Netherlands, Europe.
Its name (meaning "rear-corner") is geographically appropriate because the area lies in the Eastern-most part of Gelderland, and therefore of the Netherlands, protruding into Germany. The Achterhoek area lies between the rivers IJssel and Oude IJssel, and the borders with the province of Overijssel and Germany the former region of Zutphen County. The region is predominantly rural, with lots of free space, forests and farms. The area around the town of Winterswijk is regarded as very beautiful. A well-known beer originates from this region: Grolsch beer was first brewed in Groenlo in 1615.
