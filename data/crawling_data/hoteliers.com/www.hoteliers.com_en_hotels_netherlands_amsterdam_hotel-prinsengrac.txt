Location













Dam square


During the sixties flower power in the Netherlands was symbolized by the famous Damslapers, a 'bunch of hippies' camping out on Dam square. Nowadays the square has lost a lot of it's former easygoing charm, but it's still one of the points of interest in the city.
Dam square is the physical center of the city ever since the dam was built to keep the Zuiderzee (Southern sea) out. In the middle of the square is the National Monument, dedicated to all victims of war throughout the world. The west side of the square is flanked by the Royal Palace

After getting lost amid the maze that makes up the marvellous city of Amsterdam, you can come home to Hotel Prinsengracht . The Hotel Prinsengracht is situated on of the most well known canals in the city centre, which puts you in the perfect position to access the endless array of highlights and hot spots around town. World-class art museums, theatre and architecture are all here, but simple walking the streets of Amsterdam’s colourful neighbourhoods offers a unique and exciting cultural experience. Enticing and eclectic, you will be drawn down every narrow cobbled road until exhausted, which is when you’ll retire to 1015 Prinsengracht where excellent service, a friendly staff and a well-appointed, comfortable room will restore you for the next day’s adventure.
With so much to do in Amsterdam, why not extend your stay here!

Hotel Prinsengracht is situated on one of Amsterdam’s most beautiful canals. This historical building is located within 10 minutes walk from the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum. The area offers plenty of possibilities to enjoy yourself.
The flower market, shopping area, restaurants, Rembrandtplein and Leidseplein are just within 10 minutes walk from the hotel. The tram is an ideal way to take you to all the interesting places of Amsterdam, and when you stay in our 3 star hotel, you will get to love Amsterdam even more!
