Information about
You are about to book a hotel in Valkenburg. We would therefore like to provide you with some extra information about this beautiful city. Valkenburg, located by the river Geul, is situated in the province of Zuid-Limburg and has about 16,000 inhabitants.

Activities in Valkenburg

Valkenburg is very popular with both domestic and foreign tourists. The city finds its origin in the Roman period. This is confirmed by artifacts and structures which were found in and around Valkenburg. These discoveries prove that this area was highly populated during this period. The city has a lot of historical attractions to offer.
Valkenburg Castle
is probably the most well known. In the past, the city was ruled from this castle. The castle was severely damaged when the French occupied The Netherlands. The remains, however, are definitely worth a visit. You could also choose to go to the
Open Air Theater of Valkenburg
. Here you can see different musicals and plays. Furthermore, the city has a lot of ancient caves and quarries. Such as the Mergel Quarries (
Gemeentegrot
and
Fluweelengrot
),
Roman Catacombs
and the Geulhemmergroeve. It is also recommended to visit
Cave Aquarium Valkenburg
. Here you will find both tropical fish and amphibians. 
Thanks to
Thermae 2000
, the city attracts a lot of spa lovers. This spa is situated on the top op the
Cauberg
. Additionally, there are also loads of fun things to do for kids. You could choose to visit amusement parks
De Valkenier
or
Sprookjesbos Valkenburg
. On top of the Heunsberg, in the
Wilhelminatoren
, you will have a stunning view of the whole area. On clear days it is even possible to see the German city of Aachen and the Belgian city of Liege. A visit to
Castle Den Halder
is also worth it. This castle is situated directly by the river Geul and borders a city park. Lastly, you could also visit the
Broekhem
district. Here you will find the
St. Joseph church
.
