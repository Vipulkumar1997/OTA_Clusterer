Location hotels Amsterdam







Information about
You are about to book a hotel in Amsterdam. We would therefore like to provide you with some information about the city. Amsterdam, situated in the province of Noord-Holland is the capital of The Netherlands. Located by the Amstel river and the IJ harbor, it is the biggest city of The Netherlands with 780,000 inhabitants.

Activities in Amsterdam

Amsterdam is a city with a lot of history. The city was built in the 13th century at the Zuiderzee and by the IJ. The city is known for its beautiful canals. For that reason, a lot of hotels in Amsterdam have settled their selves along one of the many
Canals
. The same canals were placed on the world heritage list of UNESCO in August 2012.

Amsterdam attracts about 4,5 million tourists a year. Most tourists come to Amsterdam because of the large amount of culture and historical sites. Amsterdam has a variety of museums (
Rijksmuseum
,
Stedelijk Museum
,
Van Gogh Museum
,
Scheepvaartmuseum
,
Amsterdam Historic Museum
,
Anne Frank House
etc.) and other historical places (such as the
Begijnhof
and the
Dam Square
). Amsterdam also has a renowned nightlife. Most bars and clubs are located around the
Leidseplein
and
Rembrandtplein
. During the day, you can find a lot of nice shops and fine restaurants in the vibrant city centre. A tour along the canals with a canal boat is a popular daytime activity among the many tourists in Amsterdam. With warm weather, we recommend you to have a drink on one of the many terraces or sit and relax yourself in the
Vondelpark
. Also, the districts
De Pijp
,
de Jordaan
and the 9 Straatjes (9 Streets) are gaining popularity every year. A visit to the
Albert Cuyp Market
is perfect for many snacks, gadgets or just a stroll. Here you will find the typical market sales men from Amsterdam. For the sports lovers among us, there is more than enough to do. At about 20 minutes (with the metro) from the
Central Station
you will find the
Amsterdam Arena
. This is the home of football club AFC Ajax. Here you can get a tour of the stadium or you can watch a match.

Getting there

From
Amsterdam Airport Schiphol
it is very easy to reach the centre of Amsterdam. Depending on which means of transport you travel with (car, taxi, bus or train), it is possible to be in the
city centre
of Amsterdam in about 20 to 30 minutes. In addition, the public transport in Amsterdam is very well-organized. The city counts a lot of bus-, tram- and metro lines that take you to every corner of the city.
