Location













Dam square


During the sixties flower power in the Netherlands was symbolized by the famous Damslapers, a 'bunch of hippies' camping out on Dam square. Nowadays the square has lost a lot of it's former easygoing charm, but it's still one of the points of interest in the city.

Dam square is the physical center of the city ever since the dam was built to keep the Zuiderzee (Southern sea) out. In the middle of the square is the National Monument, dedicated to all victims of war throughout the world. The west side of the square is flanked by the Royal Palace
