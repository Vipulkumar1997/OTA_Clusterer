Hotel Landgoed Het Roode Koper is an estate hidden deep in the woods of the Veluwe, a large Dutch nature reserve. Het Roode Koper is one of the rare spots in the Netherlands where you can enjoy peace, beautiful countryside and a warm, personal welcome in style. A long, winding driveway takes you, straight through the nine-hectare estate, to the monumental Villa.

You can stay overnight in the Villa, the Koetshuis, the Poolse Huis or the Voorhuis. The 30 hotel rooms and separate guest accommodation have recently undergone a major renovation, while retaining their own character. Espresso machines are available in all rooms. The restaurant and sheltered terrace offer views of the romantic gardens and surrounding woodland. The menu offers international, seasonal dishes and in the autumn, there is also an extensive game menu.
