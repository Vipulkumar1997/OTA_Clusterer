Location













Suroundings


Fletcher Hotel Restaurant Erica is situated right in the middle of the woods of Berg en Dal. There are a variety of walking and cycling routes near the hotel which will take you past some of the Rijk van Nijmegen’s – which literally means “The Realm of Nijmegen” – finest natural scenery, such as the Ooij polder, the Millingse Waard, and the rolling landscape of Groesbeek. This part of the Netherlands, also known as “a different country in the heart of the country” is definitely worth visiting.
Nijmegen, which is the oldest city of The Netherlands, is located just a few kilometres from the hotel. You will find plenty of things to do there to fill several days out. For example, the oldest shopping street of Nijmegen with all its interesting shops, Lange Hezelstraat, is certainly a place worth visiting.
The numerous outdoor cafes on Waalkade, the Market Square, or the famous Koningsplein will provide you with a perfect respite after spending a day in the city. Furthermore, Nijmegen has a great variety of restaurants for you to enjoy.
