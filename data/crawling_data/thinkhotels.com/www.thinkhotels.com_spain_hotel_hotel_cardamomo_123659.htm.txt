About the endless plain curd farmland that separates Atienza from SigÃ¼enza, the tiny village of Carabias hides. And there, surrounded by the silence and stones that time has taken over and is Cardamom, recreating the warm and peaceful environment sucking traveller.

Interweaves textures and light from the silent countryside with an atmosphere of interiors starring music and fine textiles in silk and velvet. Outdoor spaces as the romantic square, the secluded garden in the shade of a leafy fig tree and the unmistakable flavor of an old rustic place from which the immensity of arable plain trodden by Don Quixote four centuries can be seen.

Cardamom combines stone, time, colors, touch, spaces, retreat and adventure. An equally open to companies seeking a venue for they can think and create. For these and those, Cardamom represents what Marco Polo said about real or imaginary places:
"A place promised but not yet discovered"
