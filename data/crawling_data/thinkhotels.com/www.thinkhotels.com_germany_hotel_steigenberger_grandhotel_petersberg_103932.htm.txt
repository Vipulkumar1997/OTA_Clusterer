An amazing view over the Rhine Valley and Bonn: the Steigenberger Grandhotel Petersberg and  Guest House of the Federal Government, sits enthroned idyllically like a castle on mountain Petersberg, part of the nature park Siebengebirge. The sophisticated style of the building is continued in the interior of spacious and comfortable 88 rooms and 11 suites. The extensive restaurant and banquet area makes it a very desirable place for extraordinary events.

Whether a boat trip cruising past castles or a sporty adventure in invigorating nature - the beautiful Rhine Valley offers diverse possibilities.

An impressive range of cultural activities awaits you in nearby Bonn: Beethoven?s birthplace, the renowned Opera, or the House of History for example guarantee a first-class programme.  There is no other, more luxurious way of spending a weekend in the countryside and at the same time near the city.
