Transportation





Getting to and from Dubai is easy. Dubai International Airport handles flights from more than 200 destinations around the world, from 130 scheduled airlines. It’s easy to get around in Dubai. Dubai has a fully-automated, driverless Metro rail system, with two lines linking much of the city. There is also an extensive bus network, with services throughout Dubai, and also to other emirates. Other transport options in Dubai include the Abras - boats that link both sides of The Creek.











Shop for designer clothes, luxury goods or the latest gadgets in the shopping malls, or head to the souks of the old town to buy fabrics and spices, and get a glimpse at the city’s trading roots - Dubai offers a multitude of exciting and varied shopping options. The city’s malls come in all shapes and sizes, and thanks to their air conditioning are great places to go to escape the heat of the day. They include the world’s largest shopping mall, the Dubai Mall, which boasts 1,200 stores and received 65 million visitors in 2012. Well-known stores in the Dubai Mall include Bloomingdale’s, Debenhams, Galeries Lafayette and Marks & Spencer.
Elsewhere, the Al Satwa area of Dubai is full of streets with stores selling textiles and household goods, as well as a number of tailors. The Al Karama area is good for bargain hunting for clothes and gifts. Bur Dubai is a good area to look for computers and other electronic items.





Dubai

Attractions





Whether you want to stare at spectacular skyscrapers, disappear from civilisation on a desert adventure, laze on a beach, shop ‘til you drop, or wander through timeless souks, Dubai is a year-round destination that is sure to satisfy your needs.



Dubai is the second largest of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, and is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf. Dubai has land borders with the emirates of Abu Dhabi and Sharjah, as well as the Sultanate of Oman.



Perhaps the most famous attraction in Dubai is the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building. Visitors can travel up to an observation deck on the 124th floor of the 829-metre high tower. Other well-known landmarks in Dubai include the Jumeirah Mosque, and The World, a collection of man-made islands in the Gulf designed to look like a map of the world.
For a glimpse of the past, head down to The Creek, where cargo is still loaded onto dhows ready to be shipped to markets in Africa, the Middle East and Asia.




Dubai also has a number of museums, parks and beaches, or you can escape the city and head out into the desert on a dune driving adventure or explore a Bedouin village. You can even take part in winter sports - inside a massive indoor ski centre. Whatever you’re looking for, Dubai seems to offer it.
