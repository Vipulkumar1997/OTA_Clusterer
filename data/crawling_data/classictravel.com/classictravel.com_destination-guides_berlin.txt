There is no shortage of luxury hotels in Berlin.  Here on our destintion guide we provide booking links to only the best hotels in Berlin.  Berlin has always been noted as a city that aspires to excess. As the culturual capital of Germany, there are at least 150 museums, some housed in former palatial residences or wonderful restaurants, as well as four major symphony orchestras, three opera houses and numerous chamber orchestras which perform at different venues throughout the year. However, if your cultural tastes lean toward the modern or the wild, be sure to come in July for the Love Parade, when the clubs of Berlin parade their "scene and sound." Every type of bar is represented, and plenty of love permeates the air. It's no wonder that half of the 3.4 million residents are under the age of 35.

Built between 1865 and 1876 on the orders of Friedrich Wilhelm IV, designed by Friedrich August Stuler, this imposing museum is one of the five structures that make up the National Gallery. During WWII, many of the works in the museum were separated and taken to West Berlin or Russia. After a three-year closure from 1998 - 2001, the museum was restored and masterpieces reunited, creating one of the largest and riches collections of its kind in the world.

www.lecrocobleu.com
Le Croco Bleu is in a former engine room of a 19th century brewery.  The decor features Teardrop crystal chandeliers, exposed pipes, disused machinery, taxidermied beasts and glass vitrines of aged liquors.  However, the real draw are the cocktails that are prepared with the utmost precision.

Kitkat Club
BessemerstraBe 4 Schonberg
Tel. +49 (0) 30.217.3680
www.kitkatclub.de
Some nights it's about fashion; other nights it's sleaze. We honestly hope you get to see the latter. To the beat of heavy techno, any fetish is fair game at Kitkat. From couture latex to all nude, the dress code leaves no survivors. Monday, the most insane, is Gay night and the squeamish need not appear.
Berghain
Friedrichshain
www.berghain.de
After 3AM this is billed as "clubbers' paradise." This huge disco often does not close until the afternoon. The reputation is that it is decadent with parties being sexually uninhibited. Sunday is the "hot" time to go.  If you gotta dance, this is the place and those that have to work on Monday, spend Sunday afternoon here.
Victoria Bar
102 Potsdamer Strasse
Tel. +49.30.2575.9977
www.victoriabar.de
