Banyan Tree Samui
Reflecting traditional Thai-style architecture, the villas are elevated structures with steep roofs where indoor living spaces flow into outdoor salas. A perfect synthesis of time-honored Thai design hallmarks and contemporary concepts, the aesthetically balanced interiors feature fine juxtapositions of natural rattan and bamboo furniture with brightly hued Thai silk accents. Each villa is appointed with modern comforts such as air-conditioning, a LCD TV, DVD player, stereo system and wireless internet connection. Considerate touches such as pillow selection, turndown services and an extensive bath menu further enhance your holiday experience. Other amenities available include private pools, sun beds and in-villa dining. The Rainforest spa: Indulge your senses with a range of hydrothermal experiences, designed to complement spa treatments for a truly holistic wellness experience.
