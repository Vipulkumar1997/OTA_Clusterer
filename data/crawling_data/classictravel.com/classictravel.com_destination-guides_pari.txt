With the water of the River Seine winding through the Gothic streets of Paris, it is not hard to understand why the City of Light has become an embodiment of romance and elegance.
Every year, Paris attracts throngs of visitors—repeated and first timers—interested in discovering and uncovering new facets of the diverse Parisian culture. Monuments such as the Notre Dame Cathedral or the Arc de Triomphe are not only tourist haunts, but also work as integral components of the Paris landscape, giving the city a sense of beauty and history. Filled with cafes and exquisite restaurants, visitors can spend the day people watching and feasting on the native cuisine. Upscale fashion houses line the streets of the Champs Elysees and St-Germain-des-Pres districts, as well as Avenue Montaigne; and some the world’s finest art museums!  For those interested in jazz and cabaret, Paris provides an escape to the colorful Bohemian scene, while the Opera de la Bastille is a destination for classic and refined opera fans.
While visiting, be prepared to walk to get the best sense of the scenery and culture. Wander the cobblestone streets of Montmartre where the Basilique du Sacre-Coeur sits atop the Parisian horizon like a gigantic white crown.  Make sure to amble along the River Seine as the sun drops and the sky blossoms into a warm pink hue; city lights will begin to spring up along the streets, and, in the background, one may catch a glimpse of the Eiffel Tower as it begins to glitter.

Museum d'Orsay
http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/overview.html
The history of the museum, of its building is quite unusual. In the centre of Paris on the banks of the Seine, opposite the Tuileries Gardens, the museum was installed in the former Orsay railway station, built for the Universal Exhibition of 1900. So the building itself could be seen as the first "work of art" in the Musee d'Orsay, which displays collections of art from the period 1848 to 1914
CineAqua
2 Avenue des Nations Unies
Tel. +33.1.40.692323
www.cineaqua.com
An innovative aquarium in Jardin du Trocadero that combines marine life with multi-media installations.
Musee des Art Decoratifs
107 Rue de Rivoli
Tel. 33.1.44.55.5750
www.lesartsdecoratifs.fr

France's history of interior design is world-renowned and Musee des Arts Decoratifs' reopening will have the "decorators" of the world flocking. With ten period rooms including Louis XVI, a gothic chamber and an art deco one, decorative ideas run amok. Lalique crystal, Sevres porcelain and Christofle silver are also on display. One very interesting part of the museum is a gallery with more then 12,000 toys. You know where to send the kids while you redecorate.
Paris Museum
Musee du Quai Branly
15 rue Jean-Baptiste Berlier
Tel. 01.56.61.70.00
www.quaibranly.fr

In a city of museums, a new one opened in June and holds its own against the city’s best. A museum dedicated to civilizations of Africa, South America, Oceana and Asia, the Branly is hidden behind a wall of dense greenery – the "vertical garden" – is a nice break from the all the stone grandeur.
Chateau de Versailles
Tel. 01.30.84.74.00
www.chateauversailles.fr/en/

Originally a mere hunting lodge, Louis XIV transformed this castle into a spectacular palace. Just southwest of the city, it has been carefully restored to the magnificence of the days of Marie Antoinette.
Opera Bastille
Place de la Bastille, 12th Arrondissement
Tel. 01.44.73.13.99 (Information) / 01.44.73.13.00 (Reservations)
www.operadeparis.fr
The 2700-seat auditorium makes for a cozier environment than other theaters but it also creates a high demand for tickets. Leave the walls of Opera Garnier and swing on over to the Bastille for more upbeat tastes.
Bateaux Parisiens (Sodexho Alliance)
Port de la Bourdonnais, 75007
Tel. 01.44.11.33.44
www.bateauxparisiens.com/english/main2.htm

Take a delightful cruise along the Seine ensconced in a comfortable glassed-in trimaran. A hostess adds commentary about what’s happening in town, including exhibits, festivals and special events. There are special programs for children, or for that special someone, a romantic dinner cruise.
Gustave-Moreau Museum
14, rue de La Rochefoucauld
Tel. +33 (1) 48.74.3850
www.musee-moreau.fr
This gem of a museum may not be as well known as others but that’s the whole point.  It is special because the artist himself, Gustave Moreau, established and designed it. Everything was built at his expense so his works are displayed the way he wanted.  He died two years after finishing it in 1896.  Seeing it now has a greater impact as the bathrooms are vintage and the library really fantastic; and of course there is the art with over 1200 paintings and 12,800 drawings.
The Catacombs
http://www.catacombes.paris.fr/en/homepage-catacombs-official-website
The Catacombs, which form a veritable labyrinth beneath the very heart of Paris, were created in the galleries of the former quarries whose stone was used to build the capital. Situated twenty metres below ground, the equivalent of a five stroy building, the ossuary contains the remains of approximately six million Parisians, transferred there gradually between the late eighteenth and mid-nineteenth century. The constant temperature is 14C or approximately 57F. The average tour is 45 minutes.




Compiegne
Just one hour from Paris this wonderful town has two chateaus, a 36,000 acre forest with 600 miles of trails, charming timbered houses, cobblestoned pedestrian streets and offbeat museums. It is also where the treaty ending WW1 was signed and where 22 years later Hitler forced the French to sign their capitulation to the Nazi's.

Chateau de Pierrefonds
Rue Viollet-le-Duc
Tel. +33 44.42.72.72
http://pierrefonds.monuments-nationaux.fr/en/
This stage set of a chateau was built in the 15th century by Philippe d' Orleans but demolished and rebuilt by Napoleon III.  It is clearly the intrepretion of his architect, Eugene Viollet-le-Duc,  of what a midieval castle should look like.  It is said to be the castle that inspired Walt Disney's animated movie "Sleeping Beauty"

Chateau Chantilly
7, Rue du Connectable
60500 Chantilly, France
Tel. +33.3.44.27.31.80
http://www.chateaudechantilly.com/en
Just one hour from Paris and 30 minutes from Charles de Gaulle airport is one of the most amazing Chateau’s in the world.  Most visitors to Paris think of Versailles and do not realize that one of the greatest collection of paintings outside the Louvre resides here.  There is so much to see, both indoors and out (the gardens are sublime) and if you want to spend the night it may not be in the Chateau but very close.
Check the website for more details.
Chateau Vaux le Vicomte
http://www.vaux-le-vicomte.com/en
This magnificient Chateau is about one hour southeast of Paris.  Built in 1661 and privately owned the chateau is well worth the visit. The French formal garden was designed by Andre Le Notre who also designed the Versailles gardens and covers 82 acres.






Where to dine in Paris can be and is often serious business for the "foodie".  No where else is the combination of dining and theatre so evident, especially at those establishments that are deemed "Haute Cuisine".  The best hotels usually have at least one restaurant of this calibre.  All are well known by any reputable concierge or your travel agent.
While the following may not be "haute" they are all special and we have, of course,  posted their respective websites for you to peruse.   At the bottom of this page we've also listed some of Paris's more notable bistro/brasseries.
Drouant
18, place Gaillon. 2nd
Tel. +33 (0)1 42.65.1516
www.drouant.com
While it's great to dine under the seascape ceiling by Emile Ruhlmann,  it's even better to sample the Alsace cuisine of Chef Antoine Westermann who took over in 2006.  Especially noted is the novel appetizer plate which is a combination of terrine of skate, scallop in creamy parsnip and lime juice and raw sardines marinated in citrus juice and honey.
Hiramatsu
52, rue de Longchamp,
Tel. + 33 (0)1.56.81.0880
www.hiramatsu.co.jp/lang_french/

The French-Japanese fusion food here is sublime. In keeping with the best of  Paris restaurants, Hiramatsu is an exceptional example. There is only one seating so come prepared to enjoy an evening where every thing is beautifully presented and served. Advanced reservations are a must.
Goumard
9, rue Duphot, 1st
Tel. +33 (0) 1 42.60.3607
www.goumard.com
The aquariums are by Lalique, the bathrooms furnishings by Majorelle and the egraved mirrors by Labourer.  The private dining room for two, Prunier, is the ultimate romantic venue. This is a classic seafood restaurant and chef Olivier Guyon is amazing and, if all else fails, there is wine list comprising 170 varieties of Champagne.
Le Cafe Moderne
40, rue Notre-Dame-des-Victoires. 2nd
Tel. +33 (0) 1 53.40.8410
http://www.le-moderne.fr/en/
Although this is great for lunch it takes on a different character at night as it attracts more of a local crowd.  The modern and contemporary design features art work that is changed frequently.  Benoit Herault, the chef since 2005, has put together an elegant menu featuring fusion dishes such as pressed foie gras with leeks in hazelnut oil.
Maceo
15, rue des Petits-Champs. 1st
Tel. +33 (0) 1 42.97.5385
www.maceorestaurant.com
Named after Maceo Parker, a great jazz and funk saxophonist, this restaurant attracts an international crowd that prefers traditional French cuisine.  Vegetarians will be pleased as the menu offers inventive meatless choices.
La Mediterranee
2, place de l'Odeon. 6th
Tel. +33 (0) 1 43.26.0230
www.la-mediterranee.com
The location facing the Odeon Theatre is one that is preferred by many. At night it is one of those places that attracts showbiz people and similar types which makes for good people watching.  Happily the chef, Denis Rippa, trained at Taillevent has made sure that everything is fresh especially the seafood. The most famous dish is carpaccio of wild sea bass with Meux mustard and herb-spread bread.
1728
8 rue d'Anjou
Tel. +33.1.4017.0477
www.restaurant-1728.com
This city of romance has another dining venue to celebrate an engagement or perhaps your current affaire!  A series of drawing rooms in an 18th century town house have been beautifully transformed into combination art gallery/restaurant.  There are fabulous paintings, Venetian chandeliers, satin drapes and had-painted silk wallpaper everywhere.  Lunch which is a bargain at 35Euro pre fixe is more about business persons dining but dinner is another story.  Then when all the candles are lit, and chef Geraldine Rumeau presents superb Japanese and French fusion, is the time you will want to be there with someone special. This is not a place to be seen but rather a repose with someone you want a private evening with.
Le Saut du Loup
107, rue de Rivoli
Tel. +33 (01) 42.25.49.55
www.lesautduloup.com

Tel. +33 1 43 26 4826

Early 20th century vintage brasserie is the imagined and real. The decor, fringed lamps and tufted velvet booths, is charming if a bit outdated.  The roast lamb in a velvety sage-scented sauce is wonderful.  The st
eak tartare is also a favorite of returning diners.
