Banyan Tree Mayakoba
Located on the southeastern shore of Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula
, this resort village sits along
Mexico's Riviera Maya
. Mayakoba, also known as "Village on Water" in ancient Mayan, is the Venice of the Caribbean coast. A harmonious blend of nature and luxury, it promises to inspire and enrapture, forever redefining the meaning of resort living. A traveller's haven with pristine coastlines overlooking azure waters, this historic peninsula offers delightful rustic corners as well as exquisite ancient reasures. Feel the cares of the modern world melt away as you unwind and take in the beauty of the lush surroundings. Discover exotic floral and fauna amidst the jungles of the legendary Mayan empire nearby. Take the plunge into its refreshing waters and be captivated by the world's second largest coral reef. Float on the crystal lagoons in your own private casita and find jungle clearings parting to reveal world-class gold courses, spas, restaurants and beaches - all within 30 minutes from
Cancun International Airport
.
