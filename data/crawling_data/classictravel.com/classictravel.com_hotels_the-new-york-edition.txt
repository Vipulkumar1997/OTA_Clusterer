The New York EDITION
The New York EDITION brings together lasting comfort, extraordinary style and an exceptional level of service in a uniquely individual environment. Located in the heart of New York City’s Flatiron District, steps from Madison Square Park, the hotel seamlessly blends the integrity and character of a prestigious landmark building with a simple, sophisticated design sensibility. Originally built in 1909 as the headquarters for The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the historic 41-story clock tower offers jaw-dropping 360-degree views of Manhattan and is an iconic landmark against the city skyline.
The New York EDITION
