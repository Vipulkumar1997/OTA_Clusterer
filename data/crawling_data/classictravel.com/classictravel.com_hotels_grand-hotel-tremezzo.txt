Grand Hotel Tremezzo
Built in 1910 and celebrating its Centenary in 2010, the
Grand Hotel Tremezzo
is one of the most charming luxury hotels on Lake Como – a vintage symbol of Italian hospitality and a place-to-be to enjoy the flavor of real vacation.
The
Grand Hotel Tremezzo
boasts the best view on Lake Como and an unmatched combination of contemporary and old-time hallmarks that make up a perfect holiday setting. With its 100 windows overlooking either the blue waters of the lake or the flowering greenery of the garden, the
Grand Hotel Tremezzo
provides a comprehensive, multifarious array of comforts: 88 elegant rooms, 2 splendid suites, a lakefront classic-style lido with a private Venetian Lancia boat, and 3 breathtaking pools (one floating on the lake, one indoor infinity). To top it all, the luxurious T Spa with a zero sight-line panoramic relaxation lounge, a 2-acre lush secular park incorporating a health-path, a floodlit clay tennis court, fitness and saunas, and five different restaurants and snack bars to seduce all palates.
Other signature features conjure up to the unique appeal of this family-owned property, benefiting of a strategic location that blends exclusivity and proximity: facing Bellagio and the Riviera delle Azalee, Milan with its international airports and boutiques is only 1-hour driving distance.
The Grand Hotel Tremezzo
is a member of exclusive Virtuoso travel network. Book online or contact our Virtuoso Travel Advisor
