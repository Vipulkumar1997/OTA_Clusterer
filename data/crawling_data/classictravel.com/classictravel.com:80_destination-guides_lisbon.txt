For years, Lisbon was the major commerce link between Asia, Europe and the Americas. Though slow to modernize, this enchanting city by the sea is in the midst of a renaissance, and during Expo '98, the city transformed itself with newly built roads, real estate development projects and the unveiling of the new Ponte Vasco de Gama bridge. We love the hip, Bairro Alto area, filled with a young, stylish crowd and creative restaurants, bars and cutting-edge boutiques. Lisbon has changed with the times to become a diverse, modern city, yet has never let go of its classic, old world, charming style.
