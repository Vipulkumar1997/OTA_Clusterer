Originally a quiet fishing village situated at the banks of the Yangtze River, Shanghai has transformed into China’s largest and most sophisticated city. It serves as the country’s major cultural, commercial and financial hub, and often draws comparisons to Paris and New York City.  Shanghai, home to the world's tallest hotel, has more that 2,000 skyscrapers designed by the world famous architects in it, as well as stirring businesses and huge shopping scenes. With luxury hotels, trendy nightlife and exceptional restaurants, Shanghai attracts more and more visitors every year, all eager to sample the finest parts of China.

During a visit here, make sure to visit several neighborhoods including the Bund, a waterfront city that attracts locals to do their morning routine including tai chi and ballroom dancing, and Yandan Lu Pedestrian Street recently renovated with modern fixtures and shops.

Mr. & Mrs. Bund has the feel of the older Western restaurants in Shanghai, but with much better food.  French-born Chef Paul Pairet settled here to offer his unique take on French and local Shanghai style cooking. The menu offers a huge range of selections from the adventurous tuna mousse in a can to the sous vide prepared black cod served with a beautiful Cantonese-style sauce.  The Long Short Rib is also a special treat for two, deliciously encrusted with a teriyaki glaze.  Be sure to check out the nightclub Bar Rouge above then come back down to try Mr. & Mrs. Bund's late night menu of frog legs with garlic coulis and the Mr. Bund OR the Mrs. Bund croque.

Xin Tiandi is a 2-block pedestrian mall with enough good eating to require weeks to experience it all. The best one to try and also one which you will need reservations for is Crystal Jade.  The specialty is without a doubt the steamed dumplings in broth (xialong bao).  Also the steamed pork dumplings and hand pulled noodles (lamian). This is authentic Cantonese cuisine at it's best.

Nightlife in Shanghai is like the city itself: constantly changing. Here is a small list of the current venues.
The Glamour Bar
6/F, No.5 The Bund ( corner of Guangdong Lu )
Tel. (86-21) 6350-9988 (office hours)
(86-21) 6322-0099 (most other hours)
www..m-theglamourbar.com
This glamorous salon has stunning views as a backdrop, sexy and sensuous interiors -- and a dazzling array of events and entertainment: from cultural readings and Sunday film sessions to smash it up shock rock; wicked drag shows to live acoustic performance; cabaret strip tease to modern ballet; public debates and lots more. And the views are Fantastic!
Kee Club
796 Huaihai Road
Tel. +86.21.3395-0888
www.keeclub.com
This new club is actually a branch of the one in Hong Kong.  There the reputation is that of a place where high society likes to hang. However, Shanghai has just opened and for the time being is accessable to the general public. The bar is great but if you go its worth booking a table at their more formal French dining room.
Attica Shanghai
15 Zhongshan Dong Er Lu
Tel. +86.21.6373-3588
www.attica-shanghai.com
There is no shortage of night spots in Shanghai!  This is one you will want to see.  It is actually adjoined to a restaurant called Finistre so you can have dinner there as well.  The terrace is huge and decorated in a Zen inspired theme.  However, here again it is the views that are completely mesmorizing. Looking down on the Bund and at the fururistic skyline of Pudong across the river.
Bar Rouge
7F, Bund 18
Tel. 021.6339.1199
www.bar-rouge-shanghai.com
You have to take the elevator and then stairs, Bar Rouge is worth it. A happening decadent Shanghai hotspot, Bar Rouge offers a terrace with special views and a pyrotechnics show the bartenders put on periodically; all this and the fun crowd makes for a great evening.
Cotton Club

99 Nanchang Road
Tel: +852.2810.1272 (reservations through Hong Kong office)

The 6,000 sq ft space is close to the famous strip of clubs in Fuxing Park. Admission to the weekly sessions is strictly members-only and A-list.
