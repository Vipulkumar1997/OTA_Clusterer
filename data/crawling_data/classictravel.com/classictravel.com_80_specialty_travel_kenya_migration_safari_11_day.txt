Kenya Migration Safari 11-Day

Park East



Tweet




















At A Glance


Seeing the migration is a dream of any nature-buff. On our Migration Safari we’ve scheduled four full days in Kenya’s Masai Mara Reserve, which puts you in prime position with the best chance of seeing the great herds. Of course, there cannot be absolute guarantees, since migratory patterns differ somewhat each year, but the chances are outstanding. Part of the fun is the excitement of discovery--you never know exactly what you’re going to see. Each day holds something different and unexpected. Perhaps you’ll have the good luck of seeing thousands of wildebeest cross and re-cross the Mara River. You may well see lions hunting. Maybe you’ll watch a cheetah pursue a gazelle at 70 miles an hour. Whatever you do, you’ll have a glimpse of the world as it existed a million years ago.
