Amandayan
Arranged around calm courtyards, Amandayan’s dwellings are imbued with the clean lines and the architectural aesthetic of the indigenous Nakhi people using locally sourced materials, including Yunnan pine and elm from Dong Bei.
Known as the Land of Eternal Spring for its exceptionally mild climate, China’s southwestern Yunnan province is bordered by Tibet, Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam and is famed for limestone plateaus, snow-capped peaks and rushing rivers.
An ancient city, Lijiang’s Old Town, Dayan, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Perched in the center, above the roofline on Lion Hill, Amandayan overlooks an intricate bridge and canal system and dramatic mountainous landscape.
Discover rich natural beauty on a trek through Tiger Leaping Gorge or horseback ride through a wildflower meadow. In Lijiang, the narrow lanes and 354 bridges reveal heritage, architecture and culture that dates back centuries.
