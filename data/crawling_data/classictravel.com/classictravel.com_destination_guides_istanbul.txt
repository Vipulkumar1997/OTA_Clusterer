Istanbul's geographic location becomes extremely symbolic in understanding the fusion of cultures and religions found in the city.  It is the only city in the world that connects two continents. Its geographic symbolism reflects the merging of Christianity and Islam, religion and secularism, traditional Anatolian culture and modern civilization. In addition to these cultural aspects, the city offers a wide variety of amazing experiences. Take a Bosphorus cruise, stroll the quiet streets around the Sultanahmet Mosque in the evening, and hold your breath as you plunge into the mayhem of the Grand Bazaar. To catch a break from Middle Eastern culture, go to Nisantasi or ferry to the Asian side to Bagdat Cadesi where the highest luxury European shopping boutiques are fronted by Ferraris and Mercedes. Don’t forget to visit a hamam or Turkish bath, which is an exfoliating cultural experience.
ClassicTravel.com is pleased to offer you this easy and concise destination guide to Istanbul.  Click on each tab to find some of the best of what the city has to offer.  Whenever possible we not only suggest the best restaruants for dining but also supply the link so you  can check out the menu yourself. We do the same so you can really check out the hot nighlife scene in this facinating city on two continents.

Built as an Eastern Orthodox church in the 4th century, converted to a mosque in 1453, then turned into a museum by the modern Turkish state, the Hagia Sofia truly embodies the conversion of civilizations in one sprawling space. The light in the Hagia Sofia refracts mystically in the nave, and beautiful Islamic calligraphy sits directly on top of ancient Byzantine mosaics.

While it is not the oldest mosque in the world, its six minarets still display a great example of Ottoman architecture during the early part of the 17th century, the golden age of Ottoman Empire architecture. Stop for tea and a game of tavla (backgammon) at one of the garden cafes nearby.
