Q. What's the difference between Madrid and every other city in the world? A. Madrid.

A city unlike any other, the capital of Spain has some of the most beautiful parks and recreational venues anywhere. It also has the Prado museum, which in itself is enough of a reason to visit more than once. Of course, there’s great food, but the new trend here is the Heladería, or ice cream parlor. These old staples are being reinvented in Madrid, becoming more stylish and adding a lounge feel, offering cocktails as well as around 40 flavors of great ice cream. Madrid eats late so don't plan on dinner before 10 pm or you'll be dining alone.

Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza
Paseo del Prado 8
Tel. +34 (0) 91.369.0151
www.museothyssen.org

The 800 or so pieces in this collection used to be on display in relative obscurity at a villa in Lugano, Switzerland, until 1895, and comprised perhaps the finest private art collection in the world. This is a distilled version of great world museums that track many movements of Western art, such as the Met in New York. Here, the visitor gets more variety from world-class painters in a much smaller space than the Prado, from 13th century Italian to 20th century American pop art. You might say this collection houses lesser-known works from the best masters, and the best works from minor masters.
Prado Museum
Paseo del Prado
Tel. +34 (0) 91.330.2800

The Prado is the joy of Madrid.To see canvases of this magnitude close up is reason enough to travel to the city. After you see Velazquez's painting "Las Meninas" you will want to see it again and again. The museum contains 9000 works of art but only 1500 are displayed at any one time, just another reason to go back.
