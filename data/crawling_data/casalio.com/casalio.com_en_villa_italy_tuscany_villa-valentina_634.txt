Villa Valentina, Italiy, Tuscany, Province of Florence, Montaione - 8-12 Persons, private pool

This superbly renovated Villa enjoys a spectacular position.

Totally private and perched on the very crest of a small hill top, surrounded by ancient Tuscan cypress trees, Villa Valentina dominates the outlying countryside and offers the most breathtaking views. All around the house Mediterranean terraces lead down into the fields and woodlands.


Description:

The entrance hall runs from one side of the house to the other, and through the façade of three south facing, full length, double glass doors you can continue onto the cotto paved portico and directly poolside.

To the left of the hall a spacious sitting room with master fireplace. The sitting room too runs full width of the house with windows on all sides. A beautifully sunny spot all seasons.

Across the entrance hall and then to the right, an archway leads into a large, south and west facing, formal dining area that overlooks the pool and panorama. Off the main dining room there is a further small reception room which can be delightfully used for breakfast or lunch as it leads to the incredibly daring glass fronted kitchen! No untidy chefs allowed! A fantastically equipped, cool beige, restaurant style kitchen is in full view as its east facing full glass front, with double doors, looks over the patio and veranda terrace.

A full guest bathroom and then utility/laundry room with ample storage space lie between the kitchen and small dining room.

An old stone staircase leads up to 5 full double bedrooms and one smaller twin bedroom painted in two tone pastel colours, 6 ensuite bathrooms one of which with tub. High up, with great views and large windows the bedrooms make the best of sunrise and sunset with three of the rooms facing east and and two facing southwest.

With a fascinating position, the south facing pool at the Villa runs the whole length of the house and can be seen from almost every room. Bordered by a terracotta paved solarium, the fantastically pitched infinity pool lies right next to the house and literally on the edge of the tree topped crest. Mosaic tiled, roman steps lead down into the water and a spa bath sits on the west facing end. Such an inviting way of watching the sun go down, over drinks maybe!

The south and westerly facing portico is perfect for shady relaxing pool side and informal dining. Towards the front of the house, east and west facing, the large Tuscan loggia veranda provides a wonderful space for entertaining. Strategically placed, not only does the loggia provide wonderful dawn and twilight views, it also overlooks the front entrance and courtyard towards the glass fronted kitchen

The furnishings and finishings are all of excellent quality and very tastefully designed. All rooms are decorated in quite vibrant pastels which are beautifully luminous. Luxury Italian fabrics are coordinated throughout and the furniture is solid, yet in an elegant Tuscan country style. Naturally all rooms of the villa are air-conditioned.

A perfect property for entertaining, superbly positioned, the Villa is a sophisticated venue for family reunions, celebrations, parties and professional events.

The Villa is a staffed property sleeping up to 12 guests. Maid service is provided daily Monday – Friday. Villa Cook or Chef service on request. Gardener once weekly and daily pool maintenance.

On a note for children:
The spacious indoor ground floor areas offer great floor space for children to play and given the proximity of the pool to the house they can be kept instantly in view although as always children need to be watched.

Being a traditional old villa, the Villa boasts flowering pots and terracotta portico and flagstone courtyard. With the garden terraces very close to the house however it is quite easy to keep children in sight. The terraced garden is poolside and is fenced around the bottom terrace. Particularly small children should be kept in view when poolside or when playing in the garden.
