Empowering people to get more out of life

Life at trivago isn’t exactly conventional – our cultural backgrounds are different, our skillsets are different, we speak different languages, and yet we are cohesively working together in one global family toward one common goal.

We celebrate our failures along with our successes, because it brings us one step closer to a solution

We would rather inspire, empower and nurture others to be authentic and pursue their dreams, rather than control them.

We seek to hire individuals that are comfortable working in an entrepreneurial environment and a flat organizational structure that rewards those who take initiative, learn, take risks and innovate.

We recruit across multiple continents, with two-thirds of our employees comprised of over 50 nationalities.

Internally, we distill our values into six core qualities




Trust


We believe success is built by getting to know and trusting those around you. We do a lot to facilitate open communication to build an environment in which trust can develop, so that our conversations are straightforward, honest and raw.




Authenticity


Be yourself, be authentic, and be known for what you do. It’s clear that you will accomplish a lot more if you’re able to be yourself and do what makes you happy.





Entrepreneurial passion


We are all passionate, curious, and want to see the projects we love come to life. We are motivated by our own determination.







Power of proof


We’re only confident in what has been proven. Placing proof above status helps to keep the game fair so that everyone has equal opportunity to make a big impact.




Focus


In a world of endless possibilities, we try to draw attention to what’s most important. We put our energy into effort and efficiency than into perfection – while staying focused on the big picture.











Fanatic Learning


In today's landscape, it's not about what you know, but how you learn. We believe if you stand still, you get left behind, which is why we constantly broaden our horizons and change perspectives.
