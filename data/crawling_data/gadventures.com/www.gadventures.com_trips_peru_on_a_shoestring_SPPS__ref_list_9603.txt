From
CHF 19.00
Get to know "the White City" and the surrounding area on a panoramic bus tour. Stop at picturesque viewpoints to capture the surrounding volcanoes, marvel at the white volcanic sillar rock architecture, and fall in love with Arequipa's cityscapes.
Flight over Nazca Lines
                        
                            -
From
CHF 117.00
Take to the skies for the best view of the enigmatic Nazca Lines, a series of patterns and pictures etched in the ground, crisscrossing a wide area of flat desert. Marvel at the lines measuring up to 10km (6 mi) in length, yet, remaining perfectly straight. See depictions of birds, insects, and animals only recognizable from the air. Decide for yourself the origin of the lines – who drew the lines, and why, remains a mystery. Current beliefs suggest that they may be part of complex agricultural calendar.
