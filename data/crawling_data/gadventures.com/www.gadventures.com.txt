Making the world a better place is easy. All you have to do is have the time of your life.
G Adventures has defined (and redefined) small group travel for 25 years. Travelling with us is the very best way to get up close and personal with your planet in a way you’d never manage on your own. And when you travel with us, you support local communities and help make the world a little bit better for everyone. Welcome to a World of Good.

Whatever your style,
see it your way
Everyone loves to travel, but not everyone loves to travel the same way. G Adventures Travel Styles gather trips of a feather together so you can spend less time searching and more time dreaming about where you’ll go next.

The original group adventure-travel tour operator
Why adventure travel?
Adventure travel is more than a vacation. It’s a chance to get to know your world better by putting yourself on a first-name basis with the people, places, and things that make it worth exploring. This is your planet. Come and get it.
Why G Adventures?
We’re the small-group adventure travel experts, and have been for over 20 years. We got that way by listening to travellers and giving them what they want: Top-notch tours in top-notch places with top-notch staff at great prices.
Why small-group travel?
The world opens up a little more for a small group than it does for a solo traveller or a big-bus tour. Small groups offer security, access, camaraderie, and an affinity with your destination than you’ll get by travelling any other way.
