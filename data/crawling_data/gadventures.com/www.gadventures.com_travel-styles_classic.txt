Go everywhere. Meet everyone. Do everything.
Looking for that sweet spot between independent backpacking and organized group tours? Congratulations; you found it. Classic tours combine the support and security of group travel, unbeatable variety, and the flexibility to go off-script when fate says, “Hey, let’s do this.”
Small-group travel done differently (and right)
Make your trip your own
Our CEOs can adjust the itinerary on-the-fly to pursue those you-really-had-to-be-there moments. No departure is alike, and that’s just how we like it.
Strangers today, friends tomorrow
Small-group travel has benefits going solo doesn’t: camaraderie, insider access, logistical support, and an instant posse of travelling companions.
Unbeatable variety
Every tour delivers an unbeatable mix of highlights, uncommon experiences, cultural contact, and active experiences. Come with an open mind. We’ll fill it up.

Tristan didn’t think group travel was for him. Then he tried it.

to Tristan, a Frenchman in his late twenties who’s done his fair share of backpacking. He’d had his eye on Turkey for a while, but wasn’t wild about sorting out all the do-it-yourself hassles this time around. How did we turn an independent spirit into a group traveller? Easy: We let him try it.

“
Going with a group opened up Turkey in a way I wouldn’t have found by myself. I explored an underground city, met with an imam, ate a home-cooked Cappadocian meal, and stayed overnight in a traditional family home, all in a single day. You can’t top access like that.

Everything, everywhere, all the time
For experienced travellers like Tristan, the surface stuff just isn’t enough. They want to dig into a place and figure out what makes it tick. That’s the mindset that powers every Classic trip; a solid mix of the highlights you came for and loads of experiences you never even knew you could do, all arranged and handled by a connected local expert.

“
There were some pretty interesting characters in my group, and it was fun to watch all the different personalities come together. It added a new dimension to travelling.

Always in good company
When you travel by yourself, you see things one way. When you travel as part of a group, everything looks different. Tristan’s group featured travellers of different ages, backgrounds, and nationalities; strangers who, by the end of the trip, had become lifelong friends.

A whole planet to play with
Tristan and travellers like him choose Classic tours because they offer the widest variety possible, both in terms of destinations and departures, and within the tour itself. Each itinerary is built to deliver an unmatchable balance of must-see highlights, spontaneous situations, insider access, and under-the-radar encounters with local people and culture that you just can’t get on your own.
See it through Tristan’s eyes
Tristan spent two mind-blowing weeks in Turkey, and the pictures he came back with only begin to tell the tale. Take a look at some of the things he got up to. Where would you go? Chances are there’s a Classic tour headed there soon.
