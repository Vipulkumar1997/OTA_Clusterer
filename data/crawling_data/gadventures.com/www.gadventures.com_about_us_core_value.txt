G Adventures Core Values












About G Adventures Core Values
In 1990, Bruce Poon Tip founded G Adventures with nothing more than two credit cards and a burning desire to create an authentic, sustainable travel experience like nothing the world had ever seen. By offering adventure-craving travellers an alternative to the resorts, cruises and motorcoach tours they were accustomed to, he not only changed the way people looked at their holiday time, but changed the face of travel forever. Twenty years later, the only thing that hasn’t changed is an inherent belief in the core values that continue to inspire our being and business today.
It’s true. At G Adventures, changing people’s lives isn’t just a mantra, it’s the very core of our company culture, the essence of who we are, and the driving force behind everything we do. The way we see it, change is the key to innovation, and people are the key to change. From our CEOs (Chief Experience Officers), G Adventures staff, partners and the thousands of travellers we interact with every day, our goal is to ensure an authentic and unforgettable life-changing experience for everyone. After all, if you’re not changing, you’re not growing. And isn’t that what life is all about?
Our passion for travel is rivaled only by our commitment to those we serve. From helping our travellers choose the perfect trip, to providing them with the most authentic life-changing adventure possible, we go out of our way to ensure a travel experience unlike anything they’ve ever imagined. By continually striving to exceed expectations – both theirs and ours – we’re better able to connect with our travellers and change the way they see the world.
While most companies are busy thinking outside the box, we learned a long time ago that sometimes it’s best to just get rid of the box altogether. That’s why we encourage our staff – and our travellers – to embrace the bizarre, step off the beaten path and boldly embark down the road less traveled. It’s the reason our company culture celebrates individuality, champions diversity and inspires fearless innovation. Bizarre? Maybe. Exciting? You bet. Coincidence? Absolutely not.
We’re proud of our reputation as a world leader in innovative, authentic adventure travel, and we work hard to make sure we stay there. Of course, it doesn’t really feel like work when you love what you do as much as we do. Perhaps it’s because we’re more than a company, we’re a family – a family of diverse individuals united by a profound respect for, and enthusiastic belief in, not only our values, but each other. This unique combination of respect and enthusiasm prevents us from losing sight of what matters most – community, people, cultural exchange – and reminds us that creating happiness is a privilege we all share together.
The foundation of our success is built on one very simple principle: Do the right thing all the time, every time. For our staff, for our travellers, for the people and places we visit. It’s the difference between booking a trip and fulfilling a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. It’s a pledge to recognize the problems facing the world today and act quickly to meet them. Above all, it’s a commitment to continually challenge ourselves to see the big picture and bring about meaningful and positive change whenever we can.
