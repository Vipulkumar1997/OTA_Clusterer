National Geographic Journeys by G Adventures






Adventure, enhanced

They offer more inclusions, greater hands-on exploration, interactions with local experts, and the freedom to roam, all within the structure and security of travelling in a small group.

Donna and Peter wanted a new way to see the world
Meet Donna and Peter, a Canadian couple in their early fifties. Myanmar had always been on their radar, but they didn’t know how to experience it like they really wanted, getting genuine cultural interaction without sacrificing comfort. Travelling with National Geographic Journeys gave them the ideal combination of fun, rawness, and exploration with flexibility, convenience, and the occasional indulgence.

“
The way the trip was structured was amazing – we had a lot of freedom to do what we wanted. It all exceeded our expectations for really getting into the destination. The people we met. How we got around. Where we stayed at night. It was a fantastic adventure.
”

Get around quicker
Donna and Peter didn’t want to spend their time away lining up for buses and trains; they wanted to see as much as they could in the time they had. Internal flights and rides on private vehicles were included in the price meaning they had more opportunity to get to know the places they were visiting.

“
It was fun discovering new foods. We ate at some great spots, tried some new things at smaller places, and even had a cooking lesson by a local chef alongside a lake. All great chances to get to know Myanmar in ways we hadn’t even imagined.
”

More included meals
National Geographic Journeys offer more included meals than other G Adventures Travel Styles, serving up the perfect mix of finer dining in some excellent restaurants, hearty sit-downs with local families, and culinary adventures of all sorts.

“
We didn’t go all that way to spend time in our hotel rooms, but it sure felt good to return at the end of a long day of exploration and love where we were staying. Accommodations were smart and comfortable and some were really unique.
”

Rest easy
We select our accommodations for how well they represent the distinctive character of the destination you’re in. Some of these rooms and cabanas draw their inspiration from history and others from the views they offer. What’s consistent, however, is that we stand by each and every one of these for what they’ll add to your experience.

See it through their eyes
Myanmar is one of the most beautiful places in the world and Donna and Peter have the photos to prove it. Take a look at some of the highlights of their experience here.
