Safety and Destination Updates






G Adventures prides itself on the extensive network of ground operations, tour leaders and local contacts worldwide, which keep us informed and up-to-date on all local situations in which we operate. Our passengers' safety is of the utmost priority and we rely on these networks to allow us to make the operational decisions necessary to keep our trips running safely. We often know of situations on the ground before the media and we are in constant contact with our local offices, tour leaders, local operators, and colleagues in order to closely monitor and inform you of the most current information affecting any regions where we operate.



For further reference, we also recommend that you check your government's travel advisory for any country to which you are travelling:

Bali Volcano

Posted: 29 Nov, 2017 | Updated: 01 Dec, 2017

Update: 1st December, 2017

We have been advised that Bali International Airport (DPS) and Lombok International Airport (LOP) are now open to air traffic.
The situation remains fluid and clients should check with their airlines for updates regarding schedules and cancellations.

We continue to monitor the situation and we will update as necessary.

This update is to advise that, due to the recent volcanic activity from Mt Agung on the Indonesian island of Bali, the international airport at Denpasar will remain closed until at least 7 a.m local time on Thursday November 30th, 2017. The closure is due to the potential threat of volcanic ash to air traffic safety. Authorities are assessing the situation on a daily basis.
Due to the high level of alert surrounding Mt Agung, authorities have placed a mandatory evacuation order for all residents living within 10 km of the volcano. Out of an abundance of caution, G adventures will not be staying or conducting activities within 50km of Mt Agung.
The situation could change at any time and our staff on the ground will continue to monitor the situation locally.
Clients who are scheduled to fly into the international airports at Bali or Lombok should check with their airlines regarding their flight status and and for updates regarding flight change and cancellation policies.
We will continue to provide updates as necessary.
