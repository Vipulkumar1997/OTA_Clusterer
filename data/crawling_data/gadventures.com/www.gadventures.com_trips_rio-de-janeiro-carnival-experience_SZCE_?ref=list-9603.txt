Day 4
Rio de Janeiro
Head out to the Sambadrome to watch the parade. Marvel at the sights and sounds of Carnival and dance the night away with new friends.
Take it slow today because the parade literally lasts all night. This evening between 6-7:30 we transfer to the Sambodrome where we have reserved seats in section 5. Your CEOs will accompany you throughout the evening and after the parade you'll transfer back to your hotel.
Samba Schools is an association of people from the same neighbourhood or community (favela) who get together on a regular basis for samba meetings and rehearsals. Samba Schools provide valuable jobs to the community in the production of costumes and floats. Each year, schools choose a different theme and may take to the parade from 3,000 to 5,000 members, and 6 to 8 floats. They have to make it through the runway in a period from 60-80 minutes, which means each member will spend only about 25-30 minutes inside the Sambodrome.
Carnival Parade
Rio de Janeiro
The Samba Schools Parade is something that everybody has to experience at least once. We watch the parade from inside the Sambadrome, marvelling at the outrageous costumes, arresting beats, and soulful rhythm of this incredible competition. Cheer on a favourite samba school as their floats make their way past you down the samba runway in an unbelievable parade of colour, movement and sound that lasts all night. When Carnival magic takes over, the Sambodrome is the setting for the greatest show on earth.
