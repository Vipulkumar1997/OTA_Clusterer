G Adventures for Good:
Clean Cookstove Project Visit
Visit a Maasai village in the Monduli District and witness the benefits of the G Adventures-supported Clean Cookstove Project. In Tanzania, 95% of people rely on cooking with wood and coal. Women and girls spend hours walking to collect wood every day (making them vulnerable to assault and unable to use their time to go to school). Indoor smoke from open-fire stoves causes cancer, emphysema, pneumonia, blindness, and burns. Take a guided tour of these villages and meet the women that have been trained as stove engineers, visit bomas (traditional homes), and observe (or get your hands dirty) by helping the Stove Team build a stove in a home.  See the beneficial impact of the clean-burning stoves on the health and daily lives of the Maasai villagers, especially the women.
G Adventures for Good:

Afterwards, sit down with our new friends and enjoy a traditional lunch of meat and plantains.
