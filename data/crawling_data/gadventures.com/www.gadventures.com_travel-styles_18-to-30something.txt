G Adventures' 18-to-30somethings tours






Got fun if you want it
Youth is a limited-time offer. Squeeze more out of yours with 18-to-Thirtysomethings – fast-paced and affordable adventures designed for young travellers. Explore the world by day, stay up all night, and do it all again tomorrow someplace new with friends you’ll want to hang on to forever. You’ve got the rest of your life to take it slow. Live fast now.
Freedom, 100% unfiltered
Instant posse
When you go with a group, someone’s always got your back and is up for whatever you want to do. Plus, your CEO does all the dirty work so you don’t have to.
Low money, no problems
Light on frills and heavy on experiences, 18-to-Thirtysomethings tours let you spend your money on what you really want. Splurge when you want to, save when you don’t.
No loners allowed
18-to-Thirtysomethings tours move fast and cover a lot of ground, so come armed with a bottomless thirst for life, an open mind, an iron stomach, and a good pair of dancing shoes.

Paul’s here for a good time, not an expensive time
Say hi to our good mate Paul, an adventurous Aussie in his early thirties. Paul’s flexible work schedule frees him up for all sorts of long-term adventures, but his less-than-flexible budget puts a premium on value and cost control. He’s backpacked solo plenty of times, but really wanted a break from sorting out the details himself this time. 18-to-Thirtysomethings to the rescue!
Watch Paul's story

“
I’m used to travelling on my own, so I wasn’t sure if going with a group of strangers was going to work for me. I was wrong. You get company when you need it, independence when you don’t.

Run with the pack
Like all 18-to-Thirtysomethings trips, Paul’s itinerary was loose and flexible, and his group was stocked with travellers his own age who could keep up with him all day and deep into the night. And really, what’s the point of eating scorpions if there’s no one around to snap a pic that proves it?

“
I appreciated how affordable my tour was up-front, and that I controlled how much I spent on food and other stuff along the way. It felt a little more mine.

Put your money where your trip is
Cash-conscious travellers like Paul know how important it is to manage your money when every dollar counts. 18-to-Thirtysomethings tours are built to be thrifty: affordable accommodations, overnight transport, and fewer included meals keep costs down and fun maxed out.

“
We covered a lot of ground in 30 days, but I never felt like our CEO was hustling us from place to place. We got enough time in each spot to feel like we were really there, not just passing through.
”
Learning something new

Variety isn’t a spice. It’s an entrée.
As a backpacker, Paul’s used to following his own schedule. 18-to-Thirtysomethings trips are typically longer than other G Adventures trips, which means we can pack more stuff into them. Each one is designed to keep you as busy as you want to be while giving you the freedom to go with the day’s flow. Less is more? Try more is more.

Show and tell
Paul spent a month on the road all over Indochina with us, and he’s got the pictures to prove it. Check out some of the highlights of his adventure here, then get out there and make some memories of your own.

Fast, fresh, and fun adventures that never slow down
Designed for young, budget-minded travellers between ages 18 to 39, 18-to-Thirtysomethings tours maximize time and money by squeezing the most out of a destination. This ain't your typical big-bus tour, though. Small groups, insider access, and personal freedom to follow the whim of the moment are the order of the day, every day.
