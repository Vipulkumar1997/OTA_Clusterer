Be where you belong
Always dreamed of getting deep inside one of the world’s greatest and most out-there destinations? You can now. Local Living tours send you undercover in some of the world’s most interesting places to discover life as it’s lived every day. Unpack once at a central home base – a Tuscan farmhouse, an Icelandic home, a rustic lodge in the Amazon jungle – and discover how the locals live with the help of a connected CEO who knows the area best.
Everywhere is local
It’s not a hotel. It’s home.
You won’t stray too far from your lodgings on a Local Living trip, and once you’ve seen 'em, you won’t want to. Each trip is based out of a charming and unique residence steeped in local character. Unpack once, meet your host, and start getting the lay of the land.
Your trip, your way
Itineraries are as loose-fit and flexible as you are. Pursue the whim of the moment and really dig into the elements of your destination that drew you to it in the first place. We give you the setting, somewhere to stay, and all the options you want, you fill in the rest.
Don’t just visit.
Inhabit.
Dine al fresco in San Gimignano on pasta you help make; hike the Path of the Gods on the Amalfi Coast; learn how to hunt with a blowgun in the Amazon; or live like a nomad on the remote Mongolian steppe. You’re a local now. Live accordingly.

Ritu wanted more than a taste of Tuscany. We gave her a banquet.
There are some places on this grand old world of ours that can only be unlocked by those who have the keys. For Ritu, a Canadian in her twenties, that place has always been Tuscany, land of rolling hills, Renaissance art, and world-famous food and wine. She wanted to dig in deep enough to truly
feel
her surroundings, not just
see
them. Local Living let her do just that (and then some).

Staying at the agriturismo in Chianciano Terme was beyond wonderful. Once we unpacked, it was incredibly easy to just slide on into daily life. It didn’t just
feel
authentic; it
was
authentic.

Your home-far-away-from-home
It’s difficult to feel a connection to any place when you’re staying in a different hotel every night, particularly if that hotel is just like every other hotel everywhere in the world. Local Living trips are centre-based, which means you stay in one location for the majority of your trip. What sort of locations? Agriturismos, family homes, and converted farmhouses in Europe, and jungle homestays, Masai campsites, and Mongolian gers in the outer reaches. You'll love them so much, you might be tempted to start forwarding your mail there.

“
I really enjoyed how much freedom I was given to explore on my own. Our host Stefano grew up in the area, so he was always prepared with a biking route we should take or a café we should visit whenever the mood struck us.

Live like a local
Your life doesn’t stick to an itinerary set by someone else, and neither does a Local Living trip. We provide some structure and scheduled activities, but you decide which ones you want to do and when you want to do them. Need some fresh air? Hike through the hills. Stayed up too late the night before? Hang around and take it easy. Stumped for ideas? Your CEO always has more at the ready to keep you as occupied as you want to be.

“
I couldn’t get over how welcoming everyone was. People we’d just met literally invited us into their homes to watch them make olive oil, taste their wine, and just chat about their lives. I’d never have been able to do that myself.

The world is a neighbourhood
The whole point of Local Living is to provide you with a glimpse of life as it’s actually lived every day, whether it’s in Tuscany, the Amalfi Coast, the hills of Thailand or the Mongolian steppe. Through our connections, Ritu was able to meet and interact with people she would never have met otherwise, and through them gained a more profound understanding of not only Tuscany but the world at large.

See it how Ritu saw it
We introduced Ritu to a side of Tuscany that she never would have experienced on her own. Check out some of the highlights from her trip here. Your world isn’t one-size-fits-all. Local Living makes it cozy.
