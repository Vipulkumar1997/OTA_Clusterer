Antarctica, Arctic and North Atlantic
Famous for its enormous icebergs, towering glaciers and shimmering summer light, Antarctica offers some of the planet's most awe inspiring landscapes.  The North Atlantic and Arctic evoke images of sparse snow covered lands, but when summer comes it bursts with colour and life.
