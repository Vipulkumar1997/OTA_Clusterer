Affiliate Program
Join our Affiliate Program and partner with the world leader in adventure travel.
G Adventures has teamed up with Commission Junction to provide you with the best affiliate experience available. With in-depth reporting and management tools, you will be earning top commissions in no time for each online booking you secure. Once accepted into the G Adventures Affiliate Program, Commission Junction will manage all payments and sales tracking.
How does it work?
1. When a customer visits your website and clicks on an ad link, they are taken to gadventures.com to complete their purchase.
2. Once the customer completes the sale online, the tracking software records the transaction and attributes the sale to you.
3. Commission Junction tracks the transaction, provides real-time reporting, and deposits monthly commissions in your bank account.
