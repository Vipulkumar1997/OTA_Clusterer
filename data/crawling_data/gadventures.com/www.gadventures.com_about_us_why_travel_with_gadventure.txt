Why Travel with G Adventures?






Why Travel with G Adventures?







Flexibility and Independence
Head off to explore independently or just chill out in a café and watch the world go by. We include the must-see highlights on most of our trips, allowing you the time to explore according to your own tastes.
Small International Groups
A big part of the experience is our small international groups. It’s these people that make travelling with us rewarding and exciting! On average there are about 10 travellers on one of our trips, depending on the destination—the maximum is usually never more than 16.
Accommodation
From unique home stays and hotels to sleeping moored under the stars in a tranquil bay, our options will provide you with the most authentic experience possible and will always reflect the local character and spirit of your adventure.
Transportation
From tuk tuk and rickshaw to public bus, train and even camel, we’re all about variety. Sometimes local transport is the best and most colourful way to go. But, depending on your choice of destination, service level and trip style, we provide alternative ways of getting around, too.
Optional 'My Own Room'
Sometimes it’s just more convenient and comfortable to have your own room, which is why we offer single travellers a ‘My Own Room’ option—a single room all to yourself at a great G Adventures price.*
*See individual trips as some exceptions apply.
No Single Supplement
We believe single travellers should enjoy the same advantages as others in their group. We’ll gladly pair you up with a roommate of the same sex to ensure you get the same price.
100% Guaranteed Departures
That’s right. We’re the first travel company in the world to guarantee every single one of our departures. Look inside for full details.
Lifetime Deposits
TM
If you cancel or delay your trip for any reason, your deposit remains valid until you’re ready to go. You can even pass it on to a friend.
24/7 Service
If you’ve got questions about a trip – even if it’s the one that you’re currently on – we’re here to help, day or night. We never sleep. NEVER.
Choice
With the largest variety of destinations, departure dates and an unparalleled choice of trip styles and service levels designed to meet all tastes, ages and budgets, we’re certain there’s a G Adventures trip for you.
Price and Value
We believe an unforgettable travel experience doesn’t have to be expensive; that’s why we continually strive to offer the most competitive prices around. Because our grassroots approach provides a more affordable way to travel, we’re able to deliver the adventure of a lifetime at a fraction of the cost.
A Different Way to Travel
At G Adventures, we encourage you to step off the beaten path, embrace the unexpected and immerse yourself in the extraordinary. Our award-winning trips embrace authentic accommodation and local transportation to bring you face to face with the world’s most fascinating cultures, customs and awe-inspiring wildlife.
