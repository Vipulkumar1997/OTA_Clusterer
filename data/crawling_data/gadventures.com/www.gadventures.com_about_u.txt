About Us







Our Story
In 1990, I launched G Adventures with the belief that other travellers would share my desire to experience authentic adventures in a responsible and sustainable manner. We've grown from a one-man show to a company of over 2,000 worldwide in 23 offices, and from a handful of trips in Latin America to more than 650 adventures spanning the globe... and beyond! Over 150,000 travellers experience the real world with us every year. What hasn't changed is our passion for making sure you get behind the scenes to experience the real world in an authentic and sustainable manner.

Our Core Values
In 1990, Bruce Poon Tip founded G Adventures with nothing more than two credit cards and a burning desire to create an authentic, sustainable travel experience like nothing the world had ever seen. By offering adventure-craving travellers an alternative to the resorts, cruises and motorcoach tours they were accustomed to, he not only changed the way people looked at their holiday time, but changed the face of travel forever. Over 26 years later, the only thing that hasn’t changed is an inherent belief in the core values that continue to inspire our being and business today.

Responsible Travel
How do you envision our world in 50 years? Our efforts in sustainability as an organization reflect our commitment to the idea that our children and grandchildren will have a wonderful natural environment to explore throughout their lives. Our role as a company is to ensure that we’re giving back more to the communities and the natural surroundings that we help you to visit than what is being taken away in our travels. Preserving cultural heritage and conserving and replenishing the natural environment, while improving the lives of local people, is the essence of our way of travelling and is integrated into every decision and action we take at G Adventures.

About Bruce Poon Tip
How did it all start? With a very inspired young man named Bruce Poon Tip. After returning from a backpacking tour of Asia, in 1990 Bruce was driven to share his passion and vision about experiencing adventures in an authentic and sustainable manner with others. With nothing more than his own personal credit cards, G Adventures was born. What started off as a one-man show has grown to become the world's largest adventure travel company with over 2,000 employees in 23 offices worldwide.
