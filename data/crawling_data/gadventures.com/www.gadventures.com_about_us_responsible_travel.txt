Responsible Travel






Don’t just see the world. Make it better.
Planet Earth is an amazing place, but it’s far from perfect. Since the very beginning, G Adventures has operated under the belief that travel is an exchange, not a commodity. As a social enterprise, the planet is our product. Its social and environmental welfare is fundamentally important to us – not just as a business, but as human beings, too. When you travel with us, you’re giving back as much – if not more – than what you take away, often in ways you’d never expect. Here’s how we spread G Adventures for Good around the world.

Planeterra
Established in 2003, Planeterra is our non-profit partner dedicated to ensuring communities touched by tourism benefit from the opportunities it provides. Planeterra helps empower local people to develop their communities, conserve their cultures, and create humane and supportive systems for their endeavours. Planeterra manages over 50 social enterprises on all seven continents, that benefit women, at-risk youth, and rural and indigenous communities.

G Local
We like to keep things local on our trips. Working with small, locally owned businesses rather than big international chains helps keep the overall cost of your trip down, but we also believe that your travel dollars should stay where you spend them. Supporting local entrepreneurs and small businesses strengthens communities, raises the overall quality of life, and ensures that the places you love will continue to be loved. Read about our G Local initiative.

Animal Welfare
G Adventures recognizes the importance of animal welfare. That’s why we have adopted the guidelines developed by the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) in conjunction with the Born Free Foundation, a third-party organization whose mission it is to protect animals from abuse. Our vision is to ensure that all animals encountered on our tours are treated humanely.

Child Welfare
G Adventures believes that it is critical that no child is ever harmed as a result of tourism. Travellers have the power to make a true impact in the communities they visit, and that’s why we actively work to ensure child welfare is protected in the places we operate.

Responsible Travel with Indigenous People
Connecting curious travellers with Indigenous communities is an essential part of our identity at G Adventures. We are committed to respecting the rights, history, and culture of Indigenous people while ensuring that tourism supports their well-being.

Planeterra and the Inter-American Development Bank
In 2013, Planeterra and G Adventures partnered with the Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to develop community-based tourism projects in rural communities underserved by the travel economy. Today, we continue to seek out opportunities for community tourism projects wherever possible to help our travellers put their travel dollars where they belong: within the communities that need them.
Disaster Relief
G Adventures strongly believes tourism is a force for global good, and we’re committed to promoting sustainable solutions in communities around the globe.

Planeterra Project: Womens Weaving Project





Planeterra Project: New Hope Cambodia

Many young people in communities surrounding Siem Reap do not have access to public schooling because their families are unable to purchase uniforms, books and other necessary materials.  Access to education was virtually eliminated during the Cambodian Genocide in 1975 and has since been slowly rebuilding.  Siem Reap has also undergone a boom in the tourism industry; income that has yet to reach the surrounding underserviced communities and local people due to lack of affordable certifications and training available.  Because of this, there is a cycle of poverty in the region that has been difficult to break.  New Hope provides free education and training in relevant subjects to prepare students for careers in the tourism industry.

Planeterra Project: Inca Trail Biodegradable Soaps





G Adventures for Good Projects
From the beginning, our mission has been a simple one—to help people and communities thrive through solutions, not handouts. We do this by providing the resources and opportunities for local people in the areas we serve to develop and strengthen their communities, and our network of travellers provide these communities with the long-term income to make these solutions sustainable.
Discover trips that visit Planeterra projects and get closer to our wonderful planet and the communities that sustain it.
