Every route’s the scenic route
Before we took to the skies, we rode the rails. The steam locomotive connected the world like no technology that came before it, linking isolated communities to the big cities. The magic of train travel hasn’t diminished with time, yet most of us have forgotten it. Climb aboard and see your world in a new way all over again.
A classic way to travel, rediscovered
Iconic railways
Ride the rails on trips built around the iconic railways of yore, like Switzerland’s Glacier Express, India’s Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, and the sprawling Trans-Siberian.
Easy on the planet
Rail travel is greener than going by car, bus, or plane. Take bigger strides, go deeper into the world, leave smaller footprints, and travel with a lighter conscience.
Deeper access
Trains can often get you closer to the heart of the world’s more remote places. Start in the big cities and watch the landscape change from urban to rural to way-out-there.

Zoe and Julian discovered that
getting there is all the fun
For Zoe and Julian, a thirtysomething couple from the UK, travelling Europe was a little been-there, done-that. They’d travelled
around
the continent loads of times, yet they’d never really travelled
through
it. If there’s one thing Europe isn’t, it’s flyover country. A Rail journey through the Alps was just the ticket to let them not merely see things, but connect with them.

“
In Europe, everything's a short flight away. Watching the landscape change as we travelled through it on the train made me realize just how much of it I'd been missing.

A window seat worth fighting over
One of train travel’s greatest advantages is that it affords you the chance to really see the country you’re travelling through. Our rail tours follow some of the most iconic and scenic rail routes in the world, providing you with a genuine connection for eye-popping landscapes like the Alps, the Himalayas, and Siberia that you just won’t get from flying over them.

“
Simply having the room to stretch out, relax, move about the cabin, and talk with your fellow travellers makes you realize what you sacrifice for the speed and so-called convenience of buses or planes.

Raising a classy glass (or two) while passing through Germany.

A living room on rails
Besides the added legroom, travelling by train is often the most convenient and comfortable way to get between point A and point B. Most train passes are significantly cheaper than airline tickets, and when your train car doubles as your hotel room, the overall price of your trip is lower, too.

“
I particularly loved how the train terminals are often right in the middle of the big cities. Instead of waiting in lines or sitting in traffic, we just stepped off the platform and got right to it.

Taking the train gets you closer to moments like this faster.

Faster than flying
Many big cities and small villages have train stations, so don’t miss seeing the in-between scenery in favour of dealing with customs and airport transfers. Once you arrive to your next stop, your hotel will often be right by the station. No getting stuck in a taxi or hauling your luggage for hours.

See it how they saw it
Zoe and Julian spent a week crossing the mountains and countryside of Europe, and the pictures they came back with just scratch the surface. Check out some of the highlights of their adventure. Rail travel is where adventure travel began. Some things never go out of style.

Adventure travel, civilized
Rail tours combine the must-see highlights, insider access, freeform exploration, and life-altering encounters with local people and culture you'd expect from small-group adventures with the ease and efficiency of the train travel.
