Want more out of your adventure? Put more into it.
Active adventures get you closer to the destination by letting you hike, bike, and multisport your way through it. We provide the equipment, the experts, and the opportunity, you provide the energy. On your mark. Get set. Go Active.
Small-group travel with an active twist
Active adventure for all
You don’t need to be an elite endurance athlete to enjoy an Active tour. Many are made with the first-time Active traveller in mind.
Physical Demand ratings
You know your limits best. Each Active tour comes with a Physical Demand rating to help you decide how much is just enough.
Options aplenty
We classify each Active tour as Hiking, Cycling, and Multi-sport, but that’s not all you’ll do. Each one includes options for other fun pursuits, too.

The world is Marc's playground
This is Marc. He’s 27, from the UK, and doesn’t mind working up a bit of a sweat if it gets him a little further away from the ordinary. He’s hiked the Inca Trail and paddled the cayes of Belize – and now he's taking on the backroads of China. His philosophy: If getting there is only half the fun, you’re doing it wrong.

A challenge, whether it’s climbing a mountain or meeting people who don’t speak your language, is an opportunity to change yourself. The more things you try, the more interesting your life gets.

Go big or stay home
Active types like Marc travel for experiences that engage the muscles as much as the mind or the heart. Whether that’s a leisurely bike ride through remote villages, a trek to the top of Kilimanjaro, or physical pursuits like rock-climbing, ziplining, or dogsledding, Active tours deliver as much or as little action as you need.

“
Seeing the world from the saddle of a bike adds depth to where you are. You get to smell and hear things that you never would from a tour bus.
