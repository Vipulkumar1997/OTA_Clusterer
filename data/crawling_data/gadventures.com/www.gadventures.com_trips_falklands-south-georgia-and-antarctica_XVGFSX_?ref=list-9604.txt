Nearby islands are the nesting grounds for Wandering albatross, a species of albatross that only stays on land to breed and eat. Hopefully in the three days in the area the group will get a chance to spot one of these majestic sea birds during the small amount of time it spends on land.
South Georgia is also the best place in the world to observe the southern elephant seal, the largest breed of seal. The island is home to over half of the world's population of these animals. October is a great time to see newly birthed pups alongside their mothers.

Drake Passage/Ushuaia
Reflect on a memorable adventure and take in some final lectures en route to Ushuaia. Keep a careful look out for a last chance to spot whales.
Turning north, embark upon the 400 mile crossing of the passage that bears the name of the 16th century English explorer Sir Francis Drake. The G Expedition is at home in this part of the Southern Ocean, known for the unimpeded never ending fetch of the winds that encircle the Antarctic.
At some point on the first day, cross the Antarctic Convergence, a meeting of cold polar water flowing north and warmer sub-antarctic water moving in the opposite direction. It is the largest biological barrier on earth and is marked by a change in temperature, salinity and nutrient levels. The north flowing Antarctic waters predominantly sink beneath southward moving sub-antarctic waters. While further south associated areas of mixing and upwelling create an ocean very high in marine productivity.
Wandering, Black-browed and Light-mantled Sooty Albatross, Prion's and Cap Petrels are among some of the species of seabirds that may join the Expedition on the journey towards the South American continent.
