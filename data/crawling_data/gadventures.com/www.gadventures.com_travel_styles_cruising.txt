Sea-ing is believing
There’s adventure aplenty out there beyond the shore, but unless you’ve got gills or flippers, you’ll need a ship to find them. Marine tours are designed for travellers of all stripes, from experienced cruisers and sailors to landlubbers who’ve never set foot on a boat. And they go just about everywhere there’s water. If you can float there, you can go there. Go there.
This is your (blue) planet
Out-there access
Sea travel brings the world’s remote corners closer. Antarctic penguin rookeries, secluded Thai coves, and the beaches of Greek legend can only be reached by sea.
Smaller ships, bigger experiences
Small ships go where big ships can’t. It’s simple physics. We use smaller vessels wherever we go to get you deeper into your destination and keep group sizes intimate.
Water, water, everywhere
The poles, the Amazon, the Galápagos Islands, and other amazing places are out there, and you sure as heck can’t walk to them. Go beyond where the land ends with us.

Leigh discovered that a small ship is all the ship she needed
This is Leigh, a Canadian in her mid-thirties. Ever since she was a kid, she’s longed to get up-close with the wildlife of the Galápagos Islands. To do that, though, she knew she’d have to get there by ship, but she didn’t want to get there aboard a big, clunky cruise ship. Then, she discovered Marine tours and found out she didn’t have to.

“
The access we had to the wildlife was just incredible. You hear about how the animals aren’t afraid of people and will come right up to you, but it’s something else to actually experience that first-hand.

Where the mild things are
The Marine program covers all aspects of ship-borne travel, from nature-focused adventures in the Galápagos and the polar regions to sailing trips in Thailand, the Maldives, and Europe. Get to the places you’d otherwise miss and get closer to the things that make them worth visiting than you ever dreamed possible.

“
I’ve travelled a fair bit, but I’ve never gotten used to packing and unpacking my luggage at every stop. Being able to put my things away for the week while still having the sensation of being in a new place every day was a refreshing change of pace.

Unpack just the once
When you travel by ship, your hotel room goes wherever you do. Ships vary in make and size depending on where you’re headed, but each one is perfectly suited for the waters it sails. The best part: The view outside your porthole changes every day, but you only unpack once.

“
I wasn’t sure I was the cruising type before I went, but my trip changed my mind. It’s a different feeling, being out there on the water. I feel like there’s a whole world of possibilities out there I’d never noticed before.

Such a beautiful day to kayak

Wherever there's water, there's us
Like many travellers, Leigh had never travelled by ship before she signed up for her first Marine trip. We’ve democratized adventure-by-sea by opening up far-flung locales like the poles, the Greek Islands, the Turquoise Coast, and the Maldives with our fleet of small ships, yachts, catamarans, and riverboats. If you can float there, we can get you there. No sea legs required.

See it how Leigh saw it
We provided Leigh with an up-close glimpse of the Galápagos that even the best nature documentary couldn’t provide. Take a look at some of the highlights of her trip here. It’s cruising, evolved.

Small-ship adventures on the world's great seas and rivers
The poles of the Earth, the wonders of the Galápagos, the mysteries of the Amazon, out-of-the-way Greek islands and other great places are best (and sometimes only) accessed by boat. Marine trips get you there aboard small ships, exclusive yachts, and catamarans.
