Adventure knows no age limit
Just because you’ve settled down and had kids doesn’t mean your adventuring days are through. Family trips open up the world of adventure travel to kids age six and up by letting them experience their planet on their own terms. Everything is new and exciting when you’re a kid. Travel with yours and discover your world for the first time all over again.
A big world, brought down to size
Family edutainment
Family trips introduce kids to the inner workings of other cultures through language, sports, crafts, and time with experts that bring what they’ve learned in school into real life.
The more the merrier
The average Family group consists of about 12 people, typically three or four families from all over the world and with kids around the same age as yours.
Small travellers, big fun
If one family member isn’t having a good time, nobody is. We give each Family tour a Recommended Age rank so parents can tell if it'll be a good fit for their kids before they go.

Together, the Robertses discovered a new theme park: "Thailand"
As working parents, Dan and Hayley are all too aware that the time they have together with their kids is at a premium. They were in the market for something special; an experience they could all enjoy that would also broaden the horizons of their sons Keir and Tigne. They were looking for an experience that all four of them would remember for the rest of their lives. They found it in a place they never suspected: on a Family trip through Thailand.

“
We went to this little village in Thailand where people grow their own food. Our CEO showed us how to separate the rice from the husk so it can be turned into food. It was cool to see how the food we ate got from the ground to our plates.

They were in the market for something special; an experience that would broaden the horizons of their sons Keir and Tigne. They were looking for an experience that all four of them would remember for the rest of their lives. They found it in a place they never suspected: on a Family trip through Cambodia and Thailand.

Learn now, appreciate forever
Travelling is the perfect way to open up a child’s world to possibility and wonder. Powerful experiences lead to new interests, and exposure to different cultures, languages, and environments helps the kids of today become the responsible, well-rounded adults of tomorrow. Our Family trips deliver a seamless mix of adventure and education that’s so much fun they won’t even realize they’re learning something the whole time.

“
Our group had kids from Canada, Germany, and Australia in it, which was pretty cool. It was great to have kids who weren’t my brother to hang out and do stuff with.

Pen-pals for life
One of the advantages of group travel is the diversity of people you get to share your experience with. Family trips are a great way for children to meet and interact with other kids from around the world who are close to their own age and share common interests. It’s not uncommon for families who meet on our trips to stay close after the trip ends; some even make the experience an annual tradition.

“
We’ve got two kids of different ages and completely different interests, so finding a trip that we could all get something out of was a challenge. I thought it was wonderful that our trip had activities that we could all do together, as well as some tailored to the ages of the kids in our group.

Built just for families
Travelling with the family is an adventure unlike any other, in all sorts of ways. Kids often have wildly different needs than adults, which is why we don’t just adapt our grown-up itineraries for smaller travellers. Little things like age-appropriate activities, hotels with amenities designed for families on the go, and CEOs that think like kids and adults alike are just a few of the things that set our Family trips apart. We believe that everyone deserves to have the time of their lives, no matter how old they are.
