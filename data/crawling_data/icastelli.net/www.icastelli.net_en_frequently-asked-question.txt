Frequently Asked Questions






HOW CAN I CONFIRM A BOOKING?




To confirm a booking, we need your personal details (Name, Surname/Family Name, address, telephone number and a valid e-mail address) as well as your credit card details which are required to debit a deposit relating to the value of the booking and being an advance payment of the booking. There are no other added costs in making your booking. The booking confirmation is sent by e-mail within 3 hours of the confirmation; in the case of not receiving such e-mail, we ask you to contact our customer care service.You will need this confirmation as it is a presentation voucher, that you must hand in at the time of check-in, containing all the details of your stay.






HOW CAN I CANCEL A BOOKING?




All cancellations are accepted only and exclusively via the electronic link which is given on confirmation of your booking; in the case of loss of this confirmation and link, we ask you to contact our customer care service. It is possible to cancel all bookings (except for non-refundable bookings, for which there is no refund) free within the cancellation policy provided for each reservation, as set out in the booking confirmation. After this period of time, the booking is irrevocably subject to the conditions of cancellation of each hotel. If you decide to make a cancellation, you expressly accept the “Conditions of Cancellation” with relative penalty, of each hotel, if relevant. We therefore ask you to read carefully such conditions before making a booking in that it is irrevocable.






HOW CAN I CHANGE A BOOKING?




Yes, it is possible to change your booking, always given that the hotel has availability. We ask you to contact our customer care service and give all the information necessary and details of your request.






IS IT SAFE TO GIVE MY CREDIT CARD DETAILS?




Yes, icastelli.net uses the most modern technology for the protection, handling and sending of your personal details as well as for the electronic transmission of information. The technology used for the transmission and treatment of all information is the “SSL (Secure Socket Layer)” according to the international standards governing electronic security.






ARE MY PERSONAL DETAILS PROTECTED?




All your personal details are treated electronically according to current laws with the single aim of supplying services which are requested. To ensure your privacy, we assure you that such information will not be given to third parties but only and exclusively to parties interested which are necessary for dealing with the services requested, in particular the hotels and banking institutions.






CAN I HAVE ASSISTANCE IF MY CREDIT CARD IS NOT ACCEPTED?




Yes, we ask you to contact our customer care service to check that the information you have given is correct, or alternatively give details of another credit card.
