Guest Reviews

Location Map









There are thousands of ways of discovering this city, unique in the world, its culture, history and tradition.  Hotel Palazzo Barbarigo, with its extraordinary position directly on the Grand Canal has one mission only, that of offering its guests a personalised welcome and a complete service down to the smallest of details,  making your stay in Venice a truly unforgettable experience.
In a 16th century Palace, the hotel opened its doors again at the beginning of September 2007, after a complete professional renovation, to offer all comforts and facilities in an environment where the atmosphere of the past marries perfectly well with modern style and furnishing.  The elegant bedrooms are all in contemporary design inspired by Art Deco.

Situated on the Grand Canal, not far from the Rialto Bridge and next to the well-known Pisani-Moretta Palazzo, the hotel is reached in a few minutes from Piazzale Roma and the railway station.  A private mooring jetty allows gondolas and small boats to arrive directly at the main entrance.

The hotel is also near the most important places, such as La Fenice, Palazzo Grassi, the Guggenheim Museum and San Marco Square.  After a long walk among the buildings and canals, a moment of relaxation can be enjoyed in the refined bar, sipping a drink and tasting delightful appetisers while, with the setting of the sun, the Grand Canal slowly blends into the night, giving way to an illuminated Venice, full of fascination, colours and life.

Classic room can not certainly be described as a space furnished in a standard way.

Could be more effectively defined as an elegant and sophisticated interior far away from any austerity. Looking at the particular corners and objects it is possible to recognize a balanced search of materials, shapes, colours, completely overrun with the vibrating Venice atmospheres.

This will makes you feel as if you were in a 40’s movie where the scenography seems to be absolutely perfect. The rooms offer a unique view of the heart of Venice while overlooking the side canal Rio San Polo.

Luxury room is featured by ironic details, sometimes frivolous but always unusual and unique. Nothing seems to be out of place: feathers, fringes and plumes to remind that in Venice, always coexisted and merge a lot of different styles.
Each space gives place to multiple interpretations that carry, in a single instant, inside a sweet whirl of satisfying sensations. The rooms offer a unique view of the heart of Venice while overlooking the side canal Rio San Polo.

The design concept of this stunning suite takes its inspiration from that branch of the Art Déco that used to match the decorative and neoclassical items. On this set the guests feel free to enjoy a trip made of pure glamour and luxury. Palazzo Barbarigo, striking and historical building on the Venetian Grand Canal, was created by an “enlightened visionary”.
All the Junior Suites overlook the wonderful Canal Grande

His Opinion:

Unbelievable, stunning hotel. If you enjoyed Angels and Demons/ The Da Vinci Code, you will love the street entry to the hotel, I will say no more as its amazing.
The rooms are very, very relaxing, comfortable and quiet.
The staff are, well, amazing, attentive, personable, helpful etc, etc, etc, etc.
Great breakfast, took an hour to get through it! The heart shaped Creme Anglais filled doughnuts are a revelation!

Location is as good as it gets, a 10min walk through busy, shop filled streets to Rialto bridge, 2 mins by taxi.

To be really, really picky, and we are being picky here, we didn't have coffee/tea facilities in our room. I was up working at 4.00am one morning and could have done with a brew. Room service was there know, but would have been nice to make it myself.

WE WILL BE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

His Opinion:

We had the suite which was pleasant though really a large room.  The room lighting is design but dark.  For the price paid there should have been a courtesy bottle of water and a newspaper - almost all people in the hotel were English speakers and there was one English language paper at breakfast for all guests.  Access is challenging but not insurmountable.  The day staff and those in the restaurant were very considerate.  The night manager was fine but not terribly welcoming or inviting.  The location is very good just down from the Rialto bridge and near a vapporetto station.  The hotel has however few amenities.  Some of the other rooms are very small and would be disappointing.  A generally good address and fair value. No perks were offered for having booked through icastelli - we stayed immediately after another icastelli listed property and there were no perks also provided.  The benefit of membership is hence unclear.

Arrivare con il motoscafo direttamente in hotel,navigando sul canal grande... sorseggiare un martini mentre tramonta il sole dopo essersi emozionati per il Rigoletto alla Fenice...la vita è fatta di piccoli piaceri. Palazzo Barbarigo , il suo staff ne fanno a pieno titolo parte.

Hotel was beautiful, beds comfy, staff very helpful, except told us tat the Ebraico final tour on .feb3 was at 2:30 and when we got there it was closed with a sign stating that last tour ofmthe day was 12:30. We planned our time around getting there fir 2:30 and missed the tour. We could've scheduled it correctly had we had the correct information.  Breakfasts were fabulous!
