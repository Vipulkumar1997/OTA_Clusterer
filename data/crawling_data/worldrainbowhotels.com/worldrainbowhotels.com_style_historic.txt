Historic Hotels - World Rainbow Hotels

















Stay in a hotel of historic significance
that has a story to tell and  provides you
with an original or authentic experience







All our Historic Hotels have a story to tell. Like all World Rainbow Hotels our historic collection have all been selected to ensure they offer the very highest standard of service and warm welcome to our LGBT travellers.

Immerse yourself in the history of these hotels and soak up the stories of how these hotels have played a part in not only the history of our community but also pop culture.

Take a look at the Andaz West Hollywood where Rock n' roll history awaits you; famous for its rock â€˜n roll parties it is now a sophisticated urban oasis which still exudes just a touch of hedonistic glamour.
