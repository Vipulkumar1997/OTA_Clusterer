Island Hotels






Just imagine lying on a powder soft beach next to a gently lapping azure blue sea, soaking up the sun and being caressed by a gentle breeze. Imagine being a thousand miles from anywhere in the middle of the ocean.

What could be more special than sharing a drink by the pool as the sunsets or walking down the beach in the moonlight?

Now make your dreams come true with a World Rainbow Island Hotel.

Our Island hotels are the epitome of luxury.  World-class hotels in Island resort locations.



Take a look at our favorites.  This is what dreams are made of.
