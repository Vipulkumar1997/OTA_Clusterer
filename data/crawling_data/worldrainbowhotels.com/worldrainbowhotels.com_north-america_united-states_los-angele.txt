Lesbian and Gay Friendly Hotels in Los Angeles












Los Angeles
,
United States
,
North America





With its gorgeous beaches lined with palm trees swaying in the gentle sea breezes, its throngs of gay and lesbian bars, clubs, shops and restaurants, Los Angeles is not so much a great gay travel destination, as a gay paradise. So it is little wonder that Los Angeles has a rapidly expanding gay community amongst the city's population of 17 million people.
In addition to its many gay and lesbian bars and clubs, Santa Monica Boulevard also has a vast array of gay-interest shops. Elsewhere in Hollywood, the LGBT Center on North Hudson Avenue is the biggest gay and lesbian organization anywhere in the world.
