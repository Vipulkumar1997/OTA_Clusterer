About the Location

As one would expect Thailand’s capital of Bangkok is a bustling metropolis with world-class gay-friendly Bangkok hotels, restaurants, and clubs in addition to opportunities to shop until you drop with so many stores in place.

One of the city’s most popular gay hotspots, Grindr, is where an international mix of men can be found dancing the night away to pop music.

Many annual festivals and events take place celebrating gay life including the Song Kran which is an enormous outdoor water festival with every major nightclub hosting late-night parties.

Transgender and transsexual tourists are welcome and many bars and cabarets are dedicated to this niche group of visitors.  Many transgender beauty pageants are hosted in Bangkok, an LGBT friendly destination.
