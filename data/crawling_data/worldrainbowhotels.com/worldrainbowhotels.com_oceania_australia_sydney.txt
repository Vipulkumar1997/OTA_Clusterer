Sydney, a world class LGBT scene, outrageous beaches, incredible shopping, hip restaurants and bars... what more do you need?

Sydney’s ‘Gay Golden Mile’, the Oxford Strip is the gayborhood of the   international city with a multitude of gay venues. A former favorite,  Newton, is  beginning to re-establish itself as a gay centre point, home  to some of the more  extravagant and independent citizens.

Sydney Mardi Gras, internationally renowned in the midst of the Australian  summer, in February – March, is a gay event to fit in once during your lifetime  – in fact it is one of the most vibrant, welcoming and popular in the world.
