Gay and lesbian friendly boutique hotels















Quirky, creative, distinct and daring, the gay friendly boutique  hotels that are part of the World Rainbow Hotels portfolio allow you to  enjoy a vacation that mirrors personal character and taste.

Choose a destination with a boutique hotel that best suits your  unique disposition; whether you decide to step into a dream at the  Maison Moschino in Milan, or check  into the sultry 3.14 in Cannes.  Perhaps gather a peaceful moment from your beach side room at The  Library Hotel in Koh Samui, Thailand or wonder through the wilderness  parkland just round your 12 Apostles Hotel in Cape Town South Africa.  Whatever destination you decide upon, you will be well accommodated  courtesy of the World Rainbow Hotels boutique collection.
