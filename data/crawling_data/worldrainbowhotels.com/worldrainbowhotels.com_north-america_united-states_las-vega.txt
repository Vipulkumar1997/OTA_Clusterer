Lesbian and Gay Friendly Hotels in Las Vegas












Las Vegas
,
United States
,
North America





A flashy, glitzy, decadent mirage in the middle of the desert, Las Vegas is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Experience the bright lights of the city from the Fountains of Bellagio, the Eiffel Tower, Stratosphere Tower, and China Town and during the day experience the mighty landscape of the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam and the Eldorado Canyon Mine.

Las Vegas gay scene is diversifying and new establishments are opening serving different themes and appealing to the more specialist interests– after all this is the adult-playground of America. Whether you're coming to catch a show, gamble or just lounge by the pool at one of the world-class hotels, 'Sin City' is the perfect LGBT getaway. With a number of gay clubs on the Strip and in the Fruit Loop (the 'gayborhood'), there's a great time to be had no matter what day you're in town.

On the whole the Las Vegas gay bars and clubs may not do the city justice, instead popular gay divas and entertainers that have headlined the big Las Vegas Shows certainly more than make up for it, including Cristina Aguilera, Cher, Elton John, and Bette Midler.

If Las Vegas is known as ‘Sin City’ there’s plenty of fun to have, however don’t get married in Las Vegas and expect it to be legal, Nevada still does not recognise same-sex marriage.
