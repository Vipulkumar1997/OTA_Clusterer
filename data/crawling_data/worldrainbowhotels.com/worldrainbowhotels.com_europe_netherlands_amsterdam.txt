Gay and Lesbian Friendly Hotels in Amsterdam












Amsterdam
,
Netherlands
,
Europe





Amsterdam is one of Europe's most attractive destinations for gays and lesbians travelers. Nowhere in the world will you find so many gay attractions per square mile. So it is not surprising that Amsterdam is such a popular destination among gay visitors.

Amsterdam was the first city to establish the granite-made Homomonument in 1987, a gay memorial which commemorates all gay men and lesbians who have been subjected to persecution because of their homosexuality. In 2001 the Netherlands was the first country in the world to decreed same-sex marriage with equal rights and benefits, serving as a model for the rest of the world to follow. In 2013 Queen Máxima, wife of King Willem-Alexander, attended the International Day Against Homophobia & Transphobia.

Amsterdam is an incredibly vibrant city offering dozens of fun-filled bars/clubs, restaurants and parties within the five neighborhoods that revolve around the city center: Zeedijk, Kerkstraat, Warmoestraat, Reguliersdwarsstraat and Amstel. All are easily reached by a 15-minute walk, public transport and taxi.
Amsterdam's annual gay events feature the March film festival Roze Filmdagen, the open-air party on King’s Day, the Gay Pride Amsterdam, the canal parade in August, the Leather Pride weekend in late October and New Year's Eve.
