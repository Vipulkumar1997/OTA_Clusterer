LGBT News











Gay and Lesbian Travel and Hotels in Europe












Europe





Europe is the most open continent for LGBT rights and acceptance of same-sex relationships with not one country making it a criminal offence.

Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Iceland and the Netherlands all recognise same-sex marriage and many countries recognise same-sex relationships and have specific protection laws in place to prevent anti-gay discrimination. While some parts of Europe are still a little hostile towards gay people, the European Union has gone a long way in recent years to ensure the whole continent subscribe to the same doctrine.

Pride festivals in Europe are usually during the summer months of May – September, though to avoid clashes, some cities are introducing Pride festivals during the winter months. You can follow EuroPride that takes place in a different city in the first week of July every year – most recently in Stockholm, Zurich and Warsaw. In Spain, Germany and United Kingdom most large cities host an annual gay pride.

In most instances the gay nightlife is very easy to find and there is a gaborhood in most cities including Soho of London, Chueca of Madrid, Sconeberg of Berlin. While the further south and East you head research is a must and many gay bars will be hidden in dark alleyways, behind closed doors where you may need to ring a bell for entry.

There is a wealth of cultures, languages and landscapes to experience in Europe, starting in the major international cities of Barcelona, Berlin, Rome, or emerging Eastern destinations of Prague, Warsaw and Budapest. Whether you’re interested in architecture (Eiffel Tower), Ancient History (Coliseum), Sport (skiing in the Alps), Culture (Germany’s Oktober Fest), or Beaches (Agean Sea) there’s something in Europe for everyone.

Many cities in Spain hold a gay pride festival including Barcelona  (March), Gran Canaria (March), Ibiza (June), Loveball Festival (August)  and Canary Islands (May). Madrid has one of the largest gay pride  festivals in Europe, which takes place in July. If you’re looking for  ‘the gay’ destination then head for Sitges, a gay town in its own right  with numerous gay beaches and a gay scene that covers much of the town.

Stockholm is the centre of life in this low-populated country and the  same goes for the gay nightlife, however both Malmo and Gothenburg have a  gay scene. Stockholm Pride has been going since August 1998, there are a  few gay bars here but all Swedish bars are mixed and gay-inclusive.  Lino is probably the best gay party spot in Stockholm along with Goken,  while Gothenborg has MataHari and Malmo has the Wonk nightclub. The gay  calendar is littered with events so there is always a party to join in  with.
