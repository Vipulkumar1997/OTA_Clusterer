Gay friendly hotels in Bangkok












Bangkok
,
Thailand
,
Asia





Bangkok, known as the City of Angels, is the center of gay life in Asia. From bears to twinks to every shape size and age of man or boy in between, this the place to go if you want to show your pride, mingle with guys and find some hot exotic romance.

During the city's huge outdoor water festival in April, the gays have their own waterworks going on, while every major club throws late-night circuit parties.

Still Bangkok has much more to offer than just hot nights. This is a city with a rich culture and history; so you can dive into the local culture during the day, eat wonderful meals at night and make the most of your vacation.
