San Diego

What other city can boast a welcome to gay and lesbian travelers with a six popular annual Pride festivities, a vibrant mix of festivals and events and an out, proud and very loud gay and lesbian community.

Enjoy the year round Californian sunshine and spirit of a city where people from all walks of life come together to meet, shop, party, dine and enjoy the area’s arts, culture and extensive nightlife.

The heart of San Diego’s Lesbian and Gay community is Hillcrest, an exciting uptown district that celebrates diversity throughout the year.

With its thoroughfares, University Avenue and the tree-lined Fifth Avenue, you will enjoy the community’s openness, hospitality and quaint neighborhood charm. Hillcrest celebrates San Diego’s hip and wild side with a mix of bistros, unique and eclectic coffee houses and cafes, boutiques, nightspots and friendly bars.

Fun in the sun, California style.
