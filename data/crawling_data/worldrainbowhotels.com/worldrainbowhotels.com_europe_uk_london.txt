Gay and Lesbian Friendly Hotels in London












London
,
UK
,
Europe





London offers a unique cocktail of sophistication, understatement, spark and unbridled hedonism. The British capitals' eight-million-plus population has kept a convincingly intimate and unthreatening feel, much of it down to its village-like atmosphere spread across 32 boroughs, each with individual and local character.

Home to Europe's largest gay and lesbian population, London remains a hot spot for the discerning international gay traveler. In London one is seldom far from a gay pub, bar or club, with literally hundreds of venues throughout the capital. Soho has long replaced Earls Court as London`s gay mecca, and offers a wide range of gay pubs, restaurants and a great variety of restaurants. Vauxhall has established itself as London’s other gay neighborhood and fancies itself as giving Soho a run for its money. But gay Vauxhall is predominantly nocturnal, with big dance clubs and bars.
