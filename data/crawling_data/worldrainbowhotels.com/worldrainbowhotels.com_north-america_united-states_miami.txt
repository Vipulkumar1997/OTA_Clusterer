Lesbian and Gay friendly hotels in Miami












Miami

Sun, sand, art, deco, and a great night life; Miami is all about pleasure! South Beach (SoBe) is the heart of the party scene in a city that takes its hedonism, ostentation and extravagance very seriously. Beyond the bling and bikinis lies a city of stylish restaurants, decadent lounge bars and a burgeoning arts scene offering irresistible Miami virtues and vices in equal measure. Miami is both a playground and a catwalk… and the perfect destination for gay and lesbians!
