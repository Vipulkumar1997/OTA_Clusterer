Gay and Lesbian Travel in South America












South America





Homosexuality is legal in all South American countries except Guyana where gay male sex is punishable with life imprisonment. Argentina is currently the only country to recognise same-sex marriage although Uruguay, French Guiana, Falkland Islands, Ecuador, Columbia and Brazil offer same-sex civil unions.

Significant progress has been made in recent years with many nations accepting homosexuality and hosting energetic gay scenes and events. While at times villages and outer suburbs may be dangerous and there is a risk you may get swindled by a prostitute the cities have lavish parties and vibrant underground clubs.

There too are certainly some very colourful gay events, if Rio de Janeiro shows how to hold a multi-cultural festival in February then Sao Paolo is possibly the biggest gay pride in the world with over 4.5 million visitors. Buenos Aires, Caracas, Bogota and Lima host annual gay prides though on a smaller scale.

South America is a rich and diverse landscape offering deserts, mountains, glacial formations and the richest rainforest in the world, becoming a very popular destination for travellers wanting a true cultural experience.

Whether you’re inspired by the Angels Falls in Venezuela, or the Amazon Rainforest, Iguazu Falls trapped between three nations, the historic Machu Picchu, or the World Heritage site of Easter Island it may first prove tricky choosing the destination. While several nations share the region, speaking a mix of Spanish and Portuguese, you are guaranteed a friendly, welcoming and electric culture.

Argentina has become a new destination of choice for gay tourists  looking for the all-inclusive gay holiday of culture, entertainment, history  and spectacular scenery. It became the first country in Latin America  to allow same-sex marriage in July 2010, including full adoption rights for gay and lesbian couples.

Brazil is a vibrant fun-loving country that will welcome you with open  arms, huge parties and an infectious carnival culture. The best time to  go is between October and March, experience the internationally renowned  phenomenon that is Rio de Janeiro carnival in February. With events  spread across the city, at this time Ipanema is the place to be – with a  beach of toned bronzed bodies and wild night street parties.
