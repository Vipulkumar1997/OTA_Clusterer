LGBT News











Gay and Lesbian Travel in North America












North America





North America is made simply of three countries each with their own take on liberalism and acceptance of homosexuality. The far North, the home of Canada, is one of the most progressive countries in the world with full equal rights for gay people.  While tolerance and acceptance in the United States of America are split and varied, more states are beginning to recognise more LGBT rights with New York, California and Chicago taking the lead. Mexico, alike USA, has varied equality rights for gay citizens.
The USA and Canada’s gay calendar is packed full of gay events and pride festivals throughout the year, the most popular being Toronto, Chicago, San Francisco, New York and Vancouver Gay Pride Festivals in June and July. Mexico’s diary is yet to be as full however it hosts a vibrant Cancun International Gay Festival in May. It is best to check your specific travel destination for gay nightlife and events.
North America’s huge and varied landscape has everything for the seasoned traveller, from the top tourist spots of Florida and California, mega cities of Toronto, Chicago and New York, unbelievable natural wonders of The Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Fisher Towers of Utah, and the mystical geological ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park.
While the modem society of North America is relatively young compared to the rest of the world, there are extraordinary remains of ancient and historical cultures especially in Mexico with the archaeological site of the Maya empire Palenque, Chichen Itza one of the largest Maya cities, and the former metropolis of Teotihuacan pre-dating 2 B.C.

Tolerance and acceptance in the USA are still split and varied, though the recent Supreme Court ruling now allows same sex-marriage across all states. The country has a chequered history with gay rights. The birthplace of LGBT equality with the Stonewall riots, New York recognised same-sex marriage in June 2011.

While Mexico is a magnet for tourists and equality has evolved there is  still a level of homophobia in the country compared to similar  countries, so the gay community is not as visible as most international  cities. Renowned for its glorious coastline,  Mexico has a number of gay and gay-friendly beaches and resorts. There  is a matured the gay nightlife in many cities including Ciudad Juarez,  Monterrey and Guadalajara.
