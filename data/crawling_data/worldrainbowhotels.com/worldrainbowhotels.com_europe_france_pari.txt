Gay and Lesbian Friendly Hotels in Paris












Paris
,
France
,
Europe





The world's most romantic city still seduces. Before you die, you've got to live "la vie en rose". Paris is, simply put, a gay paradise. Luxury shopping, fine art, romantic landmarks, cheap (yet good) wine, heavenly cheese, fashion-forward nightlife, beautiful people; it is all in one “little” metropolitan city called Paris.
The artsy and cool "Marais" is Paris' most obvious gay area, spanning blocks across the 3rd and 4th arrondisements on the Right Bank. But the entire city is ready to romance gay travelers.
