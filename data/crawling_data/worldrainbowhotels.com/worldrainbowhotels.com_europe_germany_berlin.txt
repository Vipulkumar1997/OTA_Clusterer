Lesbian and Gay Friendly Hotels in Berlin












Berlin
,
Germany

With everything from urban beaches and a happening club culture, to boutique-chic design and cosmopolitan sophistication, the German capital has it all. Berlin status of gay mecca goes way back to the hedonic times of 1920's and it is still today one of the world's largest gaytropolises – with a gay museum, a memorial to homosexuals and a mayor for 13 years!

Berlin's gay scene has a variety of gay neighbourhoods to offer, with Schöneberg being at the top of them. Motzstraße is Schöneberg’s catwalk, while Fuggerstraße is very popular to the male visitors. The rest of the gay neighbourhoods include the upcoming Kreuzberg area, the Prenzlauer Berg area, the tourist hotspot Mitte, the alternative Friedrichshain zone, and Neukölln area. Berlin is also a rich cultural city.

The annual gay events of the city include the Folsom Europe event in September, and the Motzstraßenfest as well the Christopher Street Day event, which are both held in June.
