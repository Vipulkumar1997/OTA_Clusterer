Fly from Ontario to Phoenix
Phoenix is a well-known desert paradise with a thriving city culture. The weather is just right for people looking to get away from colder climates. You can fly from Ontario to Phoenix by booking a flight with LA/Ontario International Airport (ONT). You could order a private airport-supported SUV, take a shared van, call a taxi or use your own vehicle to get to the airport. A nonstop flight from Ontario to Phoenix is about an hour long.
Attractions
One of the most popular locations for visitors is the Desert Botanical Garden, which features a collection of fascinating native plants such as cacti and rare desert flowers. The 3.5-acre Japanese Friendship Garden is another aesthetically pleasing location with its Japanese plants and zen atmosphere. Additionally, Phoenix is famous for its hiking opportunities, as you can take numerous trails in the McDowell Mountains for a chance to spot jackrabbits, bobcats and quails. This city's social scene is also extensive, with many great night-life establishments.
Hints and tips
Phoenix's average annual high temperature is 85 degrees, and its average annual low temperature is 67 degrees. This city's public transportation service is called Valley Metro, and there are bus routes to take you to every major street.
