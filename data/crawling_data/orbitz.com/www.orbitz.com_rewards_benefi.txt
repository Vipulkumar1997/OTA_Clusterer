Must be a member of Orbitz Rewards at time of Price Guarantee claim to receive additional $50 in bonus Orbucks. Restrictions apply. See
terms and conditions
for details.
2
As a tier benefit, Platinum members are eligible to receive up to $50 in Bonus Orbucks each calendar year (January 1-December 31) as reimbursement for qualifying checked bag fees incurred during the calendar year. Checked bag fees must have been incurred on stand-alone flight bookings or flights booked as part of a vacation package made on
Orbitz.com
or the Orbitz mobile app beginning January 1, 2015. You must have Platinum status at the time the claim is submitted to be eligible for this benefit. To submit a claim, send an email to
Zapthatbagfee@customercare.orbitz.com
that includes your first name, last name, Orbitz Rewards email address, and record locator number of the flight booked through
Orbitz.com
in the body of the email, and attach a photo of your paid bag fee receipt to your email. These Bonus Orbucks will expire if not redeemed within 365 days of issuance. Offer is non-transferrable and not redeemable for cash. Expect a response to your claim within 48 hours. Once verified, Bonus Orbucks will be deposited in your Orbitz Rewards account within approximately 7-10 business days.

Platinum members are eligible to receive one (1) unique authorization code every five (5) years for the application fee for TSA Pre✔
®
. The authorization code applies to the TSA Pre✔
®
program only; other program applications including, but not limited to, Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, and Privium are not eligible. Orbitz has no control over the application and/or approval process for TSA Pre✔
®
, nor does Orbitz have access to any information provided to the government by the Platinum member or by the government to the Platinum member. Orbitz has no liability regarding the TSA Pre✔
®
program. Orbitz Rewards will cover the cost up to $85 which is the application fee as of January 31, 2017. U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) charges an application fee to process each respective application regardless of whether the member’s application is approved. Orbitz will provide an authorization code to cover the full cost of the TSA Pre✔
®
application fee regardless of the decision made by TSA, but will not provide additional authorization codes or cover expenses charged to the same Platinum member within five (5) years, even if the original application is rejected. TSA Pre✔
®
membership is intended solely for the Platinum member who is eligible for and requests the authorization code, and may not be assigned, sold, transferred, and/or pledged to any third party or to another account. Expiration date of the authorization code will be provided at time of issuance. Orbitz reserves the right to discontinue this benefit at any time with or without notice. TSA Pre✔
®
program is subject to change, and Orbitz has no control over these changes. For additional information on the TSA Pre✔
®
program as well as full terms and conditions of the program, please visit
www.tsa.gov/tsa-precheck
