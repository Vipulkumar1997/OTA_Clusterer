Miami International Airport (MIA) is the primary airport for commercial flights to and from the Miami area. There are numerous domestic and international airlines that operate out of MIA. People that are interested in Miami flights can purchase special travel packages that include transportation, flight, and hotel accommodations. After your Miami flight arrives at MIA, you can take advantage of several ground transportation options that will get you anywhere along the shore or beyond. There are free shuttles supplied by MIA that will transport passengers to and from the airport to the nearby Tri-Rail commuter station or the Earlington Heights Metrorail Station. From here, passengers can reach Downtown Miami and South Beach.
Miami Weather
The tropical weather of Miami makes it one of the top vacation destinations in the country. Temperatures are between 70-85 degrees all year long. Flights to Miami during the winter season are used as an escape from frigid temperatures elsewhere in the world. Miami winters are usually warm and dry with temperatures in the 70s. The summer months in Miami can be hot and humid, but still nice enough to enjoy a plethora of outdoor activities like laying on one of the beautiful beaches along the coastline. No matter when you arrange flights to Miami, you will encounter warm temperatures that will make your stay delightful.
Getting Around Miami
Getting around Miami as soon as your flight arrives at MIA isn't too bad if you want to get around the city as quickly as possible. Renting a car while you're at the airport is a good idea, so prioritize a travel package that includes your plane tickets and car rental service making the most affordable route from point A to B to C. Other transportation options available to you after your flight to Miami include taxi, Metrorail, Metrobus, and the Metromover transit system. The Metrorail can take you to Downtown Miami or far from that bustle. The Metrorail is also connected to the Metromover, which will take you to, or near, Miami's most popular attractions.
Miami Attractions
A trip to Miami is well worth the time and effort it takes to plan a quality vacation. Miami has attractions that tourists have to see, including the following:
Jungle Island, where tropical birds and reptiles can be seen up close by visitors
Zoo Miami, where lions, komodo dragons, meerkats, gorillas, giraffes, and tree kangaroos all call home
Everglades National Park, swamps and sub-tropical jungles that make it one of the most unique public parks in the world
South Beach, this famous area has top-end hotels, restaurants, and shopping boutiques and great events like the Miami International Film Festival
Miami Seaquarium, visitors come here to enjoy the many sea creatures and exhibits held all-year long





Miami When to Go
Winter is so busy in Miami (particularly in South Beach) that locals call it simply “the season.” Europeans and snowbirds crowd the beaches, and major events like Art Basel (December), the Miami International Boat Show (February), and the South Beach Wine & Food Festival (February) pack the hotels. Still, with daytime temps hovering around 80 degrees and the ocean a pleasant 72 degrees, visitors escaping winter’s grip will hardly mind the crush.
Summer here is hot, humid, and prime hurricane season, but it’s becoming a popular time for those who crave solitude on South Beach, where the mellow ocean waters in the mid-80s have even the most reclusive locals donning barely there swimwear.
Shoulder seasons in spring and fall are also good alternatives if you want to beat the crowds. Reasonably priced hotel rooms are easier to snag, and the summer rain showers are absent. Just be aware of major events, like March’s gay Winter Party Festival and November’s esteemed Miami Book Fair International.
