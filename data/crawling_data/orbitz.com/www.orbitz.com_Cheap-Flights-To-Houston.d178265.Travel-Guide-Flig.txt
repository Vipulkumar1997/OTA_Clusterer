Houston Weather Information
Make your travel arrangements with Orbitz.com between April and November. This is peak season, during which you will find a myriad of attractions, although fall sometimes brings hurricanes. For cheap vacations, book flights to Houston from December to February.
Houston's Major Attractions
Houston Galleria, Bayou Place, Johnson Space Center and the Houston Zoo are among the most popular places in Houston. There are many seasonal attractions during the period between April and November, such as the Kemah Rock the Dock concerts and the Miller Outdoor Theater performances. The cheapest time to visit is between the winter months of December and February. Orbitz.com has numerous cheap deals for flights to Houston.





Houston When to Go
During the winter months, Houston stays relatively balmy. With average highs in the mid-60s and typically only a couple of weeks’ worth of freezing temperatures, it’s a great time to visit.
This far south, spring arrives early. For three weeks every February and March, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo dominates local calendars with big-name concerts, carnival rides, and much more. Spring also brings the start of baseball season with the Astros, and as of 2012, the Houston Dynamo of Major League Soccer will have their own new, state-of-the-art stadium. The popular Art Car Parade, featuring automobiles decorated by self-proclaimed artists, takes place in May.
Only hard-core budget travelers willing to brave the heat and mosquitoes will want to visit during July and August. Even most Houstonians try to escape at some point during the summer. On the upside, world-class museums such as the Museum of Fine Arts and the Menil Collection are air conditioned, and the beach is just 30 miles away.
As hurricane season dissipates through October, cooler temperatures prevail, making outdoor activities palatable. That may be why the activity calendar tends to be a bit spotty in the fall. Still, there is plenty to experience, including the recently opened African Forest exhibit at the Houston Zoo, downtown’s Discovery Green (which hosts events from free concerts to farmers’ markets), and alternative arts spaces such as the Center for Contemporary Craft and the Orange Show. Of course, fall is also when the Houston Texans kick off their NFL season at Reliant Stadium. Other annual events include Houston’s long-running Greek Festival in October and the Cinema Arts Festival in November.
