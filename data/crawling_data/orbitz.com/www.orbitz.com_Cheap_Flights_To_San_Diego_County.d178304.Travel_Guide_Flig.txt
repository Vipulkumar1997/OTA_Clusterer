Flights to San Diego arrive at the San Diego International Airport (SAN), which is located only 3 miles from the city center. It is also known as Lindbergh Field and provides service for 22 carriers—a hub for Southwest and Alaska Airlines. It is easy to move around in the airport and often only takes a short time to gather your luggage and be on your way. A small area in the southeast infield of the airport is home to the California least tern, an endangered species. They sit on their nest for several months over the summer, and the planes protect them from predators. While you wait for San Diego flights, you can browse in the shops or grab a bite to eat in one of the restaurants. You can also enjoy the art displayed throughout the airport.
San Diego Weather
The climate in San Diego is beautiful all year, but can vary depending on where you are visiting. You will experience coastal temperatures as well as mountains and desert. Within the city, the weather is mild and sunny with pleasant temperatures. Late summer or early autumn are typically the hottest periods, but you will still enjoy the city if you look for cheap San Diego flights during these months. Winter weather doesn’t exist here besides little rain, which makes it an ideal time for a trip to the city.
Getting Around San Diego
When San Diego flights arrive, several options can get you into town. The airport provides shuttle service to multiple locations, or you can easily find a taxi circling SAN. You will find several limousine and chauffeur services waiting at the airport too. The airport is also served by bus #992 of the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS). You can hire a car from the agencies located within the airport, but if you choose not to drive while visiting San Diego, you can use MTS to get around the city by bus, trolley, or Coaster train. You will want to experience the red trolley at least once on your trip; it provides transportation all around the city, running Monday to Saturday.
San Diego Attractions
San Diego flights take you to one of the most popular places in all of California for relaxation and nightlife.
San Diego Zoo: spend all day visiting the animals and special exhibits or book one of the special tours at the U.S. best zoo.
SeaWorld San Diego: feed and touch dolphins and visit the Turtle Reef that has up to 60 endangered and rare turtles.
Legoland California: enjoy thrilling rides and shows with more than 22,000 Lego models.
Old Town State Park: get a feel for San Diego’s past with 17 museums and buildings from the nineteenth century.
Balboa Park: featuring 15 museums, gardens, and art venues.





San Diego When to Go
No matter what time of year you visit San Diego, you’re likely to be drenched in sunshine. With perennial near-perfect weather, the city averages temperatures in the 70sJanuary is the coolest month, with highs hovering in the mid-60s and humidity measuring around 63 percent. Thanks to the Pacific Ocean’s cooling effect, July’s temperatures remain comfortable; the high temperatures average 76 degrees and humidity stays around 74 percent.
The one time of year you may not be able to count on sun is May through June, when a meteorological anomaly known as the “June Gloom” darkens the sky. Rain is still rare, and there are sunny days, but visitors in early summer should be aware that that famous California sunshine might not be as plentiful then.
The crowds come on strong in late summer, when visitors will see higher hotel rates and longer lines at San Diego’s top family attractions, such as SeaWorld and Legoland. Still, with 70 miles of beautiful beaches and a variety of summer street fairs, concerts, and arts and other cultural events, San Diego offers plenty of other options, many of which are budget-friendly.
In late July, costumed sci-fi characters take the town by storm for the annual Comic-Con conference, which attracts thousands of artists, celebrities, and fans. Other top summer celebrations include the Rock ‘n Roll Marathon in June, Humphrey’s Concerts By the Bay from June through October, La Jolla Festival of the Arts & Food Faire in June, Port of San Diego’s Big Bay Boom fireworks extravaganza on July 4, and La Jolla Music Society SummerFest and Hillcrest CityFest in August.
If your plans are flexible, consider September through mid-October, when temperatures are still pleasant but beaches and other attractions are devoid of the summer hordes.  There are still plenty of opportunities to enjoy the local flavor, too, as San Diego Restaurant Week and the Festival of Sail both fall in September. The La Jolla Art & Wine Festival takes place in October.
During low season—November through March—businesses lure visitors with discounts. You can still count on sunny skies though it’s cool in the evenings. Low-season isn’t without festivals, either. There are San Diego Beer Week in November, Balboa Park December Nights and the Holiday Bowl in December, a PGA golf event at Torrey Pines in January, and the San Diego Crew Classic Regatta in April.
