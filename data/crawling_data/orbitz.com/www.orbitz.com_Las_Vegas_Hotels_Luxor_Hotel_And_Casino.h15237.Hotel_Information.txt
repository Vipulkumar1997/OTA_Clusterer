They should just destroy the east tower.  It's trash. And it takes 10 minutes to get to your room. Very far away from everything like a hidden uncle.














fred, indiana

We reserved a king size room, upon arrival our room was not reserved and they offered us a queen sized room. The room was ok but not what we reserved. The bathroom sink was clogged and the shower head was like a fire hose, we thought it was going to take out skin off. The wallpaper in the hallways was peeling in many places and the carpet in the hallway was always damp. The staff was friendly and tried to make our stay enjoyable but the hotel fell short in making it a memorable stay.

Nice for a three day weekend. Not fancy just fair for the price. Great view from the room as I stayed in the pyramid. Construction outside on the pool started early and did wake us up even on the 15th floor. .....................................................................

I feel it's dangerous how the rooms are designed. Well the hallways to be more specific.

The pyramid rooms are less than appealing - stains on chair fabric, rusting hardware, scratched / torn wallpaper, fraid upholestry dangling beneath chairs - and the cloying, sickly sweet smell in the common areas is so strong it is nauseating.  Went to the breakfast brunch and left disappointed and hungry. Chorizo mini-burritos and biscuits for biscuits and gravy were so over cooked they were inedible, and waffles looked like eggos.
On the positive side, entire staff was friendly and helpful.

Taking a shower felt like what potential waterboarding is - terrible water pressure in the “Deluxe” suite / cheapest of rooms.

Nice hotel located right on the strip....delicious brunch buffet, and very friendly staff! Room was very clean and smelled wonderful! Beds and pillows were so comfy!!! My only cons are there was no fridge in my room and no tub (walk in shower only)....but they had hot water!!!!would definitely stay again!!!

I stayed in the newly remodeled Tower Rooms at the Luxor Lady Vegas. My flight arrived mod morning and the front desk allowed me to check in early. Upon entering my room it was very clean and spacious. I loved the new modern look. The lamps that were bedside had outlets and USB port connections for charging. The bathroom had a separate bath tub and glass shower. The one thing I personally loved about the bathroom was the shower head. I will definitely be coming back on the near future.

Everything was just ok at Luxor. Nothing spectacular, but the price was very reasonable. I would return again  but would prefer to stay at one of the newer updated options on the strip.

Close to everything.   Nice room and pleasant staff. Plenty of choice between Excalibur and Mandalay bay.

Decent but old hotel. It is Vegas - you are sinking in money! You think a shower head from the 2010 instead of the 80’s would be a must. Carpet on the walkways for the pyramid rooms-you could see the floor through! You are rich! Spend money!

I booked this hotel in March for my anniversary in November. We check in and we were told that all they had was a first floor pyramid room so they "upgraded" us for free. We didnt know any better so we said ok. The room was as far away from the lobby as possible. It was not what i expected at all. The carpet in the halls was rippled from use and my wife and i tripped multiple times. The floor was being upgraded so we wouldn't have water between 2-5a.m. Never got my $20 drink vouchers that my package said i would get. The view from our room was telephone poles and street. All in all this was a bad trip. I will not go back to the Luxor, ever. The only good thing we noticed was the shower had really good water pressure. Last comment, the check in service was horrible. We arrived at 10 p.m. and it took us over an hour to check in.
