Honolulu When to Go
It's hard to pick the best time to visit Honolulu since the weather is perfect nearly year-round. So it makes sense that when Old Man Winter has most of the U.S. in his icy grasp (yes, northeast, we’re talking to you), Honolulu is inundated with tourists.
Rarely reaching 90 degrees and never less than 65, you’re almost guaranteed good weather. And if you’re looking for a bit of diversity, take a drive around Oahu and experience the island’s multiple microclimates.
High season runs from mid-December through March, with the hotel rates peaking accordingly. You’ll find the best deals in the spring (mid-April to mid-June) and fall (September to early December), and the smallest crowds.
Swimming in the ocean is a given any time of year, since water temps rarely drop below 77 degrees, even in the winter months. If visiting between November and March, you’ll likely encounter some periods of rain. However, this less-than-perfect weather coincides with the humpback whale migration. The majestic mammals arrive from as far away as Alaska to congregate in Hawaii’s warm waters. Their mating rituals require more activity at the surface, which makes for great viewing.
