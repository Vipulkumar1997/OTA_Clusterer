Denver When to Go
Denver’s mild climate is its best-kept secret, with low relative humidity and summer averages of just 86 degrees. No wonder, then, that locals anticipate the summer almost as much as the snowpack. And they’re certainly spoiled for choice when it comes to getting outdoors. Denver is home to the nation’s largest city park system with 200 parks within city limits and more than 850 miles of paved, off-road bike trails to explore. Golf courses remain open year-round.
Any season, pick a day and a theme, and the Mile High City will probably have that celebration. January commemorates Denver’s western roots with the National Western Rodeo and Stock Show, including a parade with cowboys driving Texas Longhorn cattle through the downtown streets. Many other celebrations throughout the year offer a nod to the city’s cultural diversity, among them: Cinco de Mayo Festival, Greek Festival, and Denver PrideFest.
Known as the Napa Valley of Beer, Denver’s downtown overflows with brewpubs such as Wynkoop Brewing Company, Rock Bottom Brewery, and Breckenridge Brewery & Pub. Although anytime is good for a cold one, the best citywide celebrations of beer are during September: Denver Beer Fest, Oktoberfest, and the Great American Beer Festival.
