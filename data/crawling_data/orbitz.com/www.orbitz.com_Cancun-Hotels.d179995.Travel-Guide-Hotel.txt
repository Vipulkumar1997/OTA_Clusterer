El Rey Ruins








Cancun Interactive Aquarium









Find a perfect tropical retreat at Cancun, Mexico
Cancun is the major gateway to a region rich in the history of the ancient Mayan civilization. It is framed by well-known archaeological sites and white sand beaches, making it an impressive vacation destination. The natural beauty, warm climate and local hospitality provide the
ultimate vacation retreat
.
Things to do
Cancun beaches
Cancun beaches are divided among north and east locations. The northern beaches surround the water of Mujeres Bay. One of the best choices for families is the Playa Caracol. The water is shallow, and the location is flat. The east side borders the Caribbean Sea and offers windier conditions with big waves. Diving and snorkeling are great ways to experience the northern beaches' beautiful coral reefs. Other water activities include waterskiing and sail boating. It's also common for visitors to enjoy an adventure in the Nichupte Lagoon.
Cancun historical sites
”El Rey” is an archaeological site nestled among the resort areas. Here, you will get an inside look at the ancient Mayan civilization. The ruins represent Mexican history at its most authentic.
Cancun family activities
One of Cancun's most popular family attractions is the interactive aquarium. You will enjoy an open-air facility where it's possible to touch stingrays, conches and sea turtles. Submarine tours are ideal for observing underwater creatures without getting wet. Since the Caribbean water is extremely clear, you can view a variety of tropical fish and other deep-sea wonders. Golf enthusiasts will be delighted to play a round at a first-class course. Some top names in the sport have created challenging courses set against the gorgeous tropical backdrop.
Cancun shopping
Cancun is filled with multiple shopping opportunities. There are designer stores with famous brand names, flea markets and various souvenir shops featuring handcrafted items. Since shopping is duty-free, you will be able to take advantage of some great deals on jewelry as well.
La Isla Shopping Village
is filled with trendy shops on the banks of the Nichupte Lagoon. The overall theme is a Venetian paradise. Market 28 is a large flea market in the downtown area. It is the perfect place to find souvenirs and handcrafted wares.
Cancun dining
Restaurants at Avenidas Tulan are popular and lively. Fine dining is better on Avenida Bonampak. Budget travelers will enjoy the tacos at El Centro's Avenida Yaxchilan. For fresh seafood, Market 28 offers a wide range of eateries.
Where to stay
Approximately 150 Cancun hotels are located along the Zona Hotelara, or “Hotel Zone.” You will be able to find luxury all-inclusive resorts and smaller inns throughout the area. Live Aqua is an adult-only resort that provides an entire sensory experience. To save money, consider staying in the downtown area. Although you will need to take a taxi to the beach, room rates are cheaper, and the hotels feel more intimate.
Special events
Thanks to the warm climate, Cancun hosts various events throughout the year. Carnival is a national tradition that celebrates the days leading to Ash Wednesday. There are parades and parties all around the area. On April 20, the residents of Cancun celebrate Cancun Day, the day when the city was founded. In November, the annual Festival Internacional del Caribe Mexicano is a one-month food festival that allows visitors to sample some of the finest area dishes.
Best time to visit
Peak travel season to Cancun is December to April. Crowds are thick, but the weather is ideal, and vacation packages are cheap. It is wise to avoid March, the time when spring break travelers are most prevalent. Summer is quite humid, and temperatures approach the 90s. However, room rates are extremely low. Fall is the least busy time in Cancun, as the weather can be stormy.

Krystal Cancun


OK Hote

It is a OK hotel in a great location for the night life of Cancun, but if you get your room in the newest tower you will get all the noise from the clubs.
Make sure that you get the room nd services that your booked, I did book using Orbitz and when I got there the room and service was different, at the end they honored my reservation but took me and extra 40 minutes.

Oh! The Urban Oasis - Cancun


Great accommodation for great price

Stayed 5 days and 4 nights...We had a great stay. Loved the breakfast (full spread and lots of variety with menu changes daily). It was a bonus that the breakfast was free! Mimosas available with pastries everyday for free. Dance Club connected to the hotel and another hotel on the other side. The pool area was simply gorgeous and the hot tubs were great. The staff overall was fantastic (Gibran the bell boy, Raul in the parking area and Raul at the desk, Carlos at the desk, and Meliza at the desk). Stefany seemed to be exceedingly annoyed ALL the time and EVERYTIME we saw her and EVERYTIME I needed ANYTHING. It was disappointing that her attitude was so sour because EVERYONE else was so kind and extremely helpful. I would absolutely stay here again. Rooms clean. Chic. Looking forward to another Oh! experience.
