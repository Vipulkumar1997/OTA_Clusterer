Europe Cruise Guide


Marvel at the Norwegian fjords, bask on the beaches of the Mediterranean, and stroll through fabled cities as you allow yourself to get swept away during a cruise through this enchanting continent.
Europe offers a delightful array of captivating cities, storybook attractions and fascinating cultures, and a Europe cruise is one of the best ways to immerse yourself in this multifaceted region. Given the vastness of the continent and the multitude of things travelers can see, do and experience, cruise lines offer a range of different itineraries which are often separated by regions.
One of the more popular Europe cruise itineraries, especially for first-time cruisers, is to the Western Mediterranean. On a Western Mediterranean cruise, passengers can behold Gaudi’s gothic structures in Barcelona, dine on scrumptious pizza and pasta in Naples, and lounge on the beaches of glittery Saint-Tropez. An Eastern Mediterranean cruise can whisk you away to the white-washed Greek island of Mykonos, the historic walled city of Dubrovnik, and the bustling bazars of Istanbul.
A Baltic cruise, though sometimes overshadowed by its Mediterranean counterparts, offers charms of its own. This intriguing region offers spellbinding landscapes, charming cobblestone towns and centuries-old folk culture. As you embark on your Baltic cruise, you can find yourself strolling through the pretty promenades of Copenhagen, standing in awe at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, and feasting on Leipäjuusto (cheese bread) and Kaalikääryleet (cabbage rolls) in Helsinki.
Europe river cruises have been gaining popularity, and these smaller luxury vessels can provide you with a more intimate look into quieter ports located on some of the continent’s most storied waterways. Meanwhile, a Western Europe and British Isles cruise allows passengers to explore Europe’s iconic cities with ease.
The best time to embark on a cruise to Europe depends on your destination. A Baltic cruise is largely limited to the months of July and August, when passengers can enjoy the sunny, Scandinavian summer. Europe river cruises can be enjoyed during the winter, as Christmas markets begin to light up Europe’s medieval squares. In the Mediterranean and Western Europe – the most popular sailing routes – travelers can find Europe cruise deals during the spring and fall shoulder seasons.
