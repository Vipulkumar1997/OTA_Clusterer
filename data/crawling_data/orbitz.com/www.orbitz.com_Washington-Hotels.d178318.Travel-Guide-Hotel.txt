Housekeeping efforts should be improved. Didn't see evidence that room was vacumed, wash rags weren't replaced, had to ask for additional shower gel. And major issue that one of the queen beds' mattress needed to be changed.

Step inside the capital attractions of Washington DC
Washington, DC, the vibrant cosmopolitan capital of the United States, is one of the most popular convention and vacation destinations in the country. A seat of global power, it boasts a diverse mix of leisure activities, monuments and museums that blend well with its eclectic mix of shopping and dining options.
Things to see and do
Visitors will never run out of things to see and do in
the nation's capital
. The city is home to prominent American national monuments as well as cosmopolitan entertainment locations, and vibrant neighborhoods that are sure to suit every taste and budget.
Museums and monuments
The most popular museums are those of the Smithsonian Institute. They line the National Mall, a green expanse considered to be America's front lawn. Displays and exhibits of the Air and Space Museum, the Museum of Natural History, and the National Gallery of Art include moon rocks,
the Hope Diamond
and artworks by American and European Masters.
Visitors can also explore interactive exhibits at unique museums like the Newseum, which chronicles the history of journalism, and the Spy Museum, where they can learn about the craft of espionage. The city is filled with monuments, memorials and statues of legendary figures. The most visited are the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the White House and the Capitol Building.
Shopping, dining and nightlife
Fashionistas will be thrilled by the panache on display in the city's homegrown and international boutiques, offering an array of hip, chic and vintage clothing. Plan to attend one of the local farmers or flea markets and haggle like a pro. The District's restaurant scene reflects the city's diverse population. Foodies can experience an outstanding mix of international and ethnic flavors while grabbing a quick bite from a neighborhood eatery, or enjoying a leisurely fine dining experience in an upscale restaurant.
Visitors can enjoy a beer in a variety of neighborhood establishments and trendy brewpubs. Famous bars and cafes can be found in many Washington DC hotels. The District is home to a wide range of live performance venues, ranging from the local neighborhood music scene to the world-renowned Kennedy Center. The city's nightspots and theaters showcase a variety of musical and theatrical genres. The District is also the host-city for professional sports teams from the NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL.
Natural surroundings
In addition to the Mall, visitors can explore the beautiful flora and fauna of numerous parks throughout the city, including Constitution Gardens, Rock Creek Park, Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens and the National Botanical Garden. You can also enjoy the view while strolling along the banks of the Tidal Basin or Potomac River, or while boating along the historic Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.
Best time to visit
Although you can visit Washington, DC any time of the year, guests are likely to enjoy the spring and fall weather a bit more. The summer months are generally hot and humid, and winter is cold and snowy. Visitors will always find something interesting to do in the District, because the city hosts a variety of special events throughout the year. The most well-known are the dazzling displays of the National Tree Lighting Ceremony, the colorful Cherry Blossom Festival, and the music and fireworks of the Memorial Day and July 4th extravaganzas. There are also a number of neighborhood festivals, concerts and sporting events throughout the year.
Travel information
The District is served by Ronald Reagan National Airport (DCA), which is situated three miles south of downtown. Visitors can also fly into nearby Dulles International Airport (IAD) or Baltimore Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI). Dulles is 26 miles west, while BWI is 30 miles northeast of the city.
Located downtown, Union Station is the hub for several Amtrak and commuter rail lines. The city is also located within a network of interstate highways, including Interstates 95, 295, 395 and 495. In addition to the surface street bus system, visitors can get around the city using the highly-efficient and convenient Metro subway.

Club Quarters Hotel in Washington DC


meh...it's an OK hotel

The hotel is at a great location. It's literally right at the Metro station. Two blocks to White House and a couple more to National Mall. CVS, coffee shops, sandwich shops/restaurants nearby. 

The standard room is small but a reasonable size for a hotel in downtown area. It has a smart TV but very small as well. The main issue which really bothered me was the low quality/neglient housekeeping it has. I saw stains on bed sheet and on a new towel. Something is wrong with the K-cup machine it has, which just did not pump water efficiently.

Holiday Inn Washington-Capitol


Nice clean hotel

Easy check-in.  Nice staff.  Very clean.  Very convenient.  Three-minute walk to Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.  Good price.  

My only issue, and this is personal preference, is the bed was kind of hard and the room was super dry.  It was chilly out so we had the heat on and it was so dry.

Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill


Great Location

Stayed at the Hyatt over a weekend.  The Breakfast Buffet was superb.  Staff were all both knowledgeable pleasant and helpful.  The lobby is in the basement so getting in with lots of luggage (two pieces) was a little confusing. Hotel was in walking distance of the National Mall with all the museums and also the Capitol.
