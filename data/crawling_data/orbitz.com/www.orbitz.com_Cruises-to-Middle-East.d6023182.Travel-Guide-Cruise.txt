Middle East Cruise Guide


Stunning skyscrapers, legendary lost cities and swathes of golden deserts are on brilliant display on a cruise through this enchanting region, often dubbed as “The Cradle of Civilization.”
The Middle East is a historically rich and culturally fascinating region, and passengers embarking on a Middle East cruise will certainly be dazzled by the unique sights, sounds and scents that can only be found in the Middle East. Boasting a bevy of historic sites and gleaming metropolises, a cruise to the Middle East rewards its passengers with the opportunity to take a step back into significant moments in time, while catching glimpses of what the near future could have in store.
Itineraries for Middle East cruises can vary tremendously. Shorter durations, ranging from 4 to 7 days, are available and these sailings typically cruise around the Persian Gulf, stopping in ports of call such as Bahrain and Dubai. For travelers keen on spending more time cruising the Middle East, sailings that last for 2 or 3 weeks are available as well, and these itineraries usually sail around the Arabian Peninsula before journeying through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean.
As a cruising region, the Middle East has much to offer in terms of attractions. In Egypt, passengers can explore Luxor, where they can visit the famed Valley of the Kings and descend into some of the beautifully preserved tombs. The city of Aqaba in Jordan is the starting point for an excursion to the mythical lost city of Petra, while Salalah in Oman is steeped in Biblical tradition and is home to ancient sites such as the tomb of the prophet Job.
However, a Middle East cruise vacation also gives passengers a chance to see some of the world’s most luxurious hotels and unique architectural structures. Abu Dhabi is home to glittering skyscrapers, immaculate five-star resorts, elegant shopping malls, and picturesque beaches. Dubai is a rapidly growing cosmopolitan metropolis and in this desert city, passengers can take an excursion to the man-made Palm Islands and visit the Burj Khalifa, currently the tallest structure in the world. In Muscat, passengers can shop to their hearts content in the city’s sprawling souks and glimmering shopping malls.
Peak season for cruises to the Middle East take place from December through to March when the weather is mild and sunny days are guaranteed. Temperatures in the Middle East can reach scorching highs throughout July and August, and it’s for this reason that operators refrain from running Middle East cruises during this time. To get the best Middle East cruise deals, search for repositioning cruises; these repositioning trips tend to take place in late October and early November, as well as in late March and early April.
