Las Vegas When to Go
When it comes to Las Vegas, there really isn’t a bad time to visit. Virtually every major holiday is a prime time, but Memorial Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Eve are particularly popular. Big conventions happen throughout the year, but especially in January, early spring, and October to December. Even relatively slow times like August and the two weeks prior to Christmas are just opportunities for better rates and more breathing room.
There are things to be aware of during each season. Weather warms up quickly in spring, with temperatures in the 80s to 90s during the day (though it can still be cool at night), so pool season is always early here. In summer, temperatures are regularly over 100 (and stay high even at midnight), making drinking water and applying sunscreen universal necessities and outdoor walking discouraged. When fall arrives, outdoor activities such as hiking in Red Rock Canyon or visiting Hoover Dam are more appealing. In winter, temperatures can dip lower than most expect (even to freezing overnight), skies can be overcast, and there’s even a bit of precipitation (flash flooding does happen in January). Of course, this cooler weather rarely affects the majority of activities available but does provide added incentive to get outside and explore.
Vegas tends to be much calmer and more manageable on weekdays, when prices for rooms, spa services, entertainment, and even meals can drop, often significantly.
