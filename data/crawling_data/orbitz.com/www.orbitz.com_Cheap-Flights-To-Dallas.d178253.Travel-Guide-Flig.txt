Airports in Dallas
Before you start planning your trip to Dallas, see what flights are available. You can find flights to Dallas that land at any of the three major airports in the region. The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is the largest, and you can get flights through American Airlines, American Eagle, Delta Connection, United Express, and other domestic and international companies. Located less than 10 miles from the business district in the city, the Dallas Executive Airport offers charter and private flights. The Addison Airport, located nine miles from the business district, works with charter and cargo companies. If you have problems finding a flight, check Orbitz.com for available Dallas flights.

What to Expect From the Weather
Dallas rarely gets snow, but the city does see temperatures in the 30s and 40s during winter with some precipitation. Temperatures in the high 70s through the high 90s with high humidity are common in the summer.
Top Dallas Attractions
Dallas has many attractions that appeal to travelers, including the Dallas World Aquarium, the Dallas Museum of Art, Reunion Tower, and Victory Park. When browsing Orbitz.com for flights to Dallas, look for discount tickets to these attractions and others.





Dallas When to Go
Dallas can get downright steamy in the summer, and May is the state’s rainiest month, so travelers are advised to visit the city in the spring and fall, when the climate is more moderate yet still warm. Average temperatures in July and August hover around 96 degrees Fahrenheit, while April and October are more comfortable in the high 70s.
Although Dallas is not Texas’s largest city, it’s pivotal for business, both on the state and national levels. Flights year-round are often filled with business travelers, and the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport is one of the busiest in the country. For those reasons, fares to and from Dallas rarely vary, although you might see a bump in travel prices in the summer months and around the winter holidays.
Dallas can get frigid for Texas standards in December and January, when temperatures lower to the mid to high 50s. However, it rarely snows in Dallas—the city averages a mere 2.5 inches each year.
