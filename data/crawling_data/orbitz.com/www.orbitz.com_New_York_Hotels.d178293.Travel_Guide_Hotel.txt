Perfect location! This is on 57th between 9th & 10th. 5th Avenue & Central Park are only 3-5 blocks away. Subway is at 59th/Columbus Cir so you are right by there. And that is a main stop for most subway lines. And Lyft is cheap & shows up quick. Seinfeld like cafe nearby, good for breakfast. Morningstar ...

Visit the Big Apple for Your Next Vacation
New York city guide
"The city that never sleeps,"
New York
lives up to its nickname with exciting diversions 24/7. Whether you're ready to experience the thrill of a Broadway show or you want to step into the shoes of the many immigrants who began their lives in New York with a visit to Ellis Island, the Big Apple offers both opportunities and countless more.
Neighborhoods
The USA
's largest city, New York is made up of five distinct boroughs: Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. Each district has a unique personality and features all its own, but most visitors gravitate toward Manhattan: despite being just 12 miles long and three miles wide, this central district offers plenty of action for all age groups.
Exploring other areas couldn't be easier, either; just hop on board a bus or subway line. Overall, NYC has the advantage of being seriously walkable, but also boasts a reliable and well-organized public transit system. No matter where you stay when you're in town, there's a good chance you won't be too far from the action.
Things to see and do
Get a bird's-eye-view of NYC
The vertical power of this city is nearly overwhelming. Only like New York embodies the golden era of skyscrapers, and eight of them became the tallest in the world at different times over the course of the 20th century. Get a bird's-eye view of New York with an elevator ride up the Empire State Building, or try less-crowded but equally impressive Top of the Rock. This observation points extends over the 67th, 69th and 70th floors of the Rockefeller Center, from which you'll find fantastic views of Manhattan, Central Park and the Empire State Building.
Eat your way from Chinatown to Little Italy
When it comes to dining in New York, you really are spoilt for choice. Little Italy and Chinatown are packed with authentic eateries, while popular all-American diners like Stardust serve classics like Brooklyn Bagel, burgers, crispy wings and nachos. Finding the best bagel in New York could easily become the ultimate quest during your time in the city;
take a look here
to find some of the potential nominees.
If celebrity-spotting is at the top of your menu, check out Serendipity 3 on East 60th Street. Legendary for its "Frrrozen Hot Chocolate" dessert, this hotspot is always bustling and often sprinkled with some famous faces.
The stars of Broadway
Mesmerized by the bright lights of Broadway? Make sure to book theater tickets in advance and if you're not too picky about the production, you might even score seats near the stage at discount prices. Just ask the box office staff if the show has a daily ticket lottery system in place. From Wicked to Phantom of the Opera to Chicago, you could be watching one of the biggest shows on the planet when you're in town.
Where to stay
Uptown
If you're itching to stay in the heart of the city, look no further than Manhattan's Uptown. Its northernmost clime is home to the Guggenheim Museum and the Met, Greenwich Village, Central Park and a revitalized, culture-drenched Harlem.
Midtown
It goes without saying that NYC's most exclusive hotels are in Midtown: the
New York Marriott Marquis
(right on Times Square),
The Peninsula New York
(Fifth Avenue),
Doubletree Guest Suites
(Times Square) and
the Carlyle
(Madison Avenue). The famous lights of Broadway are only a cab or subway ride away, and affordable Midtown stays are also available: take a look at
our Budget Big Apple guide for all the Manhattan tips
you need.
Downtown
A city within a city, Manhattan's lower precinct is made up of world-famous areas such as Chinatown, Little Italy, Wall Street and the resurrected World Trade Center. Soho's fashionistas, Tribeca's celebrities, and the East Village's culinary delights also make downtown truly cosmopolitan.
Brooklyn
Close enough to the Manhattan buzz, but with a laid-back feel, Brooklyn is a borough where you can experience echoes of New York from days gone by, while enjoying the hippest crowds, trends and venues. Here you'll
find hotels to suit a wide range of budgets and tastes
. Just across the East River from Manhattan,
the New York Marriott at Brooklyn Bridge
is a gateway to both Manhattan and the heart of Brooklyn. Close to McCarren Park, the uber-cool
King and Grove Williamsburg
is the first full-service lifestyle hotel in Brooklyn. On Dean Street,
The Missing Lantern
offers the kind of affordable rooms that make Brooklyn a prime option for those traveling on a budget.

Radisson Martinique on Broadway


Truly lovely hotel

What keeps this from being a 5 rating is the room service wait staff - they need better training, both in service and language, if they are to represent this quality of hotel. They were not rude at all, simply somewhat immature and inexperienced, which a bit of training would have easily helped.

Courtyard by Marriott New York Manhattan/Upper East Side


UES near the Q

We decided to stay away from the usually touristy areas of Manhattan. The new subway Q line provided quick access to all the places we wanted to go and see, but let us stay in a new neighborhood with great food and amenities. There were some repair and cleaning deficiencies at the hotel property, but overall a good value and great stay. Used the exercise facility every day!
