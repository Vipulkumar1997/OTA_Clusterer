Asia Cruise Guide


Drift along the famed Yangtze River, journey to the glittering metropolis of Singapore, or bask on the pristine beaches of Koh Samui on a cruise that blends ancient traditions with modern amenities.
A diverse and dynamic continent with cultures, traditions, and geography that differ starkly from one region to the next, a cruise to Asia is typically divided into the regions of Southeast Asia and East Asia. Although the two regions are unlike one another, an Asia cruise to either of these regions will provide passengers with a delightful mélange of magnificent scenery, cultural intrigue, and ample opportunities for rest and relaxation.
An East Asia cruise vacation typically includes stops in China, Japan and South Korea. Passengers can disembark in Beijing to enter the palatial Forbidden City or tour the imposing Great Wall of China. In the bustling skyscraper city of Tokyo, passengers can shop at the famed Ginza district, and in the seaside resort town of Busan, they can unwind on the sandy shores of Haeundae Beach. Depending on which cruise line you choose to sail with, you may have the opportunity experience local customs and traditions, such as taking dim sum cooking classes, learning calligraphy, and visiting traditional sumo stables.
East Asia river cruises have also been gaining popularity, and the most frequented route involves cruising along the famed Yangtze River. Stretching for more than 3,900 miles, the Yangtze flows from the Tibetan Plateau before emptying into the East China Sea. The Yangtze is the longest river in Asia, and one of the highlights of a Yangtze River cruise is a visit to the majestic Three Gorges, a region replete with lush bamboo groves, misty mountains, and tranquil riverbanks.
For travelers looking to explore the region of Southeast Asia, a Southeast Asia cruise itinerary provides passengers with the opportunity to see countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Myanmar. Apart from soaking up the sun on the beckoning beaches of Langkawi, passengers can drift past the spectacular seascape of limestone pillars in Halong Bay, glimpse timeless treasures in the resplendent temples of Bangkok, and tempt their taste buds in the culinary melting pot of Singapore.
For a more intimate look into village life, a Southeast Asia river cruise can take passengers along the Mekong River or the Irrawaddy River. A cruise along the Mekong River typically begins in Ho Chi Minh City, with port visits along the way to Hanoi, Siem Reap and Phnom Penh. A cruise to Myanmar has also become a popular river itinerary, with most journeys starting in Mandalay or Bagan, with ports of call in Yangon and Pyay.
The best time of year to go on an Asia cruise vacation varies according to which part of Asia you intend to visit. A cruise to East Asia is best taken during the winter season when the temperatures are a bit cooler. The temperature can reach scorching levels in July and August, and in June and July the rainy season can put a damper on most cruising plans. Peak season for Southeast Asia cruises are from November through to March, when the temperatures are delightful and the rainfall minimal.
