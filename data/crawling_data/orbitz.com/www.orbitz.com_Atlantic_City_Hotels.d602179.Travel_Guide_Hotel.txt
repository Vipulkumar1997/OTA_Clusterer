A typical casino hotel. Big and clean, the pool and hot tubs are nice. But there is nothing to do outside the hotel, except watching the inlet or fishing. You have to drive to the boardwalk, where has nice beach and playing places, stores and many restaurants by the beach.

Explore New Jersey’s famous gaming capital
Known as the
East Coast's
gaming capital, this resort destination offers fine dining, legendary entertainment, shopping and beach days all in one spot. Atlantic City blends the ambience of small-town America with lively urban life. The most famous feature of this place is the large boardwalk lined with casinos. Its rich heritage runs deep and continues to attract visitors from around the world looking to uncover the excitement that inspired songs, movie and even board games.
Things to see and do
Beach, boardwalk and casinos
The four-mile boardwalk is home to famous casinos and novelty shops. Rest your feet and take a ride in a rolling chair, a boardwalk staple since the 1800s, before meandering in and out of casinos to enjoy the try your luck at the slot machines, roulette wheel, or an old -fashioned card game. The boardwalk overlooks the ocean and one of New Jersey's best beaches. It has earned the nickname “America's playground,” where visitors and locals can tan, swim and play in the sand for free.
Atlantic City shopping
Just off the boardwalk you will find the
Tanger Outlets
, which span 15 city blocks. Famous names like Eddie Bauer, Forever 21 and Gap feature in the complex. For more elite shopping, The Pier Shops at Caesars features brands like Tiffany & Co. and Hugo Boss.
Dining in the city
Atlantic City offers an eclectic array of dining options. Street vendors on the boardwalk serve up pizza, icing -dusted funnel cakes, soft pretzels and other treats. A visit to Steel's Fudge, the oldest family-owned fudge producer in the world, is a necessity for chocolate lovers.
Fine dining is available as well. For example, the Borgata Hotel houses Bobby Flay Steak, which features traditional steakhouse fare, and Chef Wolfgang Puck's renowned grille boasts American delights with a twist. To get the most bang for your buck, visit one of the many great AC buffets. Harrah's is a local favorite with its high variety of hot and cold entrees.
Entertainment
Famous names present shows around the city, from comedians to popular musical performers such as Rod Stewart, Erasure and Steely Dan. The Convention Center is a mecca for business events and conferences, from automotive trade shows to sports competitions and foodie events.
Where to stay
Boardwalk and marina
The boardwalk is lined with upscale hotels and most casinos offer rooms with varied amenities. The Borgata is one of the most modern facilities in the marina district, with more than 2,000 luxury guest rooms and suites. Off the main drag, recognized chains are available as well. For instance, the Best Western Envoy Inn is one block from the beach. Its downtown location remains in the heart of the city but provides more affordable rates.
Price
Atlantic City hotels vary in price. Usually, boardwalk properties run a few hundred dollars a night. Further away, a visitor may find a suitable room for less than $100. During peak summer season, rates tend to be rise considerably.
Best times to visit
Beach lovers will want to visit any time from June through August. However, this is peak season, so hotel rates are high. Atlantic City is located in the southern part of New Jersey, meaning summers are warm and humid but receive a pleasant ocean breeze, which keeps temperatures cooler than inland. Average highs are in the mid-70s. To avoid crowds, fall and spring are better and, after Labor Day, airfares drop, but some attractions begin to close.
Winters are cool, but Atlantic City’s position keeps it from receiving as much snow as other New Jersey regions, averaging 16 inches per year.
Special events
Spring and summer
In March, the Convention Center houses the largest indoor antique and collectibles show in the world. Mid-June, sees the Borgata host its "Summer Open" poker tournament for budding players.
Fall and winter
For fall, a new event in development is the AC Seafood Festival. This gives attendees the chance to experience live music, art and top food prepared by local chefs. The AC International Triathlon occurs in September as well, so you can run, cycle and swim your way to victory, or simply sit back and watch the competition.

Nice hotel close to beach

Pleasantly surprised with hotel. Good location but access to it can be difficult with the roads being closed close to it. Front desk was great! Room was dated but neat and clean with a lot of space. View from room was terrific. It is like a 30 foot window to look at the ocean. Bring your own pillow as the ones there were terrible. Very thin with basically nothing in them. Staff very friendly and helpful as this is my first visit to AC in many years.

great place. My kids loved being close to the beach. 
Took a walk on the board in the evening. 
Only downside is the lack of good restaurants near the boardwalk. 
Will be back if the summer allows !
Rooms were well apportioned and clean. 
We encountered some traffic whilst getting to the shore so try to avoid the peak times.
