Heading to Minneapolis
If you�re looking for flights to Minneapolis, use Orbitz.com to find the best fares for your chosen travel dates. Minneapolis is a Midwestern city that offers visitors a wonderful mix of cultural events and outdoor life. You can spend one afternoon at the Minnesota Institute of Art and the next kayaking on the Chain of Lakes.
Flying into Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport
Flights into Minneapolis fly into Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, located 10 miles southeast of Minneapolis. The airport handles domestic flights to and from various locations across the country as well as international flights to and from destinations like Paris, London, and Montreal. The airport has two terminals: the Lindbergh Terminal and the Humphrey Terminal.
Getting from the Airport into Town
There are several ways to get into town from the airport. Choose the one that works best with your budget. If you�d like to take a taxi into town, a taxi booth is located just outside the airport. Access it by going through the Lindbergh Terminal and walking through the tunnel level in the direction of the parking ramp. Once there, go up one level to the booth. Fares into the center of town will cost you about $30, and the ride can take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes depending on traffic. Public transportation is available via the Metro Transit Route 55 bus, which stops near the east side of the Lindbergh Terminal. It runs directly downtown, and the adult fare is $1.75 during off-peak hours and $2.25 during rush hour.
Climate in Minneapolis
The weather in Minneapolis varies widely from season to season. Winter lows average around 13�F, but they can get much lower due to the arctic air masses that travel through the region. Wind chills can make it seem much colder, so if you�re traveling to the city in the cold season, dress warmly and wear plenty of layers. Summer temperatures average around a pleasant 85�F, but they can get higher if conditions are right. Those higher temperatures can reach over 100�F, and the accompanying humidity can make it feel quite uncomfortable. Wear light cotton clothing and try to stay near air conditioning if you�re visiting the city then. The best time to visit Minneapolis is generally between June to August, when days are sunny and there are plenty of outdoor activities and festivals to enjoy.
Things to Do in Minneapolis
Theater lovers will love the Guthrie Theater. The theater�s repertory company has gained national acclaim for its performances. Grab a bike and visit stunningly beautiful Minnehaha Park. Ride through the park and experience the beauty and nature of the space, including the famous 53-foot Minnehaha Falls. Winter sees a slight drop-off in tourism, but there�s still plenty to do and hotel deals abound. Minneapolis has an excellent track record when it comes to snow cleanup, so you should still be able to get where you want to go even if it snows. When the weather�s cold, check out the Midtown Global Market for a unique shopping experience where vendors from around the world sell their wares.
Getting Ready for Minneapolis
When you book your flights to Minneapolis through Orbitz.com, you�ll have the satisfaction of knowing that you�re getting some of the best deals around. Whether you�re planning on hiking the trails, sampling Somalian pastries at the Midtown Global Market, or catching a performance at the Guthrie, you�ll end up loving this city.





Minneapolis When to Go
True to its reputation, Minneapolis is downright frigid and often frozen from November through March. Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul—which make up the Twin Cities—combine for the coldest average temperature in any city in the country, with lows of 4 degrees and 12 degrees in January and February. The upside is that, due to its location, Minneapolis also receives ample sunshine in the winter, even though you’re probably not planning on sunbathing then.
The gloom of the winter months retreats to beautiful regrowth in spring and summer, and although visitors will find slightly higher airfare and hotel prices May through August, the extra bucks are well worth it. Minneapolis is famed for its vast park system, which includes the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway and its seven districts and 50.1 miles of trails, lakes, and riverfront. The byway is the perfect place for a bike ride or jog in the warm summer months, when temperatures hover in the mid-80s. Minnesota is known as the Land of 10,000 Lakes, and visitors who travel to Minneapolis in the spring and summer will never be too far from good fishing, boating, water-skiing, and swimming.
Minneapolis also features Target Field, home of the Twins and the top-ranked sports stadium in North America, according to ESPN the Magazine. Travelers to the city during baseball season (April through October) would be wise to check it out.
