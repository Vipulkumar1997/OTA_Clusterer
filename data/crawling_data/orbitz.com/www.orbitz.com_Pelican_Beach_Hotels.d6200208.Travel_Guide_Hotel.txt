Great place to stay, comfort needs improvement.
The studio was very clean and in great condition. View of the ocean was amazing. Thermostat on AC needs to be lowered. Room was too warm at times. Bed is kinda firm. Very quiet place to get away. Staff is helpful. Would recommend.

Nice place and worth the money
The villas are nice and spacious and offer a lot of features. From kayaks to bicycles, the amenities are definitely a bonus and the place well worth it. However, I would recommend getting a vehicle because it'll be cheaper than taking a cab everywhere.

Friendly, helpful front desk staff. Couldn't find my Orbitz reservation at first but worked it out. Nice room. Clean. Cable TV. WiFi. More than what I needed for one night. $14.00 cab ride from the airport. Definitely recommend the place.
