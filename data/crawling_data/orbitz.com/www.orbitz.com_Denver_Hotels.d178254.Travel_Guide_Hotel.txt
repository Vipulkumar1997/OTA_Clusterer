Dynamic Denver is more than a Mile High City
Commonly known as the “Mile High City,” Denver marks the geographical transition from the Great Plains to the Rocky Mountains. Cultivating hustle and bustle through its airportone of the largest in the worldplus a great number of artistic and cultural features including
Denver Art Museum
and the Clyfford Still Museum, Denver is a hive of commercial and leisure activity. With farmland to the east and a seemingly limitless number of ski resorts to the west, this is a destination that perfectly combines natural and manmade attractions, giving it appeal for the spirited adventurer, the art lover, the city-hopper and everything in between.
Yearly events
Denver Botanic Gardens Summer Concert Series
Every year in June, the blooming Denver Botanic Gardens hosts a series of summer concerts at York Street and Chatfield. Families, couples and businesspeople can take a break on the lawn to enjoy a selection of music from local artists after exploring the garden during the daytime.
Elephant Rock Cycling Festival
Also during the month of June, athletic types from all over come for this popular cycling event. A
Colorado tradition
that has been going on for more than 20 years, this premier cycling festival is open to participants of all ages. Cycling trails for different ability levels have been created, but the original course is the pilgrimage to Castle Rock.
Denver Film Festival
Held in November, the international film festival in Denver has been celebrated for more than 35 years. Usually lasting for about 11 days, there are plenty of opportunities to watch award-winning films, or explore other forms of entertainment available at the festival. The Denver Film Festival has become large enough to support more than 200 screenings, so you may wind up rubbing shoulders with Hollywood greats during a winter visit.
Best time to stay in Denver
The most popular time of year for visiting Denver is June through August. Travelers on a budget may wish to come between autumn and spring, when accommodations are cheaper and temperatures are comfortable at around 62 degrees Fahrenheit. Skiers will love the winter months, when the neighboring slopes turn white and the cable cars crank into gear. During these cold days temperatures can drop as low as 16 degrees.
Summer time brings long days of festivals and fairs. Visitors can spend time hiking the nearby mountains before bar-hopping down 16th Street in the evenings. Daytime temperatures average at around 88 degrees, making for some very warm sunlit adventures.
Where to stay
16th Street
For buzzing city center life, Denver hotels near 16th Street are an ideal place to stay. This street is at the heart of downtown, surrounded by culture, shops, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Artistic appreciation can be found at features like the Denver Soundwalk designed by Jim Green, which plays whimsical sounds throughout the day, activating whenever people walk by what appears to be ordinary grates in the sidewalk. The 16th Street Theater, which features everything from live music to theatrical performances, is within walking distance of 14th, 15th and 16th Street accommodations like the Hyatt Regency at Colorado Convention Center and the aptly named Hotel Teatro, where theatrical memorabilia like costumes and pictures are showcased.
LODO
For a more historic adventure in Denver, consider staying in LODO. LODO, which stands for Lower Downtown, is more frequently populated by locals than travelers, providing a more authentic experience. Visitors can find guided walking tours available, for taking in an architectural history of Denver that includes The Oxford Hotelthe first hotel in the city dating back to the late 19th centuryand The Cruise Room. Recently renovated, LODO has become a beacon of culture and entertainment in the Mile High City.
