It was a wonderful experience to celebrate my birthday by staying at the hotel. Unfortunately we had to leave the day before the Christmas lights were lit. We will plan to return with our grandchildren when they are old enough to enjoy the beauty of Christmas at Opryland.

The room was pretty good overall. Very convenient to get to downtown Nashville and fraction of what you would pay to stay there. The room was clean, but we almost choked on air freshener and had to throw open the windows as soon as we walked in. The front walls are pretty thin, so you can hear everyone ...

Grand Ole Opry









Get your country music groove on in Nashville
This central Tennessee city is known for its Southern hospitality, its rolling topography, and its role as the country music industry's nerve center. Home to the Grand Ole Opry, Country Music Hall of Fame and CMA Awards, the city is a wonderland for country music lovers. In addition, the music scene in Nashville hosts numerous other genres, including classical, rock and blues.

Things to see
Grand Ole Opry
This prominent stage has moved several times since debuting in 1925. The current venue on Opryland Drive boasts 4,400 seats and architecture that's both rustic and lavish. This theater hosts major stars as well as promising newcomers. Every November, the Grand Ole Opry shifts its location to downtown's Ryman Auditorium, and it returns home in January.
Parthenon
Since 1897, Nashville's Parthenon has brought a taste of Greece to the South. Situated in Centennial Park, this majestic edifice houses an Athena statue that's 42-feet tall, along with an outstanding collection of art.
Schermerhorn Symphony Center
The city's dedication to the fine arts is also evident at
Schermerhorn Symphony Center
. This musical palace is the Nashville Symphony's home base, and its centerpiece is a spectacular, towering organ.
General Jackson Showboat
The General Jackson Showboat, which plies the Cumberland River, looks as though it's popped right out of a Mark Twain tale. This graceful steamboat offers various cruises throughout the week, many of which include delicious food and live music.
Country Music Hall of Fame
Even if you're not a country fan, you will still be swept away by the historical and cultural artifacts inside this imposing building. The interactive exhibits display guitars, costumes, microphones and photographs. Together, they tell the fascinating story of this enduring musical genre.

Travel and lodging information
By car
If you're driving on
your trip to Nashville
, you can take one of three interstates: I-65 from the north or south, I-24 from the southeast and northwest, and I-40 from the east or west.
By air
Nashville International Airport (BNA) is eight miles from downtown, and 10 airlines operate there. This world-class transportation center has three levels, and several hotels are nearby.
Accommodations
The Sheraton Music City Hotel, which is one of the most distinguished Nashville hotels, has outdoor and indoor pools and a large courtyard. Plus, each guest gets a private patio or balcony. This Sheraton provides a free shuttle service to and from the airport five minutes away.
The 202-room Holiday Inn Express Nashville Airport is a more inexpensive option. It offers a fitness center, an outdoor swimming pool, complimentary breakfasts, and free shuttles that go to a variety of top Nashville attractions.
Note that it costs approximately $25 to take a taxi from the airport to downtown. Public and Gray Line buses also travel between these two destinations for a cheaper fare.

Yearly events of note
Winter
In February, Nashville presents a series of soul concerts to honor Black History Month. During this month, you can also celebrate your love of turkeys at the National Wild Turkey Federation Convention, where turkey-calling competitions and turkey-themed art displays are just two of the highlights.
Spring
The "Rock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Marathon" on April 30 is a race with a distinctly Nashville twist. Dozens of bands perform as runners make their way through town. After the marathon, there's yet another concert at the Bridgestone Arena.
A four-day bash hosted by the Country Music Association in early June brings hundreds of artists to the city, many of whom are the best in the business, like Keith Urban and Tim McGraw.
Summer
Every July 4, there's a massive outdoor Nashville Symphony concert and fireworks show. Then, in August, many residents and visitors head to the Tomato Art Fest in East Nashville for recipes, cooking demonstrations, games and stories, all of which incorporate the versatile tomato.
Fall
The Germantown district holds two gigantic Oktoberfest festivals, and each showcases many artists and performers. Finally, the CMA Awards is a nationally-televised event every November. Tickets are notoriously difficult to obtain, but you can be part of the buzz inside the city.

Enjoyed the stay

Me being from out of town, the staff was amazingly helpful with tips on where to go while I was in town. The rooms were comfortable and clean. I really appreciated the shuttle bus to an from downtown,  very convenient. Shuttle bus driver Gina had some great tips on where to eat too.

DoubleTree by Hilton Nashville Downtown


good value

This  was a nice hotel in the downtown. It was within walking distance to bars, museums, river, etc. We felt we got good value, however, did not use their parking at $42.00 per day. Instead we parked at the Library parking lot at 6th and Church for $13.00 a day. It was a short walk away. There were many parking options less expensive than he Hilton Doubletree.  We had a room on the 9th floor and found it to be noisy with a loud roaring sound all the time. This room was on the top floor and we thought it may have been some equipment on the roof causing the noise. The room was spacious and comfortable and the staff was very helpful. We would stay there again if we return to Nashville.
