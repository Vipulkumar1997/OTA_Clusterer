Hawaii Cruise Guide


Immerse yourself in the natural wonders of this tropical archipelago, where you’ll discover magnificent beaches, lush landscapes, and a delectable array of seafood specialties.
The Hawaiian islands have become synonymous with paradise, and the best way to explore the natural beauty of these islands is to embark on a Hawaii cruise. From palm-fringed beaches and vibrant coral reefs to active volcanoes and plunging sea cliffs, each island you encounter during your Hawaii cruise offers a unique experience. As you cruise along the different islands, you may fall in love with bustling Honolulu on the island of Oahu, the secluded beaches of Lanai, or the verdant greenery of Kauai. In Hawaii, there is an island for every traveler.
Majestic, world-class ships and intimate, boutique-style vessels all cruise to Hawaii’s archipelago, with most departures from California, Vancouver and Honolulu. With a Hawaii cruise, you get the benefit of traveling to multiple islands in comfort and style, without any of the hassle. And, the itineraries you have to choose from are just as diverse as the Hawaiian islands themselves.
On the Big Island you can hike around Akaka Falls, one of the island’s most beautiful waterfalls. In Maui you can participate in numerous outdoor adventures such as whale watching, outrigger canoeing, and snorkeling around Molokini Crater. Kauai’s legendary beauty ranges from lush mountain ranges to roaring sea cliffs, which provides the perfect backdrop for adventure seekers. If relaxing on a beach is what you’re after, Oahu has an array of spectacular beaches for you to choose from.
Onboard, you can still capture the spirit and soul of Hawaii as you dine on a Hawaiian seafood salad called poke, learn how to perform a hula dance, and watch entertaining folkloric performances. Make sure you keep your camera on hand as you gaze out at the picturesque valleys and shimmering ocean from the comfort of your cruise liner; you may just spot a whale breeching the waters!
The best time to embark on your Hawaii cruise vacation is during the winter, when travelers are fleeing the cold weather for the warmer climate of the tropics. November through May is also the best time to glimpse humpback whales cresting the ocean waters. Fewer cruise lines operate in Hawaii during the height of summer, but you can still find some great Hawaii cruise deals before and after the months of July and August, as well as from Thanksgiving to mid-December.
