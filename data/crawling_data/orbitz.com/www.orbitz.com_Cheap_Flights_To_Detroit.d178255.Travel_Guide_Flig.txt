Visit Vibrant Detroit
Detroit, Michigan, is the home of the American auto industry, but there is far more to it than cars. Business travelers and tourists alike rely on Orbitz.com to find the best prices on flights to Detroit, as well as deals on hotels and other travel needs in this Midwestern cultural, commercial, and educational center.
Detroit Metro Airport Welcomes You
Your flight will land at Detroit Metro Airport, which is what locals and experienced travelers call Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. It is a major transportation hub for domestic and international flights, making it one of the busiest airports in the United States. Its formal address is simply Detroit Metropolitan Airport, and it is located in the city itself, about twenty-one miles away from downtown Detroit.
From the Airport to Downtown
You can catch a cab at the airport and pay about $41 for a ride downtown, or you can pay $1.50 for a ninety-minute journey on the public SMART bus Route #125 to reach your downtown destination. Eight major rental car companies have facilities in Detroit Metro Airport, so if you reserved a rental car through Orbitz.com, it will be waiting for you when you arrive. Private airport shuttles to locations within the city and its environs are also available.
Detroit Weather
Detroit temperatures range from lows of 18�F in January, when highs hit only 30�F, to highs of 81�F to 82�Fin July and August, with lows between 61�F and 63�F in these hottest months. April and October are particularly pleasant, as high temperatures hit 57�F in April and 61�F in October, with lows of 37�F and 43�F respectively. Precipitation is relatively moderate throughout the year; February is the driest month and July is the wettest month. Bring a folding umbrella with you, and bring sunglasses as well especially from May to September, as there is plenty of bright sunshine.
The Best of Detroit
The Motor City gave birth to a musical genre all its own: Motown. The two major studios that put Motown on the map now comprise the Motown Historical Museum, a must-see for fans of music as well as history buffs. The museum features the original equipment that Motown stars used to record their hits, along with other Motown memorabilia. As for the motoring history of the city, it began at the Piquette Avenue Ford plant, where workers once turned out Model T automobiles on the famed moving assembly lines. That plant is now the Model T Automotive Heritage Complex, and it is a worthwhile destination for automobile enthusiasts. You will want to see downtown Detroit itself, as it is undergoing a cultural and economic rebirth, and the Detroit People Mover is a scenic local railroad with stations throughout the center of the city. Each station is an attraction in itself, as it is decorated with unique sculptures and other works of art. Detroit is also rich in architectural monuments, and some of the best are the Guardian Building, Fox Theater, and the GM Renaissance Center, which features an observation deck on one of the highest floors.
Plan Your Visit
Detroit attractions include everything from museums and parks to a casino that rivals those of the gaming centers of the world. When you plan your trip with Orbitz.com, you�ll save money on flights to Detroit as well as hotels, rental cars, and other travel needs. You�ll have plenty of extra funds to enjoy shopping, local restaurants, and even the casino.
