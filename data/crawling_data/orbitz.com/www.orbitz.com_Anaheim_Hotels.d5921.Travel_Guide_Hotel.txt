My sister and I started staying here a couple of years ago on our annual December Disneyland trip and now it is a tradition!

This hotel was only a place to sleep for us. Our family is on the go all day everyday of vacation. We chose this hotel for it's closeness to Disneyland.

Even though my wife ripped into the front desk guy(Jacob) about a bug issue. He maintained his cool and got her another room to her satisfaction. Very professional and courteous! The lady checking us in was also very efficient and pleasant. Excellent front desk staff!

Anaheim offers family fun and sports galore
Anaheim is located in the heart of Orange County, California. Home to Disneyland and its notable sports teams, Anaheim is famously nicknamed “the happiest place on Earth." Aside from world-famous theme parks and championship-winning teams, Anaheim offers high-end boutique shopping, museums, amazing music venues, beautiful beaches and restaurants. These range from extravagant dining to small and intimate spots where visitors are likely to find gourmet menus. Anaheim has its own easily accessible airport nearbyJohn Wayne Airport in Santa Ana(SNA) that creates a stress-free traveling environment. No matter what you choose to do in
beautiful Anaheim
, you'll never run out of thrilling experiences, tasty treats and postcard-worthy weather.
Things to do
Disneyland
One can easily spend their entire Anaheim vacation at the Disneyland Resort and have an awesome trip. Offering two separate parks, Disney’s California Adventure and Disneyland itself, as well as a shopping and entertainment district (Downtown Disney), visitors are sure to see amazing live performances or have a deliciously satisfying meal. Disneyland offers rides that cater to all ages, with a distinct sense of childlike nostalgia for older guests. Live shows like Muppet Vision 3D and a spectacular nightly fireworks show are also staples of Disneyland. And don't forget all the memorable characters walking around; you are never too old to take a picture with Mickey and Minnie Mouse.
Downtown Disney
For those on tighter budgets, no admission fee is required for a distinctly Disney experience by taking a stroll through Downtown Disney. Here you can purchase souvenirs, eat at high-end restaurants or snack on those famous Disney churros; guests can also catch a movie or do some shopping. The acclaimed House of Blues Disneyland is located here, where visitors can enjoy a range of local acts and world-famous bands. Downtown Disney opens as early as 7:00 a.m. and closes as late as 2:00 a.m., giving guests ample time to get their free Disney fix.
Sports
No matter what time of the year you visit Anaheim, you'll always be able to catch an amazing ice hockey game or take in a good old-fashioned baseball game. Anaheim is home to two major sports teams: the 2007 Stanley Cup-winning Anaheim Ducks and the 2002 World Series-winning
Anaheim Angels
. Watch the Ducks play at the Honda Center or, as locals call it from a prior name, The Pond, a cutting-edge arena that transforms into a giant amphitheater. The Angels can be seen at Angel Stadium, one of the oldest (though fully-modernized) stadiums in the country.
Where to stay and how to get around
Though Disneyland does offer its own luxurious hotel, it can easily become expensive for more family-minded travelers. Thankfully, there are numerous Anaheim hotels near Disneyland, Disney’s California Adventure, and many other attractions, that are reasonably affordable. Prices range from $85 to $150, typically averaging at $100. These hotels are conveniently located near the Anaheim Resort Transportation, or ART, that can take you directly to Disneyland, Angel Stadium and the Honda Center. The ART is also easily transferable to other trains in Orange County that travel to neighboring cities such as Santa Ana and San Clemente, or Los Angeles and San Diego a bit further off.
Best time to visit
You're pretty much guaranteed beautiful weather all year-round while visiting Anaheim. The summer highs average in the 80s, while the winters typically dip no lower than the 60s. The Santa Ana winds tend to make summers last longer in Anaheim, and most of Southern California gets a cooling case of June gloom, making fun in the sun a dicey proposition in early summer. However, if you visit Anaheim in January or August, you may have a very hard time heading back home.
