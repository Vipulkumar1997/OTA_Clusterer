We have stayed at this hotel a couple of times now and we have had a very pleasant stay..everyone was helpful and friendly..we WILL being staying there again..and we will be bringing our family with us! Excellent place!














JOE and GAIL, syracuse ny

I quickly booked this hotel while it was on sale before I read any reviews. Once I started reading the reviews I got worried. This hotel was great for the price. You're not going to get a 5 star hotel at min cost. The grounds were clean, pool, Jacuzzi and playground all nice and clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. I heard no loud noise, I personally like that the pool and tiki bar are open until midnight, the kids like to swim at night. We had poolside room and wasn't noisy at all. The maids will knock on you door at check out but were nice about it. The room was spacious and comfortable 2 mini fridges, a microwave and coffee maker. Perfect location close to theme parks and right next to Old Town. I like the separate quarters for the kids and you just can't find that everywhere. Great family choice and I'll definitely go back coming from a Hilton Honors member. :)














Crystal, West Palm Beach, FL

The pictures made it look great but it was very run down and outdated. The location is good but it is so loud and the staff pounds on the door, waking you up at ridiculous hours, No coffee maker either, Just ok. They won't give you local brochures just the discount ones for the time sharing scam!

I've stayed at this place a number of times, and never really had any major issues until recently. Two visits ago, our bathroom door had a broken hinge, and couldn't close. We managed however. This most recent trip though, we had a number of issues, most of which were maintenence related. Light in vanity/sink area didn't work. Guy came in replaced a bulb, but didn't fix the problem. Many of the power outlets were non-functional, therefore it was very difficult to charge our phones or use a hair dryer. Lastly, the mini fridge didn't work. As I stated earlier, this place used to be okay for the price, but it seems like management/ownership simply doesn't care about basic hotel room maintenance. Won't be coming back anymore.

I booked this hotel on line.  The pictures included in their website are nowhere near the reality.  Rooms are very old and smelly.  Beds are uncomfortable.

The hotel staff were actually very pleasant and helpful---they were the most positive thing about the hotel. However, imagine dormitory life in the last original dormitory on campus (that is awaiting either rehab or simply to be torn down). That's this hotel. Think Motel 6 from its original days left insufficiently attended. The room looked and felt as if it hadn't been refurbished (or fully industrial cleaned) since the days of the 70s and when smoking profusely in rooms was allowed. (Though---the inside of the room did not smell like smoke, the 'long-term tenants' who lived below my room sat out on their chairs through the day making clouds of cigarette smoke to above where my room was located.) I had to move the nightstand, and judging from the trash, safety pins, dust, and debris beneath it, my guess is that the furniture in there hasn't been moved in a LONG time. Please note, the cleaning staff did profusely clean daily.  The bathroom light switch had to be jiggled for the light inside to work (50 percent of the time).  The air conditioner was anemic in its performance---thankfully, I stayed there in middle October and not in the dead heat of summer. Tenant trash in the parking lot and walkways took a day or two to get cleaned.  Security fish-eye mirrors were broken. Look---the hotel is in a great location to everything and is a great and inexpensive place to crawl into at the end of the day (from the varying Orlando excursions).  Just don't expect to want to live there.

I have stayed at the Seralago in the past (2010?) and read about the updates they were doing and decided to give them another try on a quick trip to the Orlando area to use some tickets we had for Legoland. During my past trip, I found the room in desperate need of updating and the beds were terrible. I must say they are working on it. There is fresh paint around the property. The beds and pillows were light years ahead of the bedding they had in the past. We all slept well and found the new beds comfortable. The room was clean and the maid even arranged our son's stuffed animals on the bed. The only real complaint I had was that the carpets could use steam cleaning or to be replaced/updated and some of the furniture could use painting/cleaning. I also noted some music played at the pool that was inappropriate for young children due to explicit lyrics. Not sure if it was hotel sponsored or from a guest stereo. Besides that we will consider the Seralago for future stays again. You cannot beat the price and location. When in central Florida I am not there to stay in my room. So don't really need luxuries. Just a clean maintained room with friendly staff will do and the Seralago does this! Plus proximity to Fun Spot and Old Town Kissimmee right next door which is a great place to wind down for a snack and some drinks. Also home to very awesome motorcycle and car cruises/parades Thursday-Saturday nights!

Great comfortable rooms and a cafe and arcade...but the best thing is that it's next to olde town where there's a lot to do even at night.

This place was a total dump, to keep it PG I'll just say it's the place looked rundown no Internet in the microwave in the room smoked It smelled bad  I just would not stay here again ! I only stay three nights and it just was bad but they kept the room clean but there was bugs crawling on the bathroom wall I just did not like it and I would have other words to say but  this is public display .

None of the lights were plugged in, had to figure out why no lights worked on our own. Door didn't like to close without us pushing on it. The outlet on table was not attached. Room was clean for the most part and nice tv with good channels. The breakfast buffet was $10/adults kids 10 and under are free. Only had a few items to choose from, not a decent spread. It was  edible just not worth the $10. Hotel was old but again nice for what we needed. Don't understand why they have a $7/day resort fee, don't see this as a resort.

For the price is good. But hotel need to be more maintenance. The room luck was broken. I wait 45 minute until security arrive with new card to open the room.

My husband and I stayed here for 5 days . Atleast 4 times we got locked out and couldn't get into our room and had to call maintenance every time and front desk people were oblivious, didn't even offer to change our room. Our room was barely cleaned and there were roaches . It was disgusting !!! We will never be coming back here.

The room was very outdated. The sink in the bathroom gad a foul smell upon entering. There were roaches in the room. It was the most disgusting thing to see. I was there only for the weekend, i did not want to even sleep on the bed. I will never stay there again.

Good price for a nights sleep. Stayed many times however this was the worst room ever. Shower was silicone and screws to make a useable shower. Ned was the equivalent of concrete. Room size was great. Many restaurants meet by as well as Old Town for entertainment..
