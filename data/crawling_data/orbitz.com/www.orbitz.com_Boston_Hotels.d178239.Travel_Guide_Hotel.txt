I really like this hotel. Our stay was fine. However, at check out we were charged $20 per day resort fee. Reseptionist told us that we are charged for the gim and wifi. Gim was permanently closed and wifi didn't work! So, in my opinion, $20 per day for this is quite excessive.

Check in,was bit slow, was thinking Clerk was new to the job. Also also did not make me feel welcome like they weren't happy to see me. also I had to use a walker and ask for handicap room and unfortunately it was on the 4th floor. All handicap rooms should be on the first floor because of the power ...

Celebrate the old in the modern city of Boston
The city of Boston offers visitors a compelling combination of style, sophistication, history and charm. Travel back in time by taking a guided tour of the Freedom Trail, an actual red-brick path that weaves through the city and highlights the events that led to the US declaring independence from Britain. The tour includes a visit to Boston Common, Park Street Church and the Old State House, landmarks associated with the American Revolution. Boston's sophistication is partly due to its culture of academia and innovation. Known for its many academic institutions, there are over 100 universities and colleges in the greater Boston area. Some of the more famous ones are Harvard, MIT, Tufts University and Boston College.
Top attractions
Battle of Bunker Hill memorial
A memorial monument that stands a proud 221 feet in the air makes its home on Breed Hill in Boston's Charlestown neighborhood. The Battle of Bunker Hill, although actually fought on Breed Hill, marks itself as the first official battle of the American Revolution. A symbol not only of the battle but of early Americans' dreams of independence, much effort was put into the Bunker Hill Monument's creation; a railroad was built just to transport the granite needed for its construction. Spend the afternoon here with the family, or admire it on your march along the Freedom Trail.
Cheers
”Where everybody knows your name.” Cheers, which was originally named Bull & Finch pub, adopted its current moniker after the TV show gave the place such a boost in popularity. Situated conveniently in the city's center, locals and people from out of town can both enjoy the memorabilia and cozy atmosphere still available at this famous bar.
Alternative ideas
The Boston Public Library
One of the oldest and largest libraries in the country, the
Boston Public Library
has millions of books and record archives at its disposal. The library is also renowned for its amazing architecture, which some have said resembles that of a mausoleum. Author talks, book signings and other literary events are often held here, making the BPL an ideal place to stop for a calmer family activity or on the way back to your hotel after a long day of business.
Cambridge Antique Market
Open Tuesday through Sunday, this marketplace covers five floors with approximately 150 antique dealers showing their wares. Being on the East Coast, the antique stalls are well-stocked, and each artifact comes with a unique history. Whether you're looking for estate jewelry or that one focal piece of furniture, there's a good chance you can uncover it at the Cambridge Antique Market. Just be sure to allow space in your luggage for the prizes you may find here.
Climate
If you're visiting Boston in the early months of the year, you can expect a typical northern winter, with temperatures averaging about 27 degrees Fahrenheit. Sections of Boston that are more inland can become even colder. The hot and humid summers average near 80 degrees. The humidity lessens the farther inland you go, but the entire city experiences at least mildly hot and balmy weather conditions. This is especially true during late June, July and August. Late summer and early autumn can bring on severe thunderstorms or even hurricanes. On the plus side, Boston has never experienced a life'threatening tornado.
Best time to visit
Late spring and early summer are the best times to begin looking for
Boston hotels
to book for your vacation. Since the winters can prove to be too cold and the fall experiences heavy storms, visiting during the summer ensures that weather will not prevent you from exploring all that this city has to offer. Festivals frequently pop up during the warmer months; your stomach won't thank you for missing Chowderfest. Although both the history and modernity of Boston will ensure there's something to do 12 months a year, the great weather of the summer will motivate you to keep moving all day, and into the night.

Birthday

We stayed for the weekend to celebrate my wife's BD. My children came from Washington and New Hampshire. The hotel was very nice , the staff was friendly. check in process was fast easy and pleasant . During our stay we forgot a packet, a BD gift. I called the hotel and they located that in our room and kept it for us to pick it up at our convenience. I would recommend this hotel any time. It is close to many atrctions.

It's truly a 5 star hotel, but

I really enjoyed the visit at the Liberty.  The location, historic venue, food, and service were all exceptional.

Courtyard by Marriott Boston Dedham/Westwood


Convenient to Boston

This seems like a new hotel, right off the highway, close to Boston. Our family of four stayed one night. Check in was quick. The room was clean, but lacked toiletries, which was easily corrected with a quick call downstairs. Beds were comfortable with nice pillows. And the room was a comfortable temperature and quiet. Check out was quick, also. We didn't explore the rest of the hotel, and ate elsewhere. In all, it was a quick and restful stay in between days in Beantown.
