There are three major airports in NYC that handle international and domestic New York flights. Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), and LaGuardia Airport (LGA) all handle commercial flights to and from the New York metropolitan area. New York is the busiest hub for airports and La Guardia one of the busiest in the country, serving as a hub for Delta Air Lines. There are ground transportation options for travelers once their New York flights arrive to these airports. Individuals that have booked flights to the LaGuardia Airport can make taxi, limousine, or bus arrangements from the airport to their hotel. JFK receives more international traffic, and is a travel hub for JetBlue Airways. EWR is a hub for United Airlines, and has AirTrain Newark, a fast way to get to the other boroughs of New York and its massive surrounding sprawl.
New York Weather
The weather in New York City can be warm in the summer, spring, and fall months and snowy and extremely cold in the winter. Travelers that want to plan New York flights to experience a real winter should make flight arrangements between November and late February. Snow season in New York brings around 25-30 inches of snowfall. Individuals that want to experience a much warmer climate should arrange their flight accommodations between late April and September. New York is perfect for sightseeing and outdoor activities in May, June, and September. July and August are usually the hottest months of the year in New York.
Getting Around New York
There are plenty of ways to get around after your New York flight lands at one of the three major airports in the area. Traveling by car probably isn't the most viable means of transportation due to daily traffic jams on the city streets. It is advisable that visitors use transportation services that will get them around the city in a timely manner. The most practical transportation outlets to take advantage of when you fly into the city are taxi cabs, the subway, and bus. The MTA system will handle most transportation options, giving you access to every one of New York's famous boroughs, side-streets, and alleys, just minutes from departing New York flights.
New York City Attractions
The City That Never Sleeps will surely keep its visitors awake with all the different attractions that make New York City one of the most popular places in the world. The five of attractions below are must-visits:
Empire State Building, the former tallest building in the world provides visitors with a breath-taking view of the city
Statue of Liberty, the symbol of freedom stands tall in the Atlantic
Rockefeller Center, the Christmas season is welcomed to great fanfare with the lighting of the Christmas tree
The Metropolitan Museum of Art, home to art and sculptures that go back years 5,000 years
Central Park, a well-known green space in Manhattan with unlimited activity and relaxation for friends and family
