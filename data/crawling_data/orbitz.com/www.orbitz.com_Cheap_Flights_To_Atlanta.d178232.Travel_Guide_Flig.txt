Ground Transportation in Atlanta
The most economical means of transportation into the city is via the MARTA, Atlanta's local train service. You can board the MARTA at the station, near the baggage claim area.

Atlanta Area Weather Information
Atlanta's winters are mild, with average temperatures in the 40s and 50s, but summer temperatures can soar up to the 90s, with extreme humidity making it feel even hotter. July is the rainiest month of the year, so be sure to pack a rain slicker or umbrella in case you run into showers.
What to Do in Atlanta
Atlanta combines the elegance and charm of the south with big city living. Whether you are a history buff, urban adventurer or outdoor enthusiast, you will have plenty of choices to put into your planner for your Atlanta visit. Consider a trip to Turner Field, enjoy the nightlife in Buckhead, visit Olympic Park or take a bike tour of the city. Whatever you choose to do while you are there, remember to use Orbitz.com the next time you plan to look for flights to Atlanta.





Atlanta When to Go
Atlanta has four distinct seasons, but the climate is generally mild most of the year. Spring arrives early in Georgia, with short sleeves and sunglasses coming out as soon as March. A fit of blossoms and new foliage erupts in April and May, along with some of the city’s best annual events. The Atlanta Dogwood Festival is the unofficial start of spring, while the Inman Park Festival features one of the most bizarre parades of the year. Expect big crowds at both events.
July and August are perhaps the two least desirable months to visit, unless you like hot, sticky weather. Average highs hover around 89 degrees, and the humidity is infamous, making outdoor activities uncomfortable and leading to longer-than-average lines for indoor attractions. Summer’s warmth lingers well into autumn, though breezy days in October, with highs around 73 and lows in the 50s, are relaxed and pleasant.
Newcomers might be surprised to find temperatures that dip below freezing in December or January, but cold snaps don’t tend to stick. Barring a random extreme winter weather event, Atlanta usually sees snowfall only once or twice a year.
