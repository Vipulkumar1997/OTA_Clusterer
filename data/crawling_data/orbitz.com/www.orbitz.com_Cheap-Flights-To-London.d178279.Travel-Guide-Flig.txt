London When to Go
London has a reputation for being wet and dark, and while the reputation holds up in the fall and winter months, when a spot of sun is something to celebrate, visitors to London get good weather if they know when to go.
The best time to visit London is summer, when temperatures average in the low to mid 70s and precipitation is minimal. This, of course, is when airfare and hotels are at their peak prices. But good weather in London can be worth the extra cash.
Most travelers avoid London from October through January, when temperatures are coldest. That said, you’ll find great winter deals on airfare and hotels. If museums and other indoor spaces are on your to–do list, this season may be a great budget option for you. Hearty raincoat required.
Transport options from London to Heathrow
If your holiday begins by going from Central London to Heathrow Airport, then you’ll need to plan ahead for a relaxed journey. There are two main options when getting to London Heathrow Airport from Central London. Both of these options service all terminals.
Transport options to Gatwick airport
If you need to transfer from Heathrow to Gatwick airport and need to make it to your connecting flight in plenty of time and within budget, we’ve got you covered. There are two main options when getting to Gatwick from Heathrow Airport and both serve both the north and south terminals.
