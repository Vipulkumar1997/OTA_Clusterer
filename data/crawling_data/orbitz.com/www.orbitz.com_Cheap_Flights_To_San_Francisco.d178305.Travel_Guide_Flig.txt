Travel to San Francisco
San Francisco is one of the most attractive towns on the West Coast because of the famous Golden Gate Bridge, a beautiful waterfront, and a thriving downtown. Orbitz.com can help you book a cheap flight to San Francisco and save you time and money on your whole vacation.
Arriving in San Francisco
Flights into San Francisco land at San Francisco International Airport, located at South San Francisco on the edge of the San Francisco Bay. With over 15 restaurants and many small shops around the terminals, you are sure to find the food you like and buy some souvenirs to help you remember your vacation. San Francisco's BART rapid rail service provides the fastest mode of public transportation to get from the airport to downtown, but it will cost you $8.25 for a one-way ticket. Travelers can also take the SamTrans bus, which costs $2 for a one-way trip or $6 for an all-day pass.
Exploring San Francisco
Once you arrive in San Francisco, you can see the West Coast's most iconic bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge. From the bridge, you can see the old Alcatraz prison, which is no longer in use for prisoners. However, you can still take tours of the facility. For a good view of the city, head to the Twin Peaks and see the city from above. The Land's End trails are perfect for those who like to get out and do some hiking. Because of the coastal climate, the weather stays fairly moderate, dropping down to about 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter and averaging between 55 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit in the summer months.
Visit the Beautiful San Francisco
San Francisco offers gorgeous views and a vast array of exciting activities that allow you to get outside and enjoy the city and its landmarks. Let Orbitz.com help you book cheap flights to San Francisco, as well as find deals on hotel rooms and car rentals.





San Francisco When to Go
San Francisco’s climate is mild year-round, so you can forget about packing wool underwear and parkas—or shorts and tank tops, for that matter. Though daytime temperatures rarely rise above 75 or drop below 55, there are still definite seasons.
The months of May, September, and October have less fog and, locals contend, the best weather. You may want to time your trip to coincide with one of San Francisco’s popular annual events, like the wacky Bay to Breakers seven-mile cross-town run/walk each May. The Mission District holds Carnaval in late May as well.
Summer is notoriously cool, with fog and chilly breezes sweeping across the city from the Pacific Ocean, although parts of San Francisco known as “the sunbelt”—the Mission District, for one—often remain balmy. Summer is also peak tourist season, when getting a seat on a cable car without an hours-long wait or nabbing a ticket for an Alcatraz tour can be near impossible. Late June’s LGBT Pride Celebration and Parade is one of the biggest in the country.
December, January, and February are the coldest and wettest months, though February does bring the colorful Chinese New Year’s Parade.
