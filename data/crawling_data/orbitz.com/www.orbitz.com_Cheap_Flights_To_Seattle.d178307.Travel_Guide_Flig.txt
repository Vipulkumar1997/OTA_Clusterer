Visitors traveling to Seattle might arrive at one of three local airports, including Tacoma Narrows Airport (TIW), Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA), and Kenmore Air Harbor (KEH). The majority of domestic and international fights to Seattle fly into SEA, which handles service for several air carriers, including Lufthansa, JetBlue, British Airways, and Delta Seattle flights. SEA Airport also features several shops and bookstores for passengers to browse during their time in the terminals. Visitors who have time between connections can enjoy a meal at one of the airport's 38 different restaurants and cafes. Smaller planes and corporate travelers who book Seattle flights typically arrive at TIW, which services the nearby Puget Sound area. KEH serves as a traffic hub for seaplanes.
Seattle Weather
Due to its location in the Pacific Northwest, Seattle's annual weather fluctuates with the seasons. In the winters, the city experiences a lot of rainfall along with mild temperatures in the 50s. If you're planning to book budget flights to Seattle during November, make sure you pack an umbrella in your suitcase. Seattle gets an average of six inches of precipitation in that month alone. In contrast, the summers in Seattle are dry and mild. High temperatures in the warm months average around 76 degrees Fahrenheit, while lows stay around 56 degrees each day.
Getting Around Seattle
Within the city, the King County Metro Transit system provides public transportation for residents and visitors to and from Seattle flights. While the system only operates bus routes in most areas, there is a light rail line that travels from Downtown Seattle through the south side of the city. For a unique travel experience, hop on the South Lake Union Streetcar to go up and down the city streets. Many of Seattle's popular sights are located in a few key neighborhoods, so you can reach several of them by walking through the city on foot. If you prefer to drive yourself around the area, there are several rental car agencies where you can hire a vehicle to navigate the streets yourself.
Seattle Attractions
After taking one of the low cost Seattle flights, tourists will find that the city's many attractions and sightseeing spots offer discount tickets and admissions to guests. Since Seattle has a bustling music scene, some of its hotspots pay tribute to art and music history.
Pacific Science Center: the interactive science facility for children has exhibits about math, biology, and technology
Seattle Aquarium: one of the largest marine attractions on the U.S. West Coast featuring a 120,000-gallon exhibit of native marine life
Point Defiance Zoo: a combination zoological park and aquarium with a special children's zone
Seattle Art Museum: home to over 25,000 paintings, sculptures, and artworks from artists all over the world
Space Needle, the signature landmark of the Seattle skyline that stands over 500 feet tall and offers a 360-degree view of the greater urban area





Seattle When to Go
Buffered from severe hot and cold weather by the Cascades, the Olympics, Puget Sound, and Lake Washington, Seattle’s climate is decidedly mild most of the time—winters in the 40s, summers in the mid-70s, with the occasional heat wave (a record of 103) or snowstorm (20 inches, way back in 1950).

The rain is a bit of a sore spot for Seattleites. Locals defensively love to point out that it receives less annual rainfall than New York, Atlanta, and Houston. The difference? Here, between October and May, overcast skies and drizzle are a near-daily affair. Seattle sees only about 70 clear and sunny days annually, and some sort of precipitation fizzles down an average of 150 days a year. But the weather is largely gentle—no thunderstorms, no blizzards, and little humidity.
Each season provides a home to a top-notch festival or gathering. The biggest summer event, Seafair, centers around hydroplane races on Lake Washington, and everyone with a boat is out on the water. Northwest Folklife (Memorial Day weekend) and Bumbershoot (around Labor Day) are the top eclectic music fests. Summer also brings the Seattle Chamber Music Society’s month-long series (July–August) to the city. In July, you can also hit the Capitol Hill Block Party (uber-hip indie bands), the Bite of Seattle (restaurants to nosh), and even the World’s Quickest Theater Festival. Autumn brings celebrations of local food and farms—pumpkins, salmon, corn, apple cider, wine. And when the rain rolls in, hit the Seattle International Film Festival (May), the largest in the country with 400-plus films in 25 days.
