Location is very convenient and the room was large and comfortable














Claudio, Washington DC

Hotel stay was great. Room was nice and staff were friendly and helpful. Couldn't  ask for a better location. Hotel really enhanced our visit to Chicago.  Thanks.














V, Kansas City


See all reviews











Extremely satisfied! We were not expecting it to be this good...
Spacious room with beautiful Chicago city view (not the most expensive room). Room was clean and nice. Staffs were friendly. Location was close to many nice restaurants. Metro and bus stops were within walking distance.
Had a popular bar. Be aware of drunk people out of hotel bar if returning to room late (they don't bite but they would bump into walls).
Recommend to everyone.

What a fantastic hotel!  Great location and overall feel...from the smell of baking cookies every time you walk in to the irresistible music and delicious drinks at the rooftop bar to the friendly hotel staff.  We had a great mother/daughter weekend celebrating both our birthdays, and we were pleasantly surprised by the overall AWESOMENESS of this hotel!

Friendly and very helpful staff. Great location and very clean room. Only negative is the window glass is too thin and can be noisy at night with loud cars driving in the street.  But next time I'm in Chicago, I'm definitely booking at The Godfrey again.

Every staff member I came across was very friendly. Beautiful hotel conveniently located close to restaurants, coffee shops & other fun things to nearby. Room service was quick.














Daniela, Las Vegas, NV

Our stay was comfortable. There is no fan in the bathroom so it gets very steamy when showering. Parking is very accessible. The 4th floor rooftop bar area becomes very busy with a line to get in, too busy for guests to enjoy.

Great experience overall! 

Waking distance to all major tourist attractions, local bars and multiple subway stations. 
Hotel is modern, everything is new and clean. it also has a great restaurant and a roof top bar. 

Staff was very friendly and accommodating! I got a room on the 5th floor which was located between an elevator and spa. So it was a bit noisy for me. I requested a room change and they have done it in a matter of minutes! Tyler was super helpful and quick. He also gave me a great room on 11th floor - away from the elevator and with great south views of the city. 
I was very pleased with service and my overall stay.

They were a wonderful group with decently priced meals in the restaurant. Staff was super friendly and perfectly located














Carina, denver, co

Very disappointed! When we arrived to check in, the front desk staff were both busy texting on their cell phones. We stayed for 4 nights, on the second night, we spilled coffee on the sheets and it was not changed the next day, just flipped on the other side without the stain. The lights were not working properly. They would turn on and off throughout the night.

The noise from the Urban Roofscape/rooftop bar was unbearable! They are located on the fourth floor and are open until 2:00 am so don't think about falling asleep before then. Very unaccommodating.














Janet, Boston

Good clean trendy hotel. Rooms were spacious and very comfortable. Staff was very helpful. The nighttime can be loud due to party goers at the lounge but overall a great experience! Good rooftop lounge and happy hour:)

Always clean quiet and luxurious. I love that I can go to the 4th floor for a drink and a beautiful view of the city or I can stay in the room and enjoy wifi, decent channel selection 

I would suggest adding a 24 room service but I know hey use the restaurants kitchen downstairs so it makes sense to not have it.
