Good place to stay before your cruise
We drove to Ft Lauderdale for a 5 day cruise and stayed at this hotel the night before. We were able to get a shuttle to the dock and leave our car in the parking lot for a modest amount. Staff were very helpful and facilities were clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay there again.

Sail Millionaire’s Row in Fort Lauderdale
Situated two miles north of
Port Everglades
, Fort Lauderdale has transformed itself from the “Spring Break Capital of America,” to a slick resort town that attracts a diverse audience who live for the beach. The distinctive sound of sailboat masts and yachts clangs out in the harbor, while Millionaire's Row attracts sightseeing cruises as the sun goes down. Luxurious resorts provide spa treatments and swimming pools, and evening entertainment comes in the form of sophisticated jazz bars and trendy DJ dance parties.
Things to do
Beaches
Fort Lauderdale Beach has more than seven miles of sand and a two-mile wave wall that flanks the beachfront promenade. It's a relaxing place to enjoy the water or pick up souvenirs and refreshments at the open-air shops and seaside cafes.
Hollywood Beach has a retro-cool feel with great places to snorkel, and a boardwalk voted one of the best in the country. Fishermen can cast off on Pompano Beach or Deerfield Beach, which are both good locations for reeling in your catch.
Entertainment
The Riverwalk Arts and Entertainment District is located in downtown Fort Lauderdale. A brick pathway leads to shops, cultural attractions and parks. On the way, explore the Museum of Discovery & Science where nearly 200 interactive exhibits span the topics of travel, animal habitats and flight simulation. Round things off with a family favorite movie at the IMAX Theater.
Historical attractions
Although many consider Fort Lauderdale a beach city, it contains a number of historical attractions too. The
Stranahan House Museum
has been a cornerstone for the city's growth and plays a significant role in economic life. It is possible to take self-guided tours and appreciate the antique furniture and other architectural wonders.
Las Olas is a popular thoroughfare, with its own historic house and museum of art. This area is located on the riverfront and is brimming with galleries, restaurants and hotels.
One of the best ways to see Millionaire's Row is by river cruise. This strip is filled with enormous, opulent mansions, mega-yachts and private islands.
Shopping
Greater Fort Lauderdale is home to Las Olas Blvd., the “style mile,” where independent fashion stores, specialty gift shops and fashion houses line up to form a shopper's paradise. Meanwhile, the Galleria provides a world-class retail experience. Sophisticated stores, premiere dining and luxury spas are all located here.
Sawgrass Mills is the world's largest discount and entertainment mall. More than 400 retailers are featured, including Nike, Ralph Lauren and Gap. Budget travelers should try the Swap Shop and Festival Flea Market for a variety of brand name products at discounted prices.
Dining
Fort Lauderdale is filled with an eclectic mix of restaurants. There are romantic waterfront cafes, trendy steakhouses and casual sports bars. Patio dining is a great option for people-watching as you sip a cool glass of wine.
Where to stay
There are more than 33,000 hotel rooms in the area. Some of the most upscale Fort Lauderdale hotels include the Ritz-Carlton and The Atlantic, which was the first luxury hotel in town to be located on the beach. Receive great value for money at the Marenas Beach Resort just a short drive from the airport.
Special events
Fort Lauderdale hosts a multitude of annual events. Guests enjoy food festivals, street parades, art fairs, boat shows and more.
Spring
This is the season to celebrate Ocean Fest, an event filled with food and dive-related exhibits. In May, the Las Olas Wine & Food Festival allows guests to sample fine wines and delicious South Florida cuisine, from seafood to Cuban surprises.
Fall
The International Boat Show is a fall tradition with more than 1,600 vessels on display annually. Meet the designers of some of these fantastic yachts, cabin cruisers, catamarans and jet boats and climb aboard a water taxi for the optimum view of this seaside exhibition.
Best time to visit
Although the weather remains mild throughout the year, peak travel season is during the winter. Fort Lauderdale is busiest at this time as snowbirds escape the cold. During summer, crowds are low, and hotel rates are reasonable, but the weather is rainy and humid. Business conventions are common in this season.
