Flights to Seoul
Seoul is the second-largest metropolis in the world and home to ancient traditions, avant-garde technology and a dynamic culture. Travelers find the huge city exhilarating, and it may require a few days of stay to truly appreciate its distinct beauty. Flights to Seoul are easy to book on Orbitz.com.
Airports in Seoul
Two airports serve the city: Gimpo Airport and Incheon International Airport. Gimpo Airport is just 30 minutes from downtown. The airport mostly handles domestic flights with the exceptions of a few international flights to Beijing, Tokyo and Shanghai. Incheon International Airport is the main gateway to South Korea. It is also one of the largest and busiest airports in the world. Incheon Airport is located at Yeongjong Island approximately 32 miles from downtown Seoul. The Incheon International Airport Railrod (AREX) connects the airport to Gimpo Airport, Seoul Station and to other parts of Seoul. The AREX line is located in the Transportation Center near the main terminal building. Tourists with more luggage or are headed to the farther points of Seoul can take the airport's shuttle buses and limousines.
Visitor Information and Advice
Seoul is a huge and vibrant city that displays a colorful contrast of contemporary and ancient cultures. The city has many cultural and historical landmarks, including the Five Grand Palaces located in the districts of Jongnu-go and Jung-go. Changdeokgung Palace, or the East Palace, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the most visited sites in Seoul. The city's modern architectures are also exemplary, which include the Olympic Park, Lotte World and the World Trade Center of Korea. Travelers who love to shop will definitely want to visit the COEX Mall, a large shopping center and entertainment complex located in Gangnam-gu. Temples are also popular spots and Bongeun Temple, a Buddhist temple in the old rural areas of the city, ranks as the most visited temple in the city. Seoul experiences hot summers and cold bitter winters. The warmest month is August, with an average high of 84°F, while the coldest month is January, with temperatures dropping to an average low of 21°F. A travel planner is necessary if you are traveling to the city during winter or summer. It is best to visit the city during spring and autumn, with balmy temperatures and clear skies.
Affluent, Historic Seoul
Seoul is definitely a top place to visit when visiting East Asian countries. Prices are cheaper and reasonably priced compared to a more extravagant Tokyo trip, and you still get the same luxurious and comfortable traveling experience without exhausting your budget. Scheduling flights to Seoul is easy on Orbitz.com, and travelers booking their flights on the site can also avail themselves of great discounts and vacation deals.





Seoul When to Go
Like many popular destinations in Asia, Seoul can be very hot and humid in the summers and cold in the winters. Rainy season starts in July and extends through August, thereby making the spring and fall the most pleasant times of year.
For travelers headed to Seoul, the summer months between June and August make up the busiest season, as well as Korean New Year in February and Korean Thanksgiving in August. Both holidays follow the lunar calendar, so exact dates will shift from year to year. Since these holidays place heavy emphasis on family, a mass migration out of the city occurs as almost everyone in Seoul heads back to his or her hometown during these dates. Anticipate for all modes of transportation to be extremely crowded. Also, many shops and restaurants close for Korean New Year, making the holiday not particularly tourist-friendly.
The shoulder seasons of spring and fall—March through May and October through November, respectively—are widely considered to be the best times to visit Seoul. Hotels and plane tickets are typically cheaper, and the weather is more temperate.
Low season consists of the winter months between December and February, with average daily temperatures in the high 20s to low 30s. For those who love snow, winter is a great time to visit Seoul, not only because of the lower prices, but also because there are a ton of winter activities for children and adults in and around the city. If you enjoy sledding, skiing, or ice fishing, Seoul in the winter makes for a very out-of-the-ordinary vacation spot.
