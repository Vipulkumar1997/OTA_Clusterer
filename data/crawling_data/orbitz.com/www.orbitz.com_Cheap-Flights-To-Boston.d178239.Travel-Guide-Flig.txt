The airport is situated approximately 14 miles northwest of the city of Toronto.

Boston Airport Information
Visitors to Boston usually fly into Logan International Airport, located roughly three miles across the harbor from downtown Boston. When you book flights to Boston through Orbitz.com, you will be able to choose from one of the many major domestic and international air passenger carriers that service the airport.
Ground Transportation in Boston
Logan Express bus service runs nonstop from Logan to Braintree, Framingham, Woburn and Peabody. For travel to all areas of Boston, take the MBTA's blue line subway service or silver line bus service. To get a view of Boston from the water, take the MBTA ferry to the commuter boat terminal in Quincy. A taxi from the airport to the downtown area should only cost you around $20, but if you have used Orbitz.com to book and purchase cheap tickets, your savings might be enough to warrant renting a car while you are there.
Boston Area Weather Information
Summers in Boston are beautiful, with average temperatures ranging from the mid-60s to the low 80s. Winters, however, can be brutal, with temperatures that can go from the low 20s to the mid-30s. When packing for your Boston trip, be sure to bring clothes that you can layer, and don't forget the warm jacket and snow boots if you plan to be there during the winter months.
What to Do in Boston
Boston is a mecca for history buffs. The Paul Revere House, King's Chapel Burying Ground, Bunker Hill monument, Old North Church and Old South Meeting House are must-see attractions. You should also plan to walk the Freedom Trail and spend a day at Faneuil Hall. Enjoy your trip to historic Boston, and remember to use Orbitz.com the next time you are looking for flights to Boston.





Boston When to Go
After those long winter months in hibernation, Boston comes back to life in spring. Patriots’ Day, the third Monday in April, commemorates the battles of Lexington and Concord that started the Revolutionary War; it’s also the date for the annual Boston Marathon. The Red Sox play an 11 A.M. game that day, too, so that fans can pour out of the stadium and cheer the runners at the finish line. Baseball season continues through September, if not October, if the Sawx can beat the Yanks into the playoffs.
May calls the tulips in the Public Garden to stand tall, and there’s a buzz along the strip of stores, galleries, and restaurants that line Newbury Street in the Back Bay. When the relatively humid summer arrives in June, many locals happily escape to the beaches of Cape Cod, Martha’s Vineyard, and Nantucket. But Boston is still at its busiest in the summer months. July 4th weekend brings the crowds to catch the Boston Pops concert on the Esplanade and see the fireworks display over the harbor.
Early fall is another glorious time of year, when collegiate crew teams paddle up and down the Charles River against a backdrop of foliage color.
Arrive in Boston in winter, and the blustery winds will force you inside, perhaps to the cozy confines of the new $500 million Art of the Americas Wing at the Museum of Fine Arts or The Shops at Prudential Center. But if you’re looking to cut costs, hotel rates dip in winter. One note of warning, however: Beantown’s hotel rates always trend high, usually coming in just behind New York City and Washington, D.C., for the most expensive rooms in the country.
