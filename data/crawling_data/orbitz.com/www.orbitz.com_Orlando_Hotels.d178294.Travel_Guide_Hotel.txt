With always staying at a Disney Resort, decided to change it up. The rooms were smaller than what we expected, the grounds weren’t as clean, but we can be picky.

Orlando, Florida overflows with famous theme parks
The beating heart of Florida, Orlando attracts visitors from all corners of the world and is only a few hours' drive from the state's other major cities including Tampa, Jacksonville, Miami and Naples. Home to more than a dozen spectacular amusement parks and hundreds of smaller attractions, it also boasts upscale shopping and delicious dining. A combination of world-class resorts and affordable accommodations has helped establish Orlando as a magnet for families in search of a good-time vacation.
Things to see
Ask anyone what their favorite things about Orlando are and they’ll likely point out its two major draws: Walt Disney World and Universal Studios. Beyond these theme park giants, Orlando actually has a whole host of individual amusement parks for guests of all ages, especially adults with the hearts of big kids.
Walt Disney World
What started out as a single amusement park in 1971 proved so popular, it grew into four: Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom. Your favorite movie characters, both old and new, wander around the parks, so be sure to get a picture with the likes of Captain Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean.
Riding some of the world's most famous roller coasters can be tiring, so after a long day of seeking thrills, head to Downtown Disney to eat at
Fulton's Crab House
and catch a movie at the 24-screen AMC theater. Don't forget to stop in The Lego Store, the single largest shop dedicated to anything and everything Lego.
Universal Studios
Both Walt Disney World and Universal Studios are appropriate for families and kids of all ages, but if Walt Disney World is better suited for younger children, Universal Studios might appeal more to young adults. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter stirred much excitement in 2010, and now you can even take a walk down Diagon Alley.
Just outside Universal Studios and Islands of Adventures sits CityWalk, which offers visitors movie-themed shopping and dining opportunities such as Bubba Gump Shrimp.
SeaWorld
If it’s been your lifelong dream to swim with dolphins, make it come true at SeaWorld's Discovery Cove. You'll also be able to interact with a huge variety of other animals including whales, exotic birds and fish. Think of SeaWorld as the world's best petting zoo.
Of course, your stay wouldn't be complete without going on SeaWorld's water slides and roller coasters. With a unique blend of entertainment and education, families can spend a whole day here and never get bored.
Legoland
Legoland is a must for Lego collectors of all ages. The park is decorated with custom sculptures, and guests can experiment with millions of different Lego bricks at the Lego Factory. A large botanical garden takes advantage of Orlando's tropical climate.
Hotel price ranges
Each amusement park offers themed
accommodations in Florida
, but there are plenty more Orlando hotels to suit every budget and taste. The Holiday Inn Express & Suites offers low rates for spacious and comfortable lodgings, with a free shuttle bus taking you to nearby attractions. For a luxurious stay, the JW Marriot Orlando Grand Lakes treats you to an on-site golf course and eleven restaurants.
Best time to stay
Thanks to its tropical climate, Orlando is home to exotic plants and wildlife not found anywhere else. Bromeliads, palm trees and bougainvillea vines keep the city colorful throughout the year, and mild winters allow the amusement parks to remain open during all seasons.
Millions of families flock to Orlando during the summer, and a significant number head to the city around Christmas. If you want to beat the lines at Walt Disney World and Universal Studios, plan your vacation from September to November, or from February to April, when the weather is mild.
