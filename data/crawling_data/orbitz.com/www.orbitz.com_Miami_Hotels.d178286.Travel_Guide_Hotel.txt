When looking for an airport hotel, I look for value above anything. Although location is the principal challenge, it is a comfortable and clean hotel. Value, in other words, is high.

Cuban rhythms, Art Deco and celebs in Miami
Miami's one-of-a-kind culture is a product of the tropical weather, beautiful shoreline, thriving businesses and diverse assortment of people from Cuba and every corner of America. From Little Havana to South Beach, discover Art Deco architecture, beach volleyball and Cuban cigar stores in Miami's eclectic mix. Culinary masterpieces are served up at Downtown restaurants like steakhouse Toro Toro, while giant cocktails flow down by the beach on Collins Avenue, and dancing comes later inside some of the world's most extravagant nightclubs, including the iconic Mansion.
Things to see and do
Cheer on the Miami Dolphins
Sun Life Stadium, previously known as Pro Player Stadium, is home to the Miami Dolphins. From the days of Don Shula and Dan Marino right up to the present day, the Dolphins have unified Floridians and fans across the nation.
Hang out with the monkeys
The Monkey Jungle
spans over 30 acres and is home to more than 400 monkeys, most of which are free to explore the reserve. Interested visitors can take tours to learn interesting facts about the different species of primates. The Monkey Jungle hosts scheduled feedings where you can witness the surprising intelligence of these spirited creatures.
Spend an educational day with your little ones
The Miami Children's Museum is a full-day adventure. Throughout the many exhibits are toys and games for kids to play with. Learning happens automatically in exhibits like the Castle of Dreams, Safety Zone and Everglades Park. The Ocean Odyssey exhibit contains a 900-gallon tank with an assortment of graceful and unusual sea creatures.
See Miami from the sky
Another adventure in Florida's cultural epicenter is the seaplane tour. See the city from above after taking off from the waters of Key Biscayne, and obtain a unique view of many of Miami's natural and man-made wonders, from the beaches to the poolside mansions.
Where to stay
There are a number of Miami hotels suitable for most budgets.
Downtown
Downtown, several high-rise hotels like the well-known Hyatt Regency offer views through floor-to-ceiling windows and first-class amenities. Close to conference centers and Downtown's shops and restaurants, this location is convenient for work or play.
South Beach
On South Beach, the hotels are close to the shore and fun daytime activities the beaches provide. A stay on famed Collins Avenue or Ocean Drive tends to be pricier, while budget options are set just a little further away. Creative types should try the National Hotel in the heart of the Art Deco Historical District, or the cheaper President Hotel, which is styled with glamorous murals.
Miami's efficient public transportation system ensures that, wherever you decide to stay during your vacation, the entire city is available to you.
Yearly events of note
Art Deco Weekend
Art Deco weekend, which takes place in the Art Deco Historic District in January, sees over 400,000 annual visitors. There is live music, art exhibits, walking tours, and much more for those looking to admire the architecture and soak up the history.
Miami International Boat Show
The Miami International Boat Show is one of the largest boat shows on the planet. Every February, designers, merchants and enthusiasts converge on Miami to showcase and witness the greatest advancements in boating. Everything from kayaks to multimillion-dollar super yachts are on aquatic display.
Climate
Florida's climate
is pleasant year round. The summers are hot and humid, with highs generally in the 80s and plenty of loud thunderstorms. Winters are dryer and the temperatures in these months average in the high 60s. This makes a winter vacation to the Magic City especially appealing to Americans from states with harsher climates. During any month of the year, locals and visitors party, swim and sun tan in the balmy air.

Best Western Gateway to the Keys


Keeper

Room was clean, bed was comfortable, shower worked, no bugs.

However,

A couple of the front desk people could use a week in Charm School.

When I first opened the door to the room, I was hit by a super-pungent chemical odor (insecticide?). It became less noticeable over time, but my right eye kept twitching.

Breakfast was the usual hotel lobby breakfast buffet fare -- a bit like gas station grub. But it's included in the price of the room, and you can eat all you want (if you feel you need to take it to that level).

Rodeway Inn South Miami Coral Gables


Built over 50 years ago; CHARMING

We found this South Miami spot over 5 years ago and LOVE the nearby community. It includes a Lebanese resturant, Italian, Portuguese restaurants, new Falafel shop; a shopping mall, CVS pharmacy, Starbucks and a new Ceillo coffee shop. Located near commuter train and a short trip to the beach. Free shuttle to port of Miami. Low in price..nice!
