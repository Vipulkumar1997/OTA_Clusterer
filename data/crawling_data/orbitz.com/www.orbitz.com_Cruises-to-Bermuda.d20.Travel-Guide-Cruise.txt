Bermuda Cruise Guide


Where turquoise waters meet azure skies and pink-sand beaches intermingle with pastel-hued homes, this British colony offers an indulgent tropical getaway for cruise visitors.
For travelers looking for rest and relaxation on a tropical island brimming with languid charm, a Bermuda cruise may just fit the bill. Nestled in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, the isolated island country of Bermuda is known for embracing the simple pleasures. During a Bermuda cruise vacation, passengers can enjoy a slower pace of life with ample opportunities for sun, fun and blissful relaxation.
Although Bermuda cruises are increasingly popular, cruise lines only offer a few Bermuda itinerary options, with most of them sailing from the Eastern seaboard from ports such as New York, Boston, Baltimore and Cape Liberty. The most common Bermuda cruise itinerary is a single-country sailing; these cruises are typically for 5 or 7 days with a few overnight stays at some of Bermuda’s ports. If you’re looking for a Bermuda cruise vacation that involves visits to other destinations, look for transatlantic cruises or repositioning cruises that voyage between Europe and America’s eastern coast.
Bermuda has three cruise ports -- King’s Wharf, Hamilton, and St. George’s – and each of these three ports offer passengers a selection of activities that families, couples and retirees can enjoy. King’s Wharf is the largest port in Bermuda, where passengers can set sail on a glass bottom boat in the Bermuda Triangle, or lounge on the soft sands of Horseshoe Bay beach. At Hamilton, passengers can enjoy a round of golf at the picturesque Belmont Hills Country Club, go spelunking at either Fantasy Cave or Crystal Cave, or take in the nightlife during the Wednesday evening street festivals. If you’re intrigued by history, St. George’s is home to The Bermuda National Trust Museum, in addition to a handful of old churches, venerable forts and palatial estates.
Going on a Bermuda cruise holiday is becoming more affordable, due in large part to the numerous cruise offerings that have been made available over the last few years. The Bermuda cruise season runs from April to early November, with peak season taking place during the summer months of June through August. October tends to be the rainiest month, and peak storm season typically falls between August and October. For the best Bermuda cruise deals, search for sailings outside of the summer peak season.
