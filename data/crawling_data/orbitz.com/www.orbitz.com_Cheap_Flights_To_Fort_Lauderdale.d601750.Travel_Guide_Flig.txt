Most Fort Lauderdale hotels have free shuttle service, and you can also use the Tri-Rail or Broward County public bus system. Most visitors take a cab, use the share-a-ride system or hire a private car service to get to their final destination.

If you want to be able to get around while you're in the area, use Orbitz.com to find deals from local rental car companies.
Fort Lauderdale Weather
South Florida can get uncomfortably warm in the summer, but Fort Lauderdale's coastal location ensures year-round balmy breezes. Expect temperatures in the 50s and 60s during the winter months or 80s and 90s during the summer. Think twice before booking a trip to the area during hurricane season, which is usually early fall.
Things to do in Fort Lauderdale
Life in Fort Lauderdale usually revolves around the beach. You can charter a boat to go deep-sea fishing, rent a jet ski or go parasailing. Head to Los Olas Boulevard when the sun goes down for some high-end dining, live music and dancing. Don't forget to use Orbitz.com on your next trip to find some cheap flights to Fort Lauderdale.





Fort Lauderdale When to Go
December to April is the best time span to go to Fort Lauderdale weather-wise, with warm, dry air and very little rain. Fort Lauderdale and the surrounding beaches becomes a magnet for visitors during this period, as is the case with nearby vacation destinations Miami and Palm Beach. Spring-breakers still come to party in March—though Fort Lauderdale is more family-friendly than notorious party spots like Miami and Daytona.
The heat of the summer sun is intense, made worse by the high humidity, which makes visiting anytime between June and September a constant effort to find air conditioning or a cold drink. It also means the annual flock of “snowbirds”—those who live there only for the agreeable winter months—migrate back to the cooler north to leave the place emptier for about six months of the year. Summer is also rainy season, so be prepared for short, daily downpours. On the plus side, summer also means less traffic and off-season prices.
Each year between June and November, Florida’s Atlantic coastline is threatened by hurricanes coming out of the Caribbean Sea. The chances of a direct hit are fairly remote, but it does happen. According to the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, September is the most active month for hurricanes in the South Florida region.
