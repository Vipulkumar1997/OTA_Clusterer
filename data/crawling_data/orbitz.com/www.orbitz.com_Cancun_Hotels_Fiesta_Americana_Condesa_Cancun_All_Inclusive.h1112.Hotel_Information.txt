Recent guest reviews










We just returned from our trip to Cancun and had an absolutely amazing time at Fiesta Americana Condesa resort. Victor (asst. manager) and his staff took great care of us and made us feel like home.  They went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed every moment of the trip and the service was always prompt and delivered with a smile.   We also celebrated our parents 40th wedding anniversary at Rosato and the manager Ricardo went the extra mile to make our meal and experience truly special.  The overall facility is fantastic with a great location and the staff/management is always looking to improve their look by repainting and cleaning it. We would definitely keep on going back to this resort and highly recommend it to anyone going to Cancun!

Could not have asked for better hotel to stay for the price. Got upgraded to one of the newer renovated rooms which made all the difference. The beach is stunning. The seafood restaurant and staff by the beach are excellent. You can swim out to sandy bank and walk in the middle of the turquoise ocean. They use top shelf liquor and there’s no shortage of drinks. Plenty of beach towels too which is always great as well as beach chairs and waiter service on the beach. There’s food and drinks available everywhere at any time as well as a limited room service menu. Full toiletries are available in the bathroom though the quality of the shampoo, conditioner etc is not the best but everything is provided. There’s turn down service with roses and chocolate and a welcoming bottle of wine when you arrive. Was able to use the spa at no charge to shower and clean up before flying home as had already checked out of my room - so worth it! The VIP experience with the white wristband is so worth it. The staff are really attentive. Would return again!

We enjoyed our stay here but felt like some things could have gone better. For instance we showed up at about 5 PM on Friday. By the time we got checked in and changed into our bathing suits we went downstairs to feed the kids before we jumped in the ocean/pool. I expected a ton of food options but one option by the pool just closed (who closes at 6 PM?) and the other was switching to dinner and wouldn't let us in with what we were wearing. So we ended up not eating until we had gone in the ocean and pool. They need a place by the pool that is open all day where you can just go and grab a taco or a hamburger or something. Check-in was also really slow and confusing. The AC was loud in the room. I would have liked to have the option for 2 queen size beds. Also it would be nice to get some additional information about the restaurants and what they served. Also we tried to get towels several times and they were all out! Other than that it was an enjoyable experience. It was really nice only having to bring a room key with you and I felt like the all inclusive was good value. The beach was really fun although the waves were a bit too much for the little ones and the grandparents. Food and drinks were all good. I would come back. One suggestion is to use the wrist bracelets with chips in them for the room keys. The use those at the Great Wolf Lodge and they work great!

This was our first time staying here. From the moment we arrived everyone was more than happy to make our stay the most memorable. Our room was clean and inviting. The entire surroundings were immaculate. Smiles everywhere, everyday! The pool was huge and plenty of chairs in every location. Umbrellas, tables, towels were plush and warm and never a hassle to get extra. You will never be hungry! We will definitely book again

Hotel - renovations were being competed on the front entrance and competed the day of departure and if they continue to make this level of investment, there may be good things to come.

Room - Updated decor/furniture. Clean. Comfortable. Had an excellent ocean view. No issues or complaints.l

Food - buffet served its purpose. Restaurants were nice, food was very good, difficult to eat when you want (get there early or you may have to wait 2+ hours). Pool snacks/food were accommodating as well. 

Pool - Nice pool(s) with sun pads and a swim up bar. Wasn’t too crowded while we were there. Music playing was typically dance/techno.  There were some activities taking place for people to break up there day, but mostly it was swim and lay in sun for activity. Only issue was there were a few corporate events and weddings taking place that shut the pool down early. 

Entertainment - Poor. The shows were just OK. Nothing spectacular. Something to do at night. Really not much nightlife or things to do when the sun went down. Location of the resort made it a $15-$30 cab ride (depends on who you got) to more activity downtown. 

Staff - courteous and friendly. Treated us well and took care of us when needed. 

Why I wouldn’t recommend.  It was just OK. Nothing really stood out as spectacular. First all inclusive experience and would prefer to go back to a big boat in the sea (cruising). Need more to do than lay at the pool and drink. Budget price for an OK experience.

Friendliest staff you will find in Cancun! Been to FACC 3 times and once again they proved why we keep coming back. Excellent food, amazing staff and an all around good time. You won't find better for your money in Cancun, guaranteed. They are also making improvements to have the lobby be air conditioned, so that will make this hotel an 11/10 for me!

We stayed 4 nights at this hotel, it is close to the beach, has nice stuff, great food, too many choices of restaurants. We liked Cerveceria restaurant, they make awesome fish tacos and fried calamare. I would definitely recommend to go to this hotel.

Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out. Only suggestion is that they use seasoned sushi rice - my rolls tasted like unseasoned, regular white rice was used.  Not very good.  Other than that everything was perfect!

This was the second time we stayed here. We love it! Cannot beat the price. Staff is amazing. Room was like new. Beautiful view & very spacious. If I had to complain I would say the two nicest restaurants in the resort were disappointing. The Mexican restaurant & the steak restaurant. Food was ok but not what we expected. The other restaurants were very good. My husband and I had a massage at the spa and it was awesome! We will definitely go back. I will book directly with the hotel next time. The manager and the lady that checked us in worked with us and found us the perfect room. I will not book through Orbitz. Because of them our flight was almost cancelled and it was a nightmare every time we changed flights

Although this hotel is in a great location my stay was not so great..Staff always was annoyed hardly no one ever smiles.Didnt sense that they willing to make you happy..Had to ask for everything coffee at bkfst ,napkins,water,at poolside very understaffed waited almost 30 min to get bottled water...Alejandro at the Kambu restaurant by the beach was the rudest waiter i ever encountered.The only time the staff is friendly is when you tip them...This was my 2nd time at this hotel once almost 15yrs ago and back then it was a great experience,thats why i returned..But will never go again..

beautiful place, very nice staff.  The food was also good.  The only complaint I have is that there was only one TV station in English.














Juanita, OR

The only thing I didn't like was the restroom design, it was all glass so it offers very little to no privacy if you take your kids is kind of an inconvenience but we managed. Other than that the food is delicious, staff is very friendly. We had an excellent stay at Fiesta Americana Condesa and will probably visit again in the future.














Yesenia, Houston

My time at this hotel was so much more than great! The staff was great and very friendly. There are many restaurants on the resort that have so many delicious options to choose from. My favorite restaurant was the asian restaurant Kambu. We went twice and the servers Marcial and Sebastian took care of us on two different occasions. They both recommended the fried ice cream for dessert and it was just so delicious. The restaurant was located outside near the pool and beach area so you had great food with an even better view! There is another restaurant by the pool that offered up great shrimp tacos that kept on coming! Thanks to Javier and Jaime for all the help! Angel at the the buffet restaurant was also great!

The rooms were so clean and modern. The sheets were just so comfortable and fluffy. The shower in the bathroom is huge! Though I don't watch tv on vacation I appreciated the large screen tv in the room. Our housekeeper Carlos was very fast and kept our rooms looking brand spanking new! The only thing I had a problem with was a request I put in months in advance. I asked to have adjoining rooms and my request was approved, when I arrived I was told adjoining rooms weren't available.  So I advise you to keep calling to make sure whatever you need you can get. Another thing.... the pool bar closes too early! 

Overall a great hotel with great staff. My family and I had an amazing time here and we look forward to coming back in the future.
