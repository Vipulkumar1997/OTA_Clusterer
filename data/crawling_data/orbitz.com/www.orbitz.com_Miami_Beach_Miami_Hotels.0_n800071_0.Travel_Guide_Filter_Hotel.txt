On the beach with pools
Hotel is really nice and the rooms are beautiful. It’s right on the beach and has a few pools and bars both inside the hotel and by the pool/beach. The one negative is that they give you a card for towels but you only get 1 card per person and it’s 1 towel per card!

Soak up the sunshine in style at Miami Beach
Miami Beach, Florida, is a playground of sun, sand and surf, just waiting to show guests a good time. Located in the southeast corner of the United States, Miami Beach is a clean and inviting cosmopolitan neighborhood with a reputation for being a vacationer's paradise. Whether visiting for work or pleasure, travelers find their fun in the famous beach area with outdoor sports, fresh seafood, a festive nightlife and thriving business center.
Where to go
Miami Beach - Central
Travelers visiting the central Miami Beach can walk, jog or skate the elevated boardwalk that runs all the way from 21st Street to 46th Street. This stretch of white sand offers easy access to Miami Beach hotels, bars, restaurants and concession stands for your convenience. Locals know that central Miami Beach is often quieter and less crowded than
tourist-favorite South Beach
.
Haulover Beach Park
Situated north of central Miami Beach and located between the Intracoastal Waterway and Atlantic Ocean, Haulover Beach Park is a mile and a half of soft sand and blue surf. Take part in one of the many kite-making shops or purchase a ready-made piece to fly in the open sky. This beach offers a golf course, dog park, and even a stretch of clothing-optional space for those wishing to avoid tan lines.
Things to do
Outdoor activities
Thousands of people flock to Miami Beach every year to relax and get a golden glow, but after adequate sunbathing and swimming, try your hand at one of the available water sports and activities. You can charter a boat to go fishing or take turns tubing over the waves. Jet ski and other rentals are also conveniently available along the beach, for a fee. If you crave even more excitement, go parasailing high above the turquoise sea.
Indoor activities
Roam the streets of the
National Art Deco Historic District
and view assorted architectural styles of more than 800 historic buildings constructed from the 1920s to 1940s. This area also hosts the Art Deco Weekend festival every January that includes musical performances, lectures, art exhibits, parades, merchandise vendors and more.
Nearby attractions
Everglades National Park
For a truly authentic Florida adventure, head one hour west to the park commonly known as “The River of Grass.” With 1.5 million acres of swampland, this park is home to more than a dozen rare and endangered species, including the American crocodile and the Florida panther. Take the opportunity to walk, camp or canoe through the tropical jungles to see the Everglades in a thrillingly unique way.
Zoo Miami
A short 40-minute drive will take animal enthusiasts to the popular Zoo Miami. This cage-free zoo offers guests the chance to view free-roaming animals such as tigers, elephants and zebras. Discover your inner Arabian and take a ride on a Dromedary camel, or have a face-to-face encounter with a giraffe at the Samburu Giraffe feeding station.
Seaquarium
Less than half an hour from Miami Beach is the Miami Seaquarium. Make sure to check out one of many exhibits such as the shark channel or tropical reef. The Seaquarium is the only place where you will find white-sided dolphins swimming alongside a killer whale. Stop in and watch Lolita the Killer Whale “walk on water” and perform with her bottle-nosed friends. Before you leave, partake in an unforgettable experience, and have your very own dolphin close encounter. Enjoy 30 minutes of shaking hands, sharing a kiss and practicing your training signals with your newest aquatic buddy.
Climate
Most of the year, Miami Beach enjoys temperatures averaging from the mid-70s to high 80s. Located on the coast, this city receives an average of more than 250 sunny days a year, making it an ideal vacation spot for sun-loving travelers all year-round. However, Miami Beach and the surrounding areas are also subject to the occasional tropical storm.
