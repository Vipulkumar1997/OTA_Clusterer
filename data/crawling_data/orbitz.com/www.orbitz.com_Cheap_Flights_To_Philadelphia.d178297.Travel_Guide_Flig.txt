Philadelphia When to Go
Located on the Eastern Seaboard, nearly equidistant from New York City to the north and Washington, D.C. to the south, Philadelphia has a temperate climate characterized by humid summers and cold, but not overly frigid, winters.
Philadelphia’s historic personality and family-friendly vibe attract legions of visitors in the summer months, when kids have vacation and important American holidays take place (Memorial Day in May; Independence Day in July; and Labor Day in September). Visitors should expect to wait in longer lines and to pay more for airfare and hotel rooms during the June through August stretch. Nonetheless, summer is a magical time of year in Philadelphia. The city is steeped in Red, White, and Blue, and the annual July 4 Fireworks show is one of the most elaborate in the country.
The winter months, December through February, are typically colder and sometimes snow-filled. The city is less crowded on these chilly days, and if you tolerate the cold well, this may be a good time to visit. Temperatures in January and February hover between 25-28 degrees Fahrenheit, with wind chills often making the climate feel downright freezing in Philly.
