South Pacific Cruise Guide


Succumb to the luminous turquoise seas, powder-soft beaches, year-round sunshine and extraordinary cultural traditions as you set sail across this exotic region.
Composed of 7,500 picturesque islands, the South Pacific is replete with stretches of pristine beaches, vivid coral reefs and swathes of unspoiled natural scenery, and a South Pacific cruise vacation is sure to delight passengers with a little piece of paradise, right here on Earth. The chain of islands in the South Pacific region, which include noted vacation hotspots such as Tahiti, Fiji and Bora Bora, are commonly grouped into three areas: Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia. Although these island nations have some similarities, they are also incredibly varied and diverse with their own unique cultures, histories, languages and scenery.
Polynesia is perhaps the most popular of the three, and include islands such as Tahiti, Bora Bora, and Samoa. Papeete, the capital of Tahiti, is where most South Pacific cruises begin and end, and the lively atmosphere of the city is complemented by the island’s dramatic cliffs, lush vegetation and secluded beach grottos. Bora Bora has magnificent lagoons and offers a vast array of thrilling water sports and outdoor activities, such as shark and ray feeding excursions. In Samoa, passengers can snorkel at the Palolo Deep Marine Reserve to view the walls of brilliant coral and incredible marine life.
Melanesia is comprised of the mountainous islands of the Western Pacific such as Fiji, Vanuatu, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. New Caledonia is famous for its stunning snorkeling sites, where passengers can snorkel among colorful clownfish, nudibranchs and other species of marine life. In Fiji, South Pacific cruise passengers are well poised to explore the Yasawas, a 20-island archipelago celebrated for its immaculate white sand beaches, luminous turquoise waters and variegated coral reefs. For outdoor enthusiasts, Vanuatu is home to Mount Yasur, an active caldera which visitors can hike to, while New Guinea if famed for its verdant tropical fjords.
Micronesia consists of islands such as Palau, Kiribati and Guam. With its diversity of cultures, landscapes and languages, Micronesia is a popular destination for many cruises to the South Pacific. In Palau, passengers can explore the natural beauty of the Rock Islands by kayak, or they can visit the Badrulchau Monoliths on Babeldaob Island. Kiribati is a birdwatcher’s paradise, especially on Christmas Island, while Guam is home to a vast underwater world brimming with diverse marine life, colorful corals and World War II wrecks.
The South Pacific is blessed with a tropical climate year-round, and setting sail on a South Pacific cruise at any time of year will not disappoint. However, the best time to go on a cruise to the South Pacific is during the dry season, which takes place from May to October. South Pacific cruise deals can typically be found during the wet season between November and April, when the rain and humidity increase.
