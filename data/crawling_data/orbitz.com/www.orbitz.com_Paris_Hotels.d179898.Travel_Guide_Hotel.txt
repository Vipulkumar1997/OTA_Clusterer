It was my first time staying at a hostel, and it was excellent. I realize that there’s a certain luck-factor with regard to who you get for roommates (mine were amazing and ended up spending the day with me in Paris) so I’ll focus on the hostel itself: The front staff was excellent.

Hotel Picardy is easy to get to via the Metro and it's a good hotel to stay at if you're visiting Paris and need an inexpensive place to stay. The hotel is literally across the street from the Gare du Nord Metro. The shower is a bit tight to get in and out of, but it would be fine for a person who's ...

It's great hotel, good staff and excellent breakfast. Only issue with this hotel is that it's about 10-12 minutes walk from Arch de Triump metro or chemp eleyesses area. If you don't kind walking 10-15 minutes each day from hotel - great place to stay. 5 stars!

Grand architecture and thrills fill the City of Light
Sitting in a street café watching Parisians pass by, you will realize there are few places in the world that are as romantic as Paris. Cluttered with galleries that include the Louvre, bohemian cobbled lanes and designer flagship stores, there#39;s s a unique experience in every corner of the city.  Famous landmarks fill the skyline, which looks especially idyllic when the sun sets. Witness this beauty on a boat ride along the Seine river and prepare to catch the lively fever of Paris.
Things to see
Notre-Dame de Paris
Step into this majestic cathedral, made famous by the 1831 novel, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, and be wowed by its French gothic architecture. Located on the Ile de la Cite in the center of the city, guests will feel enveloped by its history, which dates back to 1345.
Eiffel Tower
Incredibly, the symbol of Paris was nearly torn down shortly after the conclusion of the 1889 World's Fair, which is what it was built for. However, the city realized how essential the structure was for communication purposes, and adoration for the Eiffel Tower steadily grew over time. It would nearly be a crime to leave Paris without a trip up to the top.
Louvre
A gallery that needs no introduction, even to the most amateur art lover, the Louvre houses Leonardo da Vinci's “Mona Lisa” among a plethora of famous artworks in its 600,000 square feet of exhibition space. You can easily spend hours here, getting lost in a world of paintings and sculptures.
Sports
Vacationing runners will surely enjoy traversing the streets during the
Paris Marathon
, held every April. Those more interested in watching events will enjoy attending some French Open tennis matches in May or June, or lining the streets in July for the exciting conclusion of the Tour de France.
France's largest stadium seats 81,338 and is located in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis, about five miles north of the city. Built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, it hosts games played by France's national football (soccer) and rugby teams, and the final match of the Coupe de France every May. Visit the stadium to watch a match during your visit.
Where to stay
Paris is the perfect place to bask in luxuries, and it has plenty of accommodations to make this possible. A stay in Hotel du Collectionneur Arc de Triomphe is a tempting tavern of grandeur and excellence. With plenty of Paris hotels to suit all budgets, the city oozes with sophistication regardless of
where you stay
.
Annual events
Bastille Day
Bastille Day is a great time to join in the French culture, as its citizens exhibit their national pride. Taking place on July 14, it celebrates the Storming of the Bastille in 1789. The celebrations around Paris are especially memorable, and nothing quite compares to watching fireworks light up the sky behind the Eiffel Tower.
Best time to stay
More people visit Paris during the spring and summer, which means higher prices for transportation and hotel rooms. Conversely, visits in the fall or winter tend to be more affordable.
Predictably, spring and fall present the most comfortable temperatures. However, summer and winter are not too uncomfortable, especially for visitors coming from many parts of the world with more extreme climates.
Those looking for a true Parisian experience should avoid making the trip during the summer, since that is when locals spend their own vacation time out in the city. However, the people-flooded streets are offset by the open-air festivals and similar events held during these sunny months.

Radisson Blu Hotel at Disneyland® Paris


nice hotel close to disney

Really good hotel, the breakfast buffet was excellent and varied.
One thing to note is that the shuttle leaves from the parking lot in Disney, which does mean it takes a bit longer to get back and from the park. Besides that, it was an excellent stay.

Could not have asked for a better location. Minutes away from the Louvre and St. Honore shopping district. Room was very small. However, will go back. Pleasant experience.
