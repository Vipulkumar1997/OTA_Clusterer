Los Angeles When to Go
Locals will tell you that there’s no bad time to travel to Los Angeles. Although the winter months (December through March) typically feature more rainfall and slightly colder weather, the average temperatures in December and January are 68 degrees and 69 degrees, respectively. In the summer, when you’d expect unbearable heat, the average temperature rounds off to a very tolerable 85 degrees in August.
For travelers looking to enjoy Los Angeles’s terrific beaches and outdoor spots, the spring and summer months are ideal times to visit. Summer is the city’s high tourist season. You’ll pay more for airfare and hotel reservations and wait in longer lines at theme parks, such as Universal Studios and Disneyland, located in nearby Anaheim.
Although you might get rained on here and there in January and February, airfare and hotel rooms are typically less expensive. Plus, these winter months are the season for Hollywood awards like the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, and, the king of them all, the Oscars. Find yourself in town during one of these glamorous celebrations, and you could very well come face to face with Julia Roberts, Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt, or any number of Hollywood stars.
