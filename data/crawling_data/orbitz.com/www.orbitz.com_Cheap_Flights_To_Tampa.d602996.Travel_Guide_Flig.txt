Tampa When to Go
Florida is hot, and Tampa is no exception. The peak season falls over the winter months from January to April, when the weather is warm and the humidity relatively low. As is common in Florida, the weather dictates the activity. You can try to avoid the crowds and opt for a visit during the summer months, but this is one locale that has tourist season for a reason.
Summers in Florida can be painfully hot and muggy, with frequent afternoon thundershowers and lightning storms. If you can stand the scorching temps and near-unbearable humidity, you’ll be welcomed with lower hotel rates and shorter lines at attractions. June, July, and August are when the mercury tops out, but that just give you an excuse to spend your day cooling off at the beachside tiki hut with any kind of drink that has an umbrella in it.
After Labor Day is when deal hunters find the best discounts. The shoulder season months (May, October, and November) are typically a good time to visit, as there are significantly fewer visitors then. This is when Ybor City holds its annual Guavaween, a Halloween-inspired street party with Latin flare.
