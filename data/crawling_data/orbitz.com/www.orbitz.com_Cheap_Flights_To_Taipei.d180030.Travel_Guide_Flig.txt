Visiting Taipei
Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, is an important business destination as well as a city that is rich in historical and cultural attractions. Taipei has everything from hot springs and gardens to temples and museums. Use Orbitz.com to book cheap flights to Taipei and find great rates on hotel accommodations.
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport
Flights to Taipei land at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, located about 25 miles, or 40 to 50 minutes by car, from Taipei. Car rental counters are available in each terminal. Taxi fare for the trip is 1,200-1,400 Taiwanese dollars. Public transportation options are also available and include several buses. The fares run from 85 to 150 Taiwanese dollars for rides that range from 55 to 80 minutes. For 35 Taiwanese dollars, a shuttle bus can take you to the Taoyuan station of the THSR high-speed rail system, from where you can take a train to Taipei for 160 Taiwanese dollars. The entire bus and train trip takes about 35 minutes.
Taipei Attractions and Weather Information
The National Palace Museum and Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall are great introductions to Taipei's more recent history, and the Longshan Temple is one of many temples and pagodas that are part of the ancient culture of Taiwan. Taipei Zoo is the largest in Asia and features giant pandas as well as an Asian tropical rainforest exhibit. Yangmingshan National Park and New BeiTou Hot Spring are some of the other popular attractions with Taipei vacationers.
The weather in Taipei is warm all year-round. The coldest months are January and February, with highs of 64 degrees Fahrenheit and lows of about 55 degrees. The hottest months are July and August, with highs and lows of 90 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively. Rain can be very heavy from June to September, but there is substantial rainfall throughout the year in Taipei, so make sure to have an umbrella or raingear handy. Bring or purchase waterproof sunscreen, as even in January and February, the UV index in Taipei is high.
Do More in Taipei
Taipei offers a wide variety of attractions, including shopping, theatrical productions, theme parks and enticing local cuisine. When you book low-cost hotel rooms and cheap flights to Taipei with Orbitz.com, you save time and money that you can use to enjoy more of the sights and pleasures of Taipei.





Taipei When to Go
Taipei’s high season includes February’s Lunar New Year as well as the late-spring and summer months, May through August. The Taiwanese typically get a week of vacation in February to celebrate the Lunar New Year, meaning train and bus travel around the island can get pretty busy during this time.
Additionally, because Taiwan’s academic calendar is similar to that of the United States, many Taiwanese students and families take advantage of the extended summer breaks to travel and sightsee, making tourist hot spots such as Taipei 101, the National Palace Museum, and Shilin Night Market extra crowded. Add the high temperatures and extreme humidity of the season and summers are arguably one of the worst times to visit Taipei.
Low season is January to April, excluding Lunar New Year in February, and October to November. While the weather is still very hot into October, the temperatures in November through April are much cooler, in the low 60s. Be mindful that Taiwan is a tropical island and experiences typhoon season between the months of June and October.
Ultimately, the best time to visit Taipei would be before May and after September to avoid the summer heat. Since these times coincide with low season, it’s pretty much a win-win for travelers interested in visiting the island.
