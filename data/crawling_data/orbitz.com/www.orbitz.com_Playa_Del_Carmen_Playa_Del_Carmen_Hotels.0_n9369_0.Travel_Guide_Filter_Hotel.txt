City Center
Although Cancun proper is not very big, the city center is where the action happens. Here, you’ll find an endless supply of souvenir shops, restaurants and bars. If you are looking to dance late into the night, this is the place to be; the bulk of Playa del Carmen’s many nightclubs are headquartered in the center of town. The area also offers easy access to the beach, ferry port and central bus station, which is convenient if you are traveling to other locations around Mexico. If you are looking for a beachfront getaway, book a room at the Playa Palms Beach Front Condo Hotel. This beautiful hotel sits on a wide stretch of white-sand beach, and many of the rooms have views of the ocean. It offers a variety of suites and studios, a tropical garden and a private pool for the days when you want to sit in the sun away from the beach. Plus, you can enjoy your vacation on the hotel’s private hammocks or terraces, and enjoy the complimentary breakfast with a view of the water. Rooms start at $105 per night; call the hotel at 01-888-676-4431 for details. For a hotel that provides an oasis in the center of the Playa del Carmen action, check out the Aventura Mexicana. This hotel is located just a block from the center of town, so you have easy access to the major attractions without the noise. The highlight of the property is the lush central courtyard, which includes a private pool and numerous sun loungers. Guests can take advantage of the wireless Internet, on-site restaurant and discounted health spa passes. Rooms start at $60 per night. Find out more by calling the hotel at 1-800-537-4197.
North Playa del Carmen
If you want to experience a quiet, relaxing retreat away from the chaos of downtown Playa del Carmen, check out the beachfront neighborhood to the north of town. This area is home to private residences and a number of resorts. The picturesque streets offer the perfect opportunity for afternoon walks, and you can get to town by walking down the beach. If you’re looking for an adults-only experience, one of the most luxurious accommodation options is the Paradisus Playa del Carmen - La Perla, which does not allow children.
