Mexico Cruise Guide


Bursting with spectacular vistas, ancient Mayan ruins and bustling beach resorts to suit the taste of every cruiser, this vibrant Latin country is waiting to be discovered.
With over 7,000 kilometers of Pacific coastline framed by sandy bays and turquoise waters, a Mexico cruise has been a vacation favorite for decades. From lively Cabo San Lucas and spirited Acapulco to picturesque Cozumel and pristine Costa Maya, Mexico presents a wide range of cruising options for both adventure seekers and sun worshippers.
The most popular Mexico cruise sails through the aptly named “Mexican Riviera,” which has become famous for its scenic beach towns, long stretches of palm-studded coastline, and friendly locals. Because of its variety of ports and flexible sailing options, Mexican Riviera cruises are perfect for first-time cruisers, families, and even wedding parties. You can opt for a 3-night or 4-night Mexican Riviera cruise that sails from San Diego and Los Angeles to Ensenada and Catalina Island. If time isn’t an issue, there are 10-night and 12-night Mexican Riviera cruises that include ports of call at Acapulco, Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta.
There’s never a shortage of things to do on this side of Mexico. With beaches abound, water activities such as snorkeling, kayaking, scuba diving, and paddle boarding are plentiful. If cultural attractions are what you’re after, Mazatlan has an alluring old town and a gloriously inviting malecón, where you can view magical sunsets. Puerto Vallarta has a robust foodie and restaurant scene, where you can feast on delectable ceviche, toothsome tamales and delicious mole.
Another popular Mexico cruise option allows you to experience the Gulf of Mexico on the east coast, which often involves ports of call along the Caribbean. Here, passengers can visit the ancient Chacchoben Mayan ruins in Costa Maya, snorkel with friendly sea turtles in Cozumel, and lounge around on the miles of sandy beaches in beautiful Cancun.
The weather in Mexico is balmy year-round, with the exception of August and September, when temperatures can soar and humidity reaches unpleasant levels. October through April are the best times to go on a Mexico cruise vacation, and if you time your vacation right, you may be able to catch the November Dia de Muertos festivities. Low season for Mexico cruises run from June through November, with hurricane season coming into full swing in July and August.
