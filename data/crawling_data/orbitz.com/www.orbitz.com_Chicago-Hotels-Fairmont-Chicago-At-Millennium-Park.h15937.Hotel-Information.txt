Our gentleman outside to help with entering and exiting was also amazing.
Polite friendly and very assuring when we didn't know where or which way to go

Overall it was great but the phone by the bed didn't work so I called for more towels on my cell phone. They ignored the first request but responded to the second. Housekeeping staff were extremely nice and helpful. Thanks!

The staff were awesome from the time we got there till we left, however the room was very dated and the fridge didn't work. They even wanted to charge us an extra $30 a day to have it plugged in.

It was pretty good to walk to restaurants and downtown. Took us about 10-15 minutes. 

The gold floor was a little disappointing compared to some of the other fairmonts we've stayed at, as the service was not great, they expected a tip (and weren't shy to tell you) for clearing your plate, as well you had to pay for drinks. 
Katie was great though with helping us figure out the city and get sorted.

The restaurant was dirty and service was sub-par. I literally returned no less than 20 plates due to lack of cleanliness, I had to walk out as I was afraid to eat in the restaurant.

Hotel room is nice. I would recommend the hotel but not the restaurant.

Dear Kourtney,
Thank you for posting a review on Orbitz.  I am glad that you enjoyed your stay on Fairmont Gold. I apologize for the miscommunication over the refrigerators.  Our guestrooms include a mini bar which is a bit cooler than room temperature to help preserve the freshness of the items available.  We do have small refrigerators available upon request for a daily charge.

I hope your travels bring you back to the Windy City soon.

Kind Regards,
Fred Pare
