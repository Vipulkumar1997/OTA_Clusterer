Portland When to Go
Let’s get the obvious out of the way: Portland is in the Pacific Northwest, and for much of the year, that means precipitation. Not a lot of it (New York and Miami both get more inches of rain per year), but a steady drizzle. In fact, it’s not uncommon to fight rain every single day of the month in March.
December averages only 65.1 hours of sunshine a
month
. But temps rarely drop below freezing at any point during the year, especially during the day. Winter brings performances by the Portland Opera, Oregon Symphony, White Bird contemporary dance troupe, and Portland Jazz Festival.

Summers here are actually warm, sunny, and dry, thanks to the city’s inland location (it’s an hour from the coast, which means no cool sea breezes). In July and August, the mercury can sometimes top 100. With the combination of the Cascade mountain range and the funnel of the Columbia River Gorge, the weather can occasionally get funky—thunderstorms coming off the nearby peaks, freezing air rolling down the river. Everyone takes advantage of bright summer days in the form of summer concerts at the Oregon Zoo (July–August), a five-day Waterfront Blues Festival around the Fourth of July, and the Bite of Oregon food fest and the Mt. Hood Jazz Festival in August.
