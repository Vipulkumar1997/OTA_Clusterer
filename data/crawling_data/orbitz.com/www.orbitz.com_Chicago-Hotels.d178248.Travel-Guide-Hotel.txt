Chicago hotels Guide
Nicknamed the Second City, in reality, Chicago is second to none. Known as much for its blues ‚Äî and blues brothers ‚Äî as it is for its famous gangsters and deep-dish pizza, Chicago is also a mecca of art, theater, dining, and other culture.
Chicago hotels offer visitors a bit of everything. Accommodations run the gamut from bargain hotels to luxury hotels in Chicago's downtown. Guests spend the day taking in the city's many sights and tours and head to a ballgame at historic Wrigley Field, one of the best in the U.S., or they enjoy one of the many world-class museums and take in some of the first-rate theater in the evening, topping it off with a nightcap and a view of the town at the Hancock tower's Signature Lounge. Navy Pier is a great place for families to keep busy between getting some rest at one of the top Chicago hotels.
Chicago Quick Picks and Tips
Conventions
Chicago has several locations that attract trade shows from around the country. The Merchandise Mart is one of the more popular venues and is the yearly host of the National Prom Market, the USA's largest business-services trade event.
Dining
Food in Chicago: plentiful, diverse, and tasty of, course. Chicago is known for its Italian and Polish food. Lou Malnati's, which has several Chicago locations, is famous for its Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.
Major Point of Interest
Chicago visitors won't want to miss the Art Institute of Chicago and its impressive collection of Asian, modern and American art and much, much more.
Shopping
Any shopper booking a room in one of the many Chicago hotels shouldn't forget the Magnificent Mile. This section of Michigan Avenue is filled with history, shopping opportunities, and other entertainment to make your trip more than worthwhile.
Sports
Chicago has two major-league baseball teams, the Cubs and White Sox, and given the fierce loyalty of each team's fans, it's a good thing their respective parks are located so far apart. NFL fans have the Chicago Bears, while hockey fans root for the Blackhawks, and basketball fans cheer for the Bulls.
Chicago Neighborhoods
Chicago is divided into over 70 different neighborhoods, each with its own distinct feel and flavor. The Downtown Loop, or city center, is the commercial and financial district, and many of the city's cultural institutions are located here as well, including the Magnificent Mile, a shopper's paradise, and Grant Park, where guests can choose to stay at the luxury Talbott Hotel. Travelers seeking one of the less expensive Chicago hotels¬†opt for the Days Inn on the North Side, located right in the middle of the most dense population center of the city and near Lincoln Park.
The South Side is Chicago's largest area and includes many parks and public beaches. Also located here are Jackson Park, site of the 1893 Columbian Exposition, the Museum of Science and Industry (the last remaining building from the Exposition), and U.S. Cellular Field, home of the Chicago White Sox. The West Side is known for its ethnic enclaves and is home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and the NHL's Chicago Blackhawks. Overall, visitors should try to find Chicago hotels they can use for a base of operations because this vast city and all its sites can't be explored in one day ‚Äî or even a week.

Very well run establishment

Everything met or exceeded our expectations.   Very well run hotel at a very reasonable price in a location that was in dire need of high quality room and board.  We were very pleased and very impressed with this establishment.
