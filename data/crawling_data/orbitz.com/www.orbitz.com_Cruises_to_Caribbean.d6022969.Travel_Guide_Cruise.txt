Caribbean Cruise Guide


Set sail to a little piece of paradise framed by the powder-soft beaches, sapphire seas, and expanses of tropical forests that continue to lure paradise-hunters near and far.
Comprised of more than 7,000 individual islands spanning the southern seaboard of the United States to the eastern seaboard of Venezuela, the Caribbean is the perfect tropical getaway which can easily be explored with a Caribbean cruise vacation. Although the landscape, culture, architecture and outdoor attractions all differ from one Caribbean island to the next, the good news is that the geographical proximity of the islands allows travelers to visit several islands in a single Caribbean cruise.
Depending on the itinerary, passengers on a Caribbean cruise can disembark on a new island almost every day. You can spend an afternoon wandering through the vibrantly colored thoroughfare of Willemstad in Dutch Curaçao, and wake up the next morning feeling refreshed and ready to soak up the sun on one of Aruba’s picturesque beaches.
Most travelers go to the Caribbean for a beach holiday, which is something that can be enjoyed at nearly every port of call. In fact, some of the major cruise lines have a port of call at their own private island, giving their passengers a more exclusive beach escape. However, there are more to the Caribbean islands than just beaches. You can tour the stately plantation houses in Barbados, admire the Spanish colonial architecture in Puerto Rico, and sample delectable French-Creole cuisine in Martinique. For travelers in search of adventure, you can snorkel with sea turtles and stingrays in Grand Cayman, go ziplining through lush canopies in Jamaica, or swim beneath the cascading waterfalls in St. Lucia.
Cruises to the Caribbean typically leave from Florida, and the duration of these Caribbean cruises can last anywhere from five days to two weeks. Longer cruises are also available, and these often combine Caribbean ports of call with stops in Central or South America. If you’re having difficulty deciding between a western, eastern or southern Caribbean cruise, keep in mind that the eastern islands are a bit more spread out, and cruise itineraries will have more days at sea. The larger, western islands tend to offer a wide range of shore excursions and family-friendly activities. If time isn’t a factor in your vacation planning, a southern Caribbean cruise will allow you to see the more distant islands at a leisurely pace.
Peak season for Caribbean cruises lasts from mid-December to April, when the weather is at its best; think hot and sunny afternoons with low humidity, and pleasantly cool evenings. For the best Caribbean cruise deals, keep an eye out in the spring and fall seasons, as well as for affordable repositioning cruises between Europe and the Caribbean. June to November is when hurricane season comes into play, with storms generally taking place during the months of September and October, making these the cheapest months to go on a Caribbean cruise!
