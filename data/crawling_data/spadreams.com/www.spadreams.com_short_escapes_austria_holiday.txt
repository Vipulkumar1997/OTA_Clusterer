Majestic mountains and green trails
Austria is one of the most famous skiing destinations in the world and is also perfect for a spa holiday. Austria is an exciting destination with lots to discover – from rocky flanks of mountains, through endless green gorges to beautiful cities such as Salzburg or Vienna.
Our favourite destinations are located in the west of the country – in Tyrol, Carinthia, Styria and Salzburg area. The very most popular tourist areas are the alpine Tirol and Carinthia, however Styria and Salzburg are equally apt for a spa holiday, especially if you prefer green valleys and hills to snowy peaks.
Don't miss out on a chance to delight your taste buds with delicious Austrian dishes. The famous shnicel and beef dishes as well as exquisite deserts will make you fall in love with the Austrian cuisine. You don’t have to worry about your figure though. If you prefer lighter options, our spa resorts in Austria will certainly cater for your needs. Our resorts in Austria offer high-class spa ad detox treatments, which can be combined with outdoor activities such as Nordic Walking, jogging in the mountains or golf.  The mountainous resorts of Austria offer the perfect conditions for medical spa treatments, where the healthy climate and clean air will cleanse your lungs.
