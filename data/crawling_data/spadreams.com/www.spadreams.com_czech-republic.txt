Czech Republic
A journey back through time















Search








Welcome to the Czech Republic!
Under the warm hue of a setting sun, the golden city lights spill on to the surface of a glass-like river, glasses filled to the brim with Europe's best beers are chinked in celebration in cosy, welcoming pubs and thermal springs bubble peacefully. The Czech Republic will take you on a
journey back in time
- from the winding maze of Prague's cobbled streets and historical buildings to the
quaint and colourful architecture
of Karlovy Vary.
The silence on walks through ancient forests and meadows of
Czech spas
offers the perfect holiday experience. Stroll through the magnificent spa and castle gardens in the area or marvel at the centuries-old buildings of the spa halls and luxurious hotel complexes.
The "golden city" of Prague awaits with its
warm, dusky glow,
unique vibrancy and ancient buildings. Far more than just a prime tourist destination, Prague is also home to
stunning spas
offering a range of programmes, from city and wellness breaks to romantic getaways.
The iconic Karlovy Vary is the most popular spa destination in the Czech Republic, famed for its

Thermal Springs

and sulphur baths, which are used in treatments designed to
soften and deeply nourish skin
. The
Bohemian spa town
used to be a popular venue for gatherings and inspirations for many famous celebrities including: Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Richard Wagner, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Sebastian Bach, Karl Marx und Friedrich Chopin. With its charming, colourful buildings, impressive architecture and fascinating history, Karlovy Vary has also been chosen by several film directors as the backdrop for their blockbusters. Wandering through Karlovy Vary will take you past the setting for many films, including Casino Royale and Last Holiday. Near the German border lies the beautiful
Frantiskovy Lazne
, known for its radon cures, which are
highly effective
for treating inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and spondylitis.
With a huge range of hotels scattered across the Czech Republic, SpaDreams can help you find your ideal break! Contact our expert customer service team today for more information and to book your dream holiday!
