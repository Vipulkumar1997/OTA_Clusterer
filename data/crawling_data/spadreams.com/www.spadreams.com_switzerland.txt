Switzerland
A picturesque world of luxury















Search








Welcome to Switzerland!
A holiday in Switzerland is like stepping into a postcard: gaze at
azure skies
stamped with
wisps of pure white cloud,
which form a picturesque backdrop for lofty, snow coated mountains, flanked on either side with
luscious green forests
, marvel at the intense beauty of Europe's largest lake from the shores of Geneva or sample the
urban delights
of stunning Swiss cities. Switzerland is not only a synonym for luxury but also the land of sublime
spa experiences
. Our spa resorts in Switzerland offers scenic
panoramic views, delicious healthy cuisine and sophisticated spa treatments
, which satisfy even the most demanding guests. The Swiss grace and precision are reflected in the customer service and spa treatments at our resorts, which offer high-end amenities, professional
medical wellnes
s and exquisite food.
The Swiss cities amaze with their
urban chic and elegance
, however if you searching for relaxation and serenity, we recommend a stay by the Lake Constance in the Alpine foothills. This
“four-country region”
offers a one of a kind opportunity to visit Lichtenstein, Germany, Austria and Switzerland in one week, either by car or onboard a sailing boat.
The green surroundings of our spa hotels in Switzerland encourage a
connection with nature
and give a surge of new energy and vitality. Switzerland skilfully
mixes glamour and luxury with eco-friendliness and alpine rusticity
. The
spa packages
range from state-of-the art
medical wellness
to relaxing alpine herbal baths and other treatments inspired by nature. The restaurants at best spa hotels in Switzerland pamper their guests with the
local delicacies,
such as different kinds of gourmet cheese and superior chocolate, but also serve
healthy meals
suitable for health-conscious visitors and those with special dietary requirements.
If you need assistance planning your spa break in Switzerland, contact our friendly customer service team and we will be happy to help you find the perfect holiday offer for you!
