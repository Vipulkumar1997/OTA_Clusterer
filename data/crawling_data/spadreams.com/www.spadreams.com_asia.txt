Welcome to Asia & the Caribbean!
From the shimmering shores of
Sri Lanka

Indonesia
, Asia sparks with intrigue and glitters with possibility. Sunny skies, crystalline waters and palm fringed shores mingle with vivid green landscapes, rugged cliffs and an
irresistible sense of the orient.

India

Ayurveda
entices guests with the promise of
exceptional holistic healing
, an abundance of colour and a unique and vibrant culture.
Sri Lanka
, the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, is also home to some of the world's best Ayurveda specialists. Discover inner-harmony with an Ayurveda or
yoga holiday
in India or Sri Lanka for an authentic, exotic healing experience.
For
detox
and yoga,
Thailand
and Bali offer the ideal escapes. Each with stunning sunshine, luxurious hotels and their own
distinctive culture and cuisine
, your holiday in either of these destinations will be tailored to suit all of your needs.
Vietnam
, the
Maldives
and
Malaysia
are the best destinations for
luxury wellness
in Asia. Explore Vietnam's
emerald-tinted landscapes
, dive into the warm, sparkling waters off the Maldivian coast or indulge in
organic wellness
in Malaysia.
Across the Atlantic, the
Caribbean
twinkles temptingly. This colourful collection of islands are the perfect place to kick back and relax! Swinging in your
cosy hammock
strung between two palm trees with the brilliant sun warming your skin and an
ocean breeze tickling your cheek
, you'll feel as though you've stepped into a postcard.

sunniest spots on the planet
, SpaDreams can help you find the perfect hotel in Asia or the Caribbean. Contact our friendly team of experts to book now!
