Ayurveda Retreats for Better Balance and Wellbeing
Ayurveda retreats are becoming increasingly popular amongst those who want to discover the healing power of this ancient far eastern healing system. Our Ayurveda retreats will take you into the heart of
India
and
Sri Lanka
, where these traditions
first
began.
An Ayurveda Retreat is a place of sanctuary, where you can relax, achieve
inner-peace
and
restore
your
body
and
mind
to
full health
. Good health does not necessarily mean simply being
free
from illnesses. Our Ayurveda retreats focus on
holistic cures
aimed to
revitalise
your
well-being
, maximising the body’s own
healing power
, harnessing the
strength
of your
mind
and bringing your
soul
into
harmony
.
Guests at our Ayurveda retreats will have access to
treatment programmes
such as
detoxification
,
stress management
,
rejuvenation
,
yoga
,
Ayurvedic massages
, and
Dosha rehabilitation
.
Discover authentic Ayurveda retreats in
India
, the birthplace of Ayurveda, and immerse yourself in an oriental experience. On the shores of
Sri Lanka
you'll find retreats with an
equally strong
ayurvedic tradition and authentic treatments
passed down
through
generations
. Our Ayurveda
retreats
in
Europe
recreate
original treatments
in comfortable hotels and often employee
specialists
from India and Sri Lanka to
ensure authenticity
.
Let SpaDreams find the
perfect
Ayurveda retreat for you and
discover
the meaning of
true wellbeing
!
