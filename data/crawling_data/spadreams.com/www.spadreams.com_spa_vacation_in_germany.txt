Recharge Your Batteries in Germany
Germany
is the perfect

spa destination for couples

and families, as well those looking for
effective medical wellness treatments
. Its diverse landscapes and
charming small spa towns
make Germany a suitable destination for everyone looking to
combine
a
spa holiday
with interesting excursions. Most of our spa hotels in Germany are located amidst green surroundings and provide not only superior spa treatments, but also many opportunities for
outdoor activities
.
German
spa towns in the south
of the country have a long tradition and their programmes
often combine
relaxing spa treatments with

active leisure
e.g.
Nordic Walking
or
hiking
. The best known spa resorts in Germany have “Bad” (the German word for "bath") in their names, for example Bad Orb, Bad Griesbach, Bad Berleburg and many more. Well-preserved, charming towns hidden amongst green hills and

mountains
amaze their visitors with
stunning landscapes
and long trails. After an active day spent walking or hiking there is no better way to
recharge your batteries
than indulging in
soothing spa treatments
.
Those who prefer coastal landscapes can visit spa resorts by the Baltic Sea or the islands of the North Sea. The North Sea is perfect for those searching for sanctuary, however the resorts by the Baltic Sea are more easily accessible.
