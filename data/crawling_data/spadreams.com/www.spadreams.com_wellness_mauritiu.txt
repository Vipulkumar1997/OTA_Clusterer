Discover heaven on Earth
Described as the inspiration for heaven by writer Mark Twain, Mauritius is a true tropical paradise.
Turquoise tinted waters
lap against pristine, white beaches, cheeky monkeys scamper up into lush trees and every evening the
spectacular sun
sinks slowly down to meet the horizon.
This
palm speckled island
offers everything you need for an idyllic wellness escape. Feel soft grains of sand slip between your toes as you stroll barefoot across your own private stretch of beach, let your worries melt away in the warmth of a
tropical flower bath
or sit back and sip detox cocktails by the side of a sparkling pool, from the comfort of a
cosy deckchair.
Home of
luxury wellness
, Mauritius plays host to some of our most exquisite spas. Enjoy tantalising treatments, such as massages, wraps and scrubs, or get your snorkel on and explore Mauritius's
stunning shores
from within. Combine your wellness escape with
active leisure
and spend sunny afternoons sailing off the coast of Mauritius or getting an adrenaline rush on the back of a jet-ski, before returning to your opulent hotel for an evening of
entertainment and pampering.
Discover Mauritius for yourself - book a wellness holiday on Mauritius with SpaDreams today!
