Information for traveling to the Dead Sea in Jordan and Israel

Dead Sea Hotels and Therapies
The Dead Sea is a salt lake with its surface and shores approx. 400 meters
below sea level
. The climate of the Dead Sea is unique and has a
therapeutic effect
known around the world.
The desert air is extremely dry, virtually pollution-free and
enriched
in minerals. Maximum humidity is
35%
precipitation, and about
50 ml
per year. Due to relatively high content of oxygen in the air and a high concentration of
minerals
in the
sea
and nourishing
black mud
, the Dead Sea is the
best possible
destination for a
climatic cure
.
Additionally, the reduced ultraviolet radiation allows for healthy tanning and relaxing
330
days a year. The climate of the Dead Sea is pleasantly
warm
and
sunny
, even during the winter. A stay by the Dead Sea is ideal for
rheumatic diseases
and
joint problems
, as well as
skin diseases
such as eczema and psoriasis.
Another interesting property of the Dead Sea is the
high salt content
in the water which gives you a fascinating feeling of weightlessness. This intriguing
effect helps
with rehabilitation of joints and muscles as it seems that the body is ten times lighter and all movements are easier.

Dead Sea Treatments - When to undertake them
The best times for treating particular health conditions:
Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (late March to early June / September to November)
Atopic dermatitis (March to May / September-November)
Vitiligo (April to October)

Parapsoriasis diseases, e.g. lichen planus (January to June / September to November)
Prurigo nodularis, mycosis fungoides st. I - II, alopecia areata, papular urticaria, uveitis (May-June / September and October)
Cystic fibrosis (November to March)
Respiratory diseases (October to March)
Rheumatic and orthopedic diseases (February to early June / September to December) such as rheumatoid arthritis, gouty arthritis, osteoarthritis, soft tissue rheumatism, osteoarthritis. Cervical vertebrae, sciatica, shoulder pain, myalgia, neuralgia, fibromyalgia.

We strongly recommend a medical consultation with your doctor before you consider any treatments by the Dead Sea.

Recommendations
Consult with your doctor
how to take your medicines before you go to Israel or Jordan for a Dead Sea treatment. It is recommended to
limit the medicines you take to the very essential ones
. Especially the creams with corticosteroid should be avoided and put away at least four weeks before the treatment. Cortisone tablets may be taken throughout the treatment in consultation with your doctor and the specialists in DMZ.
Please
make sure that you take with you a
detailed health check report
and a
list of all the medicines
you take.

Duration of the Treatments at Dead Sea Hotels
Israel
:
In all the dead sea hotels offering treatments in DMZ Medical Centre, you must stay for
a minimum. of two weeks
(14 nights). Special prices are offered for treatments lasting five-weeks or more.
Jordan:
Dead Sea Spa - min. 1 week
(7 nights) - special price from 21 nights.
Mövenpick - min. 2 weeks
(14 nights), up to 3 weeks. Longer treatments available on request.
For the best results, we recommend at least 2-3 week treatments during the following times.
- End of March until mid June
- September - October
From mid June until the end of August the temperatures are usually too high to enjoy the healing properties of the Dead Sea, and from late October until mid March it may be too cold for healing sunbathing and bathing in the sea.
