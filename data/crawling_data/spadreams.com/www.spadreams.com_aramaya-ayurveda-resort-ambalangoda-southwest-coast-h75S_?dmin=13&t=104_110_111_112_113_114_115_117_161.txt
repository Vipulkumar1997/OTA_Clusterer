Aramaya Ayurveda Resort in detail


Your Holiday Destination

☀ Sri Lanka is a pure paradise located in the Indian ocean, surrounded by golden sandy beaches. It is a tropical island nation just off the Indian mainland. The island tempts its guests with its ancient culture and wonderful vegetation, as well as its traditional Ayurveda.

Your Holiday Region

Ambalangoda is a coastal town in the southwest of the island, well known for Sinhalese mask carving. Another attractive feature is a naturally formed and developed rock pool, perfect for swimming in.

Your Ayurveda Resort

The Aramaya Ayurveda Beach Resort, the sister hotel of the Oasis Ayurveda Beach Resort, is located directly on the long sandy beach in Ambalangoda. Countless palm trees provide a tropical ambience whilst you are taking a walk, and the warm climate is ideal for Ayurvedic treatments. The pool and garden are beautiful places for relaxing.

How You Reside

The Ayurveda Resort has a certain charm due to the individual design of each of the 13 well furnished rooms. 6 rooms with a sea view are located on the first floor and 7 rooms without are located on the ground floor. All rooms are equipped with a shower/WC, TV, hairdryer, dressing gown, safe and mosquito nets. Wifi is available in the lobby.

Description of available rooms
Dining

Ayurveda guests are offered a wide selection of Ayurvedic foods, teas and juices. All meals are served individually. Guests' diets are adjusted to suit their Doshas, which require you to eat according to your corresponding type.

Ayurveda Centre

Classic cleansing treatments are carried out in the spacious Ayurvedic centre of the Aramaya Ayurveda Beach Resort, which includes 10 treatments rooms, 3 saunas, 4 herbal baths and 2 accupuncture rooms. The centre is located next to the lobby and the pool.

Leisure

Due to the hotel being located directly on the sea, you can enjoy a lot of your leisure time in or near the water. We recommend long walks along the beach. After you have had your initial consultation with the doctor, the hotel staff will be happy to help you organise half-day excursions during your stay. It is definitely worth a trip to the town of Ambalangoda. Taxis or rickshaws to take you to the tourist town of Hikkaduwa can easily be arranged on request.

Additional information

ARRIVAL Colombo Airport (CMB), approx. 135 km (82 miles) away.
