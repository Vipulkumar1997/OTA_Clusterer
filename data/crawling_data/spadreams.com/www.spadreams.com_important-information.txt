Important Information
Everything you need to know about your travels





Travel Advice
For up to date entry requirements, along with health, safety and general advice for the country you are travelling to, please visit
https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice
.

Other countries, other customs
Be sure to familiarise yourself with the cultural practices, norms and expectations of the country you are visiting. It is also important to be aware of any public holidays and the impact that they may have on your holiday.

General Arrival and Departure
Generally speaking, the hotel room will be available from 2-3pm.
I
t is essential that you inform us if you are intending to
arrive late (after 6pm). On departure you should vacate the room by midday at the latest.
If you travelling to long-haul destinations (e.g. India, Sri Lanka, Thailand etc.) you may arrive at the hotel early in the morning, before check-in opens. We recommend that you book an extra night, to avoid having to wait at the hotel lobby. If you are leaving late in the evening and want to keep your room for the day, you will also have to book an additional night.

Flights
On your flight booking confirmation you will find the estimated departure and arrival times. Non-stop flights have no breaks. Flights with stopovers may require
disembarking
. Flight plans, routes and schedules are subject to change at short notice. You will be informed about any changes as soon as

possible.
The flight times of the departure and return flights comply with the flight timetables of the airlines, and can also be early in the morning or late at night. Night flights are also a possibility. Please consider the arrival and departure days primarily as travel days. Flight delays can also not always be avoided; for example bad weather or too many planes in the airspace can lead to delays. All flights are non-smoking.

Treatments
Some treatments e.g. beauty treatments and massages can take place on arrival days even if your room is not yet available. If necessary please ask the hotel for a room for the day (at a cost). If you are travelling in your own car, parking and underground parking spaces will be allocated if they are available. Certain exercises and treatments, e.g. aerobics, yoga and autogenous training, are always done in groups, unless otherwise stated. Additional treatments and services should be booked as far in advance as possible.

Medical Examinations
In a consultation with your GP, you should clarify whether the climate, thermal water, seawater and physical treatments such as massages or fango are suitable for you. Y
ou should also consult a doctor before booking certain
wellness programmes and before undertaking a detox or fasting programme. Many cures and spa programmes require an onsite medical examination, which is often already included in the programme, but please check the programme description. The result of the medical examination by the authorised doctor onsite will decide which treatments are prescribed for you.
Please bring existing medical records with you.

Construction Work
Construction work is sometimes undertaken at very short notice and we will not always know about it when we confirm your journey. As soon as we know about any construction work that
could disturb or impair your holiday, we will inform you immediately. We always strive to find an acceptable solution for you, generally in the form of a replacement offer or a free cancellation.

Best Price Guarantee
If, within 14 days of booking with SpaDreams, you find the same package with the same treatments with a different holiday provider for a cheaper price, then we will refund you the difference. This price promise even applies if you are offered a cheaper price by the hotels and resorts themselves. You only have to provide us with written proof of the lower price, including proof of the treatments offered and the availability of the cheaper offer. Exceptions to the best price guarantee are flights, as prices fluctuate every day, as well as special offers which are available for a limited period of time or for a limited number of people.

Doctor’s Recommendations
Please take note of the recommendations of the treatment doctors at the hotel, retreat or clinic. Succesful results cannot always be guaranteed from participation in a programme (cures, wellness, fitness and beauty).

Single Rooms
Single rooms are often double rooms for single use (see hotel descriptions). Genuine single rooms are generally only available in small numbers in hotels and may differ from double rooms in location and facilities. You have the right to accommodation in the room category confirmed by us. The layout of the room is up to the hotel. A specific room in the hotel can be requested, but cannot be guaranteed.

Golf
Please note that the golf courses may be closed because of bad weather.

Pets
Taking your pets with you on holiday is sometimes allowed (see hotel information), and information about the breed, size and weight of the animal is always required in advance.
Pets are not allowed i
n dining rooms, restaurants, common areas, lifts, pools, spas and treatment areas. All costs are to be paid on site.

Hotel classification
As expectations of comfort are different, SpaDreams uses the official classifications of each country. However, this does not always correspond to the standards you would expect at a hotel in Britain. Essentially you can only expect the hotel facilities and room amenities as described.

Tourist Tax
Any applicable tourist tax must be paid on arrival unless otherwise stated.

Discounts and Reductions
For example; 5=3 means five nights for the price of three. The whole trip must take place within the savings period. As a rule, the offer only applies to the price of the overnight stay, not to the board or additional treatments. Some discounts are exclusive to SpaDreams. We reserve the right to remove or alter seasonal discounts at any time.

Satellite TV
SAT-TV simply means satellite-reception. The programmes that can be received depends entirely on which satellite the antenna is directed at.

Sport Equipment
Sports equipment and opportunities to play are in high demand during the high season and availability can be limited. Depending on demand you may have to wait for equipment, use may be decreased or limited and you may have to compromise. This also applies to deckchairs, parasols and sun loungers. Some hotels offer seasonal entertainment programmes.

Transfers
SpaDreams offers a private transfer service to many hotels, with a separate taxi from the train station or airport to the hotel. A transfer representative will await you at the airport or train station, generally after you have passed through customs. Please take note of the transfer representative’s sign with your name and/or hotel name and ‘SpaDreams’. Your driver will help you with the loading and unloading of your luggage.

Catering
Many hotels offer local specialities and food specific to the country. Breakfast usually takes place in the form of a self-service buffet and in some countries is of much less importance or low interest. Generally speaking, half board covers breakfast and evening meals (in the form of a buffet menu or a la carte). Half board service starts on the day of your arrival with an evening meal and ends on your departure day with breakfast. If are departing from the hotel late or at night an evening meal might not be included.

Off-peak Season
Peak seasons vary from region to region and do not always align with our holiday times. Certain facilities and attractions in the area, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, restaurants and shops, may have decreased opening hours in the off-peak season. Necessary construction work or other building works are generally carried out during the off-peak season too. Some hotels are a popular destination for groups in this time due to the cheaper prices. The prices in season overlaps are calculated proportionately.

Wellness areas, bathing pools and cure areas
The wellness areas, bathing pools and cure areas are often accessible by non-residents for a fee. Beaches are almost always public and the responsibility to keep it clean lies with the relevant authority.

Room Categories
The room names provided in the descriptions have been provided by our hotel partners in order to ensure there are no mistakes when reserving. It could be, therefore, that a deluxe room in a 3 star hotel is not comparable to a room of this category in a 4 or 5 star hotel.
