Fasting in Europe
Effective Fasting Holidays for Health and Wellness

Purify Your Body in Europe
Unfortunately, most people find it easier to gain excess weight rather than lose it. Our fasting
programmes in Europe
can have a huge impact on your weight loss journey and help you to
achieve
your
dream body
.
During a fast your calorie intake is
reduced
dramatically and sometimes food is omitted altogether. A large amount of water and special fasting teas are consumed throughout the fast to keep you hydrated and energised and to help flush out toxins. As well as resulting in weight loss, the detoxing effect of fasting will leave with a healthier body and a healthier mind.
SpaDreams offers a wide variety of
fasting
programmes across the world, with several
popular
destinations in
Europe
.
Germany
, where the
Schroth
,
Buchinger

and
F.X Mayr

fasting methods were all developed, is widely considered to be the motherland of fasting, and is home to many of our best fasting hotels and clinic. The stunning landscapes of Hungary and Slovenia also offer an idyllic backdrop for your fasting holiday in Europe, or those desiring a warmer climate can undertake fasting programmes in sunny
Spain
or Portugal.
Let us help you to find the
perfect destination
for fasting, at the best possible price!
