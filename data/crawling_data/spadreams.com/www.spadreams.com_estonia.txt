Forested hills, mystic moorlands and traditional seaside resorts

Welcome to Estonia!
A
magnificent red sun
descends slowly over the Baltic Sea and sinks into the horizon, graceful deer scamper between the trees, and the
glass-like stillness of the twinkling lakes
is disturbed only by birds settling on the grassy islands speckled across their surfaces -
Estonia is a haven of untouched nature.
Woodland trails wind through pine forests, providing the perfect paths for keen walkers. Home to around 40 national parks and conservation areas, and with a landscape consisting of 50% forest, Estonia is an
idyllic destination
for anyone looking to reconnect with nature, breath in fresh air and get active in stunning locations. In the winter Estonia turns into a
Narnina-like wonderland
, perfect for snowy adventures!
Although Estonia's
charming rustic villages
may make you feel like you've stepped into a Mark Twain novel, Estonia is far from regressive. As one of the leading pioneers of the digital age, Estonia operates as an "e-society" , where residents can do anything from voting to paying taxes online.
WiFi is available almost everywhere in the country
, from the centre of a busy high street to the core of a remote forest.
The Estonian coastline meets the
beautiful Baltic sea
and is the perfect destination for a spa break. From exquisite
thalassotherapy
treatments to soothing massages, our partner hotels in Estonia will cater for your every desire.
If you want to escape to a charming wonderland in the North of Europe, contact our friendly customer service team today to book your holiday in Estonia!
