Welcome to Italy!
Where a
rich artistic tradition

meets captivating ancient history,
where fascinating architecture borders serene canals and ethereal sunsets sink over
pure white beaches
and into the horizon: a wealth of
spa

and wellness treatments
await you in enchanting Italy.
Home of some of the oldest spas in Europe, Italy's spa traditions date back to the ancient Romans. According to the legends they were the first to discover the beneficial effects of natural
thermal waters
and
fango
(therapeutic mud). The best-known spa resorts in Italy specialising in treatments with use of fango are located amidst the Euganean Hills in the Abano Region. Fango has multiple uses – it
soothes joints
affected by rheumatic conditions,
nourishes and rejuvenates skin,
as well as improving the blood circulation.
The spa resorts in Italy blend a traditional
Mediterranean flair
with stylish luxury interiors and amenities. Our elegant health spa resorts in Italy provide the guests not only with
ultimate comfort
but also with specialist health advice; most of them have on-site doctors and specialists to ensure safe and effective treatments.
Famous thermal waters
are used not only as one of the ingredients of fango but also as a natural remedy – Italy is one of the best destinations for
balneotherapy treatments
. Relaxing for the muscles and soothing for the senses, the spa treatments with use of natural mineral waters are perfect for those who suffer from back pain, joint and bone problems or skin diseases.
One of the
most

romantic destinations on Earth
, Italy is the perfect place to whisk your partner away to for an unforgettable
romantic break
, or to escape everyday life and sink into a blissful state of relaxation. From the unique elegance of Venice, to the rolling hills of Tuscany, to the sunny shores of Ischia, Italy's diverse and
bewitching landscapes
have something to entice any wellness lover.
