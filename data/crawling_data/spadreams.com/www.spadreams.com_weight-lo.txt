Fasting & Weight Loss on Holiday
Lose weight
on holiday with SpaDreams! Losing weight at home alone can be a
difficult
challenge, especially when you can't
escape
the pressures and
habits
of everyday life, or when you're surrounded by high calorie food everywhere you go.
By choosing to lose weight at a SpaDreams nutrition focused hotel, you'll be given
all
the
support
you need to reach your target weight. Discover a
new
, lighter life and enjoy tasty, healthy recipes. You will
learn
everything you need to know about a
healthy diet
, the best way to deal with a hunger attack and how to place
exercise
into your everyday life. At our
weight loss retreats
, you'll be able to meet other people looking to lose weight, so you can
support
each other on your weight loss
journeys
.
With a
wide range
of sport and wellness programmes, your weight loss holiday will not only be focused around food. Enjoy classic massages, mud packs, saunas and a large variety of beauty and slimming spa treatments at our
first
-
class resorts
. Water gymnastics, cardio training, Pilates,
Nordic walking
and many other
leisure activities
will allow you to
boost
your
calorie burn
and shed pounds whilst having fun.
For those looking for something a little bit different, we also offer

, which utilises the detoxifying effect of this ancient Indian healing art to optimise your lifestyle for healthy living. No matter what type of
weight loss holiday
you're searching for, our
expert customer service team

Types of Weight Loss Holidays
Slimming Spa Holidays

Weight-Loss Holidays
:
Our resorts offer original weight-loss programmes, which are designed to focus on quick and effective weight reduction.
