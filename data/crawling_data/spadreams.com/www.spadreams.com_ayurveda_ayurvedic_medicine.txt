Introduction to Ayurvedic Medicine
The word
Ayurveda
means "the knowledge of life" in Sanskrit. Ayurvedic medicine originated in India about
5,000 years ago
and it has evolved over time.
Dhanvantari
- The giver of Ayurveda or the "Science of Life" to the world, is worshipped in India as the
God
of
Medicine
. This ancient Indian
system of medicine
survived a ban during colonisation, and is becoming
increasingly popular today
. Authentic Ayurveda is offered by practicioners from

India
and
Sri Lanka
, not only in Asia but also in
Europe
- for example in Spain, Portugal, Germany and Poland.

What is Unique about Ayurvedic Medicine?
Unlike conventional treatments, Ayurveda
offers
a
highly individual approach
as well as holistic treatment, and
focuses
on the
entire body
and
mind
, rather than solely on a particular illness.
Instead
of
prescribing
every patient the
same medicine
for the
same illness
, an Ayurvedic doctor
examines the patient
and creates an i
ndividual treatment
designed to cure the whole body,
rather
than targeting one
particular organ
.

Doshas
What the treatment includes is dependent on
your type of constitution
, or
dosha
. There are essentially
three main doshas
: Vata, Pitta and Kapha - a professional
Ayurvedic doctor
will determine your dosha type in detail. Although it is unlikely that you will be pure Vata, Pitta or Kapha, most people have a prevailing dosha which can be used as a basic guide to begin creating an
individualised treatment plan
.

Diet for Vata, Pitta and Kapha
All
three types
should eat a
balanced diet
and avoid caffeinated drinks, alcohol and smoking.
Diet for Vata
If you are
Vata type
, you should
avoid cold foods
, fruits and leafy greens. You can use
all spices
and you should eat hearty soups, cooked root vegetables, garlic, sweet potatoes, wheat and rice. You
are allowed
to consume
all oils
as well as
diary products
(
in moderation
) and use all sweeteners
apart from white sugar
.
Diet for Pitta
Pitta types
should
avoid
any
acidic foods
, such as sour fruits and vinegar. Pungent vegetables, garlic, root vegetables and hot spices
should all be avoided
as well. Sweet fruits as well as sweet and bitter vegetables and legumes
are recommended
. Nuts, seeds and sweeteners
should not
be eaten
excessively
. Oils and diary products are
allowed
in
moderation
.
Diet for Kapha
If you are
Kapha type
, you should
avoid
salt and oily, fatty and sweet foods. You
should eat
raw or steamed vegetables as well as ripe fruits and strong spices.
Low-fat diary products
are
allowed
in
moderation
. You should use
honey instead of sugar
.

When to Take an Ayurvedic Cure
Ayurvedic medicine is offered mainly in
India
and
Sri Lanka
.
When planning an Ayurvedic holiday the
monsoon
seasons
should be taken into consideration
. The weather in India and Sri Lanka is very changeable and the monsoon season does
not
usually
mean
that it will rain all the time. It can also
rain
during the
dry season
.
Most of the hotels and centres offering Ayurvedic medicine have
higher prices
during the
dry seasons
, however many Ayurvedic specialists highlight that the wet season is a good time for Ayurvedic medicine treatments as the air is moist and free from pollutants. The pores
open more easily
and detox is more effective.
Sri Lanka
Most of the SpaDreams
hotels offering Ayurvedic medicine in Sri Lanka
are located in the south-west part of the island, where the
monsoon season
takes place in
May
-
September
. In the north-east Sri Lanka the wet season takes place in December-February. March, April, October and November are the months of the inter-monsoon season on the entire island.
India
In India the
wet season
lasts from
July
to
September
in the central parts of the country. The monsoons spread across India from the south west, where the wet season begins earlier (in May-June). In the north east the monsoon season
begins
later and
finishes in October
. Usually the south of India receives
more rainfall
than the
north
.

What to Consider
Travelling to
India
or
Sri Lanka
to experience the
most authentic
Ayurvedic medicine will be a life changing experience, however, if you are travelling from Europe it will involve a tiring, long-haul journey which could cause
jet lag
. Such a journey may not be suitable for elderly or disabled people.
Panchakarma
is an
intense detox cure
, which is not suitable for children or pregnant women. Generally it is
recommended
for people who
do not suffer
from any severe or fatal diseases, but have an unhealthy and/or hectic lifestyle and may experience problems with weight gain, digestive system, sleeping, concentration and many other conditions which stem from unhealthy, irregular eating and an imbalanced lifestyle.
It is
best to arrive
with another person undertaking the treatment, somebody who
supports this kind of treatment
or
alone
. An Ayurvedic stay is
not suitable
for a family holiday. Most hotels will accommodate people who are only there to
support another guest
and do not wish to
undertake a cure themselves
, however there are a few hotels which do not accept guests who are not there to undertake an Ayurveda cure.

Ayurvedic Medicine in Europe
Ayurvedic medicine in Europe is a
good alternative
for anyone who would like to experience an Ayurveda cure without having to take a long flight to India, Nepal or Sri Lanka.
SpaDreams
hotels in Europe offering Ayurvedic medicine
employ specialists from India and Sri Lanka and offer light Ayurveda as well as original
Panchakarma
.
You can choose from hotels located in the sunny islands

Mallorca
,
Tenerife

or Madeira
, or travel to
Germany
,
Poland

or Austria
.

Recommendations
If you have any
health related concerns
about Ayurvedic medicine or a
holiday stay
in India or Sri Lanka, please
consult your doctor
to decide whether an
Ayurvedic holiday
is suitable for you.
Vaccines
are
not

compulsory
, however vaccines for Typhoid and Hepatitis A
may be advisable
.
Make sure you
check
the
entry requirements
for citizens of your country carefully.
If you have
any questions
don't hesitate to contact us directly and we will be
happy to advise you
