Experience the Natural Healing Powers of Thalasso
Similar to our Thermal Spa treatments,
thalassotherapy
utilises the natural healing power of mineral-rich waters to tone muscles, treat cellulite and cure skin problems such as psoriasis. Thalassotherapy is
based
on the
sea products
such as seaweed, water, salt and mud. Clear your lungs in the
fresh sea air
and sooth your skin with Thalasso treatments, such as
seaweed wraps
, Vichy showers, massages and much more.
The magnificent
benefits
of these
mineral-rich oceanic products
and the natural
calming effect
of the ocean have drawn some of Hollywood's
biggest stars
to Thalassotherapy. The
Latin
word "Thalasso" means the "Cure of the Sea", which is the
tonic effect
of time spent in the
sea
or in
sea water
. With SpaDreams, you can experience the all-star treatment at an
affordable price
.
With a
warm
climate and
mineral rich
waters,
Tunisia

and
Morocco
are home to some of our finest Thalassotherapy resorts. Take a trip to one of our exotic Thalassotherapy centres in Egypt, relax and rejuvenate in Croatia or Slovenia, soak the Spanish sun or explore some of our other excellent resorts located throughout Europe. Thalasso cures are ideal for losing weight on vacation, detoxifying and after pregnancy by promoting fat burning. They are also recommended for revitalization, anti-aging, new energy, stress and general fatigue.
Other
indications
include
: cardiovascular, blood pressure, joints, spine, respiratory, rheumatism, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, circulatory disorders, chronic constipation, Crohn's disease and back problems. For one of a kind thalasso experience, we
recommend
our
resorts by the Dead Sea
,
known
for their
effective cures
for psoriasis, eczema and rheumatic conditions.
Book your
thalasso therapy escape
with SpaDreams today and discover the power of the sea!
