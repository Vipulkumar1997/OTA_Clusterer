Visit the sunniest corners of the Med!
Indulge your senses in the sunny Mediterranean! Spectacular sunshine and sunny beaches are
not the only reason why countries such as Spain, Italy and Greece top the lists of the most popular spa destinations.

The saying “Festina lente” (“make haste slowly”) is a Mediterranean motto and t
he south of Europe hides many retreats where the relaxed ambience helps guests to f
orget about the stresses of everyday life
.
The region sparkles with diversity - each of the destinations by the Mediterranean Sea offers distinctive spa treatments, cuisine and culture. Italy is best known for
spa and wellness
, as well as cures using therapeutic mud (fango), whilst Greece offers superior
thalasso treatments
. Those seeking thalasso wellness with an exotic flair can travel to Tunisia for a spa experience flavoured with a unique blend of French and African cultural influences.
Mediterranean spas also offer a diverse range of spa detox treatments. Through intensive slimming, firming and purifying treatments, you can
detoxify your body without dieting
. Most of these spa treatments utilise natural ingredients, such as coffee, green tea or sea algae.
Whether you need a
short spa break
or you're looking for a longer
spa therapy treatment
on holiday, the Mediterranean is certainly an excellent holiday choice all year around. Book with SpaDreams today and take advantage of our best price guarantee!
