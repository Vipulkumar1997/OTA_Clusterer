Top tips from our customers


‘Mosquito repellent on site. Get the bike with a light, if you want to enjoy the sunset on the beach until the end. Visit the gardens of Briefgarden and Lunuganga-Garden. Make sure to make an appointment at Lunuganga Garden. They have fixed times for a guided tour. If you want, you can also eat there.’



‘Absolutely the 3 weeks treatment, the detoxification alone needs its time and if you already want to make a treatment, you should give yourself the time. To see the island you should fly again or add on another week. The effect of the therapeutic applications was also shown in the afternoon, so that one could not necessarily (or wanted) to leave the resort. A boat trip on the Maadu River and a walk in the letter garden were very nice.’
