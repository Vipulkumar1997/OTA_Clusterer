Back to Nature and Healthy Habits
Sebastian
Kneipp
(1821 – 1897) was a
pioneer
of
hydrotherapy
(therapy with use of water)
combined with special diet
, herbal treatments, and physical activities. The cure is believed to
help patients suffering
from psychological, cardiovascular and metabolic problems such as chronic fatigue or stress, sleeping disorders, venous insufficiency or ulcers, restless legs, phlebitis, diabetes type II, obesity and hypertension. Kneipp therapy is
also suitable
as a prevention treatment to
avoid arterial disorders
and
degenerative diseases
such as
rheumatism
. The
best-known destination
for Kneipp therapy is
Bad Wörishofen
in
Germany
, where Sebastian Kneipp
gave lectures
and developed the treatment.
Increase your wellbeing with just
five elements
? The Kneipp cure
makes
it
possible
! A
combination
of
water therapy
, nutrition, exercise, herbs and a
new way of life
not only
strengthens
the
immune system
, but promises a completely
new way of life
.
The
most popular
Kneipp Therapy is the so called
hydrotherapy
where water serves as a
mediator
of temperature
stimuli
. The interaction of warm and cold water
strengthens above all the immune system
and the
blood circulation
and c
reates a better state of health
. Typical therapies include
treading
,
faucets
,
baths
or
washes
.
Elements
of the Kneipp
therapy
:
-
Water treatments
(hydrotherapy): various kinds of showers with cold and hot water, mineral and herbal baths (balneotherapy), body packs, and massages are just some of the treatments on the extensive list.
-
Herbal treatments
(phytotherapy) with use of warm bags with herbs, herbal teas and essential oils.
-
The diet
: balanced diet or fasting based mainly on vegetarian and vegan wholesome products – lots of fruit and vegetable, whole-grain products, quality diary and meat (in reasonable amounts), a lot of water and herbal teas.
-
Physical activities
: daily moderate exercises, outdoor activities such walking barefoot (e.g. in snow or a meadow).
-
Inner balance
: regulation of daily routine and deep relaxation.
A Kneipp Cure is also about the interaction of stress and rest. This movement therapy includes massages and walking, cycling or swimming. The diet should be balanced and natural. Also medicinal plants are used (phytotherapy), which can also be found in teas, oils or ointments. All in all, a new order should reconcile life and restore the mental balance.
The Kneipp Cure can be used preventively or for the treatment of a medical illness. The cure works best with other applications or with a
Detox
or
F.X. Mayr Cure
combined.
