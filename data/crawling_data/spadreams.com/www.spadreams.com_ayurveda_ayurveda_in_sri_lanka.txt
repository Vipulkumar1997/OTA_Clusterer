Ayurveda in Sri Lanka
Authentic Ayurveda & Exceptional Hospitality

Ayurveda in Sri Lanka - Indulge your Senses
Ayurveda
is a great alternative to conventional
medical treatments
and has risen in
popularity
over the past
few years
at an incredible rate. Our hotels in
Sri Lanka
offer original, traditional treatments in
luxurious settings
. Check out our
best offers
for Ayurveda in Sri Lanka if you are seeking Ayurvedic treatments from
genuine specialists
.
Forget about
everyday life
in one of our authentic

Ayurveda
or

yoga retreats
in Sri Lanka -
indulge
your senses in an
oriental paradise
and discover
inner-peace
under the guidance of our
highly trained experts
.
All of our
retreats
offering

Ayurveda

in Sri Lanka ensure
deep relaxation
and intimacy. Sri Lanka, also called the 'Teardrop of India', is known for its
pristine beauty
and
serenity
, and its long lasting postive effects on your
health
. All our hotels are
peaceful sanctuaries
which provide Ayurvedic treatments for your
body
,
mind
and
spirit
.
The hotels offering Ayurvedic treatments usually offer
complete programmes
, including an
Ayurvedic diet
corresponding to your constitution type, or
Dosha
. The concept of
three Doshas
lies at the heart of Ayurveda treatments. Ayurveda distinguishes itself from
conventional medicine
by treating each person as an individual with a
unique constitution
and unique needs.
There is
no universal diet
or
treatment
which suits everyone. According to Ayurvedic teachings, everybody has
three Doshas
(energies based on wind, fire, water and earth elements), however usually
one
or
two
are dominant.
Alternative medicine
, including

Ayurveda treatments
can help you regain
inner balance
.


Intensive Ayurveda in Sri Lanka
Although
India
is considered the
homeland of Ayurveda
, Ayurvedic medicine is of
particular importance
in Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine has a
Department of Ayurveda
, demonstrating the extent to which medicine in Sri Lanka relies on
Ayurvedic teachings
.
The
principles of Ayurveda
are universal, however Ayurvedic
Medicines
and
treatments

var
y from
region
to
region
. Some families in Sri Lanka have passed
original Ayurvedic recipes
from one generation to another, resulting in an
incredible range
of Ayurvedic recipes
across Sri Lanka
.
Intensive
Ayurveda in Sri Lanka differs slightly from
treatment in India
, however the aim is exactly the same - to
bring
your
body
and
mind
into
balance
.
The
most popular
, complete Ayurvedic treatment in
both
India and Sri Lanka is

Panchakarma
, which focuses on
Ayurvedic detox
. It takes a minimum of
two
or
three weeks
and includes an

Ayurvedic diet
. The treatment is
highly individual
and it is prescribed by an
ayurvedic doctor
, who will determine the
right cosmetic treatments
,
medicines
and
menu
. Panchakarma can be supported by
yoga classes
, which are in
most of our resorts
that offer Ayurveda in
Sri Lanka
.
Resorts offering Ayurveda in Sri Lanka provide what is known as "
barefoot luxury
." For many guests it is a rare luxury to escape their mobile phone and computer, feel the sand on the beach under their bare feet and
completely unwind
, whilst taking
Ayurvedic treatments
.
Even in the most
luxurious Ayurvedic resorts
in
Sri Lanka
, it is advised to
bring comfortable
,
casual clothes
with you. Moderate clothes are
recommended
in
public areas
(e.g. in restaurants).


Good to know

The Weather in Sri Lanka
The
monsoon season
in the south-west of
Sri Lanka
, where most of the SpaDreams hotels are located, lasts from
May
to
September
. In the north-east the
monsoon season
lasts from
December
to
February
.
The monsoon season is
often
advised as the
best time
for
Ayurveda in Sri Lanka
- the rain makes the air clean and moisture supports
detoxification
as skin pores
open more easily
. The "rainy season" does not mean it will rain at all times, but it
may
get
cold
in the
evening
. The weather in Sri Lanka is
very unpredictable
. You have to be
prepared
for the
sun
(hat and sun blockers) as well as for the
rain
during your
time
in
Sri Lanka
.

What To See
Most
of the SpaDreams

Ayurveda retreats
in
Sri Lanka
are located
close
to the
capital of Sri Lanka
- Colombo - and the town of Galle,
famous
for its
Dutch fortifications
(
UNESCO World Heritage Site
). Other flagship attractions are
located further
from the south-west coast, in the so called "
Golden Triangle
" of the central highlands,
including the historic cities
of Kandy, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya and Dambulla.

Other Useful Information:
If you fly
from Europe
to
Ind
ia it is likely that you will arrive at the
hotel
in the
morning
,
before
the
check-in
, it is advised to consider booking an additional night, to
avoid waiting
at the
hotel lobby
. A
similar situation
may occur if your
return flight
is in the
late evening
.
The
customer service
in
Sri Lanka
is
outstanding
and
hospitality
is embedded in the
culture
of
Sri Lanka
. Many locals
earn
their
living
from
tips
rather than their
low salaries
.
Tipping is
appreciated.
