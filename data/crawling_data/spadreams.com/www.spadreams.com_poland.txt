Welcome to Poland!
With its colourful traditions, picturesque landscapes and heart-warming cities, Poland welcomes its guests with open arms. The glimmering river Vistula snakes through Poland's
varied landscapes,
from mountainous peaks, through historic cities and scenic forests before
weaving into the Baltic Sea
. Home to the only primeval forest in Europe, majestic cathedrals and
myriad cultural interests
, Poland is a must-visit destination for culture lovers and relaxation seekers alike.
One of the most popular spa destinations in Poland is Kolobrzeg (also known as Kolberg) by the Baltic Coast – one of the oldest towns in Poland with a
long spa tradition.
Kolberg and other destinations by the Baltic Sea are suitable for those who suffer from respiratory problems, rheumatic conditions, back pain and various joint and muscle diseases. Our partner hotels in these regions specialise in therapies with use of
natural ingredients,
such as peat, sea salt and therapeutic mud to provide relief without invasive treatments or procedures.
Poland is also an excellent destination for
weight loss holidays
– the fresh sea air and long, sandy beaches provide the ideal backdrop for fitness enthusiasts to get active, and the hotels along the coastline often offer slimming programmes with healthy, delicious cuisine.
The South of Poland beckons those searching for
peace and tranquillity.
Swierardow Zdroj is
well-known for balneotherapy
with use of radon, which alleviates rheumatic conditions and nourishes skin. The area surrounding Swierardow Zdroj is close to popular winter sport resorts, such as Szklarska Poreba and Karpacz. In summer these winter wonderlands transform into a
hiker's paradise
- the well-marked hiking and walking trails by Mount Sniezka make for a perfect active leisure escape.
Fall in love with Poland's diversity - book your holiday in Poland with SpaDreams today. With our best price guarantee, you can be sure you'll be booking at the best possible price!
