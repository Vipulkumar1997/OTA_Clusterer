Authentic Ayurveda in Europe
Searching for an authentic
Ayurveda Retreat
without having to travel to

India
or
Sri Lanka
? Our wide variety of Ayurveda in Europe offers are just what you've been looking for!
You can receive this high quality, effective healing method in many institutions around the world. Our resorts
offering Ayurveda
in Europe are run by expert
doctors
and
therapists
from India who have grown up in a culture
immersed
in
Ayurveda
and are
well-equipped
to provide you with all the
treatments
you
need
.
The
cleansing and purification procedures
are arranged by a specialist, and a doctor will prescribe an

Ayurvedic diet
for you based on your constitution type, or
Dosha
.
Enjoy all of the benefits of authentic Ayurveda in
luxury hotels
across
Europe
!


Ayurveda Island Resorts in Europe
Madeira
(Portugal) is an excellent destination, where you can
experience
an
authentic Ayurvedic stay
at
Hotel Alpino Atlantico
which has a light ayurveda programme '
Ayurveda on Madeira
', as well as complete a
Ayurvedic Panchakarma
programme on offer. The hotel also welcomes guests who do not wish to undertake Ayurveda themselves and are there to accompany another guest who is taking ayurvedic treatments.
We also recommend the islands of
Tenerife
and
Mallorca
(Spain). Our partner hotel

Ayurveda Mallorca - House of Silence
offers a wide range of programmes, including an extremely rare combination of
Fasting according to Buchinger
with
Ayurveda
(fasting adopted to Ayurvedic teachings). This specialist
Ayurvedic healing centre
is far from a
tourist orientated beach resort
and provides the optimum conditions for Ayurvedic cures.

Hotel Botanico & Oriental Spa Garden
specialises in light Ayurveda and anti-stress programmes.


Why Europe?
There are
many reasons
why we recommend
Ayurveda in Europe
:
Long-haul flight
, as well as
jet lag
and the climate of the south of Asia, could potentially have a negative effect if your health is poor.
Ayurveda in Europe incurs
fewer travel expenses
.
The
weather
in Europe is more
stable
and
predictable
than the weather in South Asia.
The
specialists
, therapists and chefs employed at the majority of our
Ayurveda hotels in Europe
come from
India
or
Sri Lanka
and gained their
skills
there.
The treatments in our resorts in
Europe

meet
the European
safety requirements
.
