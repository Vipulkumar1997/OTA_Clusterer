A little piece of paradise















Search








Welcome to the Caribbean!
The Caribbean fulfils every sunshine-seeker's wildest fantasies; a
kaleidoscopic cluster of colours and cultures
, where flamboyant birds of paradise flutter in the cloudless skies and each island is ringed with
soft, sandy beaches
and crystal clear, cyan-tinted waters. Juicy coconuts, ripe bananas and flavoursome rum characterise the taste of the Caribbean, where your tastebuds will be delighted and your
senses will be stirred.

Relax with a rum cocktail and enjoy a moment of pure paradise on the shores of your own
personal haven of relaxation
, trek through luscious green jungles or get your scuba gear on and dive into the sparkling Caribbean sea, where a
wonderful underwater world beckons.

SpaDreams high-end, all inclusive
luxury hotels
await you on the island of St Vincent , an
idyllic island paradise
of relaxation and healthy living. With a choice of restaurants offering a variety of local delicacies and international cuisine, first class fitness facilities and a range of
tropical spa
treatments, from massages and  aromatherapy to body wraps and exfoliating scrubs. The island itself holds a certain
untouched charm
, with buildings unchanged since colonial times, and is perfectly located for diving.
Secluded coves, pristine beaches and
stunning bays
are just some of the highlights of St Lucia, home to SpaDreams
luxury detox
, health and
fitness programmes
. With
specialist support
from our hotel partner's friendly team, you can kick start a new lifestyle in an
colourful haven
of exciting fitness activities, tasty dishes and endless sunshine!
