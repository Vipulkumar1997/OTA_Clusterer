Fasting Programmes
Purify your body

Introduction to Fasting
SpaDreams offers
various fasting programmes
which are tremendously popular in
Europe
and have a great impact on those who undertake them. Fasting does not mean that you
stop eating
entirely, but rather that you reduce the amount you eat for a short period of time,
reducing
your
overall calorie
intake. The details vary from programme to programme.
Fasting
and
detox
are often seen as synonymous, as they use similar methods and achieve similar outcomes. However,
fasting aims
at weight loss, whilst
detox
programmes
focus
on the purification of the body.

Fasting According to Dr. Buchinger
Dr. Otto Buchinger is
known
as the pioneer of
medical fasting
and his methods are
extremely popular
. The Buchinger fast begins with 'preparation days' to allow your body to prepare itself for the coming fast, and to ease into a
different way
of
eating
. Programmes usually
last
for around
14

days
, although this can be altered to suit the needs of individual guests.
Buchinger fasting offers a holistic cure for both mind and body. It is recommended for the following conditions:
Obesity
Type 2 diabetes
Stress
High blood pressure
Skin diseases
Joint Rheumatism
Metabolic Syndrome


F.X. Mayr Cure
Another
popular
fasting programme was created by the Austrian doctor Franz Xaver Mayr. He observed his patients, comparing their digestive organs to the roots of trees, stating that diseases occur because we eat too much, too fast or too late in the evening. The F.X. Mayr cure
follows a strict
daily routine, focusing on the relief & detoxification of the gastro-intestinal system, using
more ingredients than Buchinger
.
The therapy focuses on the stomach, and flushes out any toxins from the body within the first few days. Guests undertaking an F. X. Mayr cure are not allowed to do the following:
Eat snacks between meals
Eat after 6pm
Drink coffee, alcohol or any fizzy pop
Eat raw foods
Drink fluids 1/2 hour before or after any meal
The fundamental principle of a Mayr cure is that a healthy digestive system is crucial for a healthy body.


Schroth Cure
This medically recognised treatment stimulates a complete body cleansing process and a
feeling
of
regeneration
. This fasting cure was developed by Johann Schroth in the 19th Century and has evolved to suit modern day demands. The treatment is
highly individual
and focuses on activating the healing powers of each individual person's body to help improve general health, the metabolic system and digestive system.
There are
4 main elements
to a Schroth Cure:
The Fasting Diet: Reducing calorie intake is a vital factor with any fasting programme. A Schroth diet is free from animal protein, salts and fats.
Body Wraps: All guests receive a full body wrap which stimulates the body's metabolism and makes the cleansing process more effective
Regulated Fluid Intake: Spa water, teas, and fruits are prescribed during the diet to induce a rhythmic change to fluid intake. This is important for body drainage.
Exercise and Rest: Exercise for the body and relaxation for the mind form part of this cure.


Kneipp Cure
This fasting cure involes a
high protein intake
(around 800 calories)
combined
with various health treatments. It consists of
4 different elements
:
Exercise therapy: Exercises such as hiking, swimming, bicycling. Aiming to strengthen the immune systems whilst fasting with food.
Nutritional therapy: Support to help you consume a minimal calorie intake whilst consuming more nutrients and protein.
Hydrotherapy: This improves circulation and allows you to detoxify and relax.
Evaluation of your life: Another crucial part of Kneipp fasting involves taking the time to reflect on your lifestyle and to consider restructuring your life in order to achieve a better balace and find peace.


Fruit Fasting
Fruit fasting is a
very common
fasting method and an easy way to
begin
cleansing the system. If you are considering a fast to lose weight method, a fruit diet may be a
beneficial
option for you. As with most fasting programmes, the
main aim
is to
improve
well-being, metabolism and immune system. Fruit fasting is an
excellent method
for those who have never done any fasting before. It is known to
benefit
your
mind
,
body
and
spirit
. It also
detoxifies
your body and gives you
new
and fresh
outlook
on
life
.

How To Fast Safely
When done safely, fasting can have a fantastic impact on both your physical and mental health. However, if fasting is not done correctly it can have negative effects. You must consult your GP/doctor before embarking on a fasting holiday, to ensure that you are physically healthy enough. Children and pregnant women should never go on a fasting holiday.
