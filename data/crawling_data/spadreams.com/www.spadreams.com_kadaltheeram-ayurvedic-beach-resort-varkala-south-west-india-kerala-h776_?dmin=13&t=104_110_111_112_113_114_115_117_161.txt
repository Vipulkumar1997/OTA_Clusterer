Top tips from our customers


‘In the morning the fishermen bring in the nets ashore on the beach just infront of the resort. In February and March, there are many small temple festivals in the neighboring villages, where you can see parades with drum groups, floats and elephants. You can quickly get to the tourist center of Varkala cliff or Helipad by tuk-tuk’



‘watch the fishermen in the neighbourhood to the left as they set sail’
