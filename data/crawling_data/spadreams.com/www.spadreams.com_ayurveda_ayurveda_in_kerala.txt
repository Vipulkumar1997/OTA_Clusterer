Ayurveda in Kerala
Authentic Ayurveda in the beautiful Indian state















Search








Introduction to Ayurveda in Kerala
Ayurveda in Kerala is one of our
most popular
holiday themes.
Kerala
is a
popular destination
for Ayurveda holidays, combining well-developed accommodation and beautiful natural settings with a strong tradition of Ayurveda.
Detailed information
about Ayurveda can be found here:
Ayurvedic Medicine
- find out what Ayurveda is all about.
Panchakarma
- learn about the classic healing and detoxifying Ayurvedic treatment.
Ayurvedic Treatments
- see what kind of wellness treatments you can expect from an Ayurvedia holiday in Kerala

Kerala as a destination for Ayurveda
Kerala is a
state of India
located in the
south-west part
of the country. Kerala enjoys easy access to the ocean – the
coastline of Kerala
is almost 600 km (370 miles) long! Ayurveda in Kerala is a great choice if you want to
enjoy original treatments
in tranquil, natural surroundings. Kerala offers many stunning
natural attractions
such as the famous backwaters, sandy beaches, waterfalls and picturesque hills.
Best known
as the most developed state of India with high quality travel and tourism infrastructure,
Kerala
is especially attractive for
Ayurveda enthusiasts
as it is more peaceful than many other popular destinations in
India

such as
Goa
or
Rajasthan
.

Ayurveda Holidays in Kerala
There is a
long tradition
of Ayurveda in Kerala, so many resorts and retreats
offer authentic treatments
by experienced specialists. Ayurveda in Kerala is available in
small affordable retreats
offering a homely atmosphere and
dedication
to the
treatments
, as well as in
five-star resorts
, which provide
professional ayurvedic

cures
and
ultimate luxury
at the same time.


Essential Travel Information
Ayurveda
in
Kerala
is a
great idea
if you would like to travel to the sources of authentic ayurveda, however such a
long journey
requires proper preparation. You can find the
essential travel information
here.
The foreign policy of India changes quite often, therefore it is necessary to
check updates
on visa requirements. At the moment most foreign visitors need a visa, which, in many cases, can be obtained quickly via an online application.
In Kerala there are
two major
international
airports
– Cochin and Trivandrum. Most of the SpaDreams hotels offer transfers and they are often included in the price of
2-3 week
ayurvedic cures.
Most flights from
Europe
to
Kerala
involve at least
one layover
(usually in the Middle East, Sri Lanka or Mumbai) and the arrival time is likely to be
before
the
check-in time
(morning). You have to plan your itinerary
carefully
– it is likely that you will depart from your country on one day and
arrive
in
India
in the morning (according to the local time) next day. To
avoid waiting
in the
hotel lobby
, it is worth booking an
additional night
to make sure that the room is ready for you. Usually the departures take place
late at night
so you have to be
prepared
for an early check-out when you leave.
There are
no strict health requirements
and
no vaccinations
are
compulsory
. However you may want to
consider
visiting a
general practitioner
and asking about possible
climate impact
on your
health
and about
vaccines
against
hepatitis
and
malaria
.
