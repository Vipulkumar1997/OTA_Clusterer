Please note:
From September to the end of April 2018, construction work will take place at the neighboring property of the hotel. This will be affected by all Lux rooms as they are located on this site. In addition, a few economy rooms are on the site, but the hotel tries to accommodate all guests who have booked economy in rooms that are not located on the construction site.
