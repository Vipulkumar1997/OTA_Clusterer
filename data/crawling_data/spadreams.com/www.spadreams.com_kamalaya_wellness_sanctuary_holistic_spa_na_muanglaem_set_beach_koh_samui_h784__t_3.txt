Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary & Holistic Spa in detail


The Island

☀
Koh Samui,
Thailand’s third largest island, lies roughly 700 km south of Bangkok in the Gulf of Thailand. The popular holiday destination offers activities such as diving, golf, hiking, fine beaches, temples and lots more. The rainy season is approximately from mid October to mid December.

Your Hotel

Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary & Holistic Spa Resort,
located on the beaches of Laem Set on the "quieter" southern side of the tropical island, is roughly 30 minutes by car from Chaweng. Kamalaya is built around a natural cave, which still looks as though buddhist monks have been returning here for centuries. Even today this special atmosphere can be felt everywhere and the area offers the best environment to escape from everyday stress and strains and to rediscover oneself.

How You Reside

24 hillside rooms
(ca 35 sq.m) with a panoramic view over the garden, with four further rooms without balcony or vista. 10 Suites (ca 65 sq.m) and 26 villas (ca 75 - 215 sq.m) position themselves perfectly within the landscape with rocks, trees and streams. All are en-suite with either shower/bath (partly open), towels, hair dryer, safe, air conditioning, tee/coffee maker, mini-bar, CD-Player, telephone, internet connection and most also have a balcony and sea view. Suites and villas in addition also have a terrace. All rooms have high-quality, modern but clasically styled furniture made from natural woods which are combined with bright fabrics to create a pleasant and friendly atmosphere.
Single rooms are double rooms
for single occupancy.
