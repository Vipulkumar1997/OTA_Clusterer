Authentic, Effective Fango Treatments in Italy
Welcome to Italy, the home of delicious cuisine, world-renowned art and

Fango mud

treatments!
Immerse yourself in the Italian tradition of
Fango
, which dates back to the Roman Empire, and experience the extraordinary healing qualities of this mineral-rich mud at our

Fango hotels in Italy
.
Soak up the sunshine and enjoy the warm hospitality of the Italians as you relax, rejuvenate and recuperate.
Fango treatments will work wonders
for people suffering from osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, cellulite, acne, scars, psoriasis, dry skin, joint and muscular pain and other diseases which stem from problems with locomotor system and skin.
The
Euganean Hills
are known for being Italy's largest Thermal Region. The salt-bromine-iodine waters, which flow in a large area to the north-eastern margin of the Euganean Hills, bear thermo-mineral properties which are
unique
in the world and are used for both therapeutic and aesthetic treatments. Experience authentic Fango treatments at the elegant
Ermitage Bel Air Medical Hotel
, situated in the midst of the stunning Euganean Hills, or
indulge yourself in the luxury spa sessions
on offer at the
Abano Grand Hotel
, which combines modern comforts with traditional Italian culture. With over 35 Fango hotels in Italy, SpaDreams can find the ideal destination for you.
Fango treatment is a form of heat therapy (thermotherapy). Another popular type of heat therapy is
balneotherapy

with use of
thermal waters
available for example at
Roman Thermal Spas of Europe
in Italy and beyond.
