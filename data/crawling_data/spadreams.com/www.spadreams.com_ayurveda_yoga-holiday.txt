Yoga Holidays: Body, Mind and Soul
Originating in India and believed to have been developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BC, yoga has been slowly integrated into the Western world and is now a
popular
form of
exercise
, known primarily for improving
flexibility
,
strength
and
posture
. Each yoga pose focuses on a
different muscle
, building strength all over your body and increasing your bodily awareness. Yoga
means
"Unity" and "Harmony", in Sanskrit the word "Yoga" is used to signify any form of connection. The
breathing techniques
required to master the art of yoga have a
relaxing
,
meditative
effect and yoga has been proven to
lower blood pressure
and
slow the heart rate
, which is
beneficial
for people with high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke sufferers.
Experience all of these health benefits with our yoga holidays! SpaDreams has
plenty of yoga holidays
on offer from luxury resorts to
yoga retreats
, giving us the opportunity to create your ideal package. Check out our
medical conditions page

and
yoga guide
to see how yoga can help you.
With SpaDreams you can visit the most
beautiful places
for your
yoga holiday:
Practice your yoga exercises on the dream beaches of
Bali
and
Thailand
. Visit spiritual temples, just let yourself go and enjoy your break from everyday life.
Also in
Europe
, destinations such as Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and of course Germany, offer yoga holidays to break through the daily grind. Or experience an unforgettable
yoga holiday
in the heart of the Alps in Switzerland. Alone or in a group, you can experience the
journey
to your
inner center
.
In Indian tradition, yoga has a far greater spiritual and
meditative focus
than in its Westernised form. By combining a yoga holiday with an

Ayurveda journey
, you can experience the immense
power
of a
holistic cure
, as well as all of the health benefits of a traditional yoga holiday.
