Good to know

The philosophy of the Yoga Vidya house

The Yoga Vidya house is a Yoga workshop house in which Yoga, meditation and spirituality are being taught, lived and passed on according to Indian tradition. There is no daily room service. The dining room works as a self-service facility. The staff and the guests live without alcohol and cigarettes (or any kind of smoking). A truly important aspect of Yoga is the attentive contact with nature and all living creatures. This is the reason why the cuisine is fully vegetarian. In the entire house there is an interactive cooperation and our staff is here for you with much love and idealism.

Our opinion

For Yoga enthusiasts and those, who would like to become Yoga enthusiasts, there may possibly not be a wider range of courses and offers and speeches on Yoga as here in the Teutoburger Forest, in a absolute authentic, modern and friendly surrounding. The combination with Ayurveda treatments enriches the offer sustainably.
