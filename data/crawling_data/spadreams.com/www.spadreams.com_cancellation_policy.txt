Cancellation Policy





Cancellation Policy for Gift Vouchers
You have the right to request a refund for unused gift vouchers without giving reason within the 14 day cancellation period.
The cancellation period commences from the moment you place your order until 14 days after placing the order.
To refund a gift voucher either write to us at SpaDreams, Ferdinand-Happ-Str. 28, 60314 Frankfurt am Main, Germany , email us at info@spadreams.com or fax us at: 069-405885903 to register your written request for a refund.
To qualify for a refund, it is sufficient that the written request for the refund of gift vouchers is received within the 14 day cancellation period.

Refund Procedure
Your full refund along with any delivery charges (with the exception of additional charges for non-standard delivery options) will be processed within 14 working days of our receipt of your written request for a refund. Refund payments will be made by the same method used for the original purchase, unless otherwise agreed. In no instance will additional fees or interest be paid. We may decline the refund until receipt of the returned goods (in this case the gift voucher) or receipt of proof of postage, depending which is received first.
