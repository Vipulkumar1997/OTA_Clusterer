Europe - The Home of Detox and Cleansing
SpaDreams offers a vast range of detox diet packages, many of which take place in our
luxury resorts
in
Europe
. Detoxing in Europe allows you to experience all the
benefits
of detoxing whilst enjoying
European culture
and stunning natural settings. As the expert teams of
nutritionists
at our resorts
across Europe
specialise in different variants of well-known detox diets, SpaDreams can find the
ideal detox

diet
for you. Most of our
detox programmes
include thermal water, fasting juice, hiking, nordic walking, fasting therapy, yoga and many more, designed to help you make long-term changes
towards
a
healthy lifestyle
.

Why Detox in Europe?
Europe
is
well-known
as the
home
of many
wellness
and
health centres
, and detoxing is a central part of this. Germany, Hungary, Spain and Portugal are amongst our
most popular
detoxing destinations. With
highly professional
specialist services, top-class facilities and splendid accommodation on offer, Europe is undoubtedly the
best place
for traditional
detoxing
and
fasting
.

How will a Detox Holiday in Europe Help You?
Removing
toxins
from the body is vital, as
long exposure
to these toxins
affect the metabolism
, immune system and can lead to numerous diseases.
Detoxing can
aid
with
weight loss
and
help prevent
other health problems related to weight issues, such as heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes. A detox programme
rids
the body of the
toxins
which affect the body's ability to deal with these issues,
strengthening
the immune system and
fighting infections
.

Alternatives to Western Detox in Europe
If you are searching for an
alternative
cleansing method, our
Ayurveda retreats
offer detoxing treatments in the form of an
Ayurveda cure
.
Ayurveda
is an
ancient Indian healing system
designed to bring harmony to your body and mind. Staying at an Ayurveda retreat can help you to understand how your body works, learn which food groups are suitable for your constitution and discover inner-peace.
Travel to
India
or
Sri Lanka
to experience
original Ayurvda
in its motherland, or undertake one of our authentic
Ayurveda cures in Europe
.
