Welcome to Africa!
From the tropical rainforests of Central Africa to the boundless dunes of the Sahara, the populous and picturesque Savannah in the East to rugged mountains, snow decked peaks and vivid green plains -
Africa sparkles with diversity.
As well as being the
oldest known place of origin of human life
, Africa is home to an endless number of species of wild animals. Observe herds of zebras, giraffes and African elephants in their natural habitat, the Serengeti Plain, or search for lions, leopards and rhinos on a safari trip at one of the myriad National Parks and nature reserves in
South Africa
.

Treat yourself to a well deserved break with an oriental flair in
Tanzania
,
Tunisia
or
Morocco
, where
colours and cultures blend together to form a magical atmosphere
. Take a trip through picturesque olive gardens and fragrant orchards, dip your toes in azure blue waters or stretch out in the sun on pure white beaches. With exotic treatments and high quality thalasso cures on offer, you will leave your holiday in Africa with a new sense of
energy and vitality
.

Culture lovers can hop on the back of a camel and discover the architectural and cultural sights of the deserts and savannah. Explore the
spectacular sights
of the Giza pyramid complex and the magnificent valleys of the kings. Get active with splendid walking tours through lush jungles, golden banana plantations or artistically designed vineyards. Feel as beautiful as Cleopatra with
luxurious wellness and beauty treatments
in
Egypt
, where you can truly relax and indulge yourself.
Discover the
endless beauty
of the world's second largest continent - book your holiday in Africa with SpaDreams today!
