Experts since 1975
Experience and tradition






40 years ago ...
… Herbert Haum founded Fit Reisen, the parent company of SpaDreams, creating a unique concept: holidays for health and wellbeing complete with attractive beauty, activity and leisure offers. Our first Fit Reisen catalogue with the tagline “Holidays and Health Treatments” was launched in 1976 to attract health-conscious travellers.

Our first offers …
...included Kneipp, Schroth, F.X. Mayr and regenerative treatments, as well as programmes promoting active leisure and healthy nutrition. Our most exclusive offers, such as holidays in Italy touring festivals in Verona and undertaking fango treatments in Abano also turned out to be extremely popular.

In 1987 …
...a meaningful cooperation with Lufthansa airlines allowed our guests enjoy health & wellness holidays in well-known spa resorts in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Czechoslovakia, France, Spain and Italy.  In response to the incredible interest of the customers from the Middle East countries (especially from Kuwait) after issuing our catalogue in English, we launched a complete version in Arabic!

The combination of health treatments and wellness holidays ...
...has always been our unique selling point in Germany, where we have established our position as a pioneer in the health tourism segment. By 1993, we had started cooperation with Ayurvedic retreats in Sri Lanka to diversify our range of offers and add Ayurveda and yoga to our rich portfolio of health beauty, fitness, fasting and detox holidays.

The year 2009 …
...brought a generational change! When our founder Herbert Haum retired, the business was taken over by the entrepreneurs Jan Seifried and Dr Nils Asmussen, supported by the long standing general manager Claudia Wagner who kept her position on the board.

From 2011 onwards …
...we have quickly developed our company into a global player offering services in 10 languages and selling holidays in 30 different markets. That could be one of the reasons why we were awarded the prize for “The Most Innovative Health Tour Operator" in July 2014. We find it a special honour as we are an “old hand” in the field of health and wellness tourism.

Today …
...our success is reflected not only in the diversity of our holidays, matching the newest trends and changing needs of our customers, but also in the exceptional price-quality ratio of the of our offers, and the unparalleled expertise and highly individual customer service provided by our team.
