Morocco
A kaleidoscope of culture















Search








Welcome to Morocco!
You lay your head back and look up into the sparkling splendor of the night sky. It is quiet. The nomad tent behind you radiates a pleasant and exotic scent of freshly brewed mint tea and various oriental spices. From the
steppe-like plateau
on which you are staying, you can look up to the distinctive mountain ranges of the snow-capped
Atlas Mountains
.
From peaceful countryside and vast stretches of desert to jewel-like cities and ancient Medina quarters, Morocco is
smorgasbord of culture and cuisine
, where African and Arabic influences blend together in a country unlike any other on Earth. Cuddle up to cheerful camels, browse an
array of treasures
at bustling  markets and sample flavourful tajines. Home to two world heritage sites and some of the
world's most striking landscapes
, Morocco will delight your senses and invigorate your soul.
Unleash your adventurous side and discover Morocco's
rugged mountainous landscapes
with a guided trek past
magnificent waterfalls
and across lofty peaks, or take a trip to one of Morocco's
astounding cities
. Explore the
labyrinthine souqs
of Marrakesh, where you'll
discover oriental carpets
adorning the sides of stalls, herbal teas of every colour glistening in ornate glasses and a
myriad of spices
mingling in the air, creating a uniquely Moroccan scent.
Our hotels in Morocco offer the finest
exotic treatments
, from speciality steam baths (hammam) to donkey milk baths, as well as more conventional body massages, peelings, manicures and pedicures. Harness the power of the sea by undertaking a thalasso therapy treatment. Designed to revitalise your body, fight fatigue and tone your muscles, our
thalasso hotels
in Morocco utilise
natural minerals
from the sea to leave you feeling refreshed and ready to take on the world.
