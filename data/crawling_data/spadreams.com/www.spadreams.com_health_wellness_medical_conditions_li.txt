Professional, Effective Cures at the Best Price Guaranteed
Health and wellness have always been at the heart of our business, and
medical wellness
is definitely the area where we excel. We offer unparalleled
expertise
and an array of premium
medical wellness resorts
, with a
wide range
of
safe
and
effective treatments
.
In
1975
, when the first European tour operators were developing their businesses based on typical package holidays, the founder of our parent company
established
the unique idea of offering
health spa holidays
. Even today there are very few other tour operators specialising purely in
health
and
wellness
. As a pioneer of health and
spa holidays
, we take great care when choosing our medical wellness hotels to make sure that all the treatments we offer are of the
highest quality
. Most of our
spa hotels
offering
medical wellness
gather from the abundance of natural resources available locally, such as peat and
mud
,

thermal waters
,

thalasso
(sea) products, sulphur and radon from natural sources, herbs and essential oils.
Our favourite destinations for
medical wellness
in
Europe
are the traditional spa towns in the
Czech Republic
,
Hungary
and
Slovakia
(thermal cures),
Poland

(cures by the Baltic Sea) the Abano region in
Italy
(fango treatments) and the spa towns in the highlands and Alpine foothills of
Germany
(Kneipp therapy, thermal cures). A unique medical wellness destination is the

Dead Sea
(cures for skin and rheumatic diseases) where the
climate
is especially
beneficial
for those
suffering
from
psoriasis
or
eczema
.
Our
customer service team
undertake regular training to ensure that they have a
deep understanding
of
all
of our
products
, and we are
happy
to
answer
all of your
questions
. Call us today to find the
right cure
for you!
