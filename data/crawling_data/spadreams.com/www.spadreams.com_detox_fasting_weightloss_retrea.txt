achieving
your
weight loss goals
.
Our vast range of weight loss retreats spans from
Europe
to
Asia
and includes over
100 different programmes
, from modern
fasting cures
in luxury hotels to ancient
Ayurveda treatments
in havens of tranquillity.

How can Detox or Fasting Help Achieve My Weight Loss Goal?
The words "
detox
" and "
fasting
" are often considered synonymous, however this is not the case. Although
both
practices
aim
to
purify
the
body
, detoxing focuses on getting rid of harmful substances in the body, whilst
fasting
refers to abstaining from food. The
build up of toxins
in the body is one of the
key aspects
of modern day life that can
lead to weight gain
.
Our detox and fasting based weight loss retreats focus on teaching guests how to change their lifestyles and develop healthy habits to enable
long term
, sustainable weight loss. Undertake a
high-quality cure
in a
stunning setting
and take the first step towards discovering a
new you
!

How can a Luxury Holiday Help Achieve My Weight Loss Goal?
Our luxury
weight loss retreats
offer a
wide range
of programmes designed to help you lose weight in
absolute comfort
. From slimming spa treatments to first-class fitness facilities, these weight loss retreats have everything you'll need to lose weight in style!
Surrounded
by
luxury
and with the help of the
highly supportive teams
at our partner weight loss retreats, you'll be in the right spot to
start
your
fitness journey
and learn how to make simple swaps to
live
a
healthier lifestyle
.

How can an Ayurvedic Cure Help Achieve My Weight Loss Goal?
As a holistic cure,
Ayurveda
focuses on
improving
general wellbeing and weight loss is usually a pleasant
additional
treat. However, several of our partner
Ayurveda retreats
also offer specialised weight loss programmes, which use
knowledge
of Ayurveda to create a
specialised
meal plan and
treatment schedule
. Programmes at these retreats will teach you how to maintain a
successful diet
and the exercises you should be doing in order to obtain and maintain a healthy weight.
