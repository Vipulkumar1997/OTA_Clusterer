Plan Your Ideal Holiday with our Special Travel Themes
With a holiday from SpaDreams, there is something for everyone. We set up each holiday specifically to meet the needs of each client.  There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all holiday.  We aim to tailor each holiday offer to the
taste preferences
, physical abilities, family needs, and leisure preferences of our clients.  Some may call these kinds of specially designed holidays
bespoke
, we simply call them fun!
The SpaDreams booking process always begins with the client's goals in mind.  What do you want to achieve on your holiday? For some it may be to
detox
and return home healthier than ever.  For others, the only goal is to enjoy some
romantic time
with their significant other.  Whatever your special travel need, we’ll do everything we can to create a
handmade holiday
just for you.

Family Friendly or Adults Only
Are you looking for a place where the
kids can run free
and truly be a kid?  Or perhaps you’re looking for the exact opposite, a chance to take a break from the pitter-patter of little feet.  A chance to enjoy some
romantic
time alone in an
Adults Only Holiday
atmosphere.
If the kids will be in tow, then be sure to book one of our
family friendly resorts
.  Many of which offer children’s activity centres, children’s meals, and even better child discounts! If the kids are staying home or there are no kids to speak of, then indulge is some
adults only relaxation
in the
spa
or by the pool.
Finally, let’s not forget the pets!  With a SpaDreams
pet friendly resort
there is no need to leave our four legged loved ones behind.
Bring your pet
with you for even more amazing family holiday memories.

Barrier Free and Handicap Accessible
When simply getting around takes extra effort every day, it can sometimes feel stressful just to consider visiting a new, unknown place.
Will there be a lift?  Will there be a ramp? With a SpaDreams
Accessible Holida
y you can rest assured that the stay you are booking is made just for you.  Take the lift directly from your room to the spa and enjoy some well-deserved
pampering
.

Travelling Solo
Is it time to get away from everything related to the daily grind?  Then
pack your bags
and jet off for an
amazing holiday
perfect for the
solo traveller
!  Our SpaDreams Solo Holidays are selected based on a combination of accommodations, spa and resort programming, safety and security, and
leisure activities
.
There is nothing to fear with a SpaDreams solo holiday.  Worried about boredom? No need, book a premium programme and your schedule will be full before you arrive.  Worried about Loneliness? With our Solo friendly trips, there are plenty of other solo travellers to chat with.   Still not sure?  Then book one of our
group programmes
programmes and you’ll be placed as part of a group retreat.  There are group
yoga retreats
as well as group
detox & diet retreats
to choose from!

Special Meals
Select your
perfect holiday
and know right away there will be meals for you!  Planning a holiday as a
vegan
, vegetarian,
gluten-free
, or even
diabetic
friendly can be a lot of effort.  But sit back and relax and let your meals be prepared for you, just the way you need.  Being a vegan on holiday shouldn’t mean going without.  If are on or looking to start a food combining diet, we’ve got resorts that will be perfect for you.

Activities
Let’s face it, for you there is no such thing as a holiday without your
favourite activity
.   It may even be that your main motivation to travel is to focus on your
golf-swing
, with a relaxing
golf break
.  Or perhaps you’ve got your mind set on a trip to Kerala for a deep
yoga & mediation retreat
.   Ready to lace up your
hiking boots
?  Break out the trekking poles and get ready for an idyllic Nordic
Trekking Holiday
.   Even gym rats will be satisfied when the book a resort with a
gym on-site
.
If you havn’t seen your
special request
on our list yet, don’t fret!  SpaDreams is here to help.  Contact our knowledgeable customer service team today and begin planning your
tailor made holiday
today.
