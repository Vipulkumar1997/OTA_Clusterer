cope
with in

unique flair
of Sri Lanka attracts travellers longing for a
journey to the inner self
.
The Ayurvedic detox cure
Panchakarma
originated in India, however it holds a
special place
in Sri Lankan culture and is
used
alongside
conventional medicine
to cure many conditions. Unlike in India, where Ayurveda was banned during the British colonisation, Ayurveda has evolved without interuption in Sri Lanka for over 5,000 years and many families in India and Sri Lanka have their
own secret recipes
for Ayurvedic herbal products and dishes used for a
detox treatment
.
Sri Lanka provides an i
nteresting alternative
to the typical Ayurveda detox treatments in
India
