Find Sancutary at Our Detox Retreats
At our
detox retreats
you can take a
step back
from everyday life and get
rid
of accumulated
toxins
in your
body
. A stay at a detox retreat will
help
your body to
gain vitality
and
new energy
as well as
strengthening
your
mind
and allowing you to
regain emotional balance
.

Western Detox
Europe is the
best place
for a
Detox Retreat
based on the teachings of the
masters
of
therapeutic fasting
:
J. Schroth – the Schroth Cure (wine, body wraps, water and exercises)
F. X. Mayr – originally simple milk & bread fasting, now a modern cure
S. Kneipp – hydrotherapy (water therapy ) and balneotherapy (bathing therapy)
O. Buchinger  – juice fasting
Thanks to the
research
of the
European naturopaths
, fasting has gained an entirely
new dimension
over the years. Before these findings, fasting was
mainly associated
with religious asceticism. The methods invented by

Schroth
,
Mayr
,
Kneipp

and
Buchinger

have evolved into modern cures, however the principles of the treatments have been remained the same. The
main principles
of the cures inspired all kinds of
fasting
and
detox cures
which became
popular
in
Europe
and in the rest of the "Western" world. The
original cures
are available primarily in
detox retreats
in
Germany
, Austria and Hungary.

Eastern Detox
In the Far East detoxing was
discovered
a
long time ago
as a cure for
various diseases
. Ayurvedic teachings are
believed
to be based on the
teachings
of Indian God Brahma from 1700-1100 BC. The vedas (holy texts) are the
source
of the
ayurvedic practice
.
The most popular Ayurvedic cure is
Panchakarma
, which literally means
five actions
(for purification). Panchakarma is a complex, individual detoxifying cure with treatments and diet which match the patient’s
type
of
constitution
. Ayurvedic recipes for dishes, cosmetics and medicines
vary depending
on the region where the
detox retreat
is
located
.
India

and
Sri Lanka

are the prime destinations for original cures, however we also offer
several authentic
Ayurvedic cures in Europe
.
