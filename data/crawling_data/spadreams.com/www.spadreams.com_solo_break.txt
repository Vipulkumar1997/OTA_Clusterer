Indulge In Alone Time
Sometimes it is not always the case to go on a holiday with friends or family. However, those who do not want to miss out on
company and new friends
are in the right place with SpaDreams.
How about, for example, an active

Nordic Walking Holiday
, an authentic
Ayurvedic Holiday
or a fitness stay in a golf spa hotel? In addition to long walks, a culinary variety and relaxing spa treatments, you have the opportunity to talk and chat with like-minded people.
Even in our
Medical Wellness Hotels

you are not alone - the success is much greater among like-minded people. If you plan a
weight loss treatment
, you will find not only motivation among the other guests, but also the opportunity to talk about success and failure.
During a

Yoga Holiday
, you can choose between courses being performed in a group or individually. Experience the soothing movements that bring body, mind and soul in harmony and create more balance. Under the motto "Traveling alone - together with cures" you can get to know new people during a
group travel
. A
fasting hike
with a set group goal brings more success, according to experience, rather than being alone. Here you will find the perfect offers, such as the use of double rooms as a
single room
without any extra fees, a
coach
who always stands by your side and a
group table
to enjoy the meals.
If you want to be more active, you will get your money's worth with the
Active Leisure Holidays
and
Fitness
&
Spa Wellness Holidays
.
Therapeutic cures in Bulgaria, Thalasso therapies in Portugal, Ayurvedic cures in India or back pain relieving days in Germany - at SpaDreams, every single traveler will surely find what they are looking for and can enjoy a
relaxing holiday
, while doing something for their health and
recharging their batteries
.
