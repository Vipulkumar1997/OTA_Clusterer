Fango Mud - Rich in minerals for natural healing
Fango Mud is special mud of volcanic origin, which is rich in minerals and sulphur, and used in treatments that nourish, revitalise, tone, and energise the skin and body. The natural healing properties of this very special mud can work wonders when combined with
warmth and relaxation
, and has been used for centuries as a natural healing cure.
If you are suffering from osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, cellulite, acne, scars, psoriasis, dry skin or joint and muscular pain then a Fango treatment could be the answer to your problems. Treatments vary in duration and temperature, and are always tailored to provide the perfect treatment for your complaint. Our
SpaDreams Fango Guide
contains everything you need to know about Fango mud and its healing properties.
Venture to
Italy, the home of Fango
, to experience authentic Fango treatments in their place of origin, or visit one of our
Fango hotels in Germany or Slovenia
. From luxury hotels to cosy retreats, our expert customer service team can help you find the right hotel to suit your needs. With the SpaDreams Best Price Guarantee you can be sure that you are getting top quality Fango treatments at the best possible price.
