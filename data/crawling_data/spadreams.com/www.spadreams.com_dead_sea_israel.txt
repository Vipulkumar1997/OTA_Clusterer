Organisation of the Week in Israel
Sunday is a weekday in Israel. All works stop at sunset on Friday until sunset on Saturday. Saturday is the day of rest (Shabbat). The service at hotels is reduced during this period.
Currency
In Israel the currency is Israeli New Shekel (ILS). 1 GBP = approx. 6 ILS.
Entry Requirements
You do not need a visa for a tourist stay in Israel, however your passport has to have a validity of at least 6 months from the date of your entry to Israel. Current information can be found at:
https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel/entry-requirements

Security
Due to the tensions in the occupied Palestinian territories, it is important to check up to date information and possible warnings for tourists at:
www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/israel.

Conventions and Customs
Outside religious sites, in the hotels and surrounding beaches, you are allowed to dress in regular clothing.
Although food and drink will still be served in hotels during Ramadan, you should avoid eating, drinking and smoking in public places out of courtesy.
When visiting religious sites such as Jerusalem, you are not allowed to wear shorts. Women must cover arms and hair (e.g. with a scarf) and public displays of affection are forbidden. Be extra vigilant when using public transport and when visiting religious sites.
For more information please see the FCO website:
