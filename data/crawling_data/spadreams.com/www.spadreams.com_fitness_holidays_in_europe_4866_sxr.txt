The finest fitness facilities on the continent
Get your trainers on, it's time to get fit! With the increasing rise of sedentary lifestyles, fitness holidays are becoming a meaningful trend all over the world. Escape from everyday life and take care of your health and well-being. A fitness holiday is a fantastic opportunity to recharge your batteries, give your fitness level a boost and rediscover the energy to cope with daily challenges.
Fitness holidays in Europe are growing in popularity as spa resorts in Europe often offer exercise and activity programmes, providing the perfect balance between spa indulgence and active leisure. Most of our hotels are nestled in beautiful natural settings, which encourage guests to take part in our outdoor exercise programmes, such as hiking, nordic walking, tennis and more. Discover exciting exercises that motivate you to keep moving, and learn how to incorporate exercise into your daily life, even after you return home.
Our favourite destinations for fitness and active holidays are Germany, Hungary, Austria and Italy, and many our spa hotels in other destinations have well-equipped fitness rooms or centre, perfect for tough workouts on rainy days. If you are suffering from the effects of a sedentary lifestyle and longing for proper workout look no further and book a fitness holiday at one of our resorts in Europe.
