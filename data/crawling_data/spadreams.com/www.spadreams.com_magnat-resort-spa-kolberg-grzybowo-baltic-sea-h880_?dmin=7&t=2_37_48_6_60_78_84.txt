Magnat Resort & Spa in detail


Your Spa

☀
Kolberg
(pl: Kolobrzeg) - the famous Polish Baltic Sea Spa - was a favorite destination of merchants and nobility at the beginning of the century. The development as a seaside resort and spa town began in 1803 with the establishment of a public beach for brine and mud treatments.
