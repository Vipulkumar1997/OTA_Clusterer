Ayurveda Retreats for Better Balance and Wellbeing
Ayurvedic treatments are based on the principle that, in order to be
restored
to full health, the body must be cleansed from harmful substances i.e. external toxins and metabolic side products, which disrupt the
basic body functions
. Detoxification lies at the core of
Panchakarma
treatments – an individual cure which is especially recommended for those who
suffer
from the
negative effects
of sedentary lifestyle and
unhealthy diet
.
Ayurvedic detox treatments
begin
with a
consultation
with an Ayurveda specialist, who will determine your
type
of
constitution
and create an individual detox treatment plan, specially
tailored to suit your needs
. You will be advised on what to eat, and all guests taking part in Ayurveda detox cures will receive different dishes. Usually a buffet style, will allow everybody to select the foods
individually advised
by the
Ayurveda

doctor
.
Whilst diet is an essential part of every Ayurvedic detox treatment, unlike many other detox treatments, Panchakarma goes
far beyond nutrition
.
Yoga
and
meditation
form a crucial part of the
holistic cure
, in addition to
individually prescribed
cosmetic treatments with use of
natural remedies
such as herbs and essential oils tailored to suit your
constitution type
. Our ayurvedic detox treatments are available in
India
and
Sri Lanka
, as well as in
Europe
.
Discover your
perfect
Ayurveda
detox treatment today
