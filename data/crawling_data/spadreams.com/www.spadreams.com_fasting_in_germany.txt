Authentic Cures in The Home of Therapeutic Fasting
Are you looking for an effective treatment to boost your metabolism and feel light and healthy again? We offer a range of detox, fasting and weight loss holidays in Europe. One of the
most popular
destinations for fasting retreats is
Germany
, known as the
home of therapeutic fasting
and the
drinking cure
; Fasting according to Buchinger.
Centuries ago fasting was seen as a religious form of asceticism. Germany is known for being the
pioneers
of
therapeutic fasting
. Another popular drinking cure in Germany is the
Kneipp Therapy
, named after Sebastian Kneipp. Fasting for health is becoming increasingly popular or even fashionable as it is a natural and effective way to detoxify and lose weight. In addition to Buchinger and Kneipp’s therapies, German health and spa resorts offer also original fasting therapies according to
Franz Xaver Mayr
and
Johann Schroth
.
Fasting involves
reduced calorie intake
, but that does not indicate that you won’t have the energy for exercises or outdoor activities. Fasters often report a sense of renewed vitality, and it makes you feel revived and ready for challenges such as long walks or hikes. Germany is one of the best destinations for outdoor activities - most of our retreats offering fasting lie in
scenic locations
suitable for outdoor exercises,
yoga
,
Tai Chi
and

long walks
. Some of the most
popular destinations
for fasting are Oberstaufen (for Schroth Cure) and Bad Wörishofen (for Kneipp Therapy).
Buchinger and F.X. Mayr fasting is available in
various locations
, mainly in
small traditional spa towns
in the south, in the highlands of Hessen and Bavaria or in the alpine foothills. Discover your perfect fasting retreat with SpaDreams and take the first step towards a
new
,
healthier life
!
