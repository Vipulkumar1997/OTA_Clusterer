Welcome to Austria!
Enter an
enchanting alpine world
of majestic, snow-capped mountains, carved valleys, rolling green hills and sparkling lakes. Magnificent views are not the only attraction; Austria offers unparalleled conditions for
active leisure
– countless trails and ski slopes as well as excellent equipment rental services make Austria an
idyllic destination
for
walking
, jogging, trekking, winter sports and cycling. Combine active leisure with indulgent
spa treatments
and revitalising
beauty packages
for the
ultimate wellness experience
in Austria.
No matter which season you choose to travel, Austria has something to for everyone. Winter may be the best time to enjoy
skiing and snowboarding
, but our traditional spa resorts nestled in the mountainous regions also offer
peace and tranquillity
for relaxation seekers during the off-peak seasons.
Our carefully selected, exclusive
spa hotels
in Austria offer a wide range of spa treatments with use of natural remedies such as peat, aromatic mountain herbs or shale oil.
Charming, rustic ambience
meets top-end amenities and modern
spa interiors
, creating a unique blend of ultimate comfort and a friendly, relaxed atmosphere.
For an
exceptional holistic healing experience
in the midst of the Austrian mountains, immerse yourself in an
Ayurveda
cure in Austria. Ayurveda is an ancient art of healing that focuses on the harmony of body and mind.
Serene, fairy tale-like spa resorts
make Austria the perfect destination to forget about the hustle and bustle of everyday life, and sink into a state of physical and mental harmony.
