Discover Ayurveda Treatments

Ayurvedic treatments are health treatments which follow the teachings of Ayurveda. Each Ayurveda treatment is
individually planned
according to the
needs of the patient
and it should prescribed by a
qualified Ayurvedic doctor
. Every cure includes a
specific diet
which corresponds with the
patient's constitution type
. Along with this diet, various treatments are applied to
help balance
the substances in your
body
,
promote inner harmony
and contribute to
overall well-being
, as well as making your
body
and
mind
strong enough to combat numerous diseases. Many travelers reguarly visit Ayurvedic resorts to
benefit
from
Ayurveda treatments
, slow down, relax and find peace.
With over seventy hotels

offering Ayurvedic treatments
, SpaDreams presents you with a range unlikely to be offered by any other tour operator in Europe. We would be pleased to provide you with assistance and advice on Ayurveda treatments and help you to find the perfect destination for you.
Find out more about the different types of Ayurvedic treatments on offer at

our hotels
, or go to our

Ayurvedic

medicine page to read more about the principles of Ayurveda. Our downloadable

Ayurveda guide
will tell you everything you need to know about Ayurveda and its benefits.

Shirodhara
Shirodhara
(shiro-forehead, dhara-flow) is an Ayurvedic treatment in which
oil is poured onto the forehead
and is acknowledged as the
best-known
Ayurvedic practice. It is performed with a
special mixture
of
oil
and
herbs
. The recipes vary and some of them are
over 2,000
years
old
! The oil flow and head massage
calm
the nervous system, reduce stress and relieve headaches.





Ayurvedic Herbal Baths
Ayurvedic baths are
used
to
relax muscles
for body relaxation and revitalisation. Flowers are
often added
to the water along with
herbs
and
oils
. The pleasant aroma and warmth of the water allow for
relaxation
and
pure indulgence
.

Shiroabhyanga and Shirovasti
Apart from
Shirodhara
, there are
many other Ayurvedic treatments
which
concentrate
on the
forehead
. Two popular treatments are called
Shiroabhyanga
and
Shirovasti
. Shiroabhyanga is a
head massage
, which can be performed lying down as well as in a sitting position.
Shirovasti
is an oil
treatment
which uses a wrap to
prevent
the
oil
from
pouring down
your
face
.





Ayurvedic Wraps
Ayurvedic treatments
include
a
variety
of
wraps
and
body scrubs
, with use of
natural ingredients
which correspond to your
type
of
constitution
. Depending on the desired result,
wraps
can
cover whole body
or they be
applied
to
particular body parts
.

Ayurvedic Masks
Ayurvedic face masks work in a similar way to conventional face masks. Typical ingredients include healing clay, herbs and oils as well as other natural elements such as algae. The masks soothe, nourish, revitalise, rejuvenate and detoxify skin as well as contributing to mood enhancement and supporting Ayurvedic cures.

Netra Basti
According to Ayurveda, the
eyes
are
linked
to the
sun
, so in order to sooth eye complaints, the
Pitta Dosha
must be brought into
balance
. During a
Netra Basti treatment
, the
entire
eye socket is bathed in a pool of
warm ghee
, which has a
nourishing effect
and helps sooth itchy eyes. The treatment usually lasts between
5
and
20 minutes
.





Abhyanga
Ayurvedic medicine
relies heavily
on the use of oils, and recognises them as carriers of healing substances. There are particular oils
assigned
to each
Dosha
.
Oils
can be applied to
particular body parts
or to the
whole body
. The traditional Ayurvedic massage with
warm oils
is called
Abhyanga
.

Pinda Sveda
Massages with
hot cotton bags
filled up with
herbs
called
Pinda Sveda
are often performed by applying
two bags
simultaneously to both sides of the body, as
shown in the picture
. Sometimes
four
hands are used to give a
full body massage
. The
aim
of this Ayurveda treatment is joint and muscle relaxation, tension release and opening of pores to allow medicinal substances to be absorbed and
remove toxins
through sweating.





Yoga and Meditation in Ayurveda
In an Ayurvedic treatment,
yoga
is often
practised every day
to relax muscles and
strengthen
them through controlled use. An
Ayurvedic
holiday is a
great
opportunity to
improve
your
balace
and
experience
all of the
health benefits
of yoga. For yoga enthusiasts, a treatment in an Ayurvedic resort is a perfect opportunity to
practice
yoga in an
authentic setting
.
Meditation is used for
mental relaxation
and teaches you how to
control
your
emotions
and focuses on your body, which makes it a
fantastic supplement
to an Ayurveda treatment. Most Ayurvedic resorts
offer

group meditation once
a
week
, however it is
recommended
to meditate on your
own
as well, paying
close attention
to
posture
and
breathing
.

Diagnosis
Ayurveda treatment begins with a consultation with a specialist Ayurvedic doctor to set up your individual treatment plan. A common element is pulse diagnosis to determine your type of constitution. There are three types of constitution, Vata, Pitta or Kapha, and usually one of them is dominant.
To find out more about different types of constitution see our
introduction to Ayurveda treatments
