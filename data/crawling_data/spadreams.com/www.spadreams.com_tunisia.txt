Tunisia
Enjoy an oriental flair with a French-Arabic charm















Search








Welcome to Tunisia!
From the endless stretches of the Sahara desert in the South to the paradisiacal, fertile valleys of the North and East coasts -
Tunisia's diversity captivates its visitors
.
Not far from the tip of
Italy
,
sprawling pine forests
weave their way between rolling hills and deep, valley where fruit trees and olive gardens blossom. Indulge in a well-earned break with an
oriental twist!
Nibble on juicy dates and figs, leave your everyday life behind and relax under the warming rays of the
ethereal sunlight
that falls between the dunes.
Enjoy traditional
thalasso treatments

which utilise the natural minerals of the sea to tone and smooth the skin, giving a new sense of
energy and vitality.
If you're searching for a
more active
form of relaxation, plan a
city tour
through Tunis, Carthage and Sidi Bou Said - these three
mesmerising cities
are so close together that they can be visited in one go. Discover the glittering glamour of the
capital city
, Tunis, with its lively streets and flamboyant market stands, before visiting the ancient city of Carthage where modern
Tunisian colours
, scents and mingle with the marks of
legends of the past.
After your trip back in time, discover the epitome of French-Arabic charm in the picturesque city of Sidi Bou Said, where you'll find charming white houses with blue doors, each with their own
individual
atmosphere. Sip a tradismells tional Tunisian mint tea as you sit back and relax, enjoying
panoramic views
of the gently swirling, turquoise sea.
Discover the
magic of Tunisia
and experience cultural and culinary treasures in an oriental atmosphere.
