Welcome to South Africa!
Yawning hippos, waddling penguins, delicate hummingbirds and magnificent lions are just some of the inhabitants of this vast and varied land of rocky mountains, savannah plains and rugged coasts. For all nature lovers, South Africa is a
must-visit

haven of biodiversity
, home to over 20,000 different species of plants, 4900 types of fungi and a myriad of rare and endangered animals.
Our
spa hotels
in South Africa are a luxury oasis of serenity on the doorstep of a
stunning world of wilderness
. In the province of West Cape, nestled at the foot of the 1400m Simonsberg mountain lie the idyllic Cape Vineyards - an unexpectedly perfect spot for a
golf course
. Combining a challenging golf course with a relaxing spa break is the
epitome of health and wellness
, allowing for an energetic but fun workout with soothing treatments at the end of the day. Hot stone, Swedish and aromatic massages await you in our
luxurious spas
in South Africa as well as innovative slimming treatments and ravishing
beauty packages
.
The South African wine is known world-wide and can be sampled in our stunning resorts. Delicate flavours and
expertly cooked local and international cuisine
make up the menus at our South African hotels, and the friendly teams of staff will cater for your every wish.
