Buchinger Clinic
Therapeutic Fasting for effective results















Search








Introduction to Fasting According to Buchinger
Dr. Otto Buchinger (1878-1966) was the
pioneer of therapeutic fasting
which, thanks to him, is now regarded as an
effective healing method
. Before Buchinger's findings, fasting was associated with religious and spiritual practices. Therapeutic fasting is still often considered a
reflective
experience today, however the main
aim
is to
detoxify
the
body
.
Fasting according to Buchinger is
based
on
liquids
- light fruit and vegetable juices, vegetable broth and herbal teas. By easing guests slowly in and out of the Buchinger fasting programme, our Buchinger clinics make it possible for you to
avoid negative side effects
, such as an increased appetite, after the programme has ended.
The recommended length of a Buchinger fasting programme is at least
2
-
3 weeks
, however many of our guests start to see the
results
after just
one week
.

Typical Fasting Menu at a Buchinger Clinic: Example
Each Buchinger clinic has its own
specific meal plans
, however most of them are fairly similar. Here is an
example

meal plan
from one of our
Buchinger fasting clinics
:
