Fasting and Weight Loss made easy!
When it comes to nutrition, it's all too easy to get into bad habits. With fast food and processed junk food so widely available, it can be difficult to stay healthy whilst keeping up with the fast pace of modern day life. Whether your
aim
is to
lose weight
or simply make some
changes
to your
diet
and kick start a
new
,
healthy lifestyle
, SpaDreams is here to help with an
extensive variety
of
fasting
,

detox

and

weight loss
holidays.
Unhealthy food has a
huge impact
on our wellbeing, both physical and mental - aside from weight gain,
diabetes
and other physical risks associated with unhealthy eating, bad dietary habits have been linked to depression, poor self-esteem and anxiety. A SpaDreams detox, fasting or weight loss holiday can
help
you to
banish bad habits
, discover a
new form
of
energy
and make
long-term
,
positive lifestyle changes
!
Healthy vegetable juices
and
detox smoothies
as well as
light vegetarian soups
provide the body with
enouginerals
and
vitamins
during
detoxification
. Various "superfoods" such as
chia seeds
,
goji berries
and the well-known and newly discovered
kale
are used in the
detox treatments
.
With
fasting juices
,

fitness programmes
, cooking classes,
spa treatments
and many more offers at our hotels across the globe, SpaDreams will provide you with all the tools you need on your
journey
to a
healthier lifestyle
. All of our specialist hotels have teams of expert nutrition and fitness advisors on hand to advise and support you.
Choose from our

Ayurveda detox
for a holistic healing cure. Whatever you choose, our expert customer service team is here to help you find the
right detox programme
for you, at the best price guaranteed.
