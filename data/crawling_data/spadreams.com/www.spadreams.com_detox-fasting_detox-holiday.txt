Detox Holidays
Cleanse your body in a safe, comfortable environment

Introduction to Detox:
SpaDreams detox holidays combine
luxury accommodation
and first class facilities with exceptional quality detoxing programmes to give you all the support and comfort you need to experience the full benefits of detoxing. Whilst it is possible to detox at home, detoxing plans found online cannot always be trusted and can have an adverse effect on your health. With our
detox holiday packages
you can be sure that you are getting specialist advice and a
detox diet
that is suitable for you. Here's what you
should consider
when booking a detox holiday:

Why Should I Detox?
With processed food
dominating the supermarket shelves
and high-pressure office jobs leading to
more stressful
and
more sedentary lifestyles
, modern-day living can
result in a build up of toxins
in the body - although our bodies do have a natural detoxing system it is not always able to keep up! Even those who make a
conscious effort
to avoid unhealthy food and take regular exercise can
still be exposed
to toxins from pesticides, preservatives, environmental pollutions and other factors that are
more difficult
to control.
Heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, strokes and obesity have all been associated with an excess of such
toxins
. A detox holiday will
flush
these
toxins
out of your body, giving you a natural energy boost, aiding your metabolism, improving your immune system and restoring balance to  your digestive, nervous, and hormonal systems. Other
benefits of detox holidays
include weight loss, slowing premature aging, clearing your skin and helping

improve mental clarity
, which can aid with depression, memory loss and sleep problems.

Best Time to Go on a Detox Holiday:
As there are
several different types
of detox holiday, the best time to book one depends on the type of detox diet you would like to try. For
detox holidays in Europe
, SpaDreams recommends
March
to
August
to make the most of the summer weather.
Hot weather
is associated with light, healthy foods, as opposed to the comfort foods that so often stock our cupboards in winter.

Fasting in Europe
is particularly effective during hot weather.

Why Spring is a Good Season for a Detox Holiday?
Spring
brings a
sense
of
regeneration
, which means it's the perfect time to refresh your system! If your healthy diet has declined somewhat over winter, and you're
struggling
to
lose
the
extra pounds
piled on during the festive season, a spring detox holiday could be the
perfect way
to cleanse your body and start a
new
, healthy diet afresh.

Why Summer is a Good Season for a Detox Holiday
During the summer, the
warm weather
will help your
body
to
relax
and enter the detoxing process.
Plenty
of nutritious, healthy fruit and vegetables come into season, meaning that you'll have a
greater variety
of

juices
to choose from. The hot weather also acts as a
natural boost
as it opens your pores and causes you to sweat - a
natural way
of releasing toxins. Take
advantage
of the warmth to boost the
effectiveness
of your detox and book a
summer detox holiday
!

Possible Restrictions
A detox holiday may
not be suitable
if you suffer from
severe chronic diseases
, acute inflamatory diseases, diabetes type 1, cancer or other
serious illnesses
.
Detox holidays are
not suitable
for children and pregnant women.
If you have any doubts or concerns please consult your doctor or GP before booking a detox holiday.

How Long Should I Detox for?
The
duration
of a detox holiday can vary from a
weekend
up to a
month
of cleansing. Although the effects of a good detox can be
seen within a few days
, SpaDreams and other professionals
recommend
a
minimum of 1 week
,
ideally 2 weeks
, to achieve the
best results
.
