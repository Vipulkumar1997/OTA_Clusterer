La Badira in detail


Your Resort

How You Reside

Luxury hotel La Badira is located in the Gulf of Hammamet only 3km from the town centre. The adult-only hotel cleverly combines modern design with the historical ambience of the beginning of the 20th century. The 130 suites are orientated toward the sea in order to capture the play of light and shadows, known as “La Badira” which gives the hotel its wonderful name.
