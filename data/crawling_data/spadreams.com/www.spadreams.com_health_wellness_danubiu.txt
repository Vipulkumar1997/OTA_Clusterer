Danubius Hotels by SpaDreams

Danubius Hotels Group
is well-known as the most popular brand of health & wellness hotels in
Hungary
and the neighbouring countries. Thanks to the abundance of
thermal springs
in this part of Europe, Danubius hotels have a long spa tradition. SpaDreams offers
20 Danubius hotels in Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia
with an extensive range of packages centred on
thermal spa & wellness
.

Danubius Health Spa Resorts in Budapest, Hungary

Danubius Helia
Danubius Helia is located opposite Margaret Island, 15 min. away from the centre of
Budapest.

The hotel is equally popular among leisure and business guests, who seek relaxation in the superb spa and active leisure in the well-equipped fitness centre.
Danubius Helia offers medical wellness programmes of different durations and balneotherapy cures.

Danubius Hotel Gellért
This Danubius hotel is one of the most impressive in the Danubius Group portfolio.
The hotel has direct access to the the famous historic spa Gellért, with a magnificent, luxury interior in art nouveau style.
Danubius Gellert specialises in wellness stays, including short city breaks.

Danubius Hotels on Margitsziget
Margitsziget – Margaret Island on Danube is the home of two Danubius Resorts:
Grand Hotel Margitsziget
and
Danubius Health Spa Resort Margitsziget
located near to Danubius Helia.
Despite island location it is easy to get to the city centre from any of the hotels.
The family of Danubius resorts in this area offer typical health holidays as well as wellness & beauty stays.

Other Danubius Hotels in Hungary

Hévíz
is the home of two Danubius resorts. Both

Danubius Health Spa Resort Hévíz
and
Danubius Aqua Health Spa Resort
are in fantastic locations - very close to the famous thermal Lake Hévíz and not too far away from Lake Balaton.
Both lakes have unique properties – Lake Hévíz is the largest thermal lake in Europe and the high temperature of the water makes it suitable for bathing all year round.
Balaton is known as the “flat lake” as the water is very shallow and it is safe even for inexperienced bathers. Nearly 80 km in length, Balaton is one of the largest lakes in Europe.

Sarvar
offers two kinds of thermal springs - a saline one (temp. 83°C) and one with a high concentration of alkaline carbonates (temp. 43° C). The Danubius hotel in Sarvar

benefits from its beautiful, green surroundings and close proximity to the Nádasdy Castle, which hosts many cultural events. Danubius Sarvar offers
fasting according to Buchinger
(juice fasting), balneotherapy,
activity programmes
, healing cures for the locomotor system and
thermal cures
.

Bük
, also known under the German name Bad Bük (Bük Baths) was became established as a spa resort
in the 1960's, which is
relatively recent in comparison to other Hungarian spa resorts with traditions dating back to the time of the Roman Empire.
Danubius Health Spa Resort in Bük ensures a comfortable stay in this small, romantic town, and offers thermal wellness and a more private ambience than the well-established resorts, such as Budapest or Hévíz.

Danubius Hotels in Slovakia and Czech Republic

Danubius Hotels by SpaDreams are available in the most prominent spa resorts in Czech Republic and Slovakia - Marianskie Lazne (also known as Marienbad) located close to the German-Czech border and Piestany, 90 km north-east from the capital of Slovakia - Bratislava.
