Ayurveda in India

Ayurveda in India - Pure bliss in an Oriental Setting
Ayurveda
is becoming
increasingly popular
amongst people searching for
effective
alternative treatments. Our Ayurveda hotels in
India
combine ancient knowledge with modern luxury to provide the optimum Ayurveda
experience
.
We offer Ayurveda and
yoga
holidays in
India
and
Sri Lanka
, where Ayurvedic knowledge
originates
from.
There is
no better place
for
relaxation
in an
oriental paradise
than an

Ayurveda retreat
in India. The resorts offering Ayurvedic treatment
focus
on
Dosha
rehabilitation through authentic
cosmetic treatments
and
individual diet plans
supported by
Ayurvedic supplements
and
yoga
. Additionally, most offer specific programmes such as:
detoxification
,
stress management
and
yoga
.

Intensive Ayurvedic Cures in India
Many of our Ayurveda hotels in India offer stays exclusively for guests interested in undertaking Ayurvedic treatments such as
Panchakarma
(Ayurvedic detox). The recommended duration of such treatment is two-three weeks or more. The main aim of
Panchakarma
is to
cleanse the body
, however the treatment is
very individual
and each guest can discuss their objectives (e.g. burn-out prevention, mental balance, healthy digestive system) with an Ayurvedic doctor shortly after arrival. Intensive Ayurvedic treatments
include
full board, as the Ayurvedic diet is one of the most important parts of the therapy.
Kerala
, known as the
paradise
of
Ayurveda
, blessed with a
good
climate, and an abundance of
natural herbs
makes it the best place to enjoy a rejuvenating Ayurvedic therapy session.
Some Ayurveda
retreats
in
India
will accommodate people who are only there to support another guest and do not wish to undertake a cure themselves, however there are a few
Ayurveda retreats
that do not accept guests who are not there to
undertake
an
Ayurveda cure
.

Relax with Ayurveda in India
Light
Ayurveda in
India
is a
great option
for anybody who would like to try out
Ayurvedic spa treatments
such as massages and herbal baths. 'Relax with Ayurveda in India' offers the
perfect opportunity
to boost your
mood
and
mental balance
, as the
exotic setting
and
indulgent treatments
make you forget about
hectic daily life
. The culture of India has a unique flair and a relaxing Ayurvedic stay will allow you to
spend time
sightseeing and
exploring
.

Luxury Ayurveda in India
There in no need to compromise
comfort
for an authentic Ayurvedic cure in India.
Ayurveda
is an
integral part
of
Indian culture
and is present in the most
luxurious resorts
in India. Luxury Ayurveda hotels in India strive exclusivity in stunning and tranquil locations. A
unique
blend of
peaceful atmosphere
, Ayurvedic spa treatments and
luxurious facilities
make every luxury resort offered by SpaDreams the
ultimate dream
destination.


Good to know

The Weather in India
The monsoon season begins in the south west parts of India in late May or early June. In the rest of the country, it typically lasts from
July
to
September
(mid or late October in the northern parts).
South
India usually receives more
rainfall
than the
north
.
During the
monsoon season
, the room prices in India usually
decrease
, as many tourists prefer to enjoy sunny weather. Nevertheless, it is said that the
monsoon season
is the ideal time to undertake an
Ayurvedic cure
as the air is clear and humid. This makes the detox more effective as the pores open easily, making it easier to get rid of toxins and absorb
Ayurvedic oils
, which are frequently used for
spa treatments
.

Entry Requirements
It is very likely that you will need a visa to travel to India. As the
entry requirements
change from time to time, you should check accurate, up to date information (e.g at the
British government website dedicated to foreign travel
) before you go to India.

Money
The currency of India is Indian Rupee. 1 GBP equals approx. 9-10 INR. Tipping is
expected
. In a hotel it a
good idea
to look for a collection box for
tips
- otherwise hotel boys and other members of staff may expect a tip of
10
to
30
rupees. In a restaurant a
5-10
% tip is sufficient if there is
no service charge
indicated in the bill.

Time Management
If you fly from
Europe
to
India
it is likely that you will arrive at the hotel
early in the morning
, before check-in. It is
advised to book
an
extra night
, to avoid having to
wait at the hotel lobby
. A similar situation
may occur
if your
return flight
is
late
in the
evening
.

Health
Ayurveda is a millennia-old
art of healing
, which is suitable for
various sicknesses
and
conditions
. However, a
long journey to India
, in addition to
jet lag
and
climate

change
, may have an adverse effect on your
health
. For this reason we do
not recommend
Ayurveda in India for our clients who
suffer
from
severe health problems
that may be worsened
by the journey
. Ayurveda in
India
is a
great choice f
or those who are
suffering
from the
effects
of an
unhealthy
and
hectic lifestyle
, that has
resulted
in a
psychical
and
physical imbalance
. Before the journey you may want to
consult a doctor
to determine possible
climate impact
on
health
and to
ask
about
malaria
and
hepatitis vaccines
(if desired).
