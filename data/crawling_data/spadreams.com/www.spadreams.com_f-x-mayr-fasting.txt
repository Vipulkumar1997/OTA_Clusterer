F. X. Mayr Fasting
Find your way to lightness, health and vitality

Cleanse Your Body and Feel Light Again
Franz Xaver Mayr
(1875 – 1965) was a
doctor
who developed a
unique fasting method
based on consumption of specific foods and drinks, such as milk, bread rolls, herbal teas and water. The idea of the “milk – bread roll diet” may not convince everybody; however its effectiveness was proved by F.X. Mayr himself who lived 90 years which was rather unusual at the turn of the nineteenth century. Due to his innovative approach F.X. Mayr became famous in
spa town
Karlovy Vary (Czech Rep.) and in Vienna (Austria). Nowadays many retreats offer the “modern F.X. Mayr Cure”, which has been improved by the followers of F.X. Mayr to match the
needs
of
contemporary patients
.
The protection is the preparation and relief phase of the fasting cure. The cleansing is, as it might be expected, mainly the emptying and purification of the intestine. This is mostly achieved by taking
Glauber's salt
in the
morning
. The cleansing is
supported
by a high hydration in the form of herbal teas, drinking water and mineral water. The training will revive the
gastrointestinal tract
. This is where the actual milk and bread diet begins. The thorough and deliberate chewing of the bread
stimulates
the
salivation
and thus the digestion. In addition,
special
abdominal massages
support
the
treatment
. A F.X. Mayr Therapy should always take place under
expert guidance
and
not
at
home
as an
experiment
.
In principle, the F.X. Mayr Cure is based on
three elements
:
1.
Rest
– relaxation of the digestive system is achieved through reduced food intake.
2.
Cleansing
– an important element of the treatment based on purification of the digestive system, for example with help of bitter salt.
3.
Training
– learning how to eat consciously (slowly, mindfully, in peaceful surroundings).
The treatment is completed with
spa treatments
that enhance
cleansing
. According to the philosophy of the treatment, one of the
main causes
of health problems is an overloaded digestive system and deposits in the bowel. The
cure
is therefore focused on
detoxification
.
Weight loss is
not
the
main aim
but rather a pleasant
bonus
of the
therapy
.
