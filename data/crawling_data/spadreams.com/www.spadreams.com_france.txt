France
A country with an elegant flair















Search








Welcome to France!
An alluring country of exquisite cuisine, elegant architecture and a
quintessentially French art de vivre (art of living)
. Perhaps it is due to its diversity that France is the most popular tourist destination in the world - the
enchanting countryside landscapes
and extraordinary, chic cities have something for everyone to discover. Both culture lovers seeking a new adventure and couples craving a
romantic getaway
can soak in the Parisian ambience of the
City of Love and Light
, whilst sailing fans and backpackers can take to the sea or explore the sprawling countryside.  From the beautiful coasts of Brittany to the stunning beaches of Cote d’Azur, France entices its visitors with iconic landscapes, charming sunsets and a
sense of intimacy that permeates the atmosphere.
With SpaDreams you will find the perfect spa escape in France in stunning locations off the beaten track.
If you are looking for a rejuvenating, relaxing holiday with a unique flair, we recommend
thalasso treatments
on the island Quiberon. Quiberon a haven of tranquility - the perfect place to relax on the sandy beach or explore the “wild coast”. Quiberon offers also gourmet culinary experiences: try crepes with chestnut cream, a traditional pastry called kougin amann or delicious, fresh seafood.
Thalassotherapy is not the only speciality of the French spas. France is blessed with natural mineral
thermal waters
used to produce effective anti-ageing cosmetics. One of the most iconic spa destinations is Dax located in the south of France, home to one of the exclusive
Roman Thermal Spas of Europe
. The elegant, stylish spa hotels in Dax are well-known for treatments with use of
Fango
(therapeutic mud) and thermal waters, which help nourish, moisturise, rejuvenate, firm and revitalise skin as well as reduce symptoms of rheumatic conditions. If thermal treatments aren't for you, escape to the green hills of Alsace where you can enjoy
fresh air and healthy food
at spa oases hidden in the most beautiful forests of France.
Discover your perfect holiday in France! Contact our friendly customer service today for expert advice and all our best offers!
