Exceptional medical wellness in fabulous hotels
Czech Republic and Slovakia enchant their visitors with endless mountain ranges, charming, traditional spa resorts and magnificent cities.
Prague, known as "the golden city“ is not only the hottest tourist spot in the Czech Republic but also a prime spa destination.
Karlovy Vary
is another iconic Czech destination famous for its hot springs and beautiful, historic buildings, such as colonnades and spa hotels. The speciality of Karlovy Vary is sulphur baths, which deeply nourish and soften skin. Due to Karlovy Vary's characteristic flair, it has been chosen as the set of numerous blockbuster films (e.g. James Bond). If you love spa and wellness, this glamorous but incredibly hospitable region is certainly a must visit destination. The Karlovy Vary region hides many other spa gems including
Jachymov
and
Frantiskovy Lazne
(Franzensbad), which are amongst the best destinations in Europe offering
radon cures
. Radon-rich
thermal waters
of
Jachymov and Frantiskovy Lazne
are an effective natural remedy for inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and spondylitis.
Slovakia is associated mainly with skiing in the Tatra Mountains, however it is also a perfect spa destination blessed with natural thermal waters. For spa and medical wellness we recommend spa resort
Piestany
, which specialises in
hydrotherapy
with use of sulphate-carbonate water.
Explore the Czech Republic and Slovakia with SpaDreams for unforgettable spa experiences at the best price, guaranteed!
