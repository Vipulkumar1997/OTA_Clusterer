Panchakarma
Discover the authentic ayurvedic practice

What is Panchakarma?
Panchakarma is a unique Ayurvedic cure, which literally translates as “
five actions
” for detoxification. Panchakarma restores
balance
of the
body and mind
, cleanses the body and
strengthens
the
immune system
. The treatment is the most
popular Ayurvedic
cure available in all SpaDreams resorts offering intensive
Ayurveda
. Panchakarma was developed millennia ago in
India
and it remains the cornerstone of Ayurvedic healing today. It is recommended for anybody who suffers from illnesses related to overall physical and mental imbalance, from
burn-out
and
depression
to
hypertension
,
digestive problems
and
obesity
.

The principles of Panchakarma
According to the
teachings of Ayurveda
, health and well-being largely depend on the ability to
eliminate toxins
,
tensions
and
residues
which accumulate
in the body
(ama). Ama is not just caused by an imbalanced diet, but also comes from repressed
negative emotions
and
experiences
. Anxiety, feelings of guilt, hidden anger or resentment can
result
in
serious imbalance
. Ultimately, accumulated ama results in various
negative effects
such as
psychosomatic diseases
or
disruption
of the
metabolic syndrome
. The aim of Panchakarma is to get
rid of toxins
and any other ama that suppresses your
natural healing abilities
. The opposite of ama is ojas – the essence of
positive energy
in the form of
psychical
and
physical strength
, a clear mind, lightness of the body, immunity to diseases and inner peace. Panchakarma allows replacement of ama with ojas: the
negative
and
destructive energy
gets replaced by the positive, healing essence and the
balance is restored
.

How Panchakarma works
How does this work in practice? Panchakarma is based on an
individualised Ayurvedic diet
supported by Ayurvedic
spa treatments
, Ayurvedic medicines and cosmetics, and physical activity (yoga). The treatment is
highly individual
and personal aims are discussed with an Ayurvedic specialist right from the start. The specialist diagnoses the
constitution type
and creates an i
ndividual meal plan
(vegetarian), offers advice on cosmetic treatments and prescribes Ayurvedic
natural medicines
. An effective Panchakarma treatment should last at least
two-three weeks
to bring
desired effects
.

Brief history of Panchakarma
Ayurvedic cures used in Panchakarma are claimed to have appeared
first in Vedas
(particularly in Atharva Veda) which are amongst the oldest religious texts. They are believed to have come from the
God Brahma
and date back to 1700–1100 BC. Intensive development of Ayurveda was observed in 6th Century BC to 7th Century AD.
Ayurvedic medicine
was suppressed during the colonial reign of Britain in India. Nowadays it is becoming
increasingly popular
due to its individual, holistic approach, which makes it completely different from the conventional medicine. Rather than focusing only on alleviation of particular symptoms and diseases, Ayurveda brings
relief to the entire body and mind
.

Panchakarma and slimming
The
main aim
of Panchakarma is
detoxification
followed by self healing, therefore Panchakarma
cannot
be treated a
short-term
, quick weight loss programme. Slimming is available within Panchakarma and it is recommended if weight is one of the reasons for bodily imbalance. Nevertheless,
weight loss
should be
treated
as just a
bonus
to the o
verall improvement of fitness and well-being
.

Good to know about Panchakarma
Panchakarma is an
intense detoxifying experience
, which is not suitable for families with children, pregnant women and for the people who suffer from extremely severe diseases, which require hospitalisation or intensive care. Panchakarma is a
perfect
way to alleviate the
negative effects
of
imbalanced lifestyle
such as unstable weight and/or moods, digestive problems, insomnia, burn-out, stress overload and much more.
A long-haul journey to
India
and
Sri Lanka
as well as the local climate and jet lag means that Panchakarma in India is only suitable for those who do not
suffer
from
severe diseases
or
mobility problems
.
Panchakarma is available also in Europe -
choose an Ayurvedic resort in Spain, Portugal, Germany, Austria, Poland or Slovenia as an alternative to a long flight to Asia.
Solo travellers
, as well as pairs/groups interested in Ayurvedic cures are very welcome in the Ayurvedic resorts. Some
Ayurvedic retreats
also offer stays without cures for people who are
supporting
their friends, partners or relatives
undertaking the cure
, however many resorts only offer stays
exclusively
for
Panchakarma
and other
Ayurvedic

treatments
.

The stages of Panchakarma
A complete Panchakarma treatment consists of four stages:
Diagnosis
- pulse diagnosis, Dosha determination and overall diagnosis of the underlying causes of health problems.
Purvakarma
- the first step, which prepares the body for the upcoming cure - special diet and oil treatments such as Abhyanga (full body massage).
Panchakarma
- literally "five actions", which originally included vomiting, use of laxatives, nose cleansing & inhalations, bloodletting and colonic irrigations. Nowadays the procedures are far less dramatic and you will be consulted on which procedures are being selected at the begining of the treatment.
Rasayana
- post-treatment including healthy diet and supplements.

Alternatives to Panchakarma
Panchakarma is a
great idea
for
detox
, however if you would prefer a more
active alternative
in your search for
inner balance
you should definitely consider our

yoga offers
available in
India
,
Philippines
and
Thailand
as well as in
Europe
.
Another method for
restoring harmony
is
fasting
. SpaDreams offers
extensive range of fasting holidays
and our
resorts in Europe
are the
most popular
.
Spa Dreams
specialises in Ayurvedic holidays
, as well as in other
detox and fasting

related holidays. We take pride in our expertise and it
contributes
to the
improvement of health and well-being
of our customers.
