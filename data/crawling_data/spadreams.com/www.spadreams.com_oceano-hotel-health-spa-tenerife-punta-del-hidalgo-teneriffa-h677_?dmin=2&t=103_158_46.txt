Top tips from our customers


‘The Mercedes Forest is not a secret but is very beautiful. We booked a small rental cars for a few days through the hotel. We could pick up the key from the reception in the morning and give it back again in the evenings. Great value for money and service. Request one to two days beforehand at the reception.’
