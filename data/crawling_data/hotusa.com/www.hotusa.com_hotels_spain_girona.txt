GIRONA
GIRONA is a land of striking contrasts
From its Costa Brava, wild and abrupt, offering us lovely beaches and coves, to the vast flatland of relaxed landscapes that are ideal for watching a magical sunset. You can see the Pyrenees to the north, with snow-capped peaks ideal for outdoor sports and activities. The areaÂ¿s cuisine is varied and rich in flavours and products.
