Hotels in Zaragoza
ZARAGOZA
ZARAGOZA is a region with highly varied landscapes, with harsh rocks rising out of river beds that come down from the mountain ranges of Teruel.
There are impregnable castles and fortified churches built in the Lower Middle Ages, as well as various centres with thermal baths and samples of Mudejar and Romanesque architecture.
