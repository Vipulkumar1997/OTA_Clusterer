The largest and most varied selection of hotels


We place at your disposal over 2,400 hotels in 49 countries and 4 continents. Our wide range allows us to satisfy the most comprehensive selection of customer types.
We have our own classification system, which is more reliable and accurate. Choose your hotel with the security of always getting it right.
Hotel classification criteria tend to vary according to the country and, in some cases, the region, which makes choosing an establishment particularly difficult.



In Hotusa we have created a new system that divides our establishments into five categories.
The categorisation of the Hotusa portfolio aims provide a more precise definition of the standards of the facilities, interior design, quality and performance of its establishments, regardless of the classifications used for the country or region or whether the accommodation belongs to the urban or the holiday sector.

We are convinced that our prices are the best. Our commitment to offering you the best price even includes paying a penalty should we fail to comply with our guarantee.

·
To prove it you should simply send an email to
helpdesk@hotusa.es
or fax + 34902932219, providing a screenshot or alternative documentation allowing our operations department to verify that, indeed, a booking can be made at the hotel at a lower price than that obtained through

·
Should it indeed be proven, under the conditions set out above, that the price of hotusa.com is not the best available on the market, we will charge the price found.

Bookings whose price differences are due to currency exchange rates are excluded from this guarantee. Only those price differences in the hotelâ€™s local currency will be valid.

·
This guarantee is not available for group bookings, negotiated company rates, early booking discount rates for payment in advance, or for any other fees with booking conditions different to those offered by Hotusa.

HOTUSA GENERAL CONDITIONS (1 JULY 2008)



· RESERVATIONS MADE THROUGH THE WEBSITE:
Only a maximum of 4 rooms may be reserved per booking, for reasons of hotel availability. Should you need more than 4 rooms, you must make your reservation by phone. In no case will reservations or additional reservations of more than 4 rooms made through the same agency, at the same hotel on similar dates be valid, even though they may be confirmed on the system. Due to real-time availability reasons, it may happen that between the time at which the availability request is made and the response from our central server (3-4 seconds), the rooms shown as available have already been booked.

(In some rare cases, due to [unforeseen] circumstances, or in certain hotels by holiday type, it may be that such charges are made for more than one night, this will be pointed out prior to booking and also in the written confirmation). Any NON-GUARANTEED reservation will become ineffective at 18:00 h. Should the client arrive later than this at the hotel, the reservation will not be kept open for them.

· GROUPS:
Reservations for more than 7 rooms can be treated as group bookings, it being up to the hotel to decide if the cancellation conditions apply or not, any deposits or signing of contracts.
