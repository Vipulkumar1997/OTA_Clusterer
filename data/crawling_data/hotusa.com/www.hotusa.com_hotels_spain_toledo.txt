TOLEDO
TOLEDO is one of SpainÂ¿s largest provinces
Toledo is one of SpainÂ¿s largest provinces. A land of windmills and cheese, it still has the same atmosphere that Cervantes immortalised in the adventures of Don Quixote de la Mancha.The province of Toledo also has a number of fortifications. Its landscape, both flat and mountainous, is dotted with the impressive outline of Arab, Roman, and medieval castles.
