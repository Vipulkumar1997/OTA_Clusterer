CORDOBA
CORDOBA The province of CÃ³rdoba includes a wide variety of landscapes and interesting sights.
The mosque of CÃ³rdoba, located in the capital and considered the most spectacular monument of the Muslim period in the Western world, is a good example of this. CÃ³rdoba also has some picturesque villages with many places to go sightseeing, which visitors are sure to enjoy. The provinceÂ¿s great diversity in natural wealth and landscapes also makes it a good place to practice all kinds of sports.
