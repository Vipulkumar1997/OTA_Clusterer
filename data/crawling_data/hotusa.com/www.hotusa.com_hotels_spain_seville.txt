SEVILLE
SEVILLE offers important monuments and interesting architecture
One of the main attractions of this province is its capital, a reflection of the cultural heritage of the many people who have inhabited the region. The province is also home to a number of places that deserve to be mentioned such as the county of Aljarafe, the dolmens of Valencina or the Treasure of the Carambolo.
