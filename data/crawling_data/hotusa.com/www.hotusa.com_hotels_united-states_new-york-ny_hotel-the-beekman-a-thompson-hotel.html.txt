Located in the epicenter of Lower Manhattan's vibrant New Downtown lies New York's last hidden architectural treasure, The Beekman. Nestled between the East and Hudson River, this award-winning luxury hotel is surrounded by some of Manhattan's most cherished attractions including the Brooklyn Bridge and One World Trade Center. Passionately restored to its former glory, the landmark building boasts 287 elegant guestrooms including 38 suites and two duplex penthouses with private rooftop terraces overlooking City Hall Park. The Beekman gathers Tom Colicchio and Keith McNally - two culinary powerhouses- to imagine two distinct world-class dining experiences. Colicchio's signature restaurant Fowler & Wells reflects on the culinary history of lower Manhattan serving a menu of quintessential New York classics. While, McNally's classic brasserie Augustine, combines a fresh take on lighter dishes and French favorites. Once Upon A Time. Now. The Beekman is a masterpiece reimagined.
