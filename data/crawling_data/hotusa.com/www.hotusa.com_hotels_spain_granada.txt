GRANADA
GRANADA is a city of gardens, fountains, monuments, and palaces hidden away in magical Moorish and gypsy quarters
Only 45 km from the city of Granada, the capital of the province, we have the county of Alpujarra, characterised by the beauty and tranquillity of its whitewashed villages, flower-filled balconies, special people and atmosphere, all set within the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountain range.
