The Gotham Hotel on 46th Street, just a few minutes from Times Square, will bring a new type of hotel experience to the center of Midtown Manhattan. With terraces off every room, guests feel as if they're floating above the city. The design accentuates the hotel's luxurious and relaxing atmosphere, and bespoke furnishings further the personalized sensibility. Located on the site that was formerly home to the historic Gotham Book Mart, the Gotham Hotel pays homage to its literary roots with a collection of books purchased from Housing Works, the non-profit organization.  Each of Gotham Hotel's 66 unique guestrooms offers style and comfort. The guestrooms are luxurious and stylish with European touches in an elegant and pragmatic manner. These spacious rooms feature distinctive terraces, loft-like ceilings, dynamic windows, vast bathrooms featuring Italian glass mosaic tile, custom accessories, and thoughtful amenities, among others. The hotel's new restaurant, the Tenpenny's brings back that intimate dining experience with seating for 55 people, serving mouth-watering dishes that will keep diners coming back.
