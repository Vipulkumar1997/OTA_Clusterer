VALENCIA
VALENCIA means sun, oranges, gardens, the sea, horchata (a drink made from the tigernut), paellaÂ¿and much more.
Its coastline has become a sandy area dotted with high blocks of apartments and service infrastructures, which lie right next to vegetable gardens and farmsteads. There are also several highly prestigious golf courses, and the coast offers the possibility of practicing a wide variety of water sports.
