MALAGA
MALAGA
MÃ¡laga is a happy-go-lucky, boisterous place, full of beautiful spots that have been inhabited for over 2000 years, home to various Mediterranean civilizations, combining tradition and modernity. Thanks to its mild climate, its beaches, and an unsurpassable offer of golf courses, the Costa del Sol makes MÃ¡laga one of SpainÂ¿s most important tourist destinations.
