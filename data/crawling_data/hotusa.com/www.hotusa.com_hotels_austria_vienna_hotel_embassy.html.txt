L'hotel non dista molto lontano dal centro storico. Ha le fermate del tram posizionate davanti e pertanto si ha la facilità di prendere i mezzi pubblici per visitare le mete di interesse. Vienna ha un'efficiente rete di mezzi per il trasporto pubblico (tram, metro, treni) che attraversa tutta la città con minime attese. L'hotel, per la mia esperienza, offre una ricca colazione e le camere sono accoglienti e pulite. Ho fatto presente alla direzione che per l'intrattenimento nella televisione della camera un canale anche in italiano sarebbe stato gradito (satellite solo tedesco, spagnolo, inglese)
