    Hotusa Best Price Guarantee



Hotusa Best Price Guarantee


Here at
hotusa.com
we   want to offer our clients the  best prices on the market, and so we want   to guarantee that booking your hotel  on our website you will find the   best price possible.

We are convinced that our prices are the best, and for this reason, our    guarantee leads us to even take on penalties if we are unable to fulfil   our  guarantee in any case.

We have come up with a system to back up our commitment. It is easy,    comfortable, and totally transparent, and any client can easily test it.


Conditions of the “Hotusa Best Price” Guarantee

• Clients must book at
hotusa.com
.

• We give clients who have booked at our website
hotusa.com
a  period of 2 hours* maximum from the time of confirmation of the   booking they have made  to let us know that the hotel that they have   booked, with the same type of room  and food plan, and under the same   booking conditions, is available at a more  economic price on the   market, whether through another operator, an on-line travel  agency, or   directly through the hotel.

• To accredit it, simply send a screen image or other documentation that   will  allow our operations department to verify that it is really   possible to book at  a lower price than that obtained at hotusa.com to   the e-mail address
helpdesk@hotusa.es
or to the fax   number
+34902932219.


• If it is truly accredited that the price offered at Hotusa.com is not   the  best price available on the market, under the conditions set out   above, we will  apply the same price.

• This guarantee is not valid for:
- Changes in rate relative to fluctuations and/or differences on the currency exchange rates.
- Group bookings, rates negotiated for companies, early-booking rates with discounts for purchasing early, or any other rate with booking conditions different than those offered by Hotusa.


*Note: We grant a prudential margin of 2 hours due to frequent   oscillations  (both rising and falling) in hotel rates, obligating us to   update our prices  with this frequency.
