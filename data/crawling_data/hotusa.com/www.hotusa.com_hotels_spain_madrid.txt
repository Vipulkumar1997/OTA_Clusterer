MADRID
MADRID is the capital of this Autonomous Region and also of the country
Madrid is the capital of this Autonomous Region and also of the country, and as such, it has much to offer: the best art collections, as well as monuments and official buildings. Outside of the cityÂ¿s beltway we find the real province of Madrid, with wonderful mountain landscapes and forests that are high enough to provide exceptionally fresh air for breathing.
