The hotel is nice, but their concierge services are not good. They are only concerned about the cars in valet and don’t care if you need a taxi.

Your Florida vacation
Other states' tourism boards would be so lucky to have Florida's ready-made allure: year-round sunshine, theme parks galore and miles of sugary coastline. Add to the list one more motivator: cheap Florida vacations. The cash-strapped can always count on the beaches for Mother Nature's gifts, from sunrises and sunsets to dolphin spotting. And for families: Disney World and all in its ilk, whose packages make for an affordable Florida travel getaway -- especially during the off-season.
Use our handy guide for cheap things to do in Florida by region, and book your trip to the land of pink flamingos and lost shakers of salt.






Best time to take a vacation to Florida


Best Time to Go
Florida vacations are great anytime of the year. The weather is mild year-round, with a subtropical and tropical climate. Annual temperatures are between 65oF and 84oF. Florida is a popular tourist attraction for individuals seeking to travel away from cold temperatures, or to enjoy the hot climate in the summer. Travelers can find bargain deals on hotel accommodations between June and September. Winter season is a little more expensive for Florida visitors due the tourist peak season between December and April. Autumn is a season of cool weather, and a relaxed atmosphere. Anytime is a great time to visit Florida’s amusement parks.






Insider tips for Florida travel


Disney World
Experience the various attractions at the famous Disney World theme park in Orlando.
Sarasota
Head to Sarasota to tour the Ringling Museum of Art and attend the Ringling International Arts Festival held in October.
Capital Grille
When it is time to sit down for a bite to eat, head over to the Capital Grille in Miami.
Busch Gardens
Those that are embarking on Florida travel with a family will enjoy the attractions at the Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa Bay.
Gatorland
Florida is well-known for its alligator population, and Gatorland in Orlando has crocodiles and alligators from all over the world.






Florida highlights


Florida Keys
Florida beach towns tempt with postcard flair, yet extra style points go the Keys, which spells paradise from every Hemingway bungalow, coral reef and beach bar. The main drag – Duval Street – is a free exercise in people watching, thanks to wall-to-wall bars, souvenir shops, bikers, drag queens and free-roaming Key West Gypsy chickens and roosters. Yes, we said it, anything goes in the Keys.
Tampa Bay
Tampa's all-American appeal is obvious from mansion-studded and rollerblader-frequented Bayshore Boulevard and during rollicking fests such as Guavaween and the Gasparilla Pirate Parade. Amble the brick-lined, iron-wrought streets in historic Ybor City and think you're in New Orleans – until you're teased by the flamenco dancers and heaping plates of Cuban fare at the Columbian Restaurant. Beyond the "metro," frugal Florida travelers won't have to sacrifice outdoor time for fun. Tampa Bay residents practically live on the beach, from pristine Fort de Soto Park (a regular on Dr. Beach's best beaches list) to tidy Pass-A-Grille, a coast dazzled by the pink palace otherwise known as Loews Don CeSar Hotel.
Miami
Don't be discouraged by the couture kittens, yacht partiers and Mazarati drivers in South Beach; despite the emphasis on affluence, not everyone lives large in America's Riviera. Tourists can still partake in the excess from afar. Follow the lighting equipment to Lummus Park to spy on a photo shoot or wander by the bistro tables along Ocean Drive. You might spot a movie star. And for budget-sensible fun from the beach, hotel hop the Art Deco district with your camera; those neon-lit facades and sexy lounges are worth capturing even if you're not a guest in the penthouse suite.
Panhandle
Think of the Panhandle as Florida's cousin from the Deep South; same family, different accent. Explore the area for traces of Southern roots, from plantation-style homes in Tallahassee to rustic seafood shacks in Apalachicola. As a family destination, it's easy on the budget thanks to a bevy of residential-style hotels designed for extended stays and pint-sized entertainment (read:  lazy rivers and water umbrellas). Outside, revel in Mother Nature's freebies: state parks made for trekking and stretches of powdery sand to sink in.
Orlando
Mickey Mouse will always have our hearts at Disney World – that's a given. Beyond the theme parks, however, are local Florida travel diversions that don't have to break the bank, starting with an inner tube ride down Rainbow River Rock State Park. On dry land, escape to the World of Orchids for fragrant, jungle air, catch the daily parade of ducks in the Peabody Orlando or dare to stare in the eyes of a gator at Gatorland, more contained and only slightly less intimidating a setting than Alligator Alley.
