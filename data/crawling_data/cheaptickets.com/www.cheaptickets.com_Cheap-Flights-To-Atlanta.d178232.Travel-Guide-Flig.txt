Cheap flights to Atlanta
Often referred to as The Big Apple of the South, Atlanta draws thousands of visitors and new transplants every year, including some of Hollywood's biggest players. Atlanta is home to Coca-Cola, CNN, the MLK Center, the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library, the Margaret Mitchell House and other historical landmarks. The city also plays host to major corporations and professional sports organizations. Metro Atlanta consists of several neighboring counties, popular neighborhoods and areas like Virginia Highlands, Midtown and Buckhead. The city is a four-hour drive south of Charlotte, North Carolina, and a two-hour drive north of Birmingham, Alabama.
Getting Around
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is less than a 20-minute drive from downtown and has held the status of being one of the world's busiest airports since 1998. Rental car booths are on site at the airport, and visitors have access to the city's MARTA subway system. City bus transit and taxi cabs are also available to get you around Atlanta.
Hints and Tips
Although it was burned to the ground during the Civil War, Atlanta rose from the ashes to become a major metropolis, offering visitors some of the South's best fine dining, shopping, hotels and entertainment. In 1996, Atlanta hosted the Summer Olympic Games. Atlanta's summers can be hot, and the winter seasons generally run from mild to cold.
