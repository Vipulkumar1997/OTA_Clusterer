Cheap flights to Tampa
Tampa is a cultural and commercial hub on the Gulf Coast of Florida. From the Tampa Museum of Art to the Salvador Dali Museum, there's plenty of fine art to explore in this city. As one of the oldest districts in Tampa, Ybor City is lined with colorful buildings and former Cigar factories, where you can now enjoy cool drinks or eat some authentic Cuban food. You can also feel the vibe of this historic district at annual events such as the Fiesta and St. Patrick's Night Parade.
Getting Around
After your plane lands at Tampa International Airport (TPA), you can use the George J. Bean Parkway to drive to Downtown Tampa. Cruise on Interstate 275 to make your way to the area's top beaches such as St. Pete Beach and Treasure Island. Catch a ride on the historic TECO Streetcar system to navigate the Channel District, which is home to the Florida Aquarium. If you're in the mood for watching some more exotic wildlife, head to Busch Gardens Tampa and tour the themed exhibits such as Edge of Africa and Orangutan Outpost.
Hints and Tips
A tropical climate is prevalent in Tampa, so you'll have the chance to dip into a swimming pool or the Gulf of Mexico any time of the year. If you need to cool off in downtown, walk the promenades along the Channel District and feel the cool breeze from Hillsborough Bay.
