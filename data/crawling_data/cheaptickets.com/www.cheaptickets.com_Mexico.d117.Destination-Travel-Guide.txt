Your Mexico vacation
From the vast bronze deserts to the sapphire reefs of Cozumel, and the ancient history around Palenque to the tequila-soaked nightlife of Tijuana, Mexico is an intriguing and exhilarating land that will throw something new at you every time. It's a place that offers endless opportunities to relax to the max or to go as wild as you like. Better yet, hurling yourself headlong into Mexico's vibrant, varied culture won't cost you nearly as many pesos as you may think.
Plan your Mexico vacation with CheapTickets for the ride of a lifetime with plenty of tequila money left over.






Best time to take a vacation to Mexico


Best Time to Go
Temperatures in Mexico vary throughout the year.  Potential visitors to Mexico should check for weather conditions for their specific destination.  Annual temperatures in Mexico are between 60 and 80 degrees.  Mexico vacations are best from October to May, especially during October and November since temperatures are nice and cool.  The rainy season in Mexico lasts from June to September, with July being the wettest month of the year.  Temperatures are typically hot and very humid during the summer months, providing perfect weather for a getaway on one of Mexico’s pristine beaches or island destinations, such as Cozumel.






Insider tips for Mexico travel


Oaxaca
Come to the town of Oaxaca during the month of October to take part in the Day of the Dead Festival, a traditional celebration of ancestry and ritual.
Acapulco
With its breathtaking ocean vistas, Mexico’s resort town of Acapulco is popular amongst locals and tourists alike.
Los Cabos
A number of resorts, bars, restaurants, and beaches with beautiful white sands are all located in Los Cabos.
Cozumel
Spend a day scuba diving and snorkeling at Cozumel, situated just off the Yucatan Peninsula.
Chichen Itza
Take a trip to the ancient Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza to experience the pyramid of El Castillo.






Mexico highlights


Palenque
Easily one of the most fascinating cities in all of Mexico, Palenque is shrouded in verdant jungle as well as home to some of the best examples of Mayan architecture. (Plus, it's super-cheap to explore.) Discover the temples and secluded ruins, and drop in to El Panchan to have a drink and divulge your Indiana Jones-inspired tales.
Cozumel
With the reputation as one of the finest diving sites in the world, the island of Cozumel is essential on a Mexico vacation. With plenty of free sights and stunning beaches, Cozumel is the best place to see the beauty that the country has to offer, both above and below water.
Mexico City
The capital city and hub of culture and architecture, Mexico City is a must-see on your Mexico travels. From the Basilica of Guadalupe to the Bosque de Chapultec, one of the city's liveliest parks, Mexico City will leave you enchanted. Head straight for Plaza de la Constitucion to see wind-up harmonica players, traveling vendors and masses of religious festivities.
Cancun
With crazed spring-breakers reveling in the center of town and breathtaking Mayan ruins located just outside, Cancun is a study in contradictions. For awe-inspiring days and awesome nights, Cancun is your one-stop shop. Make sure you check out the nearby jungle pyramids of Coba, too.
Oaxaca
The indigenous Indians created a city that positively vibrates with beauty and spirituality -- something that can be experienced during Dia de Los Muertos (Day of the Dead) celebrations on November 1. Better than any Halloween party, watch the procession of townspeople as they trek to the cemetery with gifts for their dearly departed. The soul-stirring scene will stay with you long after your Mexico travels are over.
