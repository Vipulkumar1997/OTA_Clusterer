This is a great hotel, in a excellent location. Off and away from the hoopla that Myrtle beach offers, but not too far away that would discourage you from partaking in the experience.

Overall it was ok, because we came to the show and you go through the hotel so no need transportation. Everything was great beside the mattresses in room with double bad - They are done, can’t get sleep on them, and if you have little back pain don’t even consider it - it is that bad.

Hotels in North Myrtle Beach
North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, comprises on nine miles of the Grand Strand; which is famous for its wide, white-sand beaches on the Atlantic Coast. The city is replete with luxury high-rise hotels, great shopping, the Family Kingdom Amusement Park, championship golf courses such as Whispering Pines, horseback riding and pier fishing.
Deep-sea fishing charters are available for the adventurous. Ocean Drive's O.D. Pavilion and Amusement Park is the Grand Strand's only park overlooking the sea. You can see the world's rarest tiger, the Golden Tabby, and interact with baby tigers and apes, at T.I.G.E.R.S. Preservation Station.
Key facts
North Myrtle Beach is 15 miles from the Myrtle Beach International Airport (MYR), which is easily accessible from S.C. Highway 17. With a rental car, you're just minutes away from the attractions in four charming beach towns nearby; Windy Hill, Ocean Drive, Crescent Beach and Cherry Grove.
Hints and tips
The North Myrtle Beach Area Historic Museum provides information and artifacts covering 10,000 years of area history; notably that it was sometimes home to the notorious pirate Blackbeard in the 1700s.
The summer season is humid with average temperatures of 83 to 91 degrees during the day, and nighttime lows near 70 degrees; and it's warm enough to swim even past Labor Day. Fine restaurants in town are known for their Southern-style cuisine, but the biggest culinary draw is the area's freshly caught seafood.
