Hotels in Daytona Beach
Daytona Beach, Florida, has long been considered the spring break capital of the United States; but there are many reasons to visit the area during any given time of the year. Visitors to the "World's Most Famous Beach" can enjoy the unique experience of driving their vehicles on Daytona's firm white sands. The beach is not the only attraction as visitors come to experience Bike Week, the Daytona 500 and the NASCAR Hall of Fame.
Key facts
The most popular place for visitors to stay in Daytona Beach is undoubtedly on US-1, which features plenty of beachfront accommodations. Travelers have many options for reaching Daytona. Major area airports include Jacksonville International Airport (JAX) and Orlando International Airport (MCO). Visitors to the area may also land at Daytona Beach International Airport (DAB), conveniently located between Highway 1 and Interstate 95; near the neighborhoods of South Daytona and Port Orange.
Hints and tips
The weather in Daytona Beach varies, sometimes reaching temperatures in the upper 90s during the summer. The remainder of the year is mild but tropical, with the peak time for visiting being the fall and spring months. There is plenty of nightlife available to visitors along US-1 and on International Speedway Boulevard; with the city at its busiest during its annual events, such as Biketoberfest.
