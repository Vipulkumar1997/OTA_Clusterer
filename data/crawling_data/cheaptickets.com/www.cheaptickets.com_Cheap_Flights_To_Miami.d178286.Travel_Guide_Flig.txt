Cheap flights to Miami
Situated along the turquoise waters of Biscayne Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Miami is a city where you can catch a tan and enjoy orchestras and theatrical productions within the same day. Spend the afternoon laying on the golden sand of South Beach and then head to Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts for an evening performance. If you love the sight of exotic wildlife, the Miami Seaquarium and Zoo Aquarium are worth a visit.
Getting Around
Miami International Airport (MIA) is the primary commercial airport serving Miami. Whether you choose to cruise along the Dolphin Expressway or ride the Metrorail, you can conveniently make a smooth transition from MIA to downtown Miami by car or by rapid transit. You can also hop on the Metromover to get to top destinations in Downtown Miami and Brickell, such as the American Airlines Arena and Bayfront Park. A drive along Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive will take you to some of the the area's best waterfront districts that are lined with historic Art-Deco hotels.
Hints and Tips
Miami's culture has a strong Caribbean and Latin American influence. Visit Little Havana in Downtown Miami and Espanola Way in Miami Beach to taste appetizing cuisine and drink some authentic rum at Will Call Miami. The vibrant nightlife scene of South Beach includes plenty of Salsa music and Samba dancing.
