Beautiful property and resort amenities. Recommend better shuttle service to airport and a willingness to waive resort fees for those guests who are not able to use the spa and gym - particularly those with disabilities.

The staff, from the front desk to housekeeping, was very friendly and helpful. It was a little tricky, at first, to figure out how to get down to the river from our room.

Very nice hotel, great location
The hotel was very clean and beds were comfortable. We loved the pillows so much that we ordered some for home. It can get a little noisy due to its proximity to the road, but they provided earplugs if you needed them.....we didn't need them. It was close to River Street and we walked everywhere ...

Hotels in Savannah
Savannah, a historic city located in Georgia, offers attractions for the whole family such as Forsyth Park, John the Baptist Cathedral, the Roadhouse Rail Museum, and Summer Waves waterpark. The city is best known for River Street, which contains a strip of shops and eateries. Visitors may also visit the beaches at nearby Tybee Island; a resort town located about 15 miles east of Savannah.
Key facts
Several hotel chains are located on Bay Street, which puts visitors within walking distance of River Street. Savannah has trolley tours and a shuttle bus that covers the historic district. For a more romantic way of traveling, tourists may choose to rent a horse-drawn buggy. Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport (SAV) is located off Interstate 95, and is the chief airport for Savannah and the surrounding counties.
Hints and tips
Savannah is hot and humid most months of the year. In summer, the city hosts the Savannah Music Festival, an annual event recognized as one of the best music festivals in the United States. In spring, the city hosts its annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, which attracts thousands of people from all over the United States. Savannah is home to a large Irish population, so visitors will find restaurants, pubs and even live jazz on Abercorn Street and West Bay Street.
