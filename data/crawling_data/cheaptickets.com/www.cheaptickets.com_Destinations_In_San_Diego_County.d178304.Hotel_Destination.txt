San Diego hotels
San Diego is the second largest city in California. It is a unique city mainly due to its perfect location on the pacific coast. San Diego has amazing weather almost all year round and it has a number of attractive beaches that many travelers frequent, both local and international. The recent emergence of the city as a biotechnology enclave has led to an increase in business related travel in the region to add to the already established tourist travel. The city is near a military base, so a lot of air shows streak the sky during summer, which seems to last all year. San Diego hotels range from cheap fare to luxury suites put either in the heart of the cultural districts or on the cool blue beaches.
San Diego Quick Picks and Tips
Conventions
The San Diego Convention Center is the most important convention center in the region. Most famously it is the home to the San Diego Comic Con, where every major picture studio has star-studded panels for their upcoming sci-fi/fantasy/comic book films.
Dining
Village Vino in Kensington offers eclectic tastes and mid-range meals as well as fine wines.
Major Point of Interest
The San Diego Zoo is one of the best and biggest zoos in the world, featuring Safari Park where adults and children can traverse on jungle ropes and interact with animals.
Shopping
Seaport Village promises great shopping from local craftsmen at stores you literally won't find anywhere else.
Sports
Qualcomm Stadium has hosted three Super Bowl games and is the home to the San Diego Chargers, who sell affordable and exciting tickets from the fall through winter seasons.
