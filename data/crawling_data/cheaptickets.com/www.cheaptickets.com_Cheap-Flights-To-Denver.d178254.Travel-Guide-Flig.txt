Cheap flights to Denver
The "Mile High" city of Denver welcomes visitors with the majestic Rocky Mountains as its backdrop. If you're looking for an active vacation, City Park is an all-day destination beginning with a walk around the tranquil lake. Other attractions include the Denver Zoo, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, the IMAX Theater and the Planetarium. Sixteenth Street offers some of the best restaurants, shopping, hotels and street vendors in town.
Getting Around
If you fly to Denver, you'll find that the Denver International Airport (DIA) is user-friendly. The city's public transport system operates many bus routes on its express service called skyRide. The service has pickup and drop-off points at numerous locations, including suburbs, so getting around the city is easy. One-day and five-day passes are available for unlimited travel on buses and light rail throughout metro Denver.
Hints and Tips
Denver's Old West history is legendary; at the Molly Brown House, you can learn the folklore of a famed woman saving people on the Titanic. Lower downtown is the proud home of Coors Field and many local breweries such as Hogshead. Denver touts astounding cuisine choices from Buffalo steaks to Reindeer hotdogs! Three seasons out of four, the weather is mild and sunny, and in the winter, you'll have access to skiing and other outdoor activities.
