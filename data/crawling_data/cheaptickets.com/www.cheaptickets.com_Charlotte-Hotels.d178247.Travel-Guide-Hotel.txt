Omni's are always a great choice. The location was in the center of EVERYTHING! The room was very clean. I only stay at Omni hotels if I get a room on sale. They can be a bit pricey.

Hotels in Charlotte
As well as being a major financial hub in North Carolina, Charlotte is rich in culture with venues such as the Mint Museum and Bechtler Museum of Modern Art. At the Levine Museum of the New South and Harvey B. Gantt Center, you'll discover Charlotte's African-American heritage. Visit the NASCAR Hall of Fame to appreciate this city's role in promoting stock car racing in the United States, or take a seat in the Time Warner Cable Arena to see the Hornets play basketball.
Key facts
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport (CLT) is conveniently accessible by car via Interstate 485. Andrew Jackson Highway offers a quick ride between CLT and Uptown Charlotte, a financial district lined with the city's tallest skyscrapers. You can also navigate the core of Charlotte by riding on the LYNX Light Rail. If you'd like to be within walking distance from shopping malls, you can lodge in South Park. Located just south of Uptown, neighborhoods near Myers Park and Freedom Park offer plenty of tranquility in suburban-like settings.
Hints and tips
A humid subtropical climate brings seasonal mild temperatures to Charlotte. You can enjoy southern BBQ plates at outdoor restaurants at any time of the year. Feel the vibe of 'The Queen City' in the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center or Uptown's clubs that feature bluegrass and Jazz musicians.
