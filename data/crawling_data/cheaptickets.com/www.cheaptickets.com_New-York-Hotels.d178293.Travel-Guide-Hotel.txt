Nice hotel especially for the price

Hotels in New York
New York City, New York, is always a popular destination, with tourists coming in large numbers to see The Big Apple's attractions, like the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor, and The Twin Towers Memorial. Sports are a big part of the city with the National Football League and Major League Baseball being dominant. The New York Giants, Jets, Yankees and Mets all invite fans to watch them play at their home fields. You can see the Giants and the Jets at Metlife Stadium and the Mets at Citi Field, while Yankee Stadium is the home of the Yankees.
Key facts
John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) is a principal point of travel for visitors going to New York City. La Guardia Airport (LGA) and nearby Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) also serve residents and visitors to the area from all over the United States and the world. Many visitors stay in lodgings around Central Park and Manhattan.
Hints and tips
Times Square is always packed with visitors on the last day of December for the famous New Year's Eve countdown and dropping the big ball when midnight strikes. New York City is very diverse, so there are many authentic, international cuisine options to choose from, but perhaps no meal is more genuine to NYC than food from a street cart.
