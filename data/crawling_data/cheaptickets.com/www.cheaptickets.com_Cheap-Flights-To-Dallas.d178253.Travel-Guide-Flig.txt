Cheap flights from Ontario to Dallas
The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) is your gateway from Ontario, Canada, to northern Texas and Oklahoma. The area draws in both businessmen and families heading on vacation. You’ll find the airport is located within a 30-minute drive of Arlington, Dallas and Fort Worth. In Arlington, Six Flags Over Texas is the biggest attraction.
Stretch your legs in Dallas at Klyde Warren Park, or catch a game at the AT&T; Stadium. Venture to Fort Worth if you want to look at interesting museums and art galleries, including the Kimbell Art Museum and the National Cowgirl Museum and Hall of Fame.
Key Facts
If you want to find a nice hotel room, shop and catch a show all in one place, visit Sundance Square in Fort Worth. From DFW, take TX-183 West to TX-121 South to make your way into Fort Worth. In Dallas, Dealey Plaza marks the center of downtown, and the spot where John F Kennedy was shot in 1963.
From DFW, take highway 114 East to reach this area. Head north of the plaza to visit the shops and restaurants like Y. O Ranch Steakhouse, found near the historic district. Go east of the plaza to find the art district, museums and the Nasher Sculpture Center.
Hints and Tips
A direct flight from Ontario International Airport (ONT) to DFW will take you approximately three hours. Look for rental car signs in your terminal to locate shuttles escorting visitors to the rental car desks.
