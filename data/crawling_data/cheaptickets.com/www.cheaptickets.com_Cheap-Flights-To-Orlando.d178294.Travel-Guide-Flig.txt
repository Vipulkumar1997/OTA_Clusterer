Cheap flights to Orlando
Family attractions in Orlando include Walt Disney World, Universal Studios and SeaWorld. If you like science, explore the interactive exhibits at the Orlando Science Center. Art lovers can head north on Route 552, to visit the Cornell Fine Arts Museum in Winter Park. Driving north on Route 417 will take you to the Central Florida Zoo & Botanical Gardens in Sanford. You can visit the Museum of Seminole County History in Sanford to see rooms filled with ornate furniture from the early 20th century.
Getting Around
The two terminals at Orlando International Airport (MCO) are in the same three-level building. The gates are on the third level, and the baggage claim areas are on the first and second levels. After you fly to Orlando, you can take buses to downtown Orlando or Disney World. You can take Interstate 4 north to the beaches in Daytona Beach. A drive east along Route 528 will take you to the Kennedy Space Center.
Hints and Tips
You can visit the Orange County Regional History Center to find out about Orlando's beginnings as a little town in the 19th century. The museum is in downtown Orlando near Lake Eola Park. You can enjoy Orlando's mild climate while you walk on a path around the lake or take a paddle boat out as well.
