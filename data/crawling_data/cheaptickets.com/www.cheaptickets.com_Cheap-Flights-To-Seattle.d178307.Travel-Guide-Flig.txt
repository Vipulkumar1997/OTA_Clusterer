Cheap flights to Seattle
Seattle's location on the shore of the Puget Sound within 50 miles of lakes and rivers, makes a great vacation spot if you enjoy the water. Stroll along piers at the city's waterfront for a great view of the water. Take Interstate 405 North and then head east along I-90 to enjoy swimming, boating or water skiing at Lake Sammamish. If you want to go whitewater rafting, head north on I-405 and east on Route 522 to the Skykomish River.
Getting Around
You will be 14 miles from downtown Seattle when you land at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) after flying into Seattle. You can take light rail, county buses or express buses from the airport to reach your destination in the Seattle area. If you're traveling to Bainbridge Island, you can take light rail to the Pioneer Square station and then walk to the ferry terminal.
Hints and Tips
You can visit Seattle Center to see a panoramic view of the Cascade Mountains and Elliott Bay from the observation deck of the Space Needle. There are exhibits for children to explore at the Seattle Children's Museum at the center, and the Pacific Science Center has interactive exhibits for visitors of all ages. If you want to enjoy nature, stroll through the center's gardens and be sure to visit the Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibit as well.
