My initial thoughts were the rates were to high, but then I found out that we were trying to find a room that would accept a pet, in the middle of Laguna Seca...

I was scared by the appearance outside (old motel style with outdoor entrances to rooms) and it's location. But the room and services were good. We had to drive or take a cab were ever we wanted to go.

Hotels in Monterey
Monterey is home to coastal lodgings, the world famous Big Sur beach, and an active surfing culture. As one of the oldest cities in Central California, its historic streets feature adobe structures from the founding days of the Spanish missionaries. Those interested in the early history of California can tour historic homes, or travel to visit famous Fisherman's Wharf and Cannery Row;the site of John Steinbeck's classic novels.
Key facts
Monterey, California, is sensitive not just to historical preservation, but also to ecological issues. This city is on the forefront of the United States sustainable movement. In addition to boating, scuba diving and water sports, beach-goers can partake in a whale watching tour. Learn about the rescue efforts of a staff that's dedicated to local wildlife, such as pelicans, sea otters and harbor seals, when you visit the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.
Hints and tips
Located on the Cabrillo Highway, Monterey is known for having a temperate year-round Mediterranean climate. September tends to be the warmest month in the region, with high temperatures in the upper 60s. Daily temperatures tend to be lower in areas that are directly on or adjacent to the ocean. During the winter season, snowfall is rare, and is usually only seen in the Gabilan Mountains and Santa Lucia Mountains that overlook the city.
