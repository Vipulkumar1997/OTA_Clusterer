Cheap flights to Las Vegas
Las Vegas offers world-class restaurants like Maggiano’s Little Italy, entertainment and attractions for the entire family. When you fly to Las Vegas, you can check out The Mob Museum, tour exceptional exhibits at local hotels or casinos, or drive a racecar at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway after arriving. After spending some time in one of the many casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, take in a live show or head to Fremont Street in the old downtown for jazz, comedy clubs and free weekend concerts.
Key Facts
You can catch a shuttle or taxi from McCarran International Airport (LAS) and head toward the Strip, or rent a car and just drive straight up Las Vegas Blvd. or I-15. To see more of the city, head west to the upscale Summerlin area on I-215, and enjoy great restaurants like Parma, and shopping. Within a few hours' drive from Las Vegas, you can tour the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon National Park or the Mojave Desert National Park.
Hints and Tips
Many restaurants and bars like The Griffin are located in Las Vegas, and you can enjoy a leisurely or quick meal. You can also try out one of the clubs that are open day and night, that offer food and live entertainment in a beach atmosphere or one of the many casino buffets.
