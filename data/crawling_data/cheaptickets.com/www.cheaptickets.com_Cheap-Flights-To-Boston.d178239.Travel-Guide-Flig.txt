Cheap flights to Boston
With more than a dozen Colonial-era landmarks along the Freedom Trail, Boston is a fascinating city for history buffs to visit. The cultural home of New England will also impress you with European masterpieces at the Museum of Fine Arts and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. From the New England Aquarium to the Franklin Park Zoo, there are thousands of exotic species to discover in Boston.
Getting Around
Boston is served by General Edward Lawrence Logan International (BOS), which is conveniently connected to the city's downtown district via express bus routes. Interstate 90 and the Sumner Tunnel can also be used to drive from BOS to the heart of the city, and some of the surrounding communities such as Charlestown and Cambridge. In addition to providing commuter rail and ferry service, the MBTA operates multiple rapid transit and light rail services that can help you avoid heavy traffic during rush hour. When you're ready to watch some of the oldest professional sports teams in North America, head to Fenway Park or the TD Garden.
Hints and Tips
Boston is a city with tremendous pride in its Colonial heritage. As you walk through the city's squares and parks, you'll encounter statues of American patriots such as Samuel Adams and Paul Revere. Get to the top of the Bunker Hill Monument to enjoy views of Boston's skyline, from a hill that was once the battlefield for a major Revolutionary War campaign.
