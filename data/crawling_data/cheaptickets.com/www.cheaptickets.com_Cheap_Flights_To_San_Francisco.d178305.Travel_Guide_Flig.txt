Cheap flights to San Francisco
Travelers who fly to San Francisco can rent a car and drive over the Golden Gate Bridge or take in the sea lions playing at Pier 39. From professional sports, to Alcatraz, to the San Francisco Zoo, adult and family entertainment is plentiful. Although the City by the Bay is home to a myriad of prominent attractions, many fun destinations exist outside the city limits.
Just north of San Francisco, giant redwoods draw visitors to Muir Woods National Park. A drive through the rolling hills of wine country in Sonoma or Napa Valley is another popular day trip. The eight mile Bay Bridge connects San Francisco to Oakland and the East Bay area.
Getting Around
A highly rated rail system, Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), travels to 44 stations in four counties. Iconic cable cars take sightseers over steep streets to shop at Union Square. From mansions in Pacific Heights, to high-class eateries like Frances in the Castro District, the entire city sits on a 47-square mile peninsula. Over 80 neighborhoods reflect the diversity of the city’s population.
Hints and Tips
Following the California Gold Rush in 1848, the population of San Francisco grew exponentially. Although temperature in the moderate climate usually stays between 45 and 75 degrees, morning fog and Bay winds can leave you feeling chilly.
