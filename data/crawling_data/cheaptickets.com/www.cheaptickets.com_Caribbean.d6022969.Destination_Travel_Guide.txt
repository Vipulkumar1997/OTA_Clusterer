Very nice hotel close to the beach and ocean.

The hotel was totally refurbished recently.
The hotel was redone very tastefully and at a high standard. There is only one restaurant with limited menu. The area where the hotel is has been abandoned and all the good restaurants have either moved or closed. You need to use a car to go to the nice part of town. Hopefully the area will come ...

Beautiful Hotel! Friendly staff. Food was Good, but the Restaurants requiring Reservations were Amazing. Swimming pools, waterslides and Jacuzzis were nice.

Nice hotel and close to the beach. Hotel staff was friendly especially the bartender, Anthony. However I felt like the room was a little outdated and felt like the bathroom could have felt a little cleaner. It was an overall pleasant stay.

Your Caribbean vacation
From amazing scenery to the infectious tunes, the Caribbean is also bargain-lover's paradise to boot! The beaches are stunning, with Seven Mile Beach in Negril, and Doctor's Cave Beach in Montego Bay dubbed the pick of the bunch. Or for something more secluded, try Treasure Beach in South Coast, famed for its pristine and private coves. For cheap eats, hit La Bombonera and La Casita Blanca in Puerto Rico where you can bag a meal for under $10.
From the Dominican Republic to the Alto Vista Chapel, let CheapTickets help you plan your budget-friendly Caribbean vacation.






Caribbean highlights


Jamaica
If you like rum, Rastafarians and reggae, Jamaica will be your version of heaven on earth. Jamaica has world-class diving, fishing and snorkeling (make sure you hit up Ocho Rio), and Caribbean bars filled with fun-loving locals. Whether you're kicking back in Montego Bay, touring Appleton's Estate Rum Distillery or checking out the local wildlife at Dunn's River Falls, Jamaica will get under your skin.
Hiking
There are stacks of hiking trails to explore on your Caribbean travels, showcasing the beauty of the islands for nothing. The Mastic Trail in Grand Cayman is perfect for spotting wildlife amongst the greenery, while the Bermuda Railway Trail, a scenic 18-mile trail that runs along the old railway track, is best for views and landscapes.
Bahamas
Like a postcard come to life, the Bahamas indulges Caribbean vacation fantasies. Whether you're into nature or culture (both of which can be found in abundance), the Bahamas will amaze and dazzle. Once you've slipped into island mode, take a slow stroll down to the beach, or visit the famed Atlantis on Paradise Island, home to numerous pools, water park rides, dolphin swims and more.
Spiritual spots
For those who would like to explore the spiritual side of life on their Caribbean travels, there are plenty of sacred spots to explore for free. A few notable places include the Cathedral of Santa Maria la Menor in Santo Domingo (the oldest cathedral in the Americas, dating back to the 16th century), the Bridgetown Jewish Synagogue in Barbados and the tiny-but-sweet Alto Vista Chapel in Aruba.
Dominican Republic
The Dominican Republic is breathtakingly beautiful, with equal measures of Spanish romance and Caribbean relaxation. Luxury all-inclusive resorts abound, but there are plenty of opportunities to get out of the silver service world and back to nature. Find eco-adventures thanks to abundant mountains, waterfalls and tropical forests.
