Enjoy the vibrant scenery of Houston; you can visit iconic historical attractions, like the Space Center and Museum of Fine Arts. The Museum District has 20 museums within walking distance of each other. If you enjoy adventurous activities, you should explore the animal kingdom at the Houston Zoo and the Downtown Aquarium. As one of most popular cities in Texas, Houston has a wealth of recreational activities, events and celebrations that will keep you busy during your trip. The city is also home to Minute Maid Park, where you can watch the Houston Astros play baseball.
Getting Around
There are plenty of public transportation options in Houston, including the lightrail, the METRO buses and taxi services. The George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) is about 20 miles from the downtown area. The airport connects to the METRO bus system, which is located on the south side of Terminal C. The TerminaLink train connects to Terminal B, C, D and E. There are also shuttle services, taxis and courtesy vans. If you’re interested in traveling by car, the rental car companies have counters inside the airport.
Hints and Tips
Houston has fairly warm weather year-round with cool temperatures during the winter season, which is great for outdoor activities. There are many hotels located downtown, near the cultural attractions and fine dining establishments such as Oxheart.
