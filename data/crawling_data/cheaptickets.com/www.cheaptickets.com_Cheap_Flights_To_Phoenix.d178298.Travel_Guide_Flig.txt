Cheap flights to Phoenix
Phoenix is one of the most populous cities in the Southwest. From gorgeous golf courses and diverse cultural attractions to glorious scenery and delicious food, Phoenix is much like an oasis where travelers will find both fun and sun. Major tourist attractions in Phoenix include visiting the Heard Museum, taking a hike along Camelback Mountain or catching a baseball game at Chase Stadium. The Grand Canyon is just a few hours away, and Phoenix is only 116 miles north of Tucson and 144 miles south of Flagstaff.
Getting Around
When you fly to Phoenix, you will find Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX), is located within the city limits. Rental cars are available from many major brands at the airport, and visitors to Phoenix may also wish to get a cab to their destination. Apache Cab, Yellow Cab and Mayflower Cab all operate from PHX. METRO light rail is also an option for travelers looking to get to and from the airport. Since Phoenix is known for its fair weather, there is also a bicycle route to the airport.
Hints and Tips
If visitors really want to get the most out of Phoenix, it is best to come between November and April as temperatures are more comfortable. There is a public bus system in Phoenix that can also meet the needs of most visitors.
