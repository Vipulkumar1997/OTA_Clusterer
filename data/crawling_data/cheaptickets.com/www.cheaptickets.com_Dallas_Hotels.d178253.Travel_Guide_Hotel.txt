Hotels in Dallas
Dallas has emerged as the top leisure destination in Texas for national and international travelers. Within the borders of this modern city you will encounter 14 entertainment districts including the West End Historic District, Deep Ellum and the Dallas Arts district--the largest urban arts district in the nation. Dallas is also home to some of the best shopping and dining experiences in the southwest, including Northpark Center and The Galleria.
Key facts
Dallas boasts a unique blend of industry, entertainment and sports. The West End offers food and lodging near downtown, but most of the nightlife in the city is found uptown. Navigating the different areas of the city has become increasingly effortless thanks to one of the fastest growing light rail systems in the United States called DART. The city is also home to two airports: Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) and Dallas Love Field (DAL).
Hints and tips
With an average temperature of 55 to 75 degrees, Dallas's comfortable climate makes it an ideal destination no matter the time of year. The city also affords fans year-round sports with the Dallas Cowboys in the fall, the Dallas Mavericks and Dallas Stars in the winter, and the Texas Rangers in the spring and summer.
