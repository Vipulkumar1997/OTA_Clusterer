in order to be eligible for a Price Guarantee claim.

Total CheapCash issued
is limited to the total amount spent on the booking (excluding taxes and fees). If the amount spent on the booking is less than the amount of CheapCash you are eligible to receive, then the CheapCash will be capped at an amount equal to the amount spent on the booking (excluding taxes and fees).

you must have a valid CheapCash account.  If you chose not to enroll then you will qualify only for a refund of the difference in price.

Notifying CheapTickets of a Claim.

The lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives.

Must be "Apples to Apples" Comparison.
The Price Guarantee is available only for exact itinerary matches. For example, the specific airline and cabin class (First, Business, Premium Economy or Coach/Economy), hotel (including room type), ship and cabin category, rental car company and vehicle class, applicable refund policy, and the exact same dates and times of travel or service as booked through CheapTickets.com.

For any stand-alone product booking (for example, a hotel room or an airline ticket), the comparison must be to the same product purchased stand-alone through another website (i.e., not part of a hotel + air travel package).

The Price Guarantee is not available for bookings on websites where the carrier, property, rental car company, itinerary or similar booking details are unknown until after purchase. You must meet all requirements imposed on the lower price (if any), including, without limitation, residency, regional and age-related requirements.


Comparison Rates Must Be Available to the General Public Online.
The Price Guarantee applies only to prices both advertised and available to the general public on an English-language website.

For example, this does not include rates offered on:


Membership program websites, corporate discounts or rates

Group, charter, rewards program, incentive, meeting, convention, consolidator or interline prices

Prices obtained via auction or similar process

Prices available only by using a coupon or other promotion not offered to the general public.


The lower rate may not come from a website where you call to get the rate, or from an e-mail that you received. In addition, the rate must be quoted, booked, and paid for in US dollars.


Important Note Regarding Activities and Travel Packages.
When you book an activity, or a travel package (i.e., air + hotel, air + hotel + car, air + car, or hotel + car booked together as a package on the same itinerary) with CheapTickets.com, the Price Guarantee applies to the cost of the activity or the travel package, respectively, plus all taxes and fees.

Important Note Regarding Cruises.
The Price Guarantee applies only to the cost of the cruise. Taxes and fees, and any additional items, such as air or land components, insurance, the Cruise Protection Plan, shipboard credits, transfers, pre- or post- cruise hotel stays, onboard amenities, gift cards/certificates, cash back and/or dollars off are not eligible.

To qualify for the Price Guarantee on a cruise booking, you must have either paid in full or paid a non-refundable deposit on the booking. If you have made a non-refundable deposit, then any credit under the Price Guarantee will be applied toward the outstanding balance due for your booked cruise.


Verification of Claims.
All requests, including receipts, are subject to verification by CheapTickets. CheapTickets will not accept screenshots or other purported evidence of a lower price that cannot be independently confirmed by CheapTickets personnel. Nor will CheapTickets verify any request that it believes, in its sole discretion, is the result of a printing or other error or is made fraudulently or in bad faith.

For verification of stand-alone car rental and non-prepaid hotel bookings, the customer service representative will instruct you to e-mail an electronic copy of your car or hotel receipt to CheapTickets within thirty (30) days after you have completed the rental or hotel stay.

Verified requests will receive a credit to the credit card used for the booking, within approximately 7-10 days of verification.


Limit:


One (1) set of $50 in CheapCash per entire booking

Three (3) sets of $50 in CheapCash as the result of a Price Guarantee claim per customer per calendar month (regardless of the number of accounts used by the customer or the number of bookings made by the customer).


CheapCash is valid for 365 days as long as there is qualifying purchase or redemption activity through CheapTickets.com on your account.  CheapTickets reserves the right to render any CheapCash void that CheapTickets issues in excess of these limits, or issued in error, or where the customer is found to be ineligible to receive the CheapCash or has been deemed by CheapTickets to be abusing the CheapTickets Price Guarantee program for personal or financial gains.

Changes.
CheapTickets reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify or discontinue the Price Guarantee or to restrict its availability to any person, at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice or liability to you. The terms that are in effect at the time of your booking will determine your eligibility under the Price Guarantee.

No change in the Price Guarantee program will affect any CheapCash that has already been issued to you. The failure by CheapTickets to enforce any provision of these Terms & Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.
