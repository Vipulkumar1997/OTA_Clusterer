Hotels in Phoenix
As the capital of Arizona, Phoenix is the state's cultural epicenter and houses venues such as the Phoenix Art Museum and Arizona Science Center. The Arizona State Capitol Building is the perfect place to learn about local history. Take a seat at the Talking Stick Resort Arena to cheer on the Suns and Coyotes in one of the premier indoor sports venues in the southwest region of the United States.
Key facts
Arizona's capital is served by Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX). You can use Interstate 10 to drive from PHX into Phoenix as well as some of the major nearby cities like Glendale and Scottsdale. Book a room in downtown Phoenix to enjoy views of the city's modern skyline and the peaks of the McDowell Mountain Range. If you prefer to lodge in a major shopping district, reserve a room near the Arizona Mills shopping mall or the Tempe Marketplace.
Hints and tips
A subtropical desert climate brings extremely hot summer and spring seasons to Phoenix. To find relief from the heat of the Sonoran Desert, dip your feet in the Salt River, which is also a popular place for tubing and kayaking. To get a real taste of Phoenix, try some fresh fruit that is harvested from the saguaro, one of the largest cacti in the world.
