Great stay but was under construction
Great hotel and staff. Everyone was very nice and always trying to help. Only complaint was the construction and no elevator in the parking lot so you had to walk all the way down. We had 3 kids and it wasn't pleasant especially with all the high temperatures.

Good, but be careful what you wear at the pool!
The only reason why i give a low rate is because I went to the pool and the guards of the pool ask me to change my bikini or leave the pool because my bikini supposedly was not decent for then.

Hotels in Houston
Houston, Texas, is mainly associated with professional sports, Tex Mex cuisine and NASA. The Houston Rockets play basketball at the Toyota Center, and you can catch a baseball game at Minute Maid Park when the Astros are at home. The Texans of the National Football League play at NRG Stadium, which is named for a Fortune 250 company in Houston. The Houston Dynamo, a professional soccer team, plays at the BBVA Compass Stadium. You'll want to pay a visit to the Johnson Space Center, which has become famous because of NASA. People who stay in a hotel in Houston often travel the extra distance to soak up some sun on the Gulf of Mexico.
Key Facts
There are several airports in the Houston; although the George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH) is the biggest, the West Houston Airport (IWS) and the William P. Hobby Airport (HOU) also service Houston guests and residents. The Metropolitan Transit Authority runs buses in Downtown Houston and the surrounding neighborhoods regularly.
Hints and Tips
Although the city has restaurants that serve meals from over 70 countries like Lebanon, Peru and Italy, visitors say the best dishes are the fresh-caught seafood from the Gulf of Mexico. Fish tacos and guacamole can be found on nearly every street corner. Houston weather is very mild in the winter with temperatures in the 50s, but summers can be quite warm with average temperatures reaching the 90s.
