All the staff, front desk, shuttle driver (night shift, he had only been on the job for two days), lounge/diner, at this hotel was very very nice. Everyone was extremely friendly! They really went above and beyond, out of their way to help me get to all my locations. It was a very nice stay!

Hotels in Atlanta
Atlanta, Georgia’s largest city, is the cultural and social center of the southeast region of the United States. Parks located in or near the city include Zoo Atlanta; one of only four zoos in the United States that houses giant pandas. There’s also Stone Mountain, a park that features a scenic carving on the side of the mountain, and a nightly laser light show. Cultural activities include the Atlanta Ballet, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, and the Woodruff Arts Center; a major performing arts facility.
Key facts
Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is located seven miles south of the city's central business district, and is a major hub for the entire southeast region of the United States. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) provides bus and rail service throughout the city. Buckhead, Atlanta, a major business district, features high-rise office buildings and hotels along Peachtree Road, as well as suburban residential neighborhoods.
Hints and tips
Average temperatures in Atlanta range from a low of 33 degrees in January, to July highs of 89 degrees. The comfortable climate makes it easy to enjoy the professional sports teams that Atlanta is home to; including the Braves for baseball, the Falcons for football and the Hawks for basketball. The city was also host of the 1996 Summer Olympics.
Atlanta was established at the intersection of two railroad lines in 1837. Many of its buildings were burned during the Civil War, meaning the city literally rose from ashes to become what it is today.
