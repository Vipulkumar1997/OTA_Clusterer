Cheap flights from Ontario to Chicago
When you're headed to O'Hare International Airport (ORD), you'll find plenty of attractions to keep you busy. As the most populous city in the American Midwest, Chicago is an industrial hub which draws in both business travelers and sightseers. It’s a city with a distinctive flare for innovation, as well as a 29-mile shore along Lake Michigan. Here, you can explore 77 unique neighborhoods, ranging from the downtown Loop to the luxurious Gold Coast, eccentric Wicker Park, serene Roscoe Village and vibrant Chinatown.
Key Facts
Since being rebuilt in the 1870s, the Second City has become well known for its picturesque skyline, huge parks and deep-dish pizzas. If you're an art lover, visit the Art Institute of Chicago, Loyola University Museum of Art and the Museum of Photography.
Lincoln Park Zoo and Shedd Aquarium are great stops for pleasing the kids. You may also want to walk along the Magnificent Mile, which will take you to Hancock Center, Sears Tower, Millennium Park and Buckingham Fountain.
Hints and Tips
When flying from Ontario International Airport (ONT), it will take you nearly six hours to reach your destination in Chi-Town. Since ORD is often named among the world's top ten busiest airports, hop on a shuttle bus to navigate crowds to the rental car area. Then, jump behind the wheel and take I-90, or Kennedy Expressway, towards downtown to start your exciting Chicago adventure.
