Cheap flights to Fort Lauderdale
With miles of smooth shoreline in south Florida, Fort Lauderdale never disappoints true beachgoers. Whether you stay at a boutique hotel or a luxury resort along Ocean Drive, you'll wake up to the beautiful sun rise over the Atlantic Ocean. You don't even have to wander far from the beaches to shop for designer apparel at The Galleria at Fort Lauderdale or the Harbor Shops. Interested in boarding a cruise heading towards the Caribbean Sea? You should get in line at Port Everglades, one of the busiest cruise terminals on the east coast.
Getting Around
Situated along the intersection of Interstate 595 and the Florida Turnpike, Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport (FLL) is only a short drive away from the heart of Fort Lauderdale. At the Fort Lauderdale Station, you can also board a Tri-Rail train to navigate southern Florida and reach Miami. With plenty of onsite parking, Lockhart Stadium is easily accessible by car if you'd like to watch the Strikers score some goals. Take a stroll along the Riverwalk and discover cultural treasures inside the Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale and the historic Stranahan House.
Hints and Tips
Having a tropical climate, Fort Lauderdale is blessed with sunshine all year long. If you'd like to enjoy the oceanfront far away from some of the crowded beaches, spend some quiet time at Hugh Taylor Birch State Park.
