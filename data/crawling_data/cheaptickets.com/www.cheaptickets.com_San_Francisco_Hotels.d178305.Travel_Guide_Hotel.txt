Stayed here in 2011 and came back. I'd do it again
The hotel is clean, comfortable, and well staffed. If you're squeamish, there's homeless people on Market Street but they're harmless. In the daytime, it's an active, bustling area. Make sure you've done and gotten everything you need to before you come in at night. There's no restaurants open within ...

Hotels in San Francisco
Despite its large population, San Francisco, California is less than 50 square miles in area, making it one of the most densely populated areas in the United States. Sports fans can see the Giants or 49ers play, and the A's and Raiders are just a quick BART ride over the bay. Art fans will enjoy the current exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art, and everyone can take in the beautiful scenery in Golden Gate Park.
Key facts
The city is easily accessible from San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and Oakland International Airport (OAK), both of which connect to the area's robust public transportation systems, known as BART and Muni. Many hotels are clustered in the downtown area, but you'll also find some in the Fisherman's Warf and Marina district as well. Check out the historic Haight Ashbury area, go shopping in the financial district and catch some waves on the beaches in the Sunset district.
Hints and tips
Though San Francisco does enjoy nice weather year-round, don't expect the hot sun that you'll find in Los Angeles. Bring layers to stay warm on chilly foggy mornings. San Francisco is well-known for being an unprejudiced city and hosts a very popular gay pride festival each year at the end of June.
