Hotels in Charleston
Charleston, South Carolina, is home to some of the richest history of the South. As the place where the first shots of the Civil War were fired, you will find numerous museums, historic sites and parks dedicated to the history of the region. In addition to its rich historical attractions, Charleston is also home to several one-of-a-kind golf courses, highly rated tennis courts, clean beaches and well preserved architecture.
Key facts
One of the most historic spots in Charleston is Battery Park where the locals watched the first shots of the Civil War fired over Fort Sumter. Shadowed by well-preserved antebellum homes, this park is filled with old oaks and magnolia trees overlooking the bay. A walking tour through the Battery will lead you past revolutionary period homes some of which can be toured. The many cobblestone streets will take you to the Market and the Daughters of the Confederacy Museum. One of the many local or national hotels in the area will keep you within walking distance of fine and casual dining options. There are many shops around the Market and on King Street. Golf, tennis, beach activities and fishing are found within miles of downtown Charleston.
Hints and tips
Charleston weather is mild with temperatures ranging from the 40s to mid-80s. Humidity and coastal breezes are common. Charleston is serviced by the Charleston International Airport (CHS).
