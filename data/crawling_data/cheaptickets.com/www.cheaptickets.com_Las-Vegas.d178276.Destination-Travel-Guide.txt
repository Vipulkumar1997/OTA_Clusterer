Glad we upgraded to the newer tower room. It wasn't a glamorous place,but it was ok comfortable and clean.

Beautiful Room Overlooking Vegas Strip
Loved the room - felt like I was living in luxury. There is a fully stocked mini-bar in the room but no refrigerator for general use. You have to be careful about touching the snacks on the tray as the tray is connected to some sort of scale and it may mistakenly charge you for items even if you ...

Good choice if you assist to the Convention Center
Good stay as my wife came for an event at the Las Vegas Convention Center. This hotel has seen better days but is fairly priced, people are very kind and attentive, and has convenience options. It is 15 minutes walk (or two bus stops) from fashion mall for shoppers and a little far away from the ...

Your Las Vegas vacation
Las Vegas isn't just for the wild and rambunctious. Kick back in the calm surrounds of Lorenzi Park for some baseball and a picnic, then get your crazy on with a trip to Poker Palace for the $1 blackjack tables and the chance to strike it rich.
With plenty to see and do on the cheap, CheapTickets can help everyone put a Las Vegas vacation on their bucket list.






Best time to take a vacation to Las Vegas


Las Vegas is a great place to visit any time of the year in relation to both entertainment and weather. The temperatures are at their most comfortable in the late spring or early fall; however, if you can cope with sweltering dry heat, the summer months will be a good time to catch a bargain flight or hotel room. The National Finals Rodeo is massively popular in December of every year, while huge numbers of racing fans flock to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway every March to watch exciting NASCAR. Halloween in Vegas is an incredible experience and is recommended especially if the holiday falls on a weekend.






Insider tips for Las Vegas travel


Pinball Museum
Take a trip down memory lane at the Pinball Museum and try your hand playing on a machine from back in the day.
Swan Court
Watch the magnificent swans in the lagoon alongside the private area at Swan Court at Aureole for a truly memorable dining experience.
Onda Lounge
Enjoy a selection of top wines in a free tasting afternoon every Friday at the Onda Lounge at the Mirage.
Paiute Reservation
Play an unforgettable round of golf at the Paiute Reservation surrounded by nothing but desert and mountains—just watch those bunkers.
the Gun Store
Get some real shooting practice at the Gun Store on East Tropicana, firing off rounds from quality weapons that you probably wouldn’t go near on a daily basis.






Las Vegas highlights


Casinos
Even if you don't want to spend a cent, exploring the casinos is a must on a Las Vegas vacation. From the ritzy surrounds to the cheap 24/7 eateries, you'll be kept entertained for free. Our list of musts includes Caesar's Palace for the marble statues and celeb-sightings, the Golden Nugget to check out the world's biggest piece of gold, and the Mirage for the huge fish tank housing tropical fish, eels and sharks.
Grand Canal Shops at the Venetian
This place is crazy, in a good way. Sit in the square and enjoy free tunes while you watch the gondolas drift by. Go window shopping past the high-end boutiques and watch the rich in their natural habitat. For cheap dining, head to Canonita for some delicious Mexican on your Las Vegas travels.
Live shows
Like the casinos, the live shows in Vegas have to be seen to be believed. Whether you're experiencing the sensory overload of the Cirque du Soleil or seeing a show-biz great (Elton John, for example), nothing completes a Las Vegas vacation like treating yourself to a show. It doesn't have to break the bank, either, with many hotels offering half-price tickets to patrons.
Fremont Street Experience
Grab a $1 hot dog and sit back to watch the free light bulb extravaganza. Shows are held every hour from 8:30 p.m. to midnight, so you have plenty of time to catch the action. Plus, the area is filled with casinos that are much cheaper to play at than the ones on the main strip. When it comes to budget Las Vegas vacation activities, Fremont Street is your winning bet.
Bellagio Fountains
Arguably one of the best free shows in Vegas, these massive fountains come to life every half hour to dance to music and lights. Take advantage of this perfect place to take photos, people-watch and enjoy the legendary buzz – a true Las Vegas travel experience.
