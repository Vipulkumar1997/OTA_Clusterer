Hotels in Austin
The state capital of Texas, Austin consistently ranks as one of the best places to live in the United States. Forbes named Austin ‘America's Fastest Growing City’, ‘Biggest Boom Town’ and ‘Best City for Future Job Growth’. Music lovers head to Austin for live music while sports fans watch the University of Texas Longhorns at facilities north of downtown. Visitors also stay downtown to tour the historical Renaissance Revival capitol building, while every March crowds go to the area to watch 1.5 million Mexican bats migrate to the Congress Avenue Bridge.
Key Facts
Known as the Live Music Capital of the World, music lovers hit the clubs in the Warehouse District, the Red River Music District and many other hot spots. A downtown neighborhood, South of Congress, or simply SoCo, also offers trendy bars and authentic Tex-Mex foods. The public transportation system, Capital Metro, runs routes throughout the city. The hub for air travel, Austin–Bergstrom International Airport (ABIA), greets travelers with live music and local art.
Hints and Tips
With a sub-tropical humid climate, visitors should expect Austin to be warm. Year-round summery weather is ideal for outdoor water recreation at two of the largest reservoirs on the Colorado River, Lake Travis and downtown's Lady Bird Lake. With several outdoor stages, the yearly South by Southwest Festival attracts music and film fans from around the United States.
