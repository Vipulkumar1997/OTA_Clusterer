Nice building. Rooms and lobby. The location is great. It just needs better handling of this great facility to make it the best. They need better mattress. Cleaners need to do a better job. The bedsheets and comforters were not clean. Overall, a great facility. We would stay again.

Somewhat silly complaints in this world but ... Would have like the ability to control lighting better. ie ... switches and dimmers. Bedding seemed odd. Mattress pad in a duvet that slide down, no top sheet and heavy comforter made it hard to get body temperature right. Staff was fantastic.

Hotel was ok, I guess the price is definitely what you pay for. If going through cheap tickets beware the hotel wanted $100 deposit no cash that we were unaware of it which cut into spending money for us. Since we paid cheap tickets, and they paid the Ramada. Also really dumb $10 charge to park your ...

Incredibly affordable and beyond expectations.
There is only one recommendation- update hotel restaurant information in room guide. The customer service within the restaurant also needs to be improved to a level that correlates with the rest of the hotel staff.

Hotels in Philadelphia
As the capital of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia boasts some of the best cultural treasures in the state, like the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts. History buffs will be delighted to tour Independence Hall, where the United States Constitution was drafted. From the Franklin Institute to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, there are plenty of fascinating exhibits to browse in 'The City of Brotherly Love '. Head to the Wells Fargo Center and Lincoln Financial Field to watch Philly's professional sports teams. You can cross the Delaware River to visit neighboring cities in New Jersey such as Camden and Trenton.
Key facts
Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) is connected to downtown Philadelphia via Interstate 95. You can also use SEPTA metro trains and streetcars to navigate the city. Located along the Delaware River, Fish Town and Queen Village are some of the oldest neighborhoods in Philadelphia. Former brick warehouses in these districts have been converted to modern shops and inns. If you're looking to stay in a high rising hotel in the heart of the commercial district, consider booking a room in Market East or Rittenhouse Square.
Hints and tips
The perfect time to visit the Philadelphia Zoo is during the hot summer, when the African wildlife on display will be quite active. Subzero temperatures in Philly are common in the winter time, so be sure to dress warm when you walk along Market Street and look at landmarks like the Philadelphia City Hall and the Liberty Bell. When it gets cold, you can also satisfy your cravings with an authentic Philly Cheesesteak.
