We had a suite which had a unique Texas decor. The staff were helpful with suggestions, prompt, courteous professional and pleasant. I do believe they could have offered guests a discount on food and drinks which would have encouraged us to use the restaurant and bar more often.

Hotels in San Antonio
When you visit San Antonio, you’ll have no shortage of recreational options. The city is home to two major amusement parks: Six Flags Fiesta Texas and SeaWorld. In addition to rides and water-park activities, SeaWorld visitors can watch dolphin and whale shows, and even interact with the mammals. Sports enthusiasts can take in a Spurs basketball game at AT&T; Center. History buffs should head to the historic Alamo. The compound, which is now a museum, is where the most famous battle of the Texas Revolution took place. Across from the Alamo, you’ll find the Ripley’s Believe it Or Not Odditorium and Madame Tussauds Wax Museum.
Key facts
Served by both the San Antonio International Airport (SAT) and Stinson Municipal Airport (SSF), getting into San Antonio is easy via Interstate 410. The famed San Antonio Riverwalk district is close to the Alamo and packed with restaurants and shopping. If amusement parks are on your agenda, consider lodging in San Antonio's Westover Hills area.
Hints and tips
If you visit in the summer, dress comfortably. The average daily high temperature from May through September in San Antonio exceeds 88 degrees. The Riverwalk and Downtown areas are very walkable, and authentic Mexican food and margaritas are easy to find as is Tex-Mex culture and cuisine.
