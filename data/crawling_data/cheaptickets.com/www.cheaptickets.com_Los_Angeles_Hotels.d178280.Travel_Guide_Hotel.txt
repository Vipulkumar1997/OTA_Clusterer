NIce hotel for the price but way too expensive
Parking was way too high at $35 per day. I had to park next door on the rooftop for $22 per day. Also, way too expensive. Didn't eat in the hotel because restaurant prices were way too high. Went elsewhere to eat. Not enough choices for my low budget. Vending machines were also pricey at $3.00 a ...

Decent hotel
OK hotel. Clean room, but the heat/AC not working. It was X-mas time, and it can get cold at night in LA. We had 49 degrees temperatures over night, and felt a bit cold in the room. The lobby could use some upgrades, like new carpet & more decoration. Close to airport, and not much else.

Hotels in Los Angeles
Home to millions of Californians, Los Angeles is where travelers come to experience the celebrity and stardom of modern pop culture. Within its 503 square miles, you'll find iconic treasures like the Griffith Observatory, and cultural touchstones like The Getty Center. Palm trees decorate the avenues around unique attractions like the La Brea Tar Pits, and visitors can hang out with the locals at famous eateries like Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles.
Key Facts
Most visitors to Los Angeles, who arrive by plane, do so through the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), which sits on the coast. A rental car is a must for getting around the city's hundreds of square miles, but finding lodging is a breeze, since L.A. hosts many thousands of tourists and business travelers each day.
Visitors who want to experience beach culture should stay in a hotel around Venice, Mar Vista or Westchester; all situated along the coast. Travelers interested in walking down Sunset Boulevard or visiting Griffith Park will want to stay in Los Feliz or Hollywood.
Hints and Tips
One of the best aspects of Southern California is the ten months of beach weather every year. Visit Venice Beach in November and the boardwalk will be packed with visitors in shorts and swimsuits. However, packing some layers in your suitcase is advisable. Take a hoodie and some jeans even if you're planning a summer vacation. Los Angeles is a desert, and the nights are blissfully cool.
