Hotels in Denver
Towering above most other cities in the United States, Denver, Colorado, is a high-altitude dream. If you're a sports lover, it’s all the better. Home to four major sports teams, you can catch a professional ballgame any time of the year at the Bronco's Sports Authority Field at Mile High, the Rockies' Coors Field, or the Nuggets' Pepsi Center. Enjoy one of many days of sunshine at the Denver Zoo, which is located in the expansive and scenic City Park. Just adjacent to the zoo are the celebrated Denver Museum of Nature and Science and the Denver Art Museum.
Key facts
Lower Downtown Denver, or LoDo, has been carefully revived and is now one of the hippest and most iconic areas of the city. It's dotted with Victorian and turn-of-the-century buildings that house breweries, lively restaurants and robust coffee shops. Capitol Hill is alight with Colorado history in the form of the gold-topped Colorado State Capitol and the infamous Molly Brown's historic home. Visit one of the most beautiful spots in Denver at the Botanical Gardens as it explodes with color in the spring and summer months.
Hints and tips
Denver is known for snow, but most importantly, it's known for its sunshine. The Mile High City gets more than 300 days of sunshine a year. No matter the time of year you're visiting, pack your sunblock. Even in the midst of winter, you can still burn easily.
