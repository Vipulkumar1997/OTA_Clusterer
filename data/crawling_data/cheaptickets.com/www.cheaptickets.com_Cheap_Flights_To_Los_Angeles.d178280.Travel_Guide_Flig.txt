Cheap flights to Los Angeles
When you find yourself in the City of Angels, you can enjoy the arts, shopping, cuisine and more. For the best of the beaches, head to the Venice Beach Boardwalk, which is full of walkways, bike paths, skate parks, shopping and waterfront dining at venues like Danny’s Venice. At the southern end, you can fish for your own dinner off the fishing pier. For a family friendly beach and boardwalk, head to the Santa Monica Pier and visit the aquarium and Pacific Park. Take a drive along Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills to see Los Angeles from above, as well as the homes of famous personalities.
Getting Around
Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), is the main airport when you fly to Los Angeles. There are nine terminals arranged in a U shape, and there are buses to take you between terminals. You can rent a car at the airport or take a shuttle, metro link or cab to your destination. If you choose to get a rental, Los Angeles freeways have carpool lanes, which can help you avoid the traffic that often occurs around the city.
Hints and Tips
You can learn about the Japanese American culture in Little Tokyo. Visit the Japanese American National Museum, and then enjoy the entertainment district and authentic Japanese American cuisine.
