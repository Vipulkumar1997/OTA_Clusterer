Disputes and Arbitration

Priceline is committed to customer satisfaction. If you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve it. If
                  we are unsuccessful, you may pursue your claim as explained in this section.
You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any problem, dispute, or claim relating in any way to the
                  Priceline websites and/or any of its related applications or services (the "Site"); any dealings with
                  our customer service agents; the purchase, use, or performance of any services or products available through
                  this Site; any representations made by Priceline; or our Privacy Policy (collectively, "Claims") by
                  providing Notice to Customer Support. Unless prohibited by applicable law, any Claim must be brought within two
                  (2) years from the date on which such Claim arose or accrued. If we are unable to resolve your Claims within 60
                  days, you may seek relief through arbitration or small claims court, as set forth below.
These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of
                  America, without regard to conflict of laws. All Claims or other matters in dispute between you or any
                  Third-party and Priceline, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering
                  products or services through the Site, whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall likewise be
                  governed by the laws of the State of Connecticut, without regard to conflict of laws provisions that would
                  result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.



Mandatory Arbitration


Please read this provision carefully.
It requires that any and all claims must be resolved by binding
                  arbitration or in small claims court, and it prevents you from pursuing a class action or similar proceeding in
                  any forum. These limitations apply to any claims against Priceline, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or any
                  travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the site.
In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by an arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. The arbitrator's decision
                  will generally be final and binding, with no right of appeal. Arbitration procedures are simpler and
                  more limited than court procedures.



By using this Site, you, any Third-party, and Priceline agree that any Claim, including claims
                      regarding the applicability or validity of this arbitration provision, shall be resolved exclusively by
                      final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and
                      conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the then applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA
                      ("Rules and Procedures"), except that, pursuant to subsection (e) below, under no
                      circumstances may any claim be brought or arbitrated as a class action or be joined with another person's claim,
                      or proceed on a basis involving claims brought on a purported representative capacity (either on
                      behalf of the general public or other users or persons).
As an exception to arbitration, you, any Third-party, and Priceline retain the right to pursue in a
                      small claims court located in the federal judicial district that includes you or the Third-party’s
                      billing address at the time of the Claim, any Claim that is within the court's jurisdiction and proceeds
                      on an individual basis. All Claims you or a Third-party bring against Priceline, its subsidiaries or
                      affiliates, or any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the Site must
                      be resolved in accordance with this Disputes and Arbitration Section. All Claims filed or brought
                      contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed and void.



If you decide to seek arbitration, you must first send, by certified mail, a written Notice of
                      Dispute ("Notice") addressed to: Legal Department, priceline.com LLC, 800 Connecticut Avenue,
                      Norwalk, CT 06854 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the
                      Claim; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Priceline and you, or Priceline and any Third-party,
                      do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within 60 days after the Notice is received, you, or the
                      Third-party, may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any
                      settlement offer made shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the
                      amount, if any, to which you, any Third-party, or Priceline is entitled.



The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and
                      Procedures, or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon.



To the extent that any Claim is held not to be subject to arbitration and proceeds in a Court
                      other than small claims court, such Claim shall be filed only in the United States District Court for
                      Connecticut or, if there is no federal jurisdiction over the action, in the courts of the State of Connecticut
                      located in Fairfield County, Connecticut. You hereby consent and submit to the personal
                      jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such Claim that is not subject to the arbitration
                      provision and not pursued in small claims court, and agree that any such claim shall be resolved
                      individually, without resort to any form of class action (as described more fully in section
                      I.A.2.e below). You further agree that any and all Claims or other matters asserted in such dispute,
                      whether based upon contract, tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of
                      Connecticut, without regard to conflict of laws provisions that would result in the application of the
                      laws of any other jurisdiction.




You and any third-party further agree that no proceeding against Priceline, its affiliates, or
                        any travel service providers or companies offering products or services through the site (under this
                        provision or otherwise) may proceed as a class action, be joined with another person’s claim, or
                        proceed on a basis involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity (either on behalf of
                        the general public or other users or persons).
Any and all proceedings to resolve claims will be
                        conducted only on an individual basis. In addition, no arbitration proceeding under this provision shall
                        be consolidated or joined in any way with any other arbitration proceeding without the express written
                        consent of all parties.



For any arbitration initiated pursuant to this agreement involving Claims that together seek
                      damages that do not exceed $25,000, Priceline will reimburse you for all fees and costs imposed by AAA. If
                      you are unable to pay the filing fee, Priceline will pay it for you. For any arbitration involving
                      Claims that together seek damages that exceed $25,000, if you, or any Third-party, prevail in the
                      arbitration of any Claim against Priceline, Priceline will reimburse such prevailing party for any fees or
                      costs the prevailing party paid to AAA in connection with the arbitration.



If you prevail in the arbitration of any Claim against Priceline and are awarded an amount greater
                      than Priceline’s last written settlement offer to you, Priceline will pay a minimum recovery of $5,000,
                      and Priceline will reimburse you for all reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in arbitrating the
                      Claim(s) upon which you have prevailed. If any Third-party prevails in the arbitration of any Claim against
                      Priceline and is awarded an amount greater than Priceline’s last written settlement offer to such
                      Third-party, Priceline will pay a minimum recovery of $5,000 to the Third-party, and Priceline
                      will reimburse such Third-party for all reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in arbitrating the Claim
                      upon which he or she has prevailed. Any dispute regarding attorney’s fees to be paid pursuant to this
                      paragraph will be decided by the arbitrator who decided the underlying Claim. If you or the
                      Third-party do not prevail on the claim or prevail but are awarded an amount less than or equal to Priceline’s
                      last written settlement offer to you, Priceline will pay only the amount of the award, not the minimum
                      recovery or attorneys’ fees.



Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any of the Rules and Procedures established by AAA
                      which may be to the contrary, Priceline will not be entitled to seek reimbursement of its attorney’s
                      fees for any Claim the arbitrator finds to be non-frivolous.



With the exception of sub-part (e) above (the class action waiver), if any part of this
                      arbitration provision is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules
                      and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in
                      effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or
                      conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (e) above (the class action waiver) is
                      held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be
                      null and void, and neither you nor any Third-party, nor Priceline shall be entitled to arbitrate their
                      dispute.



Arbitration rules and forms may be obtained from AAA at https://www.adr.org or by calling AAA at
                      1-800-778-7879.




If you or any third-party do not choose to accept this binding arbitration provision, you or
                        such third-party must notify Priceline in writing by certified mail within thirty (30) days of your
                        purchase or before you begin to use the services purchased on this site, whichever date is sooner.
Such notice shall be sent to the notice address defined in subsection (b), above. If you so notify us
                      by that time that you do not accept the binding arbitration provision, you and any such third-party may
                      not continue to purchase services or products on this site unless and until Priceline notifies you or
                      such third-party otherwise. Priceline shall have the right to prohibit your and such third-party’s
                      future purchase of services or products on this site.

            to use, for example, by your posting of a hashtag Priceline is promoting or other indication of acceptance of
            these terms and conditions.

            services; (e) is a communication by a user impersonating another user; (f) contains personal information, such

Travel Services





General




Pricing

Priceline endeavors to publish and maintain accurate prices and information for its services. Travel
                  service providers provide us with the price, availability and other information related to these services. In
                  the event, however, that a service is listed or provided to us at an incorrect price or with incorrect
                  information due to typographical error or other error in pricing or service information received from a travel service
                  providers, we retain the right to refuse or cancel any Requests placed for such service, whether or not the order
                  has been confirmed and/or your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the
                  purchase and your Request is canceled because of incorrect hotel, airline, or car provider information, we will
                  promptly issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the charge.



Travel Service Providers

You agree to abide by the terms or conditions of purchase imposed by any Travel Service Provider,
                  whether that Travel Service Provider is selected by you or by priceline.com, including, but not limited to, payment
                  of all amounts when due and compliance with the Travel Service Provider's rules and restrictions regarding
                  availability and use of fares, products, or services. You understand that any violation of any such Travel Service
                  Provider's conditions of purchase may result in cancellation of your reservation(s) or purchase(s), in your being
                  denied access to any flights, hotels, or automobiles, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such
                  reservation(s) or purchase(s), and in priceline.com debiting your account for any costs priceline.com incurs as a result
                  of such violation. You shall be completely responsible for all charges, fees, duties, taxes, and assessments
                  arising out of the use of this Site.
You agree that we will not be liable for any injury, loss, claim, damage, or any special, exemplary,
                  punitive, indirect, incidental or consequential damages of any kind, which arises out of or is in any way
                  connected with the performance or non-performance of any Travel Service Provider. In the event of non performance
                  resulting from bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of a Travel Service Provider,
                  you agree that your sole recourse shall be toward such Travel Service Provider and not toward us.
At Priceline, we have no special knowledge regarding the suitability for disabled persons of any
                  reservation. For information concerning the suitability for disabled persons for any reservation, contact the
                  Travel Service Provider directly.

Flights




Airline Rules

Airline tickets available through this Site are subject to the published conditions of carriage and
                  rules, including but not limited to cancellation policies, of the applicable airline. The contract of
                  carriage in use by the applicable airline, when issued, shall be between the applicable airline and the passenger.
                  Airlines retain the right to adjust flight times and schedules at any time. Airlines may also in their
                  discretion change or cancel flights or itineraries. Different tickets on the same airline may carry
                  different restrictions or include different services.



Code Share

Some airlines enter into "code share" agreements with a limited number of select airline
                  partners. This means that on certain routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the flight does not fly
                  its own aircraft to that destination. Instead, it contracts with a partner airline to fly to that destination.
                  The partner airline is listed as "operated by." In most cases you will check in with your
                  "operating" carrier; however, you should verify your flight check-in location with your
                  ticketing carrier. If your flight is a code share, it will be disclosed to you in the booking process and prior
                  to your payment on a price disclosed, retail airline ticket. If your Express Deals ® itinerary contains a
                  code share, it will be disclosed to you when your booking is confirmed, along with other itinerary
                  information.



Hazardous Materials

Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in your luggage or on your
                  person. A violation can result in five years’ imprisonment and penalties of $250,000 or more (49 U.S.C. 5124).
                  Hazardous materials include explosives, compressed gases, flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers,
                  poisons, corrosives and radioactive materials. Examples include paints, lighter fluid, fireworks, tear gases,
                  oxygen bottles, and radio-pharmaceuticals. There are special exceptions for small quantities (up to 70 ounces
                  total) of medicinal and toilet articles carried in your luggage and certain smoking materials carried
                  on your person. See
https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ash/ash_programs/hazmat/passenger_info/
for more information.



Airline Prohibited Practices

You agree not to purchase a ticket or tickets containing flight segments that you will not be using,
                  such as a "point-beyond", "hidden-city", or "back-to-back tickets" if those
                  practices are prohibited by the airline(s). You further agree not to purchase a round-trip ticket that you plan
                  to use only for one-way travel if that practice is prohibited by the airline(s). You acknowledge that most
                  airlines prohibit all such tickets, and therefore we do not guarantee that the airline will honor your ticket
                  or tickets if you engage in these practices. You agree to indemnify the Covered Parties against airline
                  claims, on the basis of these or any other prohibited practices, for the difference between the full fare of
                  your actual itinerary and the value of the ticket or tickets that you purchased.



Use of Flight Segments

Most airlines require you to use flight coupons in sequential order. For those airlines who allow the
                  use of a ticket for only one segment, if you do not cancel all or part of your journey prior to the departure
                  of any segment of your itinerary, you may forfeit up to the value of your airline ticket, depending on
                  the rules of the fare purchased.



One Way Tickets

For certain itineraries, you are able to purchase two one way tickets on the Site rather than a round
                  trip fare. If you do so, you will be making two separate bookings with two separate and different rules and
                  policies (for example, for baggage fees, change fees, and refunds). Any changes made to one of your
                  bookings will not affect the other booking (for example, if your initial flight is cancelled by either you or
                  the airline, the other airline with which you booked your return flight is not obligated to issue a refund
                  or change your itinerary). If you are traveling internationally, you may need to provide proof that you
                  have a return flight at check in and at immigration.



Information Required by The Transportation Security Administration

The Transportation Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security requires us to
                  collect information from you for purposes of watch list screening, under the authority of 49 U.S.C.
                  section 114, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. TSA may share information you
                  provide with law enforcement or intelligence agencies or others under its published system of records notice.
                  For more on TSA Privacy policies, or to view the system of records notice and the privacy impact
                  assessment, please see TSA's Web site at
www.tsa.gov
.



Additional Restrictions for Flight Express Deals

The following restrictions apply to priceline.com's Express Deals® flight service:


All flight reservations are non-cancelable, non-refundable, non-changeable and non-transferable by you.
                    Once you purchase a reservation, your method of payment will be charged for the amount shown -
                    regardless of whether or not the reservation is used. Credit will not be given for any unused
                    reservations and cannot be used toward any future purchases.

We or the airline may, on an exception basis and at the request of the airline passenger, waive one or
                    more of the restrictions after the flight has been booked. We may, in our discretion, impose additional
                    obligations and/or fees in connection with any such waiver.





Taxes and Fees on Published Price Airline Tickets

Government imposed taxes and fees and any applicable airline imposed fees are included in your fare .
                  Tax rates in effect at time of purchase are applied to your ticket price. Retroactive tax rate increases
                  may be the responsibility of the traveler.



Itinerary Changes/Cancellations/Refunds

Air travel itinerary changes, if permitted by the airline fare rules, may have a change fee
                      charged by the airline typically ranging between $200 and $300 USD per ticket that will vary by market,
                      carrier and specific fare rule. In addition, any changes made with Priceline to your itinerary will incur a
                      per ticket Priceline processing fee.



Baggage and Other Ancillary Airline Fees

Airlines may require you to pay additional fees at the airport for certain services and/ or if you
                      exceed certain limits as dictated by the airline, such as the number of bags or weight allowed,
                      and some airlines do not offer a free baggage allowance. Some airlines charge additional fees for other
                      services, for example, for carry on baggage, priority boarding and seat assignments. During the
                      booking process, Priceline provides a summary of key terms of an airline’s baggage fees, but each airline
                      should be consulted for complete information about its baggage and ancillary fees.





International Travel




Passports, Visas, Hazards, and Disinsection

It is your responsibility to ensure that you have obtained any necessary visas for international
                      travel
                      to or from the United States and that your passport will be accepted for travel.

Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without
                      incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Priceline therefore urges
                      passengers to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the
                      United States Government prior to booking travel to international destinations. For State Department
                      travel warnings and advisories, go to
https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings.html
.
                      For foreign health requirements and dangers, go to
www.cdc.gov/travel/index.htm
.
                      Other information relating to particular international destinations can be found at

, or
www.cbp.gov
.

Although not commonly used, disinsection is permitted under international law in order to protect
                      public health, agriculture and the environment. The World Health Organization and the International Civil
                      Aviation Organization stipulate two approaches for aircraft disinsection--either spray the
                      aircraft cabin with an aerosolized insecticide while passengers are on board or treat the aircraft's
                      interior surfaces with a residual insecticide (residual method) while passengers are not on board. For more
                      information about disinsection or to review a list of airline contacts for disinsection and a list
                      of countries that require disinsection, please visit the Department of Transportation website at
http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/policy/safetyenergyenv/disinsection.htm
.


By offering or facilitating travel to or from particular international destinations, we do not
                        represent or warrant that travel to or from such points is advisable or without risk, and we
                        shall not be liable for damages or losses that may result from travel to or from such destinations.




Airline Entry/Exit Fees

If you are traveling internationally, some countries or airports charge fees upon entering and/or
                      exiting the country. These fees are not included in the ticket price, or the taxes and fees we
                      display on our website prior to purchase. For more information on a specific country's entry/exit fee, we
                      suggest that you visit
www.travel.state.gov
prior to departure.








Hotels




General




Priceline

Sometimes cheaper rates are available for a specific stay at a hotel, however, these rates made
                      available by hotels may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example regarding cancellation and
                      refund. Please check the room and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your
                      reservation. Prices, rates and inventory are subject to availability from the hotel.



Check In

Upon check-in, the reservation holder must present a valid ID and credit card or, in the hotel's
                      discretion, debit card, in his or her name (the amount of available credit required will vary by hotel). Debit
                      cards may not be accepted. The guest on the reservation must be 21 years or older to check into the hotel.



Double Occupancy

All hotel reservations are guaranteed for double occupancy (i.e. 2 adults). Unless
                          specifically noted, accommodations for more than two adults are not guaranteed. Some hotels may not allow extra
                          guests. If your hotel does allow extra guests, there may be additional charges. These charges vary and
                          will be payable directly to the hotel.



Late Arrival and Failure to Check-in on First Night

While you should call Priceline if you wish to cancel a cancellable reservation in advance of
                          your stay, if you are going to be delayed on your date of check in or find that you cannot check in to
                          your hotel on the date you requested, you should contact the hotel to let them know. If you fail to check
                          in to your hotel on the day of your reservation and do not alert the hotel, the remaining portion of
                          your reservation may be canceled and you may not be entitled to a refund, depending on the terms
                          and conditions of the applicable hotel.





Cancellations and Changes to Your Reservation

Hotel cancellation policies vary. Certain reservations are non-cancellable and non-changeable.
                      Others require you to pay a penalty if you cancel. Still others are fully refundable. Check the hotel
                      cancellation policy when you book.



Disability Needs

If you have disability needs, you must call the hotel and verify that your disability needs can be
                      met. If your disability needs cannot be accommodated by the hotel, please call Priceline customer service.



Hotel Accommodations and Special Requests

Depending upon which Priceline.com hotel reservation service you use, you may or may not be able
                      to select your room type and number and type of beds (as is the case for Name Your Own Price ® and
                      Express Deals®). Room assignments are based on hotel availability and are at the hotel's discretion.
                      For hotels that allow smoking on premises, we cannot guarantee a non-smoking room for every property. If you
                      have special requests, you must always call the hotel and verify that it can meet your special requests
                      after you have made your booking. Priceline.com cannot accommodate or guarantee that special requests will
                      be met.



Hotel Star Ratings

Priceline.com's star rating system is provided for your reference. Like other well-known hotel
                      rating systems, priceline.com considers a number of factors in evaluating the quality of participating
                      hotels such as: amenities, facilities, reputation, brand, other rating services, customer feedback from guests
                      who have stayed at the hotel, etc., to assign a single star rating. Priceline.com screens participating
                      hotels carefully and updates our information periodically to ensure the validity of our ratings. Our
                      ratings systems may sometimes differ from those of other rating systems that you may be familiar with. We
                      do not warrant or guarantee that our star rating system is equal to or consistent with any other star
                      rating system and reserve the right to change a hotel's rating at any time with or without notice.



Charges for Taxes and Fees

In connection with facilitating your transaction, we will charge your method of payment for Taxes
                      and Fees. This charge includes an anticipated amount to recover the amount we pay to the hotel in connection
                      with your reservation for taxes owed by the hotel including, without limitation, sales and use tax,
                      occupancy tax, room tax, excise tax, value added tax and/or other similar taxes. In certain locations, the tax
                      amount may also include government imposed service fees or other fees not paid directly to the taxing
                      authorities but required by law to be collected by the hotel. The amount paid to the hotel in connection with your
                      reservation for taxes may vary from the amount we anticipate and include in the charge to you. The
                      balance of the charge for Taxes and Fees is a fee we retain as part of the compensation for our services
                      and to cover the costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs. The charge
                      for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors including, without limitation, the amount we pay the
                      hotel and the location of the hotel where you will be staying, and may include profit that we retain.
Except as described below, we are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable
                      taxing authorities. Our hotel suppliers, as vendors, bill all applicable taxes to us and we pay over such
                      amounts directly to the vendors. We are not a co-vendor associated with the vendor with whom we book or
                      reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable
                      taxes vary greatly by location.
For transactions involving hotels located within certain jurisdictions, the charge to your debit
                      or credit card for Taxes and Fees includes an additional payment of tax that we are required to collect and
                      remit to the jurisdiction for tax owed on amounts we retain as compensation for our services.
Depending on the property you stay at you may also be charged (i) certain mandatory hotel specific
                      service fees, for example, resort fees, energy surcharges, newspaper delivery fees, in-room safe fees,
                      tourism fees, or housekeeping fees and/or (ii) certain optional incidental fees, for example, parking
                      charges, minibar charges, phone calls, room service and movie rentals, etc. These charges, if applicable,
                      will be payable by you to the hotel directly at checkout. When you check in, a credit card or, in the
                      hotel's
                      discretion, a debit card, will be required to secure these charges and fees that you may incur
                      during your stay. Please contact the hotel directly as to whether and which charges or service fees apply.
The charges may also include destination marketing fees collected by the hotel and passed along to
                      tourist bureaus. If you are a citizen of a country other than the United States and you travel to your
                      home country, you may owe additional taxes to the hotel at check out. Contact the hotel if you have questions.





Express Deals® Hotel Service

The following restrictions apply to priceline.com's Express Deals® hotel service:


Unless specifically noted otherwise, all hotel reservations are non-cancelable, non-refundable,
                    non-changeable and non-transferable by you. Once you purchase a reservation, your method of payment will
                    be charged for the amount shown - regardless of whether or not the reservation is used. Credit will not be
                    given for any unused reservations and cannot be used toward any future purchases.

Upon check-in, the reservation holder must present a valid ID and credit card or, in the hotel's
                    discretion, debit card, in his or her name that is consistent with the transactional details provided to
                    priceline.com (the amount of available credit required will vary by hotel). Debit cards may not be
                    accepted.

We or the applicable hotel may, on an exception basis and at the request of the hotel guest, waive one or
                    more of the restrictions after the hotel room has been booked. We may, in our discretion, impose
                    additional obligations and/or fees in connection with any such waiver. You agree that if your booking is
                    successful, priceline.com will confirm the reservation and charge the entire amount of the stay, including
                    applicable Taxes and Fees (as described below) disclosed to you before booking, to your method of payment.
                    The price listed is per night and does not include priceline.com's charge to you for Taxes and Fees.

For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told both a) the Total Priceline Charges to your method
                    of payment and b) the total cost, which includes the Total Priceline Charges and the Hotel Mandatory Fee
                    which the hotel will charge at check out. Your Total Charges and the Room Rate may include compensation to
                    priceline.com for our facilitation services.

If you have special room requests (including, for example, preferences for smoking or nonsmoking rooms,
                    a specific room, particular bedding, floor location, connecting rooms, or pet accommodations),
                    you must call the hotel and verify that special requests can be met after you have made your booking.
                    Priceline.com cannot accommodate special requests in advance of your booking and cannot guarantee that
                    special requests will be met. A hotel reservation cannot be refunded, canceled or modified on the basis
                    that a special request was not (or could not be) met by the hotel.





Name Your Own Price® Hotel Service

The restrictions described above in the Express Deals® section also apply to priceline.com’s Name Your
                  Own Price® hotel service. Additionally, once you submit a request on priceline.com, you cannot modify
                  it. You also agree that if your offer is accepted, priceline.com will confirm the reservation and charge
                  the entire amount of the stay, including applicable Taxes and Fees disclosed to you before submitting an
                  offer, to your method of payment. The price you name is per night and does not include priceline.com's charge
                  to you for Taxes and Fees. Your offer price may include, in addition to amounts paid to the hotel for
                  your reservation, compensation to priceline.com for our facilitation services.
The "median retail price" which we may display to you is the median of the lowest rates our
                  participating hotels are offering to the general public for the exact or approximate travel dates you
                  selected based on information our hotel suppliers have loaded. These rates are based on the quality
                  level you chose, the city, and the area you selected. These rates are available through our disclosed hotel
                  service or were recorded at the time of booking and do not include rates that are restricted to
                  membership programs. Although we routinely review this data, we make no guarantee or warranty, with respect to
                  the accuracy or completeness of the data used or provided. Further, we make no guarantee or warranty that
                  a room will be available below or within the disclosed price range. The ranges are provided to you solely for
                  information purposes and are not actual rates. All hotel pricing information is subject to change
                  without
                  notice.



Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service

Priceline.com’s Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service is a hotel service whereby the price of the
                  hotel is disclosed to the User in advance of booking and whereby priceline.com acts as the merchant of record
                  on the transaction (i.e., directly charges your credit card). The "Total Charges" that you will pay
                  for using our Merchant Price Disclosed Hotel Service will always be disclosed to you before you submit
                  your Request. For hotels that charge mandatory fees, you will be told both a) the Total Priceline Charges
                  to your method of payment and b) the total cost, which includes the Total Priceline Charges and the Hotel
                  Mandatory Fee which the hotel will charge at check out. Your Total Charges and the Room Rate may include
                  compensation to priceline.com for our facilitation services.



Agency Hotel Service

For priceline.com's Agency Hotel Service, Priceline is not the merchant of record and does not charge
                  your credit card or other form of payment. For these transactions, if you are required to enter a credit
                  card number, you will be notified that your credit card will be used to guarantee the reservation and that
                  the hotel will charge you directly for room and tax and any other charges. Certain accommodations only
                  accept cash even if a credit card is used to book the reservation; this information will be disclosed to you.
                  You will be provided with a "Total Estimated Charges" line item on your contract page that will
                  provide you with an estimate of what the hotel will charge you, which will include taxes. Unless
                  expressly stated, taxes and service fees are excluded from your room cost, but are shown to you in the "Taxes
                  and Fees" line. Taxes are included in the Total Estimated Charges. For hotels that charge mandatory
                  fees, you will be told the Hotel Mandatory Fee which the hotel will charge at check out. Any mandatory fee
                  is also included in the "Total Estimated Charges" line.
Agency Hotel Service reservations require credit or debit card details to guarantee your reservation.
                  As such, we will send your credit or debit card information directly to the hotel at which your booking
                  is made and we may verify (i.e. pre-authorize) your credit card as well. For certain rates or special offers
                  that state that a deposit is required (which will be disclosed to you ), please note that your credit card
                  may be pre-authorized or charged by the hotel (sometimes without any option for refund) upon reservation
                  and confirmation of the booking. Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to
                  making your reservation.
You accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of the hotel, and to any
                  additional (delivery) terms and conditions of the hotel that may apply to your reservation or during your stay,
                  including for services rendered and/or products offered by the hotel (the delivery terms and
                  conditions of a hotel can be obtained with the relevant hotel). The general cancellation and no-show policy is made
                  available on our website at the hotel information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the
                  confirmation email. Please note that certain rates or special offers that require an upfront deposit
                  to the hotel (which will be disclosed in the Booking Conditions) are not eligible for cancellation or change.
                  Please check the room details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.






Rental Cars




General

Vehicle rentals available through this Site are subject to standard rental contracts of the car rental
                  companies, which will be completed by you at the time of pick-up of a vehicle. For retail price
                  disclosed rental car reservation, Priceline is not the merchant of record and does not charge your credit card.
                  Actual prices may vary depending on special requests and items purchased at the counter. Pricing may change
                  if you pick-up, or drop-off the car at a different date, time or location than you requested in your
                  reservation or for other reasons at the discretion of the rental car company. While you may request child seats and
                  other special requests, the requests are not guaranteed and are provided at the discretion of the rental car
                  company. At the time of pick up, the driver will be required to present a valid driver's license, and
                  a valid credit card in his/her name. Some locations also accept debit cards; however, rental partners
                  have different requirements for customers who will only have a debit card at the time of pickup. While our
                  rental car partners strive to honor your request for car type (economy, full size, SUV etc.), your requested
                  car type is not guaranteed to be available. Specific cars, makes and models are not guaranteed and listed
                  car makes and model are for example only. Car fleet information including capacities is based on the
                  latest information provided to us by the supplier and is subject to change.



Charges for Taxes and Service Fees

In connection with facilitating your Name Your Own Price® or Express Deals® rental car
                  transaction, we will charge your method of payment, in addition to base rate, a charge for Taxes and
                  Fees (an amount that will always be disclosed to you before you elect to proceed). This charge includes an
                  amount to recover the amount we pay to the rental car supplier in connection with your reservation for taxes,
                  fees and surcharges owed by the rental car supplier including, without limitation, sales and use tax,
                  excise tax, value added tax, airport or facility taxes, surcharges or fees and/or other similar taxes, surcharges
                  or fees. The amount of this charge is intended by us to be sufficient to cover the amount we may be
                  required to pay to a rental car supplier, and may be greater or less than the amount we actually pay the rental
                  car supplier in connection with your reservation for taxes, fees and surcharges. The balance of the charge
                  for Taxes and Fees is a fee which we retain as part of the compensation for our services and to cover the
                  costs of your reservation, including, for example, customer service costs and additional fees. The charge
                  for Taxes and Fees varies based on a number of factors, such as the amount you pay to priceline.com and
                  the location at which you will pick-up your car from the rental car supplier. The "Total Charges"
                  that you will pay to Priceline for using our Name Your Own Price® or Express Deals® rental car
                  service will always be disclosed to you before you submit your Request.
We are not the vendor collecting and remitting taxes to the applicable taxing authorities. The rental
                  car companies, as vendors, bill all applicable taxes to us and we pay over such amounts directly to the
                  vendors. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate and the type of applicable taxes vary greatly by location.
In connection with facilitating your retail rental car transaction, we will attempt to provide you,
                  when the information is available, with a breakdown of the estimated taxes, fees and surcharges that may apply
                  to your transaction. We will not charge you for these taxes, fees and surcharges, but the car rental
                  supplier will.

                    non-refundable;

A valid Driver's License AND credit card or, in the rental car company's discretion, a debit card, which
                    is consistent with the transactional details provided to priceline.com, must be presented when a vehicle
                    is picked-up at the designated location;

When picking up the vehicle, a credit card or, in the rental car company's discretion, a debit card, will
                    be required for a security deposit and to pay for any additional ancillary charges (including insurance,
                    child seats, gas, etc.).

All rentals will include Taxes, Fees, and Surcharges ("TFS") associated with the Time and
                    Mileage (T&M;) for the rental based on the timing and pick-up/drop-off of the rental; and

                    that accepts your request and is over what you paid Priceline for your reservation. These charges are
                    payable directly to the rental company.

Vacation Package Restrictions

In addition to the rules for specific services and packages already listed in these Terms & Conditions,
              the following restrictions apply to components of your Vacation Package:



Cancellations/Itinerary Changes

Cancellation policies vary based upon the travel components in your package. The applicable cancel
                  policy for individual reservations can be reviewed prior to purchase. When cancellations or changes are
                  allowed, the airline, hotel or rental car company may charge a cancellation fee or penalty. Priceline
                  Negotiator Flight tickets, Priceline Value Rate hotel room reservations, and discounted rental car reservations
                  are non-cancelable, non-transferable and non-changeable and no refunds are allowed.



Breakout of Cost of Components

Priceline is able to offer savings on vacation packages because the components of the package are
                  bundled together. We are not, therefore, able to itemize for you the cost of each component that makes up a
                  package.








Miscellaneous & Registrations

In the event that any provision of this Agreement is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, such
          provision
          shall nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and such determination
          shall
          not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.
