Senior Discount





Senior Rates

Passengers 55 and older by their departure date can qualify for special rates. You must confirm your age with a
								government-issued ID (we recommend a passport or driver's license) at the pier before boarding the ship. Most cruise lines qualify seniors as 55 and
								older. Exceptions to this are: Costa Cruises, Crystal Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises. These lines qualify seniors
								as 60 and older.





Past Guest Discount





Past Guest Rates

Most top cruise lines offer special bonuses and rates to past guests; these may include free stateroom
								upgrades and onboard spending credits. If you've sailed before, provide your agent with your past guest number and we'll find the best past guest
								offers available for even greater savings in addition to our already low prices. Cruised before but don't recall your past guest number? Just give
								us a call at
800-735-8000
and we'll be happy to assist you.
