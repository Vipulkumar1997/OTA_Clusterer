About the trip:

Berlin is a cyclists dream! We’ll explore Berlin by bike to make the most of the time we have there. Berlin’s topography is predominately flat and is very cycle friendly so even if you’re not that confident or energetic you’ll have fun taking part.
We do ask that you’re comfortable cycling on roads and cycle paths to fully enjoy this Berlin city break.

We’ll spend time sampling Berlin’s exploding microbrewery scene with a beer sampling experience and in the evening we’ll grab a cabaret show. You’ll also have plenty of time to sample the local beers and the local gay scene (if you so wish!)

Unscene travel holidays are laid back and easy going and you can take part in the planned activities as much or as little as you want.

We recommend booking flights as soon as your place is confirmed,
as they do tend to go up the closer we get to the departure date. We’ve listed your trip leader’s flight below if you’d like to join him from Edinburgh.
