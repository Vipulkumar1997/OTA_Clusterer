GayTravel Riviera Maya, Mexico

Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa's PR Manager, Marisol Ledesma tells us why Riviera Maya is a must visit destination this winter!










Nov 29, 2017





The cultural diversity you can find ar Riviera Maya, especially in Playa del Carmen
,
makes the area a perfect destination for the LGBT people. Besides, the beautiful beaches and places of interest like archaeological sites, milenary cenotes and picturesque cities like Valladolid  there's an ideal place for you to stay; Meet: Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa


GT: What are the top five reasons for LGBT travelers to visit
Belmond Maroma Resort & Spa
?
First reason, the beach, constantly ranked as one of the most beautiful beaches in the world by many magazines, besides, the hotel is aligned to this beach, so no matter where you are, you are just a few steps away. Second, the intimacy you have in this piece of heaven. It is a boutique resort with only 63 rooms and suites, framed by lush jungle and the turquoise waters. There is no better place to unwind and to reconnect with your soulmate than Belmond Maroma. Third, the authentic Mexican experience our guests are welcome and pampered with during their stay. Fourth, the flavors! Everything is about the Mexican flavors that you can find at every menu of our resort. From breakfast with the handmade quesadillas to the contemporary menus that you can enjoy with Mexican wines (yes, Mexico has pretty good wines!). And the last but not the least, the spa, as well, internationally recognized as one of the best spas in Mexico, Kinan Spa offers our guests treatments based on healing Mayan techniques, some of them use honey harvested from our very own Mayan -no stingers- bees, rituals at sunset with a Mayan shaman or simply doing yoga in the morning. Kinan Spa is aligned based on the Sacred Mayan Geometry, so pampering of your body and soul is assured.


GT: What hot spots should the community check out while on holiday?
Belmond Maroma
is very close to many 'must' places to visit, like Chichen Itza, considered one of the new 7 Wonders of the World, as well, it is nearby boho-chic Tulum that you can go to explore after visiting the Mayan ruins of Tulum. You can swim in the natural cenotes, true to this region. Playa del Carmen and its 5th avenue is a good place to walk around and so some shopping, and it is only 20 minutes away from the hotel. If you want to go fancier, Cancun hotel zone is the best place.

GT: Favorite restaurant in Riviera Maya?:
Frida Kahlo, a restaurant in Playa del Carmen.


Favorite place to unwind on the property?:
El Mirador, a very special place in the top of the main building to enjoy either a sunrise or a sunset. It has clear views to the ocean from one side and jungle from the other.

GT: Where’s the best place to enjoy the outdoors?:
The snorkeling trip it is a very nice activity to enjoy during the day. The second largest coral barrier in the world sits right in front to the hotel, making this place perfect for a snorkel or even diving! (we do have PADI certifications too!) Also, the complimentary guided bike tour within the jungle where you can enjoy daily.

GT: What’s one thing that
Riviera Maya
has to offer that you can't find anywhere else?:
This is hard! But I think the beach!


GT: Best gay club/restaurant/attraction?:
Most of the restaurants and bars in Playa del Carmen / Tulum are gay-friendly. In Playa del Carmen, you can find a gay bar named "69 night club".

GT: What three things do I have to pack to enjoy
Belmond Maroma
and Riviera Maya?:
Bathing suits, light pants, and a comfortable shirt. (the rest you can buy here!)

GT: Best time of year to visit?:
Between November through April. Wheater is perfect! Summer time, from June to August is also a good option, could be the second choice


GT: I’m in town for 24 hours: What are 3 things I absolutely have to do?:
Go to the 5th avenue, visit a cenote and have dinner in
Belmond
.

GT: What’s something people would be surprised to learn about
Riviera Maya
?:
The beach in general, from the talcum powder sand, warm waters to the turquoise colors of the Caribbean Sea. It is absolutely magical the vibrant colors and it is internationally very well-know for.
