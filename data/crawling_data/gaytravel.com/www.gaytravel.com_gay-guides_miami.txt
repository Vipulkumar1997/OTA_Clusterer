Gay Miami

Miami is the “Gay Riviera” of the United States East Coast.  Enjoy a margarita and soak up the sun at Miami’s gay beach near Ocean Drive. When night falls, dance the night away at one of the city’s amazing gay and lesbian nightclubs.

When you’re in town, don’t skip gay friendly South Beach. The city has still maintained its reputation as the hotspot gay playground. Here you’ll find a diverse blend of tourists, giving it an international flair, and it’s bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the East, Alton Road to the West, Sixth Street to the South and Dade Boulevard to the North. Think “The Birdcage” with hot, tan bodies everywhere

For those who enjoy sports and thrilling outdoor activities, don’t forget about Miami’s diverse water-based sports. Enjoy parasailing, jet skiing, kite surfing, windsurfing, and much more. South Beach has many areas where you can experience these activities for very affordable rates.

There's also the fabulous Miami gay beach on 12th street! It’s not very hard to find and it is considered one of the must-go places. It is marked with rainbow flags, making it easy to find. This gay beach is a haven for gay men but you’ll also find stupendous amounts of lesbians and straights.

Want to take it a step further? Check out Haulover Beach Park, one of the best nude beaches in the United States. This beach is 11 miles from south beach so a taxi may be too expensive. Thankfully there is another cheaper option; check out the Route 120 Beach MAX, an inexpensive bus alternative.

If you have some time and you’re looking for a break from the pulse of the city, drive to Everglades National Park, where you can see alligator farms and take airboat rides through the swamp.
If you take SW 8th Street all the way from downtown Miami, you can pass through Little Havana and grab some authentic Cuban food for lunch.

Transportation:

Metrorail:
The Miami Metrorail has over 20 different stations.  Although it does not cover all of Miami, it is an inexpensive way of traveling to the different major parts of Miami.

MetroMover:
Experience a great way to travel throughout downtown Miami for FREE. This is ideal if you want to avoid heavy traffic and the pain of finding a parking spot.

Taxi:
Don’t forget about the little yellow cars driving the streets! There are numerous taxi companies all over Miami. Travel fast and easily at your own discretion, these taxis are only a call or a wave away.
