Culture, Fun and EuroPride In Vienna










Nov 30, 2017




Culture,
Fun
and EuroPride in Vienna

Not only in the past did gay members of the aristocracy have fun in
Vienna
. The gay scene still flourishes today. And in 2019,
EuroPride
will again be held in the city on the Danube.

Cosmopolitan Vienna – Then and Now

Whether Prince Eugene of Savoy, Emperor Charles VI or Archduke Luziwuzi – it is still possible to stroll in the footsteps of prominent gay people in Vienna nowadays: The Belvedere Palace, the Karlskirche (Church of St. Charles) and the gay sauna “Kaiserbründl” are ongoing reminders of the homosexual aristocratic trio and an absolute must-see on a visit to Vienna – whatever the time of year.

Gay Events in Vienna

Vienna serves up all sorts of gay events throughout the year: In winter, it’s the gay balls – particularly the
Rainbow Ball
(27 January 2018) – which promise fun and dance in three-four time. Things get really hot in the spring, when the Vienna Boylesque Festival (30 + 31 May 2018), the Vienna Fetish Spring (30 May - 3 June 2018) and the
Life Ball
(probably 2 June 2018) will take to the stage. The highlight in June each year is Vienna Pride (2-16 June 2018). Vienna Pride, which last two full weeks in 2018, starts with the Life Ball. The Pride Run Vienna on 9 June 2018 is just one of the highlights. The Pride Village at City Hall Square offers information, food and parties. And the Rainbow Parade along the Vienna Ringstrasse boulevard on 16 June 2018 is the crowing conclusion. A CSD in front of such a beautiful backdrop does not exist anywhere else in the world! People wearing traditional dirndl costumes and lederhosen sway to the music at the Pink Wiener Wiesn Festival in the autumn.  And fetish fans from around the world look forward to
Vienna Fetish Week
and "Vienna in Black" (25 October - 1 November 2017)

From Shopping to Clubbing

The diverse gay scene around
Gumpendorfer Strasse and Naschmarkt
(5th and 6th districts) is packed with bars. And additional copies of the holiday reading you left at home can be bought in the gay and lesbian bookstore
"Löwenherz"
in the 9th district. However, it remains to be seen whether it is really necessary. Because gay parties in unusual locations - from Art Nouveau buildings to a former slaughterhouse - ensure sleepless nights, especially on the weekend.

EuroPride 2019

Things will get really colorful and varied in 2019, when
EuroPride
comes to Vienna under the motto "Visions of Pride" with dozens of informational, cultural and festival events from 19 May to 19 June.  Exactly 50 years after the rebellion of gays and lesbians in New York's Stonewall Inn, it is being held for the second time in Vienna (first time in 2001). Up to 1.5 million visitors are expected at EuroPride in Vienna. Watch the video to find out exactly what will be waiting for you when you come to Vienna in 2019:
