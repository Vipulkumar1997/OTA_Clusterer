About GayTravel

We created GayTravel to be a model for the type of community we want our world to be:  diverse, inclusive and safe.

For over 20 years, we have traveled the globe seeking gay-friendly, welcoming and inspiring destinations, accommodations, cruises, tours, events, entertainment, attractions, clubs, restaurants, and venues to bring you meticulously curated recommendations that represent the rarified taste of our LGBTQ travelers, Editors, Experts and GayTravel Gurus.

The U.S. Department of State has sought GayTravel’s feedback in developing safe protocols for LGBTQ travelers abroad.  GayTravel has been featured in the
New York Times
,
The Wall Street Journal
and
Smart Money Magazine
.

GayTravel prides itself on working with travel partners around the world who have shown themselves to be gay-friendly and welcoming to the LGBTQ community and who constantly improve their amenities and service levels for all travelers.  GayTravel will decline advertising from companies and organizations that have shown discriminatory behavior toward any minority community.

Those travel partners who manifest a spirit of inclusiveness and who have gone above and beyond are eligible to be designated
GayTravel Approved®
and
GayTravel Approved® Luxury
.  We encourage you to offer recommendations for GayTravel Approved® travel destinations, accommodations, cruises, tours, events, entertainment, attractions, clubs, restaurants, and venues.
