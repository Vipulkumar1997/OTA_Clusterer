Gay Florida

With a beautiful coastline, gay friendly cities, and the worlds ultimate theme park at Disney World, Universal Studios, and Sea World, Florida has been a #1 tourists destination for decades and has more than enough to offer LGBT visitors.

Florida, also known as “The Sunshine State” is a favorite winter hot spot for the LGBT community.  If the beach goer within needs to bust out, there are so many choices for a warm gay-friendly getaway.  You can lie in the white sand on the west coast, hit the eastern shore if you crave more nightlife, or head to the southernmost point for a memorable vacation in the Keys!

The Gay and Lesbian Film Fest in Ft. Lauderdale is a must do as well as our favorite; Gay DayS Orlando!
