Welcome Onboard Travelers

"I will always remember my first cruise — from the incredible ship to the stunning destinations, I never expected to have so much fun. But it's the people I've met and the extraordinary experiences that keep me coming back and setting sail for new adventures more than 200 times. Every time I set foot on a cruise ship, I fall in love with the ocean all over again. I look forward to being your GayTravel.com Cruise Guru and to sharing beautiful stories, photos, and experiences from onboard and around the world with you."

- GayTravel.com Cruise Guru, Stephen Prisco
