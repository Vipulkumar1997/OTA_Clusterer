The thought of going up a lopsided building...is daunting. But I must admit you do go up slightly in the wonk but it's so exciting. Me and my boyfriend got the giggles which made it worse.

visite très bien organisée, respect de l'heure de la visite.
C'est très impressionnant, car on ressent plus notre centre de gravité selon que la tour est penchée.

If you go to Pisa Climbing the tower is a must and pre-booking is the way to go to avoid waiting a long time or missing out altogether.

When booking make sure that the site you are using for payment is secure like this one.

The inside story

Why does the tower lean? The Romanesque 183ft (56m) campanile, was begun in 1170 but started leaning immediately due to the porous clay soil beneath it.
Building diagonal floors to offset the lean was attempted in 1272, but didn’t help. In 1372, the tower was leaning 4.5ft (1.4m). By 1993, it was 17ft (5.4m) and the tower was closed for ten years amid fears it might fall. But by 2013, it had started to lean slightly back in the opposite direction. What was happening?
