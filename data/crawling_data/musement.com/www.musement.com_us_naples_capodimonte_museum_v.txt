The inside story

The Capodimonte Museum is a great place to view pieces from Neapolitan painting and decorative art schools. This building used to be a luxurious palace belonging Charles of Bourbon (King of Naples), the noble that had it made to accommodate his hobbies of hunting - the reason for the 124 acres wood surrounding the palace - and his art collection, inherited from his mother Elisabetta Farnese.
The first and second floors of the Museum house a gallery with paintings from the 13th Century to the 18th Century, a collection started by the King of Naples in the year 1738.
