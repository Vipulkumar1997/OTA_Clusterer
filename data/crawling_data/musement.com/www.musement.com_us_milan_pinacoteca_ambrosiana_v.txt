Pinacoteca Ambrosiana has a very interesting collection with the highlight of course being the work of leonardo.  I would also like to mention the exceptionally effective lighting of all the paintings.  Very discreet, showing the works at the very best advantage.

The people with Musement and Zani Viaggi were wonderful to work with, answering the questions I had ahead of time. Our guide presented very interesting information and guided us charmingly and kindly through the tour. We had an unforgettable experience.

My friend and I visited the art gallery and we really enjoyed ourselves. As a student of literature when I entered da Vinci's Atlantic Codex room I had goosebumps. What an incredible display! Highly recommended!

The library was absolutely fantastic. It is not everyday that you are able to see originals of Leonardo's Atlantic Codex. I was amazed to see long hand multiplications by the master. Definitely worth it.
