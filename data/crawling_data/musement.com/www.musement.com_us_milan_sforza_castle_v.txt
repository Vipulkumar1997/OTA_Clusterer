Our guide was very knowledgeable and amusing.  The group was not too large so everyone had a chance to follow.  Would thoroughly recommend this trip to anyone first time and short of time in Milan. Quite expensive but worth it.

Grazie alla preparazione alla capacità di raccontare della nostra guida, Paolo (non sono sicura del suo nome ma ha capelli e barbetta rossa !) abbiamo trascorso più di due ore interessantissime, catapultandoci all'indietro nei secoli e facendo "entrare" e scoprire il Cenacolo di Leonardo. Grandissim...

The walking tour was a wonderful experience. We normally don't follow tours and do our own thing. The tour has shown us a few other sites not mentioned in the itinerary which we would have missed.

Laura was a super guide which made the tour so wonderful. She knows her stuff! Seriously, she knew the history very well and made it interesting and entertaining. We saw Leonardo's The Last Supper first and this was a "cannot miss" venue for us. The walking tour was like very good icing on a delicio...

We thoroughly enjoyed the tour with our guide Lara. She was extremely knowledgeable and warm. We got to see many beautiful and interesting sites with a nice balance of art, history, architecture, shops and humor. This was our first time in Milan and it was a great way to get started.

The guide was amazing - her knowledge and cheerfulness made my trip to Milan! Besides - seeing the Last Supper is worth every penny. During the Historical Tour you will see details of the city which are hard to be noticed whilst you are sightseeing on your own. Highly recommended.
