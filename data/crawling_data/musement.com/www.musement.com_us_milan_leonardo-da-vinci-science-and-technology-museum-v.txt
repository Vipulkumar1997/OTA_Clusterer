Très belle belle exposition permanente et itinérante... IL faut avoir du temps ( entre 3h/4h, pour les plus rapide) pour l'apprécier tellement il y a de chose à voir... Nous en avons eu pour notre porte-monnaie. ^^

Bellissima esperienza! Il museo è grande, consiglio di andarci la mattina. Noi l'abbiamo visitato a coppie con i bimbi super felici nel vedere treni, aerei e navi. Consigliato.

The inside story

Created in 1953, the Museum of Science and Technology houses the biggest collection of scientific and technological artifacts in Italy, and it holds the largest exhibition space in the world that is devoted to models built based purely on Leonardo da Vinci’s sketches.
In the halls of an old convent, the Museum of Science and Technology is a place of learning that uses displays and interactive activities to describe and teach all about the development of technology in Italian and European history – you can visit the chemistry labs, participate in energy experiments, discover new facts about light and electricity, robotics, genetics and so on. This museum is held in the halls of the "Monastery of San Vittore al Corpo," a church not far from where it is said that Leonardo da Vinci himself owned small plots of land.
