Destinations in Portugal








Alentejo





4 hotels



Known for its cork trees and rolling plains, the stunning region of Alentejo offers visitors a genuine sense of Portuguese rural life.








Algarve





7 hotels



The southerly Algarve is Portugal’s sand-flanked footnote. An ever-mild climate and broad beaches lined with shallow bays make it the country’s postergirl for seaside family holidays, with a smattering of surfers attracted by its Atlantic rollers.








Cascais





1 hotel



Former fishing village, Cascais (‘kesh-kysh’) grew into a genteel summer resort under the patronage of the Portuguese royal family.








Douro Valley





2 hotels



This north-western patch of Portugal is golden by name ('Douro') and golden by nature, with sepia-tinged hills and amber-hued valleys.








Lisbon





3 hotels



Once the stamping ground of Romans, Moors and Crusaders, this historic hillside city has culture, cobbles, cafés, cable cars and cod aplenty.








Porto





2 hotels



Rising from the banks of the Douro passing through it, Porto is a hilly, historic mix of bridges, Baroque churches and narrow mediaeval alleys…








Torres Vedras





1 hotel



This rugged coastal region of northern Lisbon plays three roles, each of them well: respected wine region, aquatic playground, and historic stronghold.

The best wineries to visit in Portugal















Nha Cretcheu at Areias do Seixo, Torres Vedras, Portugal



Having removed bed-facing plasma TVs, formal service and the ubiquitous minibar from the menu, Areias do Seixo has set about redefining luxury, giving nature a starring role: fresh fruit in rooms and furnishings carved from wood. Inside Nha Cretcheu, the futuristic grey stone walls and floors create an austere space, yet the more natural touches – an elevated four-poster bed with a frame hewn from slender wooden boughs, a neatly stacked log pile next to the cosy fireplace, a collection of floor cushions, a private Jacuzzi and an astonishing view of the ocean – all result in a surprisingly relaxing environment.
