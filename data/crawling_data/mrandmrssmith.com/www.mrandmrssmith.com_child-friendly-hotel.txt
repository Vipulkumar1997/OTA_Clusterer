Child-friendly

Our cherry-picked selection of child-friendly hotels and villas is perfect for a luxury family break, both for grown-up Smiths and little boys and girls. Not all of them have supervised toddler-heaven crèches, children's meals, playgrounds and activities to divert young ones (though some have all three), but they do all deliver what’s important – a big welcome for youngsters in the stylish surroundings you’ve come to expect from Mr & Mrs Smith.

Sooner or later, everyone serious about style who comes to Barcelona heads to Passeig de Gracia with space in their suitcase and a credit card that can take a beating. The smartest shoppers minimise their bag-lugging distance by checking into the Catalan capital’s most elegant address – the designer apartments of El Palauet. The art nouveau exterior gives way to a collection of modern, minimalist suites – each equipped with furniture straight out of a primer of 20th-century design classics and staffed by a personal PA, to book your restaurants, bag you tickets and, if need be, help carry your shopping...
