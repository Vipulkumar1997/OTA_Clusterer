L'Orangerie Suite at Jardins Secrets, Nimes, France



Jardins Secrets is not so much a boutique hotel as a beautiful private house that, since 2005, has allowed members of the public to pay for the privilege of staying there. Boutique-hotel lovers everywhere should salute Christophe and Annabelle Valentin for opening up their family home and garden. On the edge of the ancient town centre of Nîmes, this pink-hued 17th-century city villa has just 14 guest rooms – the pick of which is L'Orangerie, a Double Delux with an intimate, boudoir-like atmosphere, beautiful wooden floors and glorious garden views through its shuttered French doors.
