Change or cancellation requests received by our customer support team 3 days prior to noon on the date of check-in will be subject to 1 night's fee.

Is my card charged at the time of booking?
If the room shows as "available" your card will be charged the total price listed under "Reservation details". If you have booked a room at a "Standby Hotel" then your card is not charged until it is confirmed.
What does "Standby Hotel" mean?
The "Standby Hotel" booking status means that our allotment of rooms at that hotel may have sold out and that our customer support representatives are negotiating with the hotel on your behalf in order to secure the room and rate that you have requested. During this process, your credit card will not be charged. You will, however, receive a reservation number for status identification purposes.
Within 48 hours, you should receive an email with a status update, which will state whether or not your request has been confirmed or denied. If it has been confirmed, your credit card will be charged. If you do not receive an update after 48 hours, or if your requested check-in is within the following 24 hours, please call

Can I hold a room without paying for it?
We are unable to hold rooms without payment.
Why can't I book just 1 night?
Some hotels require a minimum stay that is greater than one night. If you can't easily find a room for one night's stay,

please open a

support ticket

or call

+1-800-442-0568

so we can help you find what you are looking for.

Why can't I pick a room type on some hotels?
The room types shown in your search results are based on what is available for the dates you selected.

Is my reservation confirmed with the hotel immediately after I book it?
Yes. Your booking is confirmed and guaranteed, although you may not be assigned to an actual room until you check in.
I need a room for 2 adults and 3 children. How many rooms do I need to book?
Hotel rooms often cannot accommodate more than 4 people. The results/rooms shown on the search results page are what the hotel can accommodate for the party you searched for. If you find that you still need a bigger space, our

Vacation Homes

might be a good option.
What size bed(s) will I get?
You can request specific bedding types under the room preferences on the "Traveler Information" page. Suppliers will try to accommodate your request, but because availability varies, your request cannot be guaranteed. The default bedding is generally a double bed.
I booked within 24 to 48 hours, is it confirmed? Is my booking confirmed if my check-in date is within 24-48 hours of booking?
If your check-in date is within 24 to 48 hours of booking, please call

What are your service fees for flight bookings?
We do not charge fees for flight bookings. However, there are potential delivery service fees if a paper ticket must be mailed because your reservation is not eligible for electronic ticketing. Delivery fees are:

$25 anywhere within the continental US

$50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and anywhere outside the US

Supplier Fees: Airlines, charter companies, and tour operators may have fees - including change or cancellation fees - that will be passed to you. Fees are often high if changes/cancellations occur less than 48 hours before flying.
Is there a fee to book on your site?

How do I change or cancel my flight reservation?
To change or cancel your flight, please call your airline directly, open a

and we'll be happy to assist. Please note that while some tickets may be exchanged, some are non-refundable and the airlines have fees that we cannot waive.

please open a

support ticket

or call

+1-800-442-0568
.
If you have a credit that was received through the airline and not through Last Minute Travel, you must contact the airline directly.
Why did my flight itinerary change?
The airline may make adjustments to your flight schedule/information (such as flight numbers or airplane equipment) at any time prior to your scheduled departure date and time. When this occurs, the airline notifies us regarding the change and we send you a new confirmation reflecting the most current information. If the airline is no longer operating your flight, or the schedule change is unacceptable, the airline will offer you an alternate flight or you may be entitled to a refund. Please note: If you choose a flight other than the airline's alternate option, fees may apply.
Why did the price change during the booking process?
Until you have completed your booking, airfare is not guaranteed. The airline may change the fare and seats may become unavailable (also resulting in a price change).
What forms of payment do you accept?
We accept MasterCard, Visa, American Express, Discover and JCB.
How long does it take to receive a refund?
Once a refund has been processed it may take 7-10 business days for the refund to appear on your bank statement. If you request a refund from the airline directly, expect the refund process to take 30-90 days.
How can I get my seats assigned?
You can enter your seating preference when making your reservation on our site. We will make every attempt to accommodate your request but cannot guarantee it. You can also log onto the airline's website to select your seat.
How do I get a seat in the emergency exit row?
We do not have access to emergency row seating. Please contact the airline with your request once your reservation is confirmed.
Why are there no seats showing on the map?
Some airlines choose only to show a portion of the seating and some choose not to show anything at all. The remaining seats can be seen at the airport upon check-in.
Can I add another person to an existing reservation?
Once your reservation has been processed; we are unable to add additional passengers. You will need to go online and book a new reservation for additional passengers.
How do I book a flight for an unaccompanied minor?
Each airline has its own policies regarding the acceptance of unaccompanied children. Please contact the airline directly in order to book a flight for an unaccompanied minor.
What are the baggage restrictions for my flight(s)?
Baggage size and weight restrictions vary by airline. Baggage fees are not included in your total trip cost when purchasing tickets on our website. They are collected by the airline when you check-in. Baggage policies are subject to change at any time, so make sure to check your airline's website for the most up to date information.
Do you offer bereavement fares, military rates, or the ability to purchase using frequent flyer points/miles?
Unfortunately, we do not offer these types of fares. Please contact the airline directly to inquire about their policies.
What is an "on request" booking?
Your booking will show that it is "on request" until it has been confirmed by the airline, which usually takes around 30 minutes. Upon confirmation, you will receive an email with your electronic ticket, the status of your booking will change to "confirmed", and your credit card will be charged.

Yes. Cruise lines charge per person, without consideration of age.
