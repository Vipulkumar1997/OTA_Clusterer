Couples Spa Packages




Sometimes you just donâ€™t want to travel on your own and want to share your wellbeing experience with your partner - gorgeous spa locations are usually perfect for a spot of romance too!
At Wellbeing Escapes we create holiday packages that are excellent value for money with a huge variety from spa retreats to fitness holidays. If you want to unwind and relax in a tranquil location, we have a wide range of spa resorts offering a selection of





treatments and activities to help you get away from the hassles of everyday life.
Share experiences - perhaps try a new activity, take a cookery class or a boat trip and then enjoy treatments together or privately on your own. Itâ€™s a wonderful and fun way to experience the joys of wellbeing if you fancy taking some time to connect and unwind.
