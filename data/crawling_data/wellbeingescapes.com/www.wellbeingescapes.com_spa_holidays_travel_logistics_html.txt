Spa Holiday Travel Logistics

Know Before You Go Document
Take a look at the document that was sent to you with your booking confirmation as it includes some useful information that is specific to your destination

Passports
As a general guide, if you are travelling long haul or outside the EU your passport must have a minimum of six months validity. If you hold a British passport this minimum validity is not required if you are travelling to a EU country, however your passport must be valid for the duration of your travel dates.

Visas
British and NON-EU passport holders are required to obtain a visa for certain destinations. If you hold a passport issued by any other country, please check with the appropriate Foreign Office/Embassy for the country you are visiting. We encourage you to find further and up-to-date information about passports and visa requirements at the
British and Foreign Commonwealth Office
.


For
India
, nationals from selected countries can obtain an e-visa - please consult the Government of India
website
for further information.

For
Sri Lanka
, all visitors (including those in transit) need an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) which is available from the
Sri Lanka Online Visa Application Website
. It is generally approved within 2 working days but please keep in mind that it may take longer. See here for more details:

https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/sri-lanka/entry-requirements

Please note for
Turkey
the

visa is still available on arrival and costs around $20 (but you pay the equivalent in GBP or EUR). We'd encourage you to arrange it in advance via:
https://www.evisa.gov.tr/en/
and see here for more details:
https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/turkey/entry-requirements


Tickets & documents
Please review the documents we have given to make sure all is in order for you. Check that your name and initials on the confirmation and airline ticket we have given you are correct and that they match those on your passport. If you notice any of the information being incorrect or missing, you
must
contact us immediately so that we can take action right away.

Health

Make sure you are up-to-date with the current immunisations requirements, as some destinations may demand so. We advise you to find out more about specific immunisations, as well as other travel health tips at
www.netdoctor.co.uk/travel
. We always recommend you check with your GP if you have any questions or specific health concerns and that you are good to go!

Currency
Since most of your spa holiday components are pre paid, it won't be necessary to take much local currency. We recommend getting cash at the local airport ATM (not the UK airport) which will give you good exchange rates. Alternatively if you want to pre purchase your local currency, the Post Office offers good rates.

Airport information

Knowing your way around the airport you are departing from makes travelling so much easier. Here's some useful links:

Heathrow Airport:
