Weight Loss Holidays

A
weight loss holiday
is a good idea if you would like to lose weight or shape-up - perhaps for an important occasion (brides in particular always want to look their best!) or simply to appear and look better and feel healthier in yourself. We knwo that carrying extra weight can put a burden on you both physically and emotionally. A
weight loss* holiday
will kick-start the process of losing weight in a sustainable way which is what you should aim to do.

Our
weight loss holidays
have been carefully researched by us so we know that they are the best at dealing with weight loss issues and can support you on every level - from nutritional guidance to fitness options to encourage weight loss and stimulate your metabolism.

Our detox and weight loss programmes are designed to improve physical health not only when at the resort but when you return home as you will receive sound advice for continuing your weight loss once back so book a weight loss holiday now and become the very best version of yourself!

*
Please note that it is very unlikely that you will lose a significant amount of weight on a short break of 5 - 7 nights.  A few pounds is a realistic result but it totally depends on your metabolism and how much weight you have to lose. O
ur programmes have been carefully selected to ensure that you lose weight safely and realistically.  They are designed to inform and educate so that you have the tools to continue your weight loss at home.
A short break will set you on the right path to healthier eating and likely weight-loss but this can only be achieved in time.  Beware those that promise otherwise!
However we can assure you that you will return refreshed after a detox or weight-loss programme as your system will have had a well-deserved rest, your skin will look brighter and you will think more carefully about how you fuel your body.
If you are looking for significant weight-loss, we recommend a month-long programme and will be happy to discuss our various programmes with you.
