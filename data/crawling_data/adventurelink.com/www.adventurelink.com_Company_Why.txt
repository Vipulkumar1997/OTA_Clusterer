Why Book with AdventureLink?




Best Selection

Curated Selection of the
                                            best operators and trips. 
                                            AdventureLink has carefully
                                            selected the best operators from around the world.
                                            We hand select the trips and
                                            tour operators that we include in our system. Each operator is vetted
                                            by our curators to ensure that they meet or exceed the quality and
                                            reputation we're looking for.

Allowing only the highest
                                            quality of international and local operators allows us to provide you
                                            with only the best trips from the most reputable tour operators. Just a
                                            few of our tour operators:

Travel Insurance

AdventureLink offers comprehensive medical and trip cancellation insurance in partnership with TravelGuard.

With Travel Guard, you can
                                            tailor a travel insurance plan to fit that adventure of your dreams. So,
                                            whether you are planning an exciting excursion with family, friends or
                                            by yourself – you can ‘play hard’ knowing that you are covered, if your
                                            gear should turn up missing or emergency medical attention is required
                                            after a particularly daring expedition.


Plans to fit your travel needs
Whether it's a trip for two
                                            days or two weeks, Travel Guard plans have covered millions of travelers
                                            for over 20 years. Our plans provide the insurance protection you need.
                                            And, since most plans come with 24-hour travel assistance, we are
                                            available to answer your questions about coverage and deliver on our
                                            promises, so you can be rest assured that you’ve chosen your travel
                                            insurance plan wisely.
