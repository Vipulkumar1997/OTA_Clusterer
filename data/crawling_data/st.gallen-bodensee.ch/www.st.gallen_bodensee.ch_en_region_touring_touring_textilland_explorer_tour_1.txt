Textilland Explorer Tour

Tour through Eastern Switzerland








St.Gallen is world-famous as a textile city. Great designers such as Chanel, Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani and others work with embroidery from St.Gallen, and hardly a single important fashion show in Paris, Milan or New York takes place without presenting the corresponding haute couture. Not only St.Gallen, but also other parts of Eastern Switzerland have a rich history of textiles.




NEW - You can receive now a stamp at four stations when presenting thismap. Did you collect all four? Then there is a textile surprise awaiting you atthe last station*. Have a lot of fun
while collecting and discovering!
