St.Gallen inspires









St.Gallen inspires

Mia Baumann, a Swedish-born and St.Gallerin-of-choice, shows us her favourite spots. She also tells us why they inspire her.





The region of St.Gallen-Lake Constance is inspirational – even for us. That is why we are making six short films about the most beautiful places and sights. However, we will mainly be focussing on people who have moved here for love or jobs. People, who love the region and would recommend it. People like Mia Baumann.
The 42-year-old Swede has lived in the St.Gallen-Bodensee region since 2006. Mia is married, has two children and is responsible for marketing at Baumann AG, a kitchen design company in St.Gallen. Mia shares her thoughts on what makes St.Gallen such an inspiring place to live.
