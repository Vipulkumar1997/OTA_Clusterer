St.Gallen inspires









St.Gallen inspires

Sabya Gaan, an Indian-born and St.Galler-of-choice, shows us his favourite spots. He also tells us why they inspire him.





The region of St.Gallen-Lake Constance is inspirational – even for us. That is why we are making six short films about the most beautiful places and sights. However, we will mainly be focussing on people who have moved here for love or jobs. People, who love the region and would recommend it. People like Sabya Gaan.
The 41-year-old grew up in Orixa, India, studied in the USA and moved to the area in 2007 for a job. He is married, has two small children and works as a scientist and group leader at Empa in St.Gallen. In the first short film, Sabya Gaan showed us his favourite spots in the city and explained why they are important to him.
