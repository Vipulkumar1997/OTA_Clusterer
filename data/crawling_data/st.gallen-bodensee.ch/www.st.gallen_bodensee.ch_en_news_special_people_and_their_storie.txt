Special people and their stories

Portraits about love, inspiration and their home.








Stories about life, these are stories from the region St.Gallen-Lake Constance. We have met people who have touched us, who have carried the destination out into the world, who have moved or even changed it. People from different countries, cultures and social class. They tell us why they were inspired by St.Gallen-Bodensee.
