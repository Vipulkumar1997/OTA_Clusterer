The entire Abbey Precincts of St.Gallen has been a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1983.







The best-known city landmarks are the Baroque cathedral with its twin spires and the Abbey Library with its gorgeous rococo hall.
From end of may to mid of July, the Abbey courtyard is used for the St.Gallen Festival. Therefore the visibility of the twin spires is limited. Thank you very much for your understanding.
