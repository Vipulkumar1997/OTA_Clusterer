Textilland Ostschweiz








Pioneering spirit and world-renowned tradition

St.Gallen is known worldwide as a textile center, important designers such as Chanel, Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani and other process tips from St.Gallen, and hardly a major fashion show in Paris, Milan or New York to dispense with the presentation of the corresponding haute couture. Wear these creations of numerous celebrities, including Michelle Obama, Adele, Madonna and Charlène, Princess of Monaco.
Eastern Switzerland can well be described as “textile country“ shaped by history and a pioneering spirit that’s home to many flourishing companies: from thread to embroidery and underwear, to ultra-modern and functional textiles thanks to latest technology.
Experience a pioneering spirit and tradition first-hand! “Textilland Ostschweiz” is proud to open the rich textile legacy to you.
