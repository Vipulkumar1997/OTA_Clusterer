St.Gallen inspires









St.Gallen inspires

Mara Zwatz, an Austrian-born and St.Gallerin-of-choice, shows us her favourite spots. She also tells us why they inspire her.





The region of St.Gallen-Lake Constance is inspirational – even for us. That is why we are making six short films about the most beautiful places and sights. However, we will mainly be focussing on people who have moved here for love or jobs. People, who love the region and would recommend it. People like Mara Zwatz.
The 43-year-old grew up in Tirol and Kärnten. She moved to St. Gallen for love at the age of 19 and immediately felt at home here. Mara has a daughter and her partner run the first-floor tavern Zum Goldenen Schäfli in the heart of St. Gallen. She tells us what it is about St. Gallen that inspires her.
