Top 5 Winter









Top 5 Winter

St.Gallen is also worth a trip in winter




1) City of stars
From the very first day of Advent, the centre of St.Gallen will be in the limelight. 700 stars will shine over Switzerland's
«city of stars»
, bathing the Christmas market, squares and alleyways in magical light. At the Christmas market itself, about 50 prettily decorated chalet stalls will be selling Swiss crafts and local specialities. Another highlight will be the Christmas tree, studded with 18,000 fairy lights, on the Klosterplatz in the Abbey Precinct.
2) Baroque World – Religion and Spirituality in the Princely Abbey of St.Gallen
The cathedral of St.Gallen has stood in the heart of the city in all its baroque glory for 250 years – and the Abbey Library was built at the same time. The two buildings are among the most beautiful of the Late Baroque period. The Abbey Library is devoting its new exhibition
«Baroque World»
to this subject – from 29 November 2017 to 11 March 2018.
3) 500 years of the Reformation
St.Gallen was one of the first towns in Switzerland to choose to renew its faith. In Joachim von Watt, known as Vadian, St.Gallen had a leader who was a humanist and a Reformer and a driving force behind the new church movement, far beyond the town itself. During the winter this year, there will be a number of
events
to mark this anniversary. On our interesting tour called
«Places of the Reformation»
, you can learn all about the troubled period of the Reformation, a time to which edifices in the city such as the St.Laurence Church, the Schiedmauer dividing wall and the Karlstor (Charles' Gate) still bear witness.
4) St.Gallen Theatre
Musicals, opera, plays and dance: every season Switzerland's oldest theatre brings its audiences some special highlights. When it comes to musical theatre, there are often treats from the worlds of opera and musicals to discover – this season there's the musical «On the Town» and the opera «La Bohème». St.Gallen-Bodensee Tourismus has some
attractive packages
for both.
5) Winter walking and fun in the snow
Crisp snow crunching beneath your feet, the snowy landscape and fresh air – even during the coldest season, the region is ideal for exploring on foot. For example, the St.Gallen Panoramic Trail boasts wonderful views of St.Gallen's Old Town and the Abbey Precinct.
Winter sports enthusiasts
can do their laps on the Unterer Brand, city trail and Notkersegg cross-country skiing trails, in the Peter and Paul and on the Kinderfestplatz. The cross-country skiing trails offer great opportunities to get moving and train in a beautiful setting. The trails open as soon as the snow and temperature conditions permit.
