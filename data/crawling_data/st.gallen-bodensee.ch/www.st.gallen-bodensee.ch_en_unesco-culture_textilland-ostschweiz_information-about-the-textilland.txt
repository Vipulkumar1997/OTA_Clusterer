About «Textilland»








Textilland Ostschweiz” is an association supported by the leading textile companies of Eastern Switzerland, the tourist destinations of the cantons of Thurgau, St.Gallen and both Appenzell regions as well as leading hotels in the area. Founded in 2010, it develops tourist products, which bring the textile know-how and heritage of eastern Switzerland alive.
The association now comprises about 50 members, associated partners and patrons. “Textilland Ostschweiz” is supported by the four cantons of St. Gallen, Thurgau, Appenzell Ausser- und Innerrhoden. Ad-hoc project support is also provided by the city of St. Gallen, the „Ortsbürgergemeinde St.Gallen“ and the Lottery Fund of the canton of St. Gallen.
