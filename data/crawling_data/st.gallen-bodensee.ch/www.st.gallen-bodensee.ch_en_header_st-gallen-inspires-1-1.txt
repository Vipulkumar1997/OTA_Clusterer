St.Gallen inspires









St.Gallen inspires

Rachel de Lagenest, textile designer and St.Gallerin-of-choice, shows us her favourite spots. She also tells us why they inspire her.





The region of St.Gallen-Lake Constance is inspirational – even for us. That is why we are making six short films about the most beautiful places and sights. However, we will mainly be focussing on people who have moved here for love or jobs. People, who love the region and would recommend it. People like Rachel de Lagenest.
The 46-year-old St. Gallen native lived in Paris for 15 years before moving to the St. Gallen-Lake Constance region in 2005 to take up a job offer. Rachel is married, has two children and works as chief designer for prêt à porter/couture at Bischoff Textil in St. Gallen. Rachel tells us what it is about St. Gallen that inspires her.
