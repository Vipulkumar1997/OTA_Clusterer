Three World Cultural Heritage Sites







By car, drive from Schaffhausen along Lake Constance in the direction of ‘Lindau/Meersburg’. After a few kilometres, you will reach unteruhldingen.In June 2011, UNESCo recognised a total of 111 pile dwelling sites in six Alpine countries  as a cross-border World Cultural Heritage Site, under the name of «Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps». One of them is located in Unteruhldingen.
After a short drive, you will arrive in Meersburg. Magnificent castle facilities, small, idyllic  alleyways and beautiful settings, right by Lake Constance, await you.  From Meersburg, take the ferry to Konstanz and  drive to Reichenau Island. Vines and lettuce fields alternate here with precious, ancient churches. The venerable monastery has be-longed to the UNESCO-World Cultural Heritage since 2000.
Continue on to St.Gallen. Here, the tour ends in the Abbey Precincts, which were listed as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 1983. The unique architectural ensemble of the abbey, including the monastery church, abbey library and archives, is typical of the Baroque period.
