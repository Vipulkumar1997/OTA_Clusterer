micelab:bodensee

As a marketing community defined by its common interests, for the last 20 years BodenseeMeeting has been responsible for the continuous development of the Lake Constance area as a conference and congress landscape. This ranges from global medical congresses, through international association congresses and large corporate events, to the annual Nobel Laureate Conference. Well over 1,000 such residential events mean that Lake Constance now plays an important role in the MICE industry.
