Gastronomy








The cuisine of eastern Switzerland is considered to be one of the best and most diverse in Switzerland by those in the know

You definitely should not miss trying one of the best-known local specialities – the St.Gallen bratwurst – but please leave off the mustard!
Specialities from around the world are prepared as lovingly as typical local dishes in the picturesque Old Town restaurants (known as “first-floor pubs”) of this mediaeval city.
Restaurants that spoil you with delicacies even on sundays:
