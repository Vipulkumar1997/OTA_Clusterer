Architecture








The St.Gallen-Lake Constance region contains many architectural gems beyond its cities.

Architectural sculptures from the Carolingian era, mediaeval half-timbered houses and fluid and creative buildings by Santiago Calatrava and Hundertwasser are just some of the highlights in the region.
