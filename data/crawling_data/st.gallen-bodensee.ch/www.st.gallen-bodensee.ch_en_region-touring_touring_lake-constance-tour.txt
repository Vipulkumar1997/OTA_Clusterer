Drive around Lake Constance







The Lake Bodensee tour starts in St.Gallen.  The trip takes you – as its name suggests – from St.Gallen on Lake Bodensee along the Austrian border and on to Bregenz.
From St.Gallen, drive to Bregenz. After a stroll in the old Town and along the lake promenade in Bregenz, the tour continues on to Germany.  In just 15 minutes you will reach Lindau. Lindau’s old Town is situated on the approximately 70-hectare Lindau Island. Centuries-old buildings, historic squares and romantic alley-ways conjure up an almost Mediterranean flair.
Continue, and after half an hour you will reach the town of Friedrichshafen. Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin is inseparably connected with the history of Friedrichshafen – as, long ago, he built his airships here. A visit to the Zeppelin Museum is a must. After half an hour by ferry across Lake  Bodensee you will reach Romanshorn.
Following your stay in Romanshorn, it’s back  to St.Gallen. Enjoy the evening there and  discover the culinary variety in a traditional first-floor restaurant.
