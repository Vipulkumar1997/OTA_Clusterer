Centrally located in Ireland's vibrant capital, The Abbey Court Hostel cannot be beaten on price, comfort or location.
Find us in the bright purple building on Bachelors Walk along the River Liffey - just 20 paces from O'Connell Bridge, and four doors down from Dublin's Tourist Office. We are a family-run business, open since 1999 and thriving ever since.

With our range of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, 12- and 24-bed dorms, we're ideal for groups of friends, college students and sports teams. Lots of luggage storage space too!

Our freebies include free Wi-Fi and Internet, free breakfast, free Wii and Xbox, free maps and city guides and free guided walking tours of the city in both English and Spanish. Start your stay by enjoying a free welcome beer! Need to chill out after a hectic day sightseeing or clubbing? Then chill out in our comfortable centrally-heated rooms with hot power showers or take the chance to meet other travellers in our large lounge and kitchen area. We have also recently added a games room, hammock room and cinema room so you are never stuck for something to do!

Our young and friendly staff are more than willing to help you throughout your stay, from booking city tours and day trips and giving shopping tips to recommending pub crawls. We have no curfew, giving you lots of time to explore all of the city's sights, pubs, bars and clubs! We're just a couple tram stops from the O2 Arena, where all the biggest artists in the world play in Dublin.
