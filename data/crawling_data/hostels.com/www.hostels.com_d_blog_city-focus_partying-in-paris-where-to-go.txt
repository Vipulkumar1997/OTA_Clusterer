Partying in Paris: Where to go

Posted in:
City Focus








by Ellen Curham

Paris
is a top European destination and a favourite of ours at Hostels.com. Not only does it feature some of the continent’s top tourist attractions like the Eiffel Tower and Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa in the Louvre. The
French
capital is also home to some top notch cuisine with traditional French fare as well as a host of international restaurants that fit in with the diverse population.

However, we’re not here to talk about that today. At Hostels.com we want to make sure that you get to explore as much of a city as possible and that includes the nightlife scene. We’ve compiled some of the best places in Paris to check out if you’re looking to party.

The Cocktail Bar

Paris is a classy city, so why not try some sophisticated cocktails while you’re there? Head to the Montorgueil neighbourhood and check out the
Experimental Cocktail Club
. This bar is everything you expect from an excellent cocktail haunt: it has bespoke drinks with fresh ingredients and knowledgeable bartenders. The atmosphere is lively and it gets pretty crowded but that adds to its charm. This isn’t necessarily a place for a quiet drink but the live DJ and delicious drinks promise that this will be an excellent start to any night in Paris.

Address:
37 Rue Saint-Sauveur, 75002 Paris, France



The Nightclub

The Bastille district is where you’ll find many of the cities nightclubs if you’re looking to dance and party for the night. A Hostels.com favourite is
Badaboum
which has casual interiors, a cocktail bar and a quality sound system. It’s inexpensive and has a young and vibrant crowd as well as some great guest DJs. Hit this place up if you want to hear decent techno music and avoid the touristy-style club crawls.

Address:
2B Rue des Taillandiers, 75011 Paris, France



The Dive Bar

If you want to spend the night partying without spending too much money, then
Le Bar Dix
(or 10 Bar) is the perfect Parisian dive bar to drink the night away in. Sangria isn’t the first concoction that comes to mind when you think of dive bars but this grungy hole in the wall is famed for the refreshing fruit-laden drink that comes with a refreshingly low price to match. Packed to the brim with locals and mainly mustached barmen, this place is a riot and perfect for partying on the cheap.

Address:
10 Place de la République, 75011 Paris, France



The Concept Venue

Trust surrealist Hollywood director David Lynch to set up a concept club in Paris. Based on the strange Club Silencio from his movie Mulholland Drive, this space features artsy interiors, alternative music and an exclusive guest list. As it is a members’ club, ask around if you happen to have Parisian friends or else wait until after midnight when they let a limited amount of mere mortals in.
Silencio
is one of the hottest places to be during Paris Fashion Week but has a pretty trendy crowd all year ‘round too.

Address:
142 Rue Montmartre, 75002 Paris, France




The Show

If you’re going to see a show in Paris then it’s essential that you visit the
Moulin Rouge
. Sure, it will be packed with tourists and overpriced drinks but it’s the original Parisian cabaret that still puts on one hell of a show. You need to prebook tickets online and they are normally in the triple digits but it is worth it if you are a fan of dance, the movie or showmanship in general. Make sure to dress up and join in the fun!

Address:
82 Boulevard de Clichy, 75018 Paris, France
