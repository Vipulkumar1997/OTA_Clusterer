The metro line 1 (light blue) will be closed from July the 3rd until November. We recommend that you take the bus from the airport (Airport Express, 5eur) as it is the fastest route. Get off at Atocha Train Station and once there walk up Atocha street, always on the left hand side of the road. Once you walk past Anton Martin metro station, keep your eyes on the street names and turn left onto Magdalena street, Keep on the left side, turn left on the third street, Calle Olivar and then immediately to the right onto Cabeza street. We are on number 24!
