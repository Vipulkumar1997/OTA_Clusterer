Property Owners

Here's how you can promote your property on the most popular website for great value accommodation:

Offer Online Bookings to Our Guests:

Sign up
for your Hostel Inbox and allocate beds for sale on Hostels.com. We'll create a one-page microsite to promote your property (approved by you) with a link which allows guests to see your bed/room availability and make online bookings through our Hostel Inbox system. Signing up is free of charge and our model is very straightforward and fully automated. You simply pay a service fee (commission %) for reservations processed through the system.

Upgrade to a Featured Listing:
Properties with Featured Listings on Hostels.com get on average 4 times more bookings per year than those without. Once you've signed up to offer online bookings through us, you can upgrade to a Featured Listing which gives you top placement on your city or country page. To buy a Featured Listing,
login
to the Hostels.com Inbox, go to the Promotions section to see the pricing for your city and make your purchase.

Hostels.com is fully owned by Web Reservations International Ltd. (WRI). WRI is the leading provider of online reservations technology to the Budget Youth & Independent Travel (BYIT) market.
