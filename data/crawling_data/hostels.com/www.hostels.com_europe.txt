If you're taking yourself to Europe and hoping to stay in hostels when you get there, you're in for quite a trip. The European hostel scene is a vast and varied one offering accommodation in anything from a castle in Scotland to a houseboat in the Netherlands. Gone are the days of curfews and 20 bed dorms - although if that's your thing you'll be able to find that too. If you fancy a little more freedom and a few less room-mates then look no further than the selection of European hostels on Hostels.com.
