There a number of different hostel organisations in Ireland. They include Independent and YHA associations. The IHH (Independent Holiday Hostels) has 100+ owner operated hostel members and is approved by the Irish Tourist Authority, Fàilte Ireland. Member hostels vary from large city hostels to small countryside properties some of which are based in farms and historic buildings.
The Irish Youth Hostel Organisation (YHA) or An Oige was founded in 1823 and has over 20 hostels located throughout Ireland. These include some large city centre locations and many smaller rural hostels.
Hostels in Ireland have a homely feel and are a good place to meet up with fellow tourists. Irish hostels are not licensed so do not have private bars. Many private rooms in Ireland offer en-suite facilities.
