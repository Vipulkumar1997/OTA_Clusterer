One thing to note about Swedish hostels is that you generally have to bring your own bed linen or rent it on arrival. Sleeping bags aren't allowed in some places, so you should check with the hostel in advance if you plan on using one.

Hostels.com works with 64 hostels in Sweden. Traditionally, a Swedish hostel is called 'Vandrarhem', which relates to the fact that these properties used to be strongly focused on self-catering. In fact, even now some hostels will charge extra if you don't clean your room before checking out. This practice is, however, becoming more and more unusual.
SVIF is an independent youth hostel association operating in Sweden. It looks after 195 hostels throughout the country. Another hostelling association working in Sweden is STF. They're a member of Hostelling International (HI) and tend to focus on sports and nature activities, such as fishing, trekking and golfing.
