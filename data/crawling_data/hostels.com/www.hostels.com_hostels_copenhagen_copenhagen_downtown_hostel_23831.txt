Conveniently located right next to Norreport station which is the metro station with metros running directly to Copenhagen Airport on only 12 minutes. The metro and S-tog station Norreport is only 700 meter from the CPH Downtown which gives easy access to the whole of Copenhagen and the rest of Denmark.

From Copenhagen Airport: take the metro to station Norreport, cross the street and go down Norregade \'Nytorv Radhustrade (all same street). CPH Downtown is located in the square opposite the fountain. Instead of walking you take bus 14 (heading Jydeholmen/Alekistevej ) from Norreport metro station  for 3 stops, same ticket as used in the metro.

From Copenhagen Central Station: take bus 2A heading Kastrup and  get off at 2nd stop (at the canal) walk down Radhusstrade for 75 meters to the square. CPH Downtown is located in the square opposite the fountain. Alternatively you can walk  its only 500 meters; walk down Tietgensgade (backside of Tivoli) and keep going to Stormgade, turn left first time and then turn right at Langangsstrade for 100 meters to the square.




Located Near


Our location can not be better - right in the middle of the city! We're located near the pedestrian shopping street Stroget (two minutes' walk). Stroget goes through the inner city, full of world-class Danish design, fashion stores and much more. Central station is 10 minutes walk away and Tivoli gardens are only five minutes walk away and is Denmark's most visited attraction and the third most visited amusement park in Europe.
