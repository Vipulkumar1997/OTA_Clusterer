Stay at a refurbished former brewery in vibrant Prenzlauer Berg - the central district with an unequalled nightlife and which is close to the major sights.
We're an independent hostel with a unique style, where 150-year-old industrial architecture meets modern interior design.

Our hostel is located in Berlin's scene district, Prenzlauer Berg, famous for its countless bars, clubs, cafés and shops.

Bed linen is included in the price. Our rooms are cleaned daily and feature freshly made-up beds with lockable storage facilities in the dorms.

The all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet is only €5.50.

Our amenities include 24hr reception and a 24hr bar. We have free Internet terminals and Wi-Fi, free luggage storage, free city maps and free walking tours.  Bike rental is available for only €10 per day.

There’s also an open fireplace with our own courtyard for relaxing in, plus brilliants, table football and table tennis.

Guests can avail of our washing machines, towel rental and elevator as well as the hairdryers, iron, phone chargers and power adaptors that are available to borrow.

New Year's Eve: on the first of January we offer a late-check-out until 12am! The breakfast takes place between 8 am and 1pm in our lobby! We wish you loads of fun!
