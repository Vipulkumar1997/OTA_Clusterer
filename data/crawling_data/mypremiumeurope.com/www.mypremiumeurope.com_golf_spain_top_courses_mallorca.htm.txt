1. Son Vida

Opened in 1964 this was the first golf course on Mallorca, and is located in the luxury residential area
of Son Vida, just inland of Palma. Meandering through the villas and residences it challenges with
narrow fairways and its hilly landscaping. Outstanding is the view from the 6 th hole to the Cathedral
of Palma.

2. Son Muntaner

This beautiful second course of Arabella Golf is also located in Son Vida and was inaugurated in 2000. It is much wider though quite challenging for all levels of golfers. Its hole 15, a par 5, is a 517m long uphill hole, probably the toughest on the course.

Type: 18 Holes // Par 72

Location: Son Vida

Green Fees: €117-€150 (low-high season)


Visit Website - Son Muntaner
3. Real Bendinat Golf Mallorca

This course west of Palma is a pure joy for the good golfer, thanks to its magnificent sea views and situation against the backdrop of Bendinat Castle. It has wide and open fairways and is relatively short in distance, though several dog-legs present a challenge. The finishing hole with 454m to the pin calls for a long drive.

Specification
:
Built 1986 // Designed by Hawtree
Type: 18 Holes // Par 70

Location: Real Bendinat

Green Fees: €91-€97 (low-high season)

Our Hotel Suggestion

4. Golf de Poniente

With majestic mountain views of the Tramuntana, this course is fun to play for all handicaps. Several lakes influence play and bunkers are well-placed obstacles making it tough but fair. The par-3 hole number 12 stands out with its 210 yard length.

Specification
:
Built 1978 // Designed by John Harris

Type: 18 Holes // Par 72

Location: Cala Figuera

Green Fees: from €59 (*9 holes)

Our Hotel Suggestion

Visit Website - Golf de Poniente
5. Golf Santa Ponsa I

Golf Santa Ponsa consists of a total of three courses, although only Santa Ponsa I is a public course. Beautifully set and fairly flat it is the perfect leisure course, although there‘s a challenge for long hitters: it boasts probably the longest hole on the island , number 10, at 590 yards long.

Specification
:
Built 1977 // Designed by Pepe Gancedo
Type: 18 Holes // Par 72

Location: Santa Ponsa

Green Fees: €93- €99 (low-high season)

6. Golf de Andratx

This course opened in 2000 and is definitely one of the top courses on Mallorca. Not only is it one of the most difficult ones, it also boasts breathtaking views. Relatively hilly, it requires great accuracy; raised tees and plenty of lakes contribute to the challenge. Tip: it gets busy, so reserve your tee-time well ahead of time!

Specification
:

Built 2000 // Designed by David Kidd

Type: 18 Holes // Par 72

Location: Camp de Mar

Green Fees: €80- €110 (low-high season)

7. Son Termens Golf

A fairly short course and not too difficult it is designed to be a pleasure to play for the visitor. Undulating fairways meander over what was originally a hunting estate, and the course is rich in fauna and flora. The scenic Tramuntana adds to the charm of the area.

Specification
:

Built 1998 // Designed by Harris Group

8. Son Antem Golf

Both courses belong to the nearby Marriott Son Antem, and will remind you of an American-type course as they are fairly open and mostly with water hazards. While Son Antem East is characterized by wide fairways and flat greens, easy to play for beginners and intermediates, Son Antem West is more demanding with undulating greens and much narrower fairways.

Specification
:

Built: 1994 East + 2001 West

Designed: Francisco Lopez Segales

Type: 18 holes // Par 72

Location: Son Antem, east of Palma

10. Club de Golf Alcanada

Named after a little island just off the coast, this course offers a great variety of holes, making it interesting for all skill levels.

Type: 18 holes // Par 72

Location: Northwest

Green Fees: €105-€150 (low-high season)
