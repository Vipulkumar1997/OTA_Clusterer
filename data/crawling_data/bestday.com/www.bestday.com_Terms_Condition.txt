www.BestDay.com
Under this agreement, the payment processing services for goods and/or services purchased on this website are provided by Best Day Europe Ltd. on behalf of Viajes Beda, S.A. de C.V. or by Traveler''s Holding Inc., depending on the type of payment method used for the purchase of the goods and/or services. In the event you choose to pay with credit card and the payment will be processed via a European Acquirer, these terms are an agreement between you and Best Day Europe Ltd. For any other type of purchases, these terms are an agreement between you and Viajes Beda, S.A. de C.V. and goods and/or services will be delivered by Viajes Beda, S.A. de C.V. directly. Rates listed are exclusively valid for the inquiry date. They are subject to change and will only be honored as shown on the website if the service requested is confirmed by means of charge to your credit card and you receive a confirmation number.

Upon making a reservation it becomes necessary for you to give your authorization, written and/or verbal, to run the corresponding charge on your credit card and by this you declare to have full knowledge of our Reservation and Payment Policies, Disclaimer and Cancellation Policies. All reservations are subject to availability existing at the moment of your request. No confirmation can be issued until full payment for the requested service has been made. In some cases (which are duly marked for you to easily identify them before filling out contact information and credit card number fields) it will be necessary to check availability directly with the service operator before a confirmation can be issued to you. Please note that this verification and confirmation process may take up to, and never more than, 24 hours. In order to avoid inconveniences, please make a printout of your reservation voucher and have it ready for check-in to the reserved service. Should a change to a confirmed reservation be needed, please contact your assigned Travel Consultant and have your reservation and/or confirmation number handy. We strongly suggest reading the CANCELLATION POLICIES section hereinafter. Any changes are subject to availability and rate adjustments when necessary. Our CANCELLATION POLICIES are applicable at all times without exception.

PAYMENT POLICIES:

The amount corresponding to your reservation will be immediately charged to your credit card, provided it has a confirmed reservation status. Please bear in mind that your credit card billing statement will show "TRAVEL RESERVATION CENTER" as the company responsible for the charge, except for some reservations including flights where you might have two charges, one for the airfare amount and another for the remaining amount of all other services such as your hotel, airport shuttle or activity reservation, taxes, fees, and other. These charges may appear as “TRAVEL RESERVATION CENTER” and the corresponding “AIRLINE COMPANY NAME”. VISA, MASTERCARD and AMERICAN EXPRESS are welcome. We will be glad to accept your wire transfer as an alternative form of payment. Please contact one of our Travel Consultants for further details. The currency in which service rates are quoted on the website may be other than Mexican pesos or US dollars, in which case the specific currency will be readily specified for your easy identification. Mexican pesos rates will always be charged in Mexican pesos. For any other currency, however, the amount to charge will be first converted into US Dollars and the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date will be applied. This movement may cause a variation of up to 3% above the international fluctuation index for currency exchange and such difference will show on your billing statement.
www.BestDay.com
cannot be held responsible for this variation and upon accepting the PAYMENT POLICIES you acknowledge to have been informed of the exchange rate fluctuation and declare your agreement to the corresponding charge being made into US Dollars.

Despite our close communication with our selected group of service suppliers, there is still a possibility that changes on the rates may occur without notice. As some of the rates become expired and cannot be timely updated by the operator to your immediate convenience,

www.BestDay.com
will only charge the lower amount. When an updated price is higher than the originally quoted price,
www.BestDay.com
will have a Travel Consultant inform you of the specific variation and the resulting balance that needs to be covered. Should you not agree to the correct amount and decide to cancel upon the circumstances,
www.BestDay.com
will honor you cancellation request without penalization. www.BestDay.com and its service suppliers will also be released from any responsibility towards compensations that the client may claim and will not be considered liable for any inconveniences arising from the said rate difference and/or cancellation.
