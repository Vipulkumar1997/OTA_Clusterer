Heliskiing - Highlight for all friends of action and mountains

A real highlight for all fans of the mountains and of skiing is the heliskiing. Selected "Leading Family Hotels & Resorts" provide heliskiing offerings for their guests.




























































































































Your children’s hotel organizes a
panoramic flight with a helicopter
and you can enjoy a stunning view over the beautiful mountains. Finally arrived at the mountaintop the departure in the valley begins. There are also offered slight ski descents to make sure that children aged 12 to 14 years can participate accompanied by one parent.

Experience the
breathtaking mountaintops of the Dolomites of Val Gardena
from above. The
"Family Spa Grand Hotel Cavallino Bianco"
organizes helicopter flights for its guests and ski departures. Enjoy a flight with the helicopter over the
fascinating Dolomites mountains
, that were designated as UNESCO world heritage. The flight’s aim is the
"Marmolada" (3,270 m)
, the so-called queen of the Dolomites. From the top of the Marmolada the departure to the valley starts. Therefore you need a valid ski ticket for the ski region "Dolomiti Superski".

Take advantage of the special occasion for heliskiing and experience the unique mountains near your family hotel from a complete new site.










Simply the best for families!
