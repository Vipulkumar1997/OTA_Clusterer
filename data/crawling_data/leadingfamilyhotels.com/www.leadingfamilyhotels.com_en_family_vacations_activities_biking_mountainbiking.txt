Cycling and mountain biking in beautiful natural landscapes

Guests of the "Leading Family Hotels & Resorts" enjoy great conditions for a cycling holiday. The exclusive children’s hotels are all situated in charming natural landscapes in the Alps















































As guests of our children’s hotels a
wide range of bike trails
are at your disposal. Many bike trails run through meadows, along the valley or around beautiful lakes. All family hotels also offer bicycles, mountain bikes and some even offer e-bikes for rent.

Many mountain trails for advanced mountain bikers run through the beautiful Tyrolean mountains and the Dolomites of Val Gardena. The holiday region
Tyrol Zugspitze Arena
has been voted
Austria’s best bike region twice
. In addition to fantastic bike trails in the valley, the region provides numerous mountain trails for bike pros. The highlight for all mountain bike pros is the
freeride trail
which provides several jumps, bridges and natural obstacles!

Some of the exclusive family hotels offer guided bike tours for both beginners and advanced cyclists. The
children’s hotel Alpenrose in Lermoos (Tyrol)
is also a
member of the bike hotels
and therefore offers its guests 5 cycling excursions and 3 guided bike tours weekly.

The Dolomites of Val Gardena (Italy), which were designated as UNESCO world heritage, also provide marvellous bike trails. Spend your family vacation at the
luxury children’s hotel Cavallino Bianco in St. Ulrich
and you enjoy a stunning view over the beautiful Dolomites. It is also the
perfect starting point for many bike tours
with a mountain bike or a racing bike through the world famous mountains. Racing cyclists find many great mountain pass roads that provide a breathtaking view of the mountain scenery of the Dolomites.










Simply the best for families!
