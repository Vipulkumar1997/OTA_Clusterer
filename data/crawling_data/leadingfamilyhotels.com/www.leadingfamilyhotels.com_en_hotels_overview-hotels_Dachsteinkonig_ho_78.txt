The Leading Family Hotel & Resort Dachsteinkönig****s

Dachsteinkönig’s twelve chalet units lay luxurious living at your family’s feet. We have thought of everything to enable relaxation and carefree holidays for parents, grandparents, and children alike. Families big and small live in their own ‘private’ house on two floors. Several children’s rooms provide suffiencient space for the little ones. The family can come together in front of the cosy fire. Guests staying in a chalet can relax in complete privacy in their very own
private sauna
. Futhermore, there are 105 modern family suites.








Children’s world XXL


Babies and children will be given professional care from their seventh day of life (!) on. In the Baby Club (0-1 year), the Toddler’s Club (1-2 years), the Mini Club (3-5 years), the Maxi Club (6-11 years) and the Teenagers’ Club (12-16 years), 20 trained carers – mainly kindergarten teachers – look after our young guests seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. The indoor playing area has a sensational size of 2,000 m² (21,500 sq. ft.). A cinema and a theatre, a two-storey Soft Play Area, a family bowling alley, a gym, an indoor kart circuit and much more will stretch the imagination of childhood dreams to the limit. The “craziest” experience will most probably be the 100-metre (320 ft.) waterslide leading into the bathing area with numerous pools and attractions. Outdoors, the children will experience unforgettable adventures on a gigantic area with a bouncy castle, an adventure playground, a Bobby Car course, a petting zoo and much more.
A 1,000-m² (11,000-sq.ft.) wellness and sauna area with an exclusive SPA is reserved for adults and their regeneration in peace and quiet. Ernst Mayer is convinced that “a family holiday may only be called a family holiday when the offer is right for children as well as for adults,” and he intends to offer a lot in Gosau: There will be eleven treatment rooms for massages, balneotherapy, cosmetics and Ayurveda. Furthermore, there are six different saunas, a pano-rama outdoor sauna, a relaxation room, a communications and relaxation zone with juice bar, a top gym, an indoor golf simulator and much more.
