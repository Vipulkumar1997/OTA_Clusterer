precious time-out as parents
and enjoy some time with your partner on your family vacation. Or simply spend relaxing moments being on your own.

Enjoy a delightful and
romantic candle-light dinner
with your partner or spend moments of pleasure and relaxation in our charming spa areas. Feel free to take a time-out from your parental responsibilities without having any bad conscience!
