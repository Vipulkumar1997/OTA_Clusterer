Skiing course offers for the entire family

Improve your skiing skills on your family vacation at the Leading Family Hotels & Resorts. Three of the family hotels are situated in very famous winter sports regions and provide many offers for families for a perfect winter holiday!








































































Your family hotel is only few minutes away from the skiing resorts, which provide several skiing schools. Many qualified ski instructors are at your disposal at the skiing schools and help to improve the skiing technique both for beginners and advanced skiers.
Many skiing courses are offered for all disciplines:
alpine ski, snowboarding, cross-country skiing and also guided ski tours and snowshoe hikes as well as carving courses and special ski courses for re-beginners.

For children we offer a special service: Professional supervisors accompany your children from the family hotel to the ski school and take them back safely to the hotel after the ski course.
Snow parks for children
provide many specials for the youngest to make sure that they can learn to ski in a playful way.

In the snow parks
many supervisors
are at the children’s disposal to take care of them and play with them. The children’s snow parks provide a
wide range of children’s attractions:
training areas with obstacle courses, ski carousels and seatings for the parents.

Some of the ‚Leading Family Hotels & Resorts‘ provide a
hotel’s own ski rental or a ski depot
. For detailed information about the ski resorts, trail maps and ski school’s offerings consult the reception of your family hotel.












Simply the best for families!
