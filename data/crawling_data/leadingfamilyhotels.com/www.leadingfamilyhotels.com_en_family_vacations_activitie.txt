Active family vacation in Austria and South Tyrol/Italy

The four children’s hotels that belong to the "Leading Family Hotels & Resorts" are all situated in pleasant landscapes. Spend your family vacation at the first-class childrens hotels that provide many sport and leisure activities. The family hotels furthermore offer various sports programs.
















































































































































































Three of the "Leading Family" children’s hotels are situated in the
top winter sport regions Val Gardena/Gröden, Serfaus-Fiss-Ladis and the Tyrol Zugspitze Arena.
Explore the beautiful ski resorts near your family hotel. These regions are very snow-sure and therefore provide perfect conditions for an active winter family vacation. Many sports are offered on the ski slopes: snowshoe hiking, tobogganing, cross-country skiing or a horse drawn carriage ride.

The
fascinating mountain scenery
that surrounds the "Leading Family Hotels & Resorts" in Austria and South Tyrol (Italy) offers also a wide range of activities in summer and autumn. Explore the mountains with your family by hiking along alpine pastures. If you would like to spend a more active family vacation you can hike to a mountain summit or go on a climbing tour.

For action fans the mountains offer many outdoor sports:
canyoning, rafting, climbing or mountain biking
. Let yourself be enchanted by the fascinating natural landscapes around the ‘Leading Family Hotels & Resorts’. Our luxury children’s hotels also provide their own guides: hiking guides, golf pros and ski instructors are at your disposal.
