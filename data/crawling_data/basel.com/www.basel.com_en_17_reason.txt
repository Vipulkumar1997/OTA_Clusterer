Mediterranean
flair

Basel, the city on the Rhine, has a Mediterranean climate and as many as 300 days of sunshine a year. As soon as temperatures allow, the people of Basel take to the outdoors, and their joie de vivre is clear to see.

Basel's residents
are crazy about
art

In the now legendary Picasso year of 1967, the people of Basel voted to acquire two paintings by the artist for the city's Kunstmuseum (Museum of Fine Arts). Picasso was so moved that he gave three paintings and a study to Basel. And the city's love of art is evident everywhere: it's no coincidence that there are 40 museums here within a small area.

most beautiful people in the world


Not just during the famous Fasnacht (carnival), the three "most beautiful days" for the people of Basel. For the remaining 362 days of the year they prepare for the event with a passion. Look forward to creative masks, colourful costumes and wonderful lanterns!

Silently, driven only by the current, four ferries take you across the river throughout the year. See how time seems to stand still during the brief crossing.

Swimsuits
– the typical
summer outfit
in Basel

The people of Basel love nothing more than swimming in the Rhine. Thanks to the «Wickelfisch», an airtight bag used to carry clothes and keep them dry, the river becomes a stream of colour in the summer months.

Dolce vita
on the banks of the Rhine

The Rhine is the city's lifeline and an area for recreation. When temperatures rise, there's a distinct southern flair: stalls set out their wares, residents put out tables and chairs, and barbecues pop up everywhere.

World-class
venue

Thanks to its location on the border with France and Germany, the multinational companies established here, and the two large trade fairs, there is always a cosmopolitan air in the streets and alleys of Basel. It's therefore no wonder that the city's inhabitants are considered to be particularly open-minded.

up
to your ears

Did you know that Basel is one of only a few cities to have two orchestras of international renown? The Sinfonieorchester (symphony orchestra) and the Kammerorchester (chamber music orchestra) play regularly at the world's greatest concert halls, delighting classical music fans.
