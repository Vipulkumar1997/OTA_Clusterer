When it rains in Basel


Grey rainy weather dampens the mood and also your desire to go out and do things. But it doesn’t have to be like that. There are plenty of interesting and entertaining things to do in Basel even when it's cold and wet outside. Here are some all-weather things to do in Basel.


















Basel Zoo: Vivarium and primate house


You don't need to forego a visit to the zoo if it’s raining: the vivarium and primate house offer interesting alternatives to the open-air enclosures. Admire the colourful exotic fishes and immerse yourself in the mysterious world of the vivarium. The playful monkeys in the primate house will put everyone in a good mood. Then you’ll soon forget the grey rainy weather.

Details

















Afternoon Tea (Les Trois Rois)


What could be cosier than a cup of tea in a warm room when it’s cold and wet outside? Celebrate the British way of life in the lobby of the Les Trois Rois hotel and enjoy delicious teas and snacks.
The Les Trois Rois hotel serves tasty scones, sandwiches, pastries and a selection of aromatic teas from Lucerne-based “L’art du thé” every day.

Details

















Botanical Garden glasshouses


There’s plenty of intriguing flora to discover in all seasons in the Botanical Garden of the University of Basel. With their colourful, exotic flowers, the glasshouses guarantee a good mood even in rainy weather. Plunge into the fascinating world of the rainforest in the tropical house or admire Switzerland's largest orchid collection. Tropical swamp and water plants, cacti or orchids will make you forget the outside world for a while, especially in inclement weather.

Details

















Basel City Tour Bus


Embark on a different type of voyage of discovery: five daily Panoramabus tours offer you the opportunity to discover the most beautiful places and to board or leave the bus where you wish.

Discovery trip in a vintage tram


Trams have long been an important element of Basel life. Our trip on a vintage tram will provide a window on the past: giving you a feeling of what it was like to travel around the city a hundred years ago. You can look forward to a tour in which you'll hear authentic sounds of yesteryear: as you rumble along in the old tram, our guide's enlightening commentary will help evoke times past. Besides that, the trip will enable you to see the city from a different perspective.

Details

















Cinema


When else would you go to the cinema if not on a wet and cold day? Basel has a wide choice of cinemas that are sure to have something to suit you. The 40 or so cinema screens in the Basel region offer all the Hollywood blockbusters plus countless European and many non-European films. All films are shown in the original language with German subtitles.
