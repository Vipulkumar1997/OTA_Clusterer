Riehen has already had the honour of being named the Swiss municipality with the highest quality of life. The award was no coincidence: Riehen attracts attention with its large amount of green space and a very attractive city centre. The town is also a cultural hotspot as the home of the famous Fondation Beyeler. Yet even the adjacent Hirzbrunnen district of Basel offers many idyllic spots, including the Lange Erlen zoo and the Wiese River.

New in the district: «Markgräfler Wiiwegli» now from Riehen to Grenzach
For many visitors and hikers, the “Markgräfler Wiiwegli” is one of the best-known and most popular hiking trails in the region. It takes you through a changing landscape from Weil am Rhein to Freiburg. It was recently extended and now continues via Riehen to Grenzach.

Shopping tip: Erlenmatt flea market

The Erlenmatt area is an insider’s tip for anyone who loves small but high-quality flea markets. Every Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., you can rummage to your heart’s content and also meet and chat with the area’s residents. Thanks to a park with a playground in the immediate vicinity, families will get their money’s worth here as well.

Dining tip: Badischer Bahnhof

The Badischer Bahnhof (German railway station) building is home to two establishments that could not be more different, but are both well worth discovering. Gare du Nord delights visitors with a cozy bar, cool live music and a long tradition as a meeting place for watching football matches. Les Gareçons offers a stylish atmosphere and creative crossover cuisine.

Local character Sam Keller

Director of Fondation Beyeler
«I grew up in Riehen, a big green municipality just outside Basel on the border to the Black Forest. What I love about it is the way it ties nature and culture together. Examples include sculptures by well-known American artist Richard Serra in the magnificent Wenkenpark, concerts in the intimate setting of the Sarasinpark and Alexander Calder’s big tree sculptures in the idyllic Berowerpark. But most of all, I love the walking and cycling path from Riehen to Weil. It takes you through meadows, waterways, gardens and vineyards and offers a panoramic view of the Rhine valley.»
