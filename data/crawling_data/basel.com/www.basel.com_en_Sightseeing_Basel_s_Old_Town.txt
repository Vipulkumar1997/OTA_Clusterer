Basel’s Old Town



Basel’s Old Town is best discovered on foot, since most of its sights are located near each other. There are wonderful discoveries to be made on both the Grossbasel and Kleinbasel sides of the Rhine. In between, take a break on the banks of the Rhine or sit on a bench and enjoy the charming views.

Attractions















Basler Münster

Basel Zentrum







Together with the Mittlere Brücke, the Basler Münster (Cathedral) is probably the most famous landmark in Basel. With its red sandstone walls, colourful roof tiles and twin towers, no other building adorns the cityscape of Basel like the Cathedral.

Details
















City Hall

Basel Zentrum







The City Hall is the seat of the Basel government and its parliament. In the midst of the Old Town, it is particularly eye­catching with its red facade, the characteristic tower and playful frescoes.

Details
















Marktplatz

Basel Zentrum







The market square is dominated by the impressive City Hall, the seat of government of the Canton of Basel-Stadt. During the week, the market on the square sells fresh vegetables, fruit and flowers.

Details
















Mittlere Brücke

Basel Zentrum







Hardly another monument in the city of Basel has become such a symbol of the city as the Mittlere Brücke. Opened in 1226, it is one of the oldest Rhine crossings between Lake Constance and the North Sea.

Details
















Pfalz

Basel Zentrum







The Pfalz viewing terrace in Basel offers fantastic views over the Old Town and as far as the border triangle.

Details
















Spalentor

Basel Zentrum







The Spalentor (Gate of Spalen) is the most magnificent and impressive of the three city gates still remaining from the city fortifications dating from 1400.

Details
















Tinguely Fountain

Basel Zentrum







In 1977 Jean Tinguely created sculptural machines in a shallow fountain where the stage of the old city theatre company once stood, and in the process gifted Basel a famous new landmark.

Details
















Basel Old Town

Basel Zentrum







Take a walk with us around Basel Old Town, one of the most well-preserved and prettiest in Europe, and be surprised by the wide variety of architecture, unparalleled in any other city.

Details
















Blue and White Houses

Basel Zentrum







These former residences on Rheinsprung were purchased by the municipality of Basel­City in 1942 and 1968 and today are used by the Department of Commerce, Social Affairs and the Environment.

Details
















St. Alban-Tor

Basel Zentrum







The St. Alban­Tor (St.Alban's Gate), dating back to ca. 1400, was part of the fortifications of the old walled city and is the gateway to a picturesque district of the city.

Details
















St. Johanns-Tor

Basel Zentrum







St. Johanns-Tor (St. Johanns Gate) is one of the three surviving entrance gates to the old mediaeval walled city, which formed part of the fortifications built shortly after the great earthquake of 1356.
