Experience Basel in 24 hours


Do you only have one day to see our city? The following activities will give you a quick overview of Basel.


















Basel Adventure Tour


Solve tricky problems and discover hidden locations – this is the Basel Adventure Tour. You just need a sense of direction and a flair for puzzles. On the tour you will discover hidden corners, sleepy alleyways and many attractions of the city in a rather different way.

Ferry ride


Crossing the Rhine on one of the four ferries is an absolute must. Summon the ferryman with the bell at the landing stage, board the ferry and unwind, just like the people of Basel have done for over 150 years.

A visit to the Kunstmuseum Basel


It can rightly be claimed that the Kunstmuseum Basel is a famous attraction, as it is often listed among the best museums in the world. So when in Basel you should definitely see for yourself why this is so.

Lunch at the Kunsthalle restaurant


There is probably no restaurant in Basel that is more typical of the city. For an informal get-together the locals meet in the "brown part" or in the spacious garden under the chestnut trees. If they have something to celebrate they eat in the more elegant "white part" of the restaurant.

Basel Cathedral and tour of the Old Town


Visit Basel's Cathedral, the symbol of our city. And if you'd like to see more sights we recommend joining one of our public tours of the Old Town.

Dinner in a guild restaurant


The guild restaurants are a very special highlight in Basel's culinary scene. Here centuries-old history meets culinary enjoyment. Enjoy a traditional dinner at one of the restaurants in the centre of town – an unforgettable Basel experience.

Eating & Going out

















After-work drinks


The best way to round off an action-packed day in Basel is with a delicious drink. The Volkshaus Bar, designed by Basel's star architects Herzog & de Meuron, offers a wide range of cocktails. The classic bar atmosphere and music make it the ideal place for a drink or aperitif after work before moving on to the neighbouring Volkshaus Brasserie for dinner.
