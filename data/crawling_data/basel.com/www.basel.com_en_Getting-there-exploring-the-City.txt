Getting there & exploring the City


Basel is situated in the heart of Europe, right in the border triangle region where Switzerland, Germany and France converge. Thanks to its manageable size and the excellent public transport network, it's quick and easy to get around the city.


















Exploring the City


You are sure to enjoy the fact that nothing is far away in our city. Here you can find out more about getting from A to B in Basel – whether on foot, by tram or bus, or with a taxi.

Details

















Getting there


If you are travelling by air, you can reach the city via EuroAirport or nearby Zurich Airport. It's very easy to plan your journey via the three railway stations and the major motorways. Cruise ships also travel down the Rhine to Basel every day.

Details

















Location


Basel lies in the heart of Europe, on both banks of the Rhine. The city is the centre of the idyllic border triangle of France, Germany and Switzerland – lying between the Swiss Jura, Germany’s Black Forest and the Vosges in Alsace.
