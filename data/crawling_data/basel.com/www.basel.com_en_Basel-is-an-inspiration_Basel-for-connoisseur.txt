Basel for connoisseurs.


Museum enthusiasts and culture vultures are not the only ones who will find plenty to enjoy in our city – the people of Basel are masters in the art of enjoying life. Stop by and indulge your tastebuds!


















A shopping tour in the Spalenberg district


Lovers of fine cuisine should not miss visiting the Spalenberg district. With traditional bakeries, a well-stocked tea shop, a specialist cheese shop and purveyors of confectionery and wines, it is the ideal place to stock up on treats in Basel.

Lunch at Restaurant Stucki


Tanja Grandits is a shooting star on the culinary scene and has won both the Gault Millau "Newcomer of the Year" and "Chef of the Year" awards. At Restaurant Stucki she serves aromatic cuisine in which she blends seemingly contrasting ingredients into a harmonious dish.

Pure relaxation at the Dampfbad Basel


The Dampfbad (steam baths) in the St Johann district is proof that good things come in small packages. Finished with a great love for detail, guests can choose from a combination of bathing and massage traditions from both near and far. It is the perfect place to recharge your batteries.

The Dampfbad

















Aperitifs at the bar of the Grand Hotel Les Trois Rois


When the people of Basel want to toast something in an elegant setting they head for the bar at the Grand Hotel Les Trois Rois. It offers a stylish atmosphere, subtle piano music, a terrace with a view of the Rhine, and probably the best cocktails in the city.

Bar Les Trois Rois

















Dinner at the Cheval Blanc


The Cheval Blanc at the Grand Hotel Les Trois Rois – with three Michelin stars – is the number one venue for connoisseurs. Head chef Peter Knogl has also won the Gault Millau "Chef of the Year" award twice. We guarantee that you'll dream about his cooking for a long time!

World-class jazz at the Bird's Eye Jazz Club


Anyone keen on rounding off the evening with top-class jazz should make for the Bird's Eye Jazz Club. There are live jazz performances five times a week, featuring international stars and promising young artists.
