Basel’s southern districts are notable for their diversity: discover magnificent villas in the Bruderholz quarter, the «Gundeli» (Gundeldingen), a melting pot of cultures, and the gritty industrial charm of Dreispitz – one of Basel's fastest-developing districts. With the relocation here of the Academy of Art and Design and the HeK («house of electronic arts»), Dreispitz is also becoming the new hotspot in Basel’s cultural scene.
New in the district: Tellplatz 3
At a central location in the Gundeldingen district, the owners of Tellplatz 3 have created a new meeting place for people who appreciate good food and joie de vivre. On offer are distinctive cheeses, house-made sausages, special spices, distilled products and fine wines. You can take them with you or enjoy them on the spot at a long table in a cosy atmosphere.

Dining tip: Markthalle

It took some time before the building with the striking dome near the SBB train station found its new purpose. After short «guest roles» as an event location and only moderate success as a shopping centre, the building is now being used for the same purpose as in earlier times: the provision of food and drink. However, it is not a classic market. Instead, the Markthalle is home to food stands that offer visitors delicacies from all over the world.

Local character Tanja Grandits

Gault Millau Chef of the Year 2014 and Chef de Cuisine at Restaurant Stucki
«I like it here in the Bruderholz quarter so much because I felt welcomed by its residents from the very beginning. Many of them are regular guests at Restaurant Stucki and in our little «local store». I also really appreciate the fact that the countryside and forest are as close as the city centre. My favourite spot here is little Buremichelskopf Park. I always like to take a second turn around it when I’m out running.»
