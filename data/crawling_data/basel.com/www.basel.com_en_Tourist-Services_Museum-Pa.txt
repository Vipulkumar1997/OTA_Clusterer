Museum Pass


Use Basel as a starting point to visit numerous museums and their exciting exhibitions in the Tri-border Point.



























The Museum Pass grants you entry to about 320 museums in Germany, France and Switzerland.

Visit exciting exhibitions, enjoy long walks through romantic castles, fortresses and gardens, or pay a quick visit to a museum to view the artwork of your favourite painter.
You can purchase your museum pass from the Tourist Information Office at the SBB station, or from the Stadtcasino at Barfüsserplatz.
