Kleinbasel is a good example of the way public perception can change. What used to be referred to disparagingly as «das mindere Basel» («lesser Basel») is today a very popular district. This comes as no surprise: here you can find everything you need to be happy and content – a Mediterranean ambiance along the sun-drenched banks of the Rhine and vibrant squares, streets, bars and restaurants.
New in the district: Restaurant Trio
The new establishment in Kleinbasel is situated right next to Hotel Basilisk opposite the Kaserne (barracks) with a view of the lively Klybeckstrasse. The menu features Mediterranean dishes as well as several classics. Trio was founded by three friends and is a cocktail bar, café and restaurant all in one, as well as a new trendy meeting place in Kleinbasel.

Shopping tip: Bäckerei Kult

It may be located in the city’s oldest bakery, but the concept behind Bäckerei Kult is brand new: in addition to a small array of constantly available products such as croissants, baguettes and sourdough-based breads, Kult offers a continually changing range of creations. The bakery also sees itself as a place where bakers can meet and interact, and serves as a platform for exchanges and recipe-sampling for everyone.

Dining tip: Roter Bären

Ochsengasse, a street which until now was better known as Basel’s red-light district, has recently become a hot address for gourmets. The 250 spherical lamps and peacock-feather wallpaper at Roter Bären make the atmosphere highly unusual all by themselves, but the concept continues in the kitchen, which offers visitors the opportunity to put together their meals from a variety of dishes instead of the usual starters and main courses.

Local character Tino Krattiger

«Skipper» and organizer of the «Im Fluss» music festival
«During my childhood, the area around the Rheingasse looked much like some of the districts in East Berlin right after the wall came down: grey and black houses, untended streets and lots of soot. Today, Kleinbasel offers spruced-up historic streets with an endless variety of restaurants and bars. So it’s not surprising that I like to frequent what used to be Zum Schwarzen Bären and is today called Grenzwert – the bar where Hermann Hesse worked on «Steppenwolf». When I want to eat, I still go – almost every day and with great gusto – to Zum Schmale Wurf. Its two owners, Robi und Michele, are unbelievably slim, just like the name of the place.»
