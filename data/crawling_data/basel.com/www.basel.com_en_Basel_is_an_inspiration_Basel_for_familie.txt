Basel for families


Young and old visitors alike will enjoy the city on the Rhine with its relaxed atmosphere and large number of museums – many of which are interesting for children too – and a wide range of other activities.


















An exciting trip to Basel Zoo


The people of Basel know and love their "Zolli", as it is one of the regular excursion destinations for kindergartens and schools in the region. No wonder, as it is home to over 600 species of animals and visitors can always discover something new.

Visit the Aquabasilea water world


Young guests can get acquainted with water in a fun, child-friendly way at Aquabasilea in Pratteln. Older guests can choose from exciting encounters with the water in the wave pool, the activity pool or the various slides.

Lunch at Aquabasilea


The Aquabasilea water world offers a range of dining options, with a self-service restaurant, a sauna bistro with an inside and outside area, and an Eastern-inspired café in the hammam. There's something for all tastes here.

Treasure hunts with Basil


A treasure hunt with Basil is an adventure for the whole family. Armed with tricky questions, the participants embark on a very special kind of city tour. And there's even a special surprise for the little ones.

A visit to Basel's Marionettentheater (puppet theatre)


The Marionettentheater on Basel's Münsterplatz is an institution in its own right. It has entertained children for generations and it's always a pleasure to see how silent it becomes in the auditorium as soon as the curtain goes up.

Dinner at Papa Joe’s


Papa Joe's is a restaurant located on the popular Barfüsserplatz in the city centre. Its informal atmosphere and American specialities are popular with young and old alike.
