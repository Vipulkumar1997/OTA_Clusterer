Good to know


Basel can look back on over 2,000 years of history. There has been a settlement here since Celtic times – and for good reason. Its geographic location between Vosges, the Black Forest and the Jura Mountains gives our city an exceptional amount of sunshine and one of the warmest climates in Switzerland. As well as encouraging a growing number of people to move to Basel, this is drawing more and more major companies to the city each year.
