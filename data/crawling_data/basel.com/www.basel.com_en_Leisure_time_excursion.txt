Leisure time & excursions


The views from the summits of the Jura, the Black Forest or the Vosges are just a taste of the treasures this region has to offer. You will see even more if you take a short trip into the countryside and enjoy the varied and picturesque regions along the way. The neighbouring cantons of Basel Land and Solothurn, plus Alsace and the Black Forest all form a gigantic recreational area with boundless opportunities for spending your free time. But there’s no need to travel far: Basel itself has plenty of green space and a variety of offers for spending a few free hours.
