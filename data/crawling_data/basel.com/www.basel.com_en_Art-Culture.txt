Art & Culture


Basel is generally known as the culture capital of Switzerland. And not without reason: art can be seen wherever you go, whether strolling through the beautiful Old Town or when visiting one of the almost 40 museums. With their themed collections, the museums have something for every taste and many have reputations that stretch far beyond the Swiss border. On top of that, there are countless galleries scattered throughout the city. And that's not all: the many top-class events that take place here throughout the year strengthen Basel’s reputation as a cultural hotspot. The city also has a lively theatre and music scene.
