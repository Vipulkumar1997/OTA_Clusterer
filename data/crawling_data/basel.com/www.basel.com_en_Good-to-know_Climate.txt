Climate


In comparison with other regions of Switzerland, Basel has extremely favourable weather conditions. Temperatures are relatively mild and the city is not prone to fog.









The Central European continental climate bestows on the city mild average daytime temperatures of 10.3°C in spring, 18.8°C in summer, 10.5°C in autumn and 2.4°C in winter.
The sun shines in Basel for 3,500 hours each year and average rainfall is a mere 90mm per month. The daytime temperature in the summer months can reach as high as 35°C, however low atmospheric humidity means that it is always very pleasant at even the highest of temperatures.
In winter it snows every so often, however snow rarely settles for long periods. Between November and March temperatures usually vary between -2°C and 3.5°C.
