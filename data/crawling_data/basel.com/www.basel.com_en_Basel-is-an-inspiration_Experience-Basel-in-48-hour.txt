Experience Basel in 48 hours


Do you have 48 hours to spend in Basel? Following your
first-day activities
we'd like to recommend a few highlights that will show you why our city's heart beats for art, culture and design.


















Architecture in Basel


There can be few other places where buildings dating back as far as the fifteenth century engage so harmoniously and vibrantly with the creations of modern-day architects. Our "Architecture in Basel" brochure offers three self-guided walks that will take you past the most important contemporary buildings.

Architecture in Basel

















A visit to Museum Tinguely


Probably no other artist was more in tune with Basel than Tinguely. Which is why the Basel-based pharmaceutical group Roche built a museum as a monument to him. The building by Mario Botta houses not only a comprehensive collection of his work but also exhibitions of his artistic predecessors.

Museum Tinguely

















Lunch at the Chez Jeannot restaurant


A visit to the museum's restaurant is also worthwhile: here you can dine overlooking the Rhine, surrounded by more of the artist's works. A very pleasurable way to extend your museum visit!

Chez Jeannot

















Aperitifs at the Bar Rouge


The Messeturm (exhibition centre tower) by Morger & Degelo and the adjacent exhibition centre aren't just an architectural attraction. On the 31st floor you'll find the highest bar in Basel from where you can enjoy a view extending to Germany and France.

Bar Rouge

















Dinner at the Teufelhof – a Basel restaurant and arts venue


All under one roof: the Teufelhof Basel houses a hotel with artistically designed rooms, a small theatre, a wine store and two restaurants: the "Atelier" for every day and the "Bel Etage" for special occasions.

Bel Etage

















A visit to Theater Basel


Theater Basel is Switzerland's biggest multipurpose theatre, offering high-calibre ballet, opera and theatre productions every evening. You'll be amazed at what you can see on Basel's stages.
