Events


It doesn’t really matter when you come to Basel: there are unique events here all year round. Switzerland’s largest Fasnacht (Carnival), the most important art fair in the world, a well-known ATP tournament, a fun fair with a history that dates back nearly 550 years and much more. Actually you should just spend 365 days in Basel, because it's too hard to choose! Here you will find an overview of all the events so that you know what is happening when and you can plan accordingly.
