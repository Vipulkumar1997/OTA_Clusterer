BaselCityTour – the sightseeing bus in Basel.


Embark on a different type of voyage of discovery: Several times a day, Panoramabus tours each day offer you the opportunity to discover the most beautiful places and to board or leave the bus where you wish.












BaselCityTour offers informative and entertaining bus tours around the city centre. The two-and-a-half-hour tour takes you past Spalentor, Kunstmuseum Basel, Museum Tinguely, the Roche Tower, Messe Basel (exhibition square) and the Dreiländereck (Tri-border Point). You can get on or off at any of the 20 or so stops, explore the highlights in the traffic-free city centre and then board the bus again. Each seat has an iPad mini2 with an audio guide app. You can download this free of charge on your smartphone so you can also use it outside the bus. The app presents the tour highlights and provides interesting background information about culture in Basel. Young passengers can enjoy a special channel with stories in Basel dialect.
Tickets:
- Adults: CHF 24
- Children aged 4-12: CHF 12
- Children aged 0-3: Free of charge
