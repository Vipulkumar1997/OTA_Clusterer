Zurich Traditions





“Zwänzgerle”, “Eis, Zwei, Geissebei” and “Schifferstechen” – Zurich and the surrounding region are home to a host of crazy and amusing traditions.


The Swiss may not be renowned for their sense of humor, yet in Zurich they are full of fun when they take part in the city’s quirkiest traditions: for example, they are courageous when they plunge into the Limmat river at icy minus temperatures during the “Samichlausschwimmen” event, smart and proud in their beautiful costumes at the Sechseläuten spring festival, and relaxed and cheerful during “Knabenschiessen” or “Badenfahrt”.
