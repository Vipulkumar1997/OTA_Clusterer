Zurich, the Shopping Paradise

Each quarter of the city offers its own unique shopping experience: from the finest chocolate, watches and jewelry on the famous Bahnhofstrasse, to trendy and traditional stores in the Old Town, through to local, urban labels in Zurich-West.

In summer, the many weekly markets in Zurich and region sell flowers, vegetables, local specialties and second-hand treasures. In winter, meanwhile, shoppers are enchanted by diverse Christmas markets.

Most stores are open from Monday to Friday between 9.00am and 8.00pm. Smaller outlets often close at 6.30pm. On Saturdays, the majority of shops are open for business from 9.00am – 5.00pm. On Sundays, you can shop in the 135 outlets at
