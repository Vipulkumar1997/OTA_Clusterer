Hand in Hand: Quality and Sustainability at Zürich Tourism
Zürich. Your sustainable city trip.


Zurich is well on the way to becoming a so-called “smart destination”. Comprehensive efforts to promote quality and sustainability go hand in hand.


As an organization, Zürich Tourism actively promotes quality and sustainability and, in collaboration with its partners, is systematically implementing this philosophy: top positions in international rankings underscore this commitment. Zürich Tourism has been awarded the
Quality Label, Levels II and III
of the Swiss Tourism Federation (STF). In this way, it intensively endorses the notion of providing top quality in the Zurich tourist region.

At the same time, Zürich Tourism actively promotes ecological, economic and social sustainability, and has been leading by example in this respect since 1998. Both its staff and its service providers are wholeheartedly committed to this idea. In 2010, Zürich Tourism signed the Sustainability Charter drawn up by the Swiss tourism industry. The organization has been certified according to ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. In addition, since 2010, Zürich Tourism has been offsetting all non-avoidable CO2 emissions in collaboration with the
myclimate
foundation. On doing so, it supports an international climate protection project. In line with the measures adopted by both the City (Strategy 2035, Smart City) and Canton (Cluster Strategy, innovation park) of Zurich, in the long term Zürich Tourism is pursuing the vision of becoming a so-called “
smart destination
”.

As a destination, Zurich regularly dominates the top positions in global sustainability rankings - such as 1st place in the
Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index 2016
or 2nd place in the
Mercer Quality of Living Ranking 2016
. Furthermore, Zurich is one of the most sustainable congress cities in the world, achieving the 3rd highest number of points in the
Global Destination Sustainability Index
(GDS). This year, Zurich is supporting the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development endorsed by the UNWTO (United Nations World Tourism Organization) as a “
Friend of the Year
”.

Experience a Climate-Neutral Zurich:
Tours and excursions that are climate-neutral are indicated on this website by the green leaf symbol. Climate-neutral means that either no harmful emissions are generated or that they are offset via the
myclimate
foundation. Learn more about climate change and protection in Zurich on the
myclimate Audio Adventure
. Further tips for environmentally conscious travelers can be found in the brochure, «
Tips for a Responsible Traveler
», published by the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO).
