Christmas in Zurich


Zurich is simply enchanting during the advent period, with quaint Christmas markets, traditional advent concerts and impressive Christmas shows.

It takes at least 1 hour to make a hand-dipped candle of about 8" in length and 0.8" in diameter





The key information at a glance: Zurich’s magical Christmas illuminations are marked in red, while the blue stars show where the city’s most beautiful Christmas markets are to be found.

































The Christmas market at Zurich main station is Europe’s largest covered market. The centerpiece is a 15 meter high Christmas tree, literally dripping with Swarovski crystals.








The Christmas village at Sechseläutenplatz is many residents’ favorite market. An adorable and quaint hive of activity, reminiscent of Santa’s fabled home in the North Pole.

Christmas lights




During Advent, the city by the Limmat is bathed in magical light: the ‘Lucy’ Christmas lights on Bahnhofstrasse and countless fairy lights twinkle throughout the Old Town from the end of November.















Rennweg




Rennweg near Bahnhofstrasse is particularly enchanting. The lights resemble falling snow and captivate the passers-by.















Augustinergasse




The very picturesque Augustinergasse is even more handsome dressed in its Advent garb.















Limmatquai




The tree-like illuminations along Limmatquai make a stroll through Zurich’s Old Town even more romantic.

Wienachtsdorf










One of the largest Christmas markets in the city of Zurich is held at Sechseläutenplatz, directly in front of the Opera House.

Circus Conelli



Learn more





Switzerland’s first Christmas circus entertains young and old with its acrobatic feats. The circus has been a permanent fixture of Advent in Zurich for more than 30 years.















Lichterschwimmen



Learn more





The Lichterschwimmen floating candles event is organized by Zürich Tourism and the School and Sports Department of the City of Zurich as a Christmas gift to all residents and visitors.




























The oldest Christmas market in the city is in ‘Niederdörfli’, in Zurich’s Old Town.








Zurich’s public candle-making event – during which young and old can create their own candles out of pleasantly smelling beeswax – is for many locals just as much a part of Christmas as Christmas tree decorations are for others.











Activities for Children



Learn more























The Märlitram has been chauffeuring children around Zurich’s city center since 1958. During the trip, two angels recite Christmas stories.












Glühwein (Hot Mulled Wine)



à la Tages-Anzeiger restaurant critic Daniel Böniger


serves 4 persons


1 bottle of fruity Zürich Blauburgunder (Pinot noir) wine
freshly squeezed juice of 1 orange
2 sticks of cinnamon
2–3 whole cloves
1–2 anise stars
2 bay leaves
5–6 peppercorns to add some spiciness (if desired)
honey to sweeten as desired




Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan and heat up slowly. Be careful not to boil the wine, otherwise the alcohol will evaporate. Constantly stir and taste the glühwein. In this way, you can immediately taste if any of the spices is too dominant. If this is the case, remove immediately. Serve at a temperature of around 60 °C.

Ice skating



Ice skating is especially popular at Christmas. Zurich’s three most beautiful rinks stand in a forest, by the lake and in front of the opera house. A cup of hot chocolate or a glass of mulled wine taste even better here.









In front of the Opera House



Ice Rinks in Zurich

High above the city



Ice Rinks in Zurich





The Dolder ice skating rink was built high above the city in 1930. The picturesque skating rink is reached through a small forest and also offers curling.




























The ‘Christkindlimärt’ in Rapperswil is particularly charming. Children adore these lovingly decorated little cabins in the heart of the city.








The Winterthur Christmas market in the center of the Old Town is especially picturesque, thanks to its unique historic surroundings.
