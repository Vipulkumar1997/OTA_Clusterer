The offers on the Zürich Tourism website are non-binding offers (invitation to submit an offer). By making an order (by letter, e-mail, phone, submission of the completed form), the customer submits a binding offer to Zürich Tourism with respect to the conclusion of contract and accepts the GTCs of Zurich Tourism as well as the cancellation policy. Receipt of the order is subsequently confirmed to the customer (by phone, letter, e-mail or a system message). Acknowledgement of receipt shall not be considered acceptance of the offer. The contract shall be concluded only after Zürich Tourism accepts the customer's offer and formally confirms the order to him. In the event that the customer submits a non-binding offer by phone, letter, e-mail or submission of the completed form, the response by Zürich Tourism shall be considered the binding offer with respect to the conclusion of contract. In this case, the contract shall be concluded by means of the customer's explicit acceptance of the offer.

Any open claims arising from the cancelled booking which are held by Zürich Tourism with respect to the customer shall be cancelled.
In the event that the service cannot be carried out or is cancelled by Zürich Tourism due to reasons for which Zürich Tourism is not responsible, and in the event that the customer provides proof that he is not personally responsible, Zürich Tourism reserves the right to execute a partial refund of up to 50%; however, it shall not be under any obligation to do so. With regard to the financial consequences of a customer's cancellation of a service, Zürich Tourism's conditions of cancellation apply.

Third-party services are subject to the contractual conditions of the service provider.

2.         Conclusion of the contract with third parties
Third-party offers on the website of Zürich Tourism shall be considered non-binding offers by the third-party.

Receipt of the order is subsequently confirmed to the customer (by e-mail or a system message). Acknowledgement of receipt shall not be considered as the acceptance of the offer. The contract with the third party shall be concluded only after the customer's offer has been accepted and the order has been confirmed to him. In the event that the customer submits a non-binding offer through submission of the completed form, the response received shall be considered the binding offer with respect to the conclusion of contract with the third party. In this case, the contract with the third party shall be concluded by means of the customer's explicit acceptance of the offer.

3.         Fulfilment of contract and cancellation
The third party as contractual partner of the customer is solely responsible for fulfilment of the contract. The contractual terms of the third party shall apply.
