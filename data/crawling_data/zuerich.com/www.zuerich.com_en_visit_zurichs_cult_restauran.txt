Zurich’s Cult Restaurants





These restaurants have been shaping the face of Zurich for many years, and visitors should not leave the city without having visited at least one of them.


Whenever you visit a city, besides the sights, you also want to experience the culinary highlights on offer. What do the locals like to eat? What are the regional and fresh specialties, and what culinary trends can be found here?

In particular, the following tradition-steeped restaurants characterize the city of Zurich:


























The Classic


Kronenhalle








Tuck into delicious food surrounded by original artwork by Picasso, Giacometti or Chagall – you can only get that at the Kronenhalle on Bellevue.








More



























The Italian


Casa Ferlin








Italian grandezza and the best ravioli in Zurich can be found in the over 100-year old Casa Ferlin.








More



























The Vegetarian


Hiltl








When Ambrosius Hiltl opened Europe’s first vegetarian restaurant in 1898, the whole of Zurich laughed at the “root bunker”. Nowadays, Hiltl is cult!








More



























The Sausage


Sternen Grill








The Sternen Grill is Zurich’s original street food outlet, serving the best sausage with the hottest mustard in town.








More



























The Hearty


Zeughauskeller








In the one-time arsenal storehouse, the weapons are now only for decoration and hearty traditional Swiss fare is served in the vaulted cellar.








More



























The Beam Test


Oepfelchammer








In the oldest wine tavern in Zurich, guests can enjoy traditional Swiss dishes and the spectacle of guests attempting the legendary “Beam Test”.








More



























The Noble


Lobster & Oyster Bar








Anyone who likes fresh seafood should be sure to visit the elegant Lobster & Oyster Bar at the Hotel St. Gotthard, which dates from 1935.








More



























The Sensual


Blindekuh








In the world’s first “dine in the dark” restaurant, guests have to trust their nose, mouth, ears and hands, for they can see absolutely nothing.








More



























The Baroque


Zum Kropf








Good hearty fare is served at the Zum Kropf, whose magnificent beer hall painted in baroque style dates from 1444.








More



























The Historical


Kindli








The first pilgrims stopped off at the Haus zum Kindli 500 years ago. In line with tradition, the locale still welcomes guests from all over the world.








More



























The Tradition-Steeped


Lindenhofkeller








In this elegant vaulted cellar, guests are treated to culinary classics and a phenomenal range of wines.








More



























Goethe’s Tavern


Kaiser’s Reblaube








Already from a distance, Kaiser’s Reblaube fascinates with its painted façade. And in the Goethestübli, guests feel like nobility from medieval times.








More



























The Wine Family


Cantinetta Antinori








At this Old Town restaurant, guests are treated to a wide selection of open Antinori wines, as well as exquisite Italian cuisine.
