Winter in Zurich – Ideas for the Colder Months





In winter, Zurich combines Switzerland’s spectacular Alpine world with the amenities of an international metropolis.


The city of Zurich is well worth a visit in winter, too:  besides countless shopping facilities, visitors can find culinary diversity, relaxing wellness offers, and, of course, a vibrant nightlife. However, leisurely days can also be enriched with lots of action and trips into the snow-laden winter landscapes. Many Swiss ski areas can be reached within just 90 minutes by public transportation, ice rinks have been set up in the heart of the city, and – as soon as sufficient snow has fallen – winding toboggan runs in the region around Lake Zurich treat visitors to thrilling rides.













Winter Sport





From the city onto the piste: these ski areas can be reached from Zurich in less than 90 minutes.
