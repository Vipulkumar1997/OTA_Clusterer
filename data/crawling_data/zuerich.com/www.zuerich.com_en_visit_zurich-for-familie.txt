Zurich for Families – Excursion Tips for Families With Children






Culture

Zurich has a large range of cultural events for families with children. Numerous museums organize special workshops, and there are performances for children in the Tanzhaus (dance theater) and Tonhalle Zurich (concert hall). A circus comes to Zurich every year – with its animals in the spring and clowns and acrobats at Christmas.

Animals

There's fantastic animal fun at the Zurich Zoo – with Masoala rain forest and elephant park – as well as at the Wildnispark Zurich or the kids' zoo in Rapperswil.

Nature

The parks and nature reserves in Zurich and the region provide lots of excursion options: on foot, by bike or by boat. Parks with barbecue spots and many playgrounds in the city entice you to linger. There are special offers for families in a few restaurants and hotels too.













Nature





The zoo, which is surrounded by nature yet close to the city, is home to a wide range of fauna.
