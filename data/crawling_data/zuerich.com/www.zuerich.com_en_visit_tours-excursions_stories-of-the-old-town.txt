What do Einstein, James Joyce and Wagner have in common? All three were residents of Zurich. But it‚Äôs not only great minds who are captivated by this lakeside city with its well-preserved old town ‚Äì people from all over the world have always flocked to the thriving metropolis.

On a two-hour walk through the old town, we go searching for clues to the city‚Äôs past in its hidden alleyways and picturesque squares. Together, we uncover the secrets of Bahnhofstrasse, find out what a ‚Äòprocession axis‚Äô is, and visit a church with a minute-hand that jumps a record-breaking half meter every minute.

This popular tour is filled with numerous astonishing and amusing anecdotes and has plenty to offer both visitors and locals alike.

Christmas Edition from November 24‚ÄíDecember 24, 2017
At Advent, the Christmas lights along the Bahnhofstrasse and the various Christmas markets give rise to a magical ambiance in Zurich. During this period, you will receive a surprise during the guided tour.
