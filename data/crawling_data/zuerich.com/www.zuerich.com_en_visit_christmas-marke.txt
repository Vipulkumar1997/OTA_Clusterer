Zurich’s Most Beautiful Christmas Markets





These multifaceted Zurich Christmas markets emanate a wonderful festive mood.


Whether at Zurich’s oldest Christmas market in the picturesque Old Town, at the urban “Wienachtsdorf” Christmas village on Sechseläutenplatz near Bellevue, or next to the 15-meter (49 ft) tall sparkling Christmas tree at the Christkindlimarkt at Zurich Main Train Station: In Zurich, there is a Christmas market to suit each and every taste. A huge choice of gifts and gift ideas enchants visitors to the beautifully decorated market stands.

During a stroll through the Christmas market, there is also plenty of opportunity to warm up with a glass of punch (for the children) or mulled wine (for the adults), or a hot bite to eat, such as raclette or fondue. The Christmas markets in the city of Zurich, as well as in the region around Lake Zurich, are especially inviting and multifaceted, with the result that every visitor is guaranteed to find their own particular favorite.

What’s more, with the special RailAway combined offer, guests can benefit from

20% discount on a return train trip to Zurich, including transfer within ZVV Zone 110 by S-Bahn, tram or bus

30% discount on a voucher for a hotdog and soft drink at Jay's Urban Kitchen at the Christmas market located at Zurich Main Train Station

30% discount on a voucher for a mulled wine or tea at the large chalet in front of the Christmas tree at the Zurich “Wienachtsdorf” Christmas village near Bellevue

This offer is valid from November 24–December 23, 2017.
