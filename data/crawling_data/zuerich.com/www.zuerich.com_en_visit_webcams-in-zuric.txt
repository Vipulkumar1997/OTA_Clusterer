View Zurich Through the Webcam





Even if you are not actually in Zurich, you can transport yourself there and check out the local weather via these webcams.


If you want to know what the weather is like in Zurich, you can find out from the many webcams that transmit beautiful images from throughout the city. There is a webcam on the Uetliberg, for instance, from where on a clear day you can see right across Lake Zurich as far as the snow-capped Alps. Meanwhile, the webcam on the Stadthaus, Zurich’s city hall, gives you a glimpse of the Old Town with its Limmat river and other sights, the Grossmünster and Fraumünster churches, and the tradition-steeped guild houses.
