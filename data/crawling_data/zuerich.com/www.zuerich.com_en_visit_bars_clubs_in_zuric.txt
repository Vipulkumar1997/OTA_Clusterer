Bars & Clubs - Zurich Nightlife Guide





Zurich is the perfect place to be for night owls and dance-mad clubbers. The vast choice of the most diverse of bars means that everyone can find a place that suits their taste.


Whether cocktails, beer or gin, whether football, karaoke, concerts or readings – between them, Zurich’s bars cover every possible preference.

At a late hour, guests head for one of the city’s trendy clubs. Electro, house, rock or reggae – partygoers have plenty of opportunity to take to the dance floor and in many places can dance through to the early hours of the morning.

Good to Know – Bars & Clubs in Zurich

For a number of years,
Langstrasse
has been Zurich’s
most popular entertainment district
among nightlife enthusiasts of all ages.

Night owls can satisfy their hunger at
takeout stands
until late into the night.

Smoking is prohibited
in Zurich’s locales; however, many offer so-called “Fumoirs” (smoker’s rooms).

With the
Zürich Card
, party-goers can benefit from, among other things, free admission to the
Mascotte Club
or the
Casino
, as well as free or discounted beverages at selected venues.
