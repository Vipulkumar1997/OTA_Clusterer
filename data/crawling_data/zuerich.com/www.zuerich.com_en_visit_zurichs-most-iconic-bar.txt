The Cult Bars and Cafés of Zurich





Every city has its share of bars that everyone knows and loves. They are what give the city a face, almost even a character.


Some of them have been around so long that they are simply part of the fabric of the city. They were once frequented by famous names such as Einstein, James Joyce, or Max Frisch. Others are known for a special drink or for their decor, while others have some attraction that makes them unique. The following bars are among the most iconic in Zurich.


























Solid as a Rock


Gräbli-Bar








The Gräbli-Bar is solid as a rock, and open almost around the clock 365 days a year. It only closes very briefly every day to clear up.








More



























A Renaissance


Olé Olé








The Olé Olé dates back to 1967. Once the haunt of Hells Angels, shady characters, and others, these days the clientele is young and hip.








More



























“Aelplimilch”


Aelplibar








Rustic folk music and fabled “Aelplimilch” (“Alpine milk”) are all you need for a few happy hours in the Aelplibar.








More

























Intellectual Tradition


Odeon








A favorite among intellectuals since 1911: Einstein, the Dadaists, Lenin, and many others felt at home in this historical bar on Bellevue.








More

























Where Artists Meet


Terrasse








Directly opposite the Odeon is the Café de la Terrasse, which wows guests with its wonderful garden patio and light-flooded restaurant.








More



























The Piano Bar


Splendid-Bar








This little gem in the Niederdorf is one of the most traditional jazz bars in Switzerland. Here music is played and guests can chat the night away.








More

























Dada’s Birthplace


Cabaret Voltaire








Dada originated here, and from this base it conquered the world. Today the bar is a popular meeting place, with a stage for readings and concerts.








More



























For Whiskey Lovers


Widder Bar








In this classic cocktail bar, everyone is sure to find their favorite drink: 1,000 bottles hold 500 different spirits and 250 single-malt whiskeys.








More



























Legendary


Kronenhalle Bar








The bar belonging to the famous Kronenhalle restaurant is one Zurich’s best: Guests enjoy their cocktails here among original Picassos and Chagalls.








More



























Coffeehouse Culture


Schober








First opened in 1845 as a sweet shop, today Schober is a jewel of coffeehouse culture and famed for its hot drinking chocolate.








More



























Relaxed


Regenbogen Bar








Another classic Zurich bar is “Bögli” or “Rägebögli,” as it is affectionately known, tucked away in the secluded Rosenhof courtyard.








More



























Saved


Kon-Tiki and Züri-Bar








When these history-steeped, cult bars were due to be closed down in 2015, a group of young restaurateurs immediately stepped in and saved them.
