25hours Hotel Zurich Langstrasse is located right next to Zurich's main station. Cultures and lifestyles all converge on legendary Langstrasse. The designer, Werner Aisslinger, regards the hotel as a small, independent universe, inspired by the contrasts between banks and red lights, art and finance. Regularly changing artists work in and around the hotel, always ensuring new, creative input.
