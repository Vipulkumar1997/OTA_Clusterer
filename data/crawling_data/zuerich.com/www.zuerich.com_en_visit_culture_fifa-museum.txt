The FIFA World Football Museum is an interactive experience world for people of all ages, and is guaranteed to get all football fans’ pulses racing.

Spread over three floors and covering approximately 3,000 square meters (32,500 sq.ft) of exhibition space, the FIFA World Football Museum examines all aspects of the world of football. Besides the extraordinary history of FIFA and the Football World Cup, an interactive, multimedia world of experiences illustrates how, across the globe, the game stirs people’s emotions on a daily basis, and influences and inspires them. Along with the original World Cup Trophy, the Museum displays over 1,000 items of exclusive memorabilia and apparel, including the national football shirts of all the FIFA member associations. A further highlight is the giant pinball machine, which invites visitors to test their own ball skills in a playful manner – guaranteeing plenty of fun, including for non-football fanatics.

The
Sportsbar 1904
, a
bistro
and a
cafeteria
ensure that guests do not go hungry. In addition, the Museum shop – which, like the restaurants, is open to the public – stocks a range of great gifts and souvenirs for fans of all ages.
