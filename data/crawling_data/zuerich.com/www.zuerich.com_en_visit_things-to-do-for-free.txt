Zurich For Free






Things to do For Free – Experience Zurich on a Budget

Many people are not aware of the fact that numerous Zurich museums have free admission. What's more, the
Money Museum
, of all places, is one of them! And the
Zoological Museum
. And the
Langenberg Wildlife Park
. And … the list is long.

Sporty visitors can explore the city free of charge and from a completely different perspective with a rental bicycle from "
Züri rollt
” – whereby the view from the Polyterrasse is anyway priceless. A number of beautiful parks and gardens are open to the public, while some riverside bathing areas entice with the opportunity for a refreshing dip – not to mention free admission. And if, after so much activity, you have worked up a thirst, you can quench it with a drink from one of the city’s 1,200 fountains, all of which provide top-quality drinking water.

Zürich Card: The Smart Way to Discover Zurich

Another great way to save money in Zurich is by purchasing a
Zürich Card
.
