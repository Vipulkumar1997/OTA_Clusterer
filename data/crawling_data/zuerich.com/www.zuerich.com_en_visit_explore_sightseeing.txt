More than just a city


Zurich offers a wide variety of typical sites and locations. The Grossmünster, Lake Zurich, Bahnhofstrasse and Zurich Zoo are just the start...

1,200

The city of Zurich boasts 1,200 fountains – and you can drink from every single one of them





Zurich’s famous facades certainly have a story or two to tell. Urban explorers can visit the Grossmünster and the historic guild halls, as well Lenin’s apartment in exile or Einstein’s favorite cafe.









Steeped in history




The center of Zurich tells the tale of the city. Did you know that Platzspitz park used to be a shooting ground, that Bauschänzli was part of the city’s fortifications and that Lindenhof was Zurich’s first settlement?















The Old Town




Zurich’s Old Town is particularly well known for the picturesque ‘Niederdörfli’ on the right bank of the Limmat.















‘Bauschänzli’




The ‘Bauschänzli’ is a relic of the city’s former Baroque fortification. Today, the artificial river island is home to a pleasant garden restaurant.















Platzspitz




Platzspitz was infamously referred to as ‘Needle Park’ in the 1980s when it was a gathering point for hundreds of drug addicts. Today, the park is once again a lovely place to relax, just as it was in the 18th century.























Zurich’s churches



Zurich’s skyline is dominated by its churches. The twin towers of the Grossmünster, the stained glass windows of the Fraumünster and the clock tower of St. Peter are all prominent features of the cityscape.









The Grossmünster Church




Huldrych Zwingli once proclaimed his reformation from the Grossmünster, in turn giving rise to the Reformed Church. Zurich is even referred to as ‘the Zwinglistadt’ or 'Zwingli city' to the present day.















The Fraumünster Church




Established in 853, the Fraumünster Church is one of Zurich’s landmarks. The Fraumünster was a Benedictine convent and is famous for its stained glass windows by Chagall.















St. Peter




Situated on a hill near the Lindenhof, St. Peter church has the largest tower clock face in Europe.




























What would Zurich be without Lake Zurich? The city's very own ‘sea’ is perfect for summer swimming and all kinds of water sports. And a boat ride around the lake is an absolute must!








Zurich is blessed with countless parks and green spaces. One of the most beautiful is the Chinese Garden, a gift from Zurich’s twin city Kunming in China.











Zurich Zoo



Zurich Zoo




















Zurich Zoo is easily accessible and is one of Europe’s most attractive zoological gardens. It is committed to conservation and biological diversity.









Cultural diversity



Zurich places a high premium on art and culture. In addition to its exquisite opera house, culture vultures will discover the best museums, concerts and theaters.










In the heart of the city, Zurich Opera House is a real gem. It has hosted countless debuts and world premieres, and is the favorite venue of many renowned opera singers.
















Rote Fabrik is an alternative cultural center with theater and concert stages – a nexus of slam poetry, graffiti, music, food and drink.















Kunsthaus




The Kunsthaus is home to one of Switzerland’s most eminent art collections, ranging from the 15th century through to the present day.
















The former shipbuilding yard in Zurich-West combines theater, outstanding cuisine and a jazz club all under one roof.























Urban creativity



A new district is emerging in Zurich-West around the old factory building. It lends Zurich its unconventional charm and provides plenty of space for creativity.










Frau Gerolds Garten is another attraction in Zurich-West, offering an urban oasis of shops and restaurants, surrounded by trendy nightclubs and bars.
















Zurich’s already diverse museum landscape has yet another addition. The new FIFA Museum is dedicated to all things related to the beloved round leather ball.
















Gamblers can try their luck right in the heart of Zurich: poker, blackjack, roulette and much more. The casino is open 365 days a year.
