"Birchermuesli"



à la Hiltl


For 4 people


Preparation time: approx. 20 minutes
Leave to stand: approx. 6 hours or overnight

50 g (2 oz) of rolled oats, fine
35 g (1 oz) of rolled spelt
150 ml (5 fl oz) of orange juice
250 g (9 oz) of sour milk with bifidus
50 g (2 oz) of pear syrup
200 g (7 oz) of fresh berries, mixed
1 apple
1 banana, ripe
70 ml (2½ fl oz) of cream
Fresh fruit as desired for the topping




1. Mix together the rolled oats and spelt, orange juice, sour
milk and pear syrup, then leave to stand in the refrigerator
for 6 hours or overnight.

and fold in. Top the Bircher muesli with the prepared fresh

Zurich Specialties

Visitors to Zurich should be sure to try certain classic dishes. Heading the list is “Züri Gschnätzlets”, a veal ragout that is traditionally served with rösti potatoes. It can be found here:
















When a Luxembourg confectioner brought a macaron recipe to the Confiserie Sprüngli in 1957, his bosses were enthralled. The recipe was refined – and the light and airy “Luxemburgerli” was born.
















Here in Zurich’s Old Town, sweet-toothed visitors come a little bit closer to chocolate heaven. Max Chocolatiers seduces with its soft-melting chocolate creations.
















The best sausages in town – or so many Zurich residents maintain – are to be had at the Sternen Grill at Bellevue. And there must be a grain of truth in this claim, for sometimes the line of customers stretches right back into the street.
