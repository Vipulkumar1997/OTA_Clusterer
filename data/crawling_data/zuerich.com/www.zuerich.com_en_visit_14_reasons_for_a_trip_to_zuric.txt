14 Reasons to Love Zurich


Share this




















By, In and On the Water



Outdoor Pools

Badi-Bars

Lakeview Restaurants




















Water, water everywhere: a dip in Lake Zurich or the River Limmat belongs just as much to Zurich as a ride in a pedal boat or a mild evening in one of the lakeside Badi-Bars.











Zurich’s "Skyline"



Learn More




















The towers of the Grossmünster Church characterize Zurich’s skyline. Incidentally, you can climb to the top of the Karlsturm, where you are rewarded with a spectacular panorama.











Eat Zürich Geschnetzeltes



Restaurant Kronenhalle

Restaurant Kindli

Zunfthaus zur Waag




















No visit to Zurich is complete without sampling the traditional local specialty, Zürich Geschnetzeltes with rösti potatoes. It tastes best in one of the guild houses or in the Kronenhalle.











Historical Corners and Alleyways



Schipfe

Lindenhof

Niederdorf




















Zurich’s picturesque Old Town tells the city’s 3,500-year-old history on the Lindenhof, at Schipfe and in the Niederdörfli quarter.











The Water City



Learn More




















Zurich is home to over 1,200 fountains. The water flowing out of the pipes is of drinking quality and can be consumed without problem.











“The Little Red Train”




















The historical Polybahn funicular takes you from Central up to the Polyterrasse in 100 seconds. From here, you can enjoy superb views of the city.

Sweet Temptations



Buy Swiss Chocolate




















Light and airy Luxemburgerli macaroons from Sprüngli or exquisite Swiss chocolate from Lindt, Läderach or Vollenweider: you just HAVE to sample these mouthwatering treats.











Observing the Animals
