Information about Vancouver



Vancouver is a city in the southwest of Canada. The city's natural attributes are considerable, given that the place is on
                        the River Fraser delta, surrounded by mountains.     Water sports are therefore very popular in the city, especially rowing,
                        sailing and fishing. Vancouver has a very modern architecture including some impressive skyscrapers in the centre. Some of
                        the city's most important buildings include the Anthropology Museum, the Cathedral of Christ Church and the Vancouver Art
                        Gallery.     The city has many interesting places, such as Stanley Park, a large public park that is ideal to relax surrounded
                        by nature. Other places to see include the Archaeological Museum and the city's theatres. One special place for all the family
                        is the Vancouver Aquarium, which is Canada's largest.     Don't miss this fascinating city.
