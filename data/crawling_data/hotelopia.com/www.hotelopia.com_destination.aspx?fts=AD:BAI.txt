Information about Bali



Bali is an island that forms part of the lesser Sonda Islands, in Indonesia. This paradisiacal island is located between Java
                        and Lombok and offers a very varied range of attractions and services, from shopping centres to museums and art galleries,
                        from ancient temples to palaces.    Among the main natural attractions in Bali, Mount Agung is a highlight; it is a 3,100
                        metre high active volcano. We also recommend that you visit the island’s extensive collection of temples; the Temple of Besakih
                        stands out above the rest, it is the mother temple, the centre of all Balinese culture. The temple of The Two Elephants is
                        also attractive, as is the Sacred Forest of Sangeh, filled with monkeys.    However without any doubt, the most alluring thing
                        about the island, are its beaches, full of coral reefs. There are seaside resorts with white sandy beaches and other beaches
                        further north with darker, almost black sands. The majority of the beaches in Bali are suitable for surfing and scuba diving,
                        its crystalline waters are ideal for discovering a fantastic underwater world. Visit this paradisiacal island; discover Bali!
