Information about California Coast



Coastal California is the name given to all the coastal regions of the State of California in the United States.     The coastal
                        areas of the state tend to be wealthier, more liberal and more fun than other parts of the state. It includes the following
                        regions: the San Francisco Bay Area, the Central Coast, Santa Barbara, the city of Los Angeles and the urban area of San Diego.
                        Here you can find some lovely sandy beaches and impressive rocky coastline, warm, tropical beaches and fantastic waves, which
                        attract watersport lovers. One obvious highlight is the city of Los Angeles (including Hollywood and Beverly Hills) which
                        attracts tourists from all over the world.     You can also visit Disneyland, in Anaheim. Other places that we recommend are
                        the scenic city of San Francisco and the interesting city of San Diego, but there is much more to see.    Coastal California
                        offers beautiful nature and fun, with a wide range of opportunities and activities. What are you waiting for?
