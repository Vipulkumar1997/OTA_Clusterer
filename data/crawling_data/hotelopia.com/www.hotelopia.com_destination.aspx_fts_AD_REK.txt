Located next to the Laugardalur Park recreational area, this venue is both peaceful and close to the city centre of Reykjavik.
                              The main street – Laugavegur, can be reached within a brisk 5-minute walk, while Laugardalsholl Stadium – the multipurpose
                              indoor arena, which in 1972 hosted the so called “Chess Match of the Century", is just 300 metres away. The nearest local
                              bus stop is 100 metres away and provides convenient access to the rest of the city. Guests looking for some dinning options
                              can find a number of restaurants and bars within 1km radius. If one doesn't feel like exploring the area he will surely appreciate
                              the onsite Island restaurant, which serves a variety of local and international specialities and is the perfect place for
                              an enjoyable meal. After that guests can head to the cosy lobby bar and relax with an invigorating coffee or a nice cocktail.

Sitting just next to Laugavegur, Reykjavik's main shopping street, this establishment offers outstanding location for anyone
                              wishing to explore the capital city of Iceland. Located on Mjolniholti it is approximately 10 minutes' walk from the city
                              centre and in an area which houses several shops, restaurants, bars and cafés. Within walking distance guests will find Hlemmur
                              bus station, Hofoi House and Kjarvalsstaoir Museum and the Hallgrímskirkja church. Although the surrounding area is quite
                              lively, the venue is perfect choice both for those looking for a quieter place and for those who want to be near the excitement
                              of the city. Build in 2011 the hotel is named by the rock that protrudes from the wall on its first floor. Its look and interior
                              take their inspiration from Icelandic nature, especially the Icelandic rocks, which creates its unique atmosphere and ambiance.

Designed by former state architect Gudjón Samúelsson in 1917 this boutique hotel combines architectural appeal, prime location
                              in the centre of Reykjavik, just 650 metres from the harbour, comfortable accommodation and excellent services. After work,
                              shopping or visiting popular local points of interest like the Hallgrímskirkja Church, guests can unwind with a book or a
                              film in the subdued elegance of their room, among calming muted colours and subtle architectural details. A drink in the on-site
                              bar and a dinner of fantastic local specialties in the stately elegance of the hotel's restaurant will prove an excellent
                              ending of the day.

Information about Iceland



Reykjavík is the capital of the Republic of Iceland. It is the most northerly capital in the world. It is a place of wonderful
                        landscapes, with plenty of open spaces where you can engage in all kinds of sports and activities. The city’s name means “Bay
                        of Smoke”, a name it gets from the geothermal steam that emanates from the city’s homes and swimming pools.    Reykjavík is
                        home to several cultural facilities, one of the best of which is the CIA, which is dedicated to Icelandic visual arts. It
                        is a complex that promotes both local and international artists.    The city is also full of excellent museums, among which
                        we would recommend: the House of Culture, the Icelandic National Museum – which covers 1,200 years of Iceland’s history –
                        the Natural History Museum and the Viking Maritime Museum, among others.    Discover this northern city in its unique and
                        beautiful natural setting. Come and enjoy its many comforts and activities, visit Reykjavík!
