Information about Barbados



Barbados is one of the Lesser Antilles. The nation’s capital is Bridgetown and its beaches are bathed by the Caribbean Sea
                        and the Atlantic Ocean.     The island has good hotels and a good tourism infrastructure. The shopping districts are busy,
                        partly because of the duty free shops. In fact, Barbados is a tax haven.    The natural landscape is extraordinary. Visitors
                        can go on excursions, explore caverns, do some underwater fishing, visit wildlife reserves, walk through spectacular parks
                        and gardens, go on a helicopter ride and play countless sports, including golf, tennis, cricket, horse riding, swimming, diving,
                        snorkelling, water skiing, windsurfing sailing and many more.    The nightlife is active, especially around the Saint Lawrence
                        Gap. The best place to d some shopping is Broadstreet, which is the heart of the island’s shopping district. It has lots of
                        good shops, including some excellent jewellers. If you want some local handcrafts, go to small villages like Holetown and
                        Speightstown.     The cuisine is very good in Barbados, with everything from top-end luxury restaurants to beach bars on offer.
                        Find out about the island’s history at its museums, visit the rum distilleries, see the Barbados Cathedral and Synagogue and
                        the historical houses of St. Nicholas Abbey and Bush Hill House. Visit Barbados.

Our customers' opinions

The location of the hotel is perfect. Situated on the seafront, with access to the bar. Fairly friendly but one member of
                     staff was exceptional. She was the customer relations manager. Outstanding!
