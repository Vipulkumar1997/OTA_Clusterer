Information about Gauteng-Johannesburg



Johannesburg is the capital of South Africa’s Gauteng Province. It is the biggest and most populous city in the country, thanks
                        mainly to the importance it gained through its position as a major trading post for precious minerals like gold and diamonds.
                        There is plenty for people of all ages and tastes to do in Johannesburg. Visitors are spoiled for choice, with beautiful natural
                        surroundings, excellent golf courses, botanical gardens, parks and some impressive architecture all on offer.     Johannesburg
                        also has a lot of cultural attractions, among which are: the Adler Museum of the History of Medicine, the Bensusan Museum
                        of Photography, and the Bernberg Museum of Costume, which has a collection of 18th century garments on display.      You can
                        also take a daytrip to working gold mines or to the Diamond Cutting Works, where you can see the art of cutting and working
                        diamonds in progress.    There are also some aquariums and animal reservations in the city, where you can go to see leopards,
                        giraffes, rhinos and a vast array of birds.    This is a region with a lot to offer visitors. The city of Johannesburg itself
                        will satisfy everybody with its mix of nature and good old fashioned fun and its modern infrastructures. It is an ideal holiday
                        destination for anybody hoping to experience something new.
