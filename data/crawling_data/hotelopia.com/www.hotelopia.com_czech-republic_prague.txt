Information about Prague



Prague is the capital and the most important city of the Czech Republic, as well as being the capital of the region of Bohemia.
                        It is set on the banks of the River Moldava, and is popularly known as the ""the Heart of Europe.""     Among its many attractions,
                        we recommend the 12th century Old Town Square, which is the centre of the oldest part of the city. Two buildings dominate
                        the square: the Town Hall and the Church of Tyn. It is also possible to visit the Baroque Church of St Nicholas, the Kinský
                        family palace and the Stone Bell House, which dates from the 14th century. It currently houses some of the Prague City Gallery's
                        exhibition and concert rooms.     However, it is Prague Castle that is the true highlight of any visit to the city. It was
                        founded in the 9th century, and nowadays it houses the Cathedral, the Royal Palace and many other important monuments. The
                        city's old town has been on UNESCO's list of World Heritage sites since 1992. Discover Europe's heart, visit Prague!
