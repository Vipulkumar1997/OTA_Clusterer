The hotel is in an ideal position in the heart of Cape Town, enticing guests to explore a myriad of attractions in the city
                              – from the vibrant nightlife and trendy downtown restaurants and bars; to the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront to the breathtaking
                              Peninsula and legendary winelands. Surrounded by a neighbourhood where cafés, galleries and museums spill onto the sidewalks
                              and almost everyone prefers to take a walk, the Gardens suburb is like a small town community in the bowels of a bustling
                              city.
