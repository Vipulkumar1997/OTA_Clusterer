Welcome to the Best Western Plus Siding 29 Lodge! Recreational activities are endless, including hiking trails at Banff National
                              Park, and it is all just minutes away from this cozy Banff hotel. Situated close to the Canadian Rockies in the Town of Banff,
                              many guests come for the hiking along Parker Ridge Trail or for boating at Lake Minnewanka. Visit Bow Falls and don’t miss
                              out on Surprise Corner. From gentle, sloping trails to ones fit for avid hikers, there’s something for everyone. There’s also
                              world class golfing nearby at Fairmount Banff Springs. Perhaps world class skiing is what you are after, in which case a trip
                              to Sunshine Village might be in order. There is also Mount Norquay and Lake Louise near this Banff hotel. Day trips to local
                              attractions like Tunnel Mountain Drive are a great way to see the Rockies and explore the region. Make sure to schedule time
                              at Cave & Basin National Historic Site to learn more about what makes this part of Alberta so unique. Glacier Skywalk is fun
                              for the whole family, while a tour of the Columbia Ice Field can’t be missed. How about a Grotto Canyon Ice Walk or horseback
                              riding in the Rockies? A shot of romance can be injected into any trip with a helicopter ride or a horse-drawn carriage through
                              the historic district. White water rafting on Kicking Horse River brings water adventurers to the region or you can watch
                              the sun rise on a balloon tour. Business travelers to Calgary and Edmonton regularly stay at this Banff hotel to enjoy peace
                              and quiet since Banff is primarily a tourist destination. The city caters to many convention businesses on day tours from
                              nearby cities in Alberta, and is known for world class shopping. Home to Canada’s first National Park and Canada’s highest
                              town at 4,540 feet above sea level, there’s always something exciting happening like the Banff Film & Book Festival or Ice
                              Magic Festival.

Information about Canadian Rockies



The Canadian Rockies are in Western Canada. They are part of a continuous mountain range that goes from British Columbia in
                        the north to New Mexico in southern USA.    The closest airport is in Calgary, but if you travel to Vancouver, you will cross
                        the province of British Columbia, which has some truly wonderful landscapes. The highest peaks in the Canadian Rockies is
                        Mount Robson, at 3,954 metres, followed by Mount Columbia, Twin Peak, Clémenceau and Alberta, among others.    These steep
                        mountains hide beautiful lakes, huge valleys, dense forests, glaciers and waterfalls.    There is good comfortable accommodation
                        in the nearby towns of Jasper, Valemount, Banff and Lake Louise.     If you travel in the summer, you can camp in the designated
                        areas of the natural parks, or opt for a small cabin with a chemical toilet in the midst of tall pine trees. The best campgrounds
                        are in Jasper and Lake Louise.    There are over fifteen mountain refuges belonging to the Mountain Club of Canada, which
                        you must reserve in advance, as with the comfortable and accessible youth hostels.     This is an ideal destination for lovers
                        of the great outdoors.
