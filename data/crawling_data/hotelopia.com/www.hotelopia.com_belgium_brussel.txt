Information about Brussels



Brussels is Belgium's largest city and its capital; it is located in the centre of the country and it is the seat of the European
                        Union's most important institutions. The atmosphere here is very cosmopolitan and multicultural; the architecture, both ancient
                        and modern, is exquisite; there are more than 70 museums and a great many other places of interest. In the lower part of Brussels
                        is the place to find the city's heart: the Grand-Place, declared World Heritage. This square has many splendid buildings like
                        the Town Hall, in the Gothic style, and the Maison du Roi, which houses the different costumes worn by the Manneken-Pis, Belgium's
                        national statue.      Take some time to visit the Fine Arts Museum, the Horta Museum, the Belgian Comic Centre, the Royal
                        Palace, the Parliament Buildings and the La Monnaie Theatre. The European zone is very modern, with some good examples of
                        contemporary architecture and some fine shops.    If you want to have fun, see Brupark, with the famous Atomium, Mini Europe,
                        the Océade Water park and the Kinepolis; in The Village you can choose a restaurant and enjoy some fine local or international
                        dishes. Take a stroll in the Galeries Royales Saint Hubert for some luxury purchases. Brussels has attractions for all tastes.
