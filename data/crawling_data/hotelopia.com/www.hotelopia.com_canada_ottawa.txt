Information about Ottawa



The Canadian capital of Ottawa is located in the southeast of the province of Ontario.     This destination is popular with
                        visitors because it is one of the area's most peaceful and attractive cities, with much to see and do. It offers activities
                        all year round, such as the Tulip Festival in Spring, Canada Day in summer and the Winterlude carnival in winter. Ottawa is
                        located on the banks of the river of the same name, and is divided into Lower Town, Centretown (the city's business centre)
                        and Parliament Hill, where the country's legislative seat is to be found.     One of the things that makes this such a pleasant
                        city is the number of green spaces, around 3230 hectares, including play areas and parks, making it one of the greenest cities
                        in Canada. Ottawa is waiting for you: it is a friendly, beautiful place and very cultural too.     You can see the National
                        Arts Centre and many interesting museums and galleries. Visit Ottawa and you'll leave with great memories of this lovely city!
