                              exquisite architectural feature, marble floors, ancient walls and courtyard garden carefully restored to their former glory.
                              The building is a story of arches, beautiful woodwork and exquisite gardens that take one back to an era gone by. The courtyard
                              garden is a beautiful corner for quiet reading or for a leisurely cup of Zanzibar tea! The Palace Museum and the popular Forodhani
                              Gardens, a stone throw away, are an added attraction. The visitor could also drive without difficulty to the East Coast fishing
