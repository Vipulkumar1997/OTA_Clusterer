This hotel is located in the centre of Cancun's hotel zone. The 12-story hotel is a marvel, sparkling against the brilliance
                              of a white sandy beach and the Caribbean Sea, pays homage to a lifestyle of excess, built to accommodate rock stars. It has
                              everything needed to fulfill rock n' roll dreams including acclaimed restaurants, bars and lounges, expansive poolscape and
                              a spa with outdoor massage areas. There are many night time destinations, shopping centers, restaurants, bars in the area.

Information about Cancun and vicinity



The coastal city of Cancun is in the south-east of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Being on the Yucatan Peninsula, Cancun
                        has a coastline on the Caribbean Sea.     It is an internationally famous tourist resort, widely considered to be a heaven
                        of excellent beaches lapped by a clear blue sea. The beaches on offer range from the popular crowd pleasers to the hidden
                        little gems, in coves and bays far from the noise and stress of city life. All are ideal for snorkeling, and other popular
                        ways to pass the time here are jet-skiing and swimming with dolphins. The Cancun Interactive Aquarium is a very popular attraction.
                        It shows visitors marine life and allows them to interact with it. Another reason why so many visitors come to Cancun every
                        year is its historical legacy. There are several Mayan sights close at hand, while there are some still waiting for the most
                        adventurous explorers to uncover them in the jungle.     The centre of Cancun is a alive with fun and activity, with countless
                        restaurants, shops, business centres and night clubs on offer. You will have a dream holiday in Cancun, it won’t disappoint
                        you.
