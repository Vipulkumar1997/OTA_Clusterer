Information about Washington - DC



A trip to America is not complete without a visit to the Nation’s Capital. Washington D.C is such a veritable feast of things
                        to see and do that it is almost impossible to get around in just one visit. At night, its many monuments and memorials illuminate
                        the city whilst during the day, there is the beautiful, scenic and serene Great Falls Park, situated along the banks of the
                        Potomac River.
                        
                        Washington D.C is home to the famous Smithsonian museums which host a wide variety of original exhibits and attractions. There
                        are 19 museums and galleries in all, all free, that feature over 137 million different things to see - including thousands
                        of great and memorable pieces of art and a range of displays that chart man’s progress through history. Washington is also
                        host to the Mount Vernon Estate, once the home of former President, George Washington. Set on 500 acres of beautiful land,
                        this 14 room mansion takes the visitor back in time to learn all about America’s first President.
                        
                        Washington D.C is steeped in history, none more so than in historic Georgetown. Georgetown is one of the oldest and busiest
                        neighbourhoods in Washington D.C with lots of bars, shops and restaurants set on Olde Worlde Cobblestone streets. And, of
                        course, there is The White House, of which regular tours are available.
