Information about Rio de Janeiro



Río de Janeiro is one of Brazil’s major cities, and one of the most beautiful in South America. It s most iconic monument
                        is its gigantic statue of Christ the Redeemer, which sits atop Cerro del Corcovado and has incredible panoramic views.   
                        Río de Janeiro is famous for its tropical beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema, as well as for its fantastic carnival atmosphere.
                        Another iconic image is that of the Sugarloaf Mountain, which you can reach by cable car. You can reach the summit of the
                        Corcovado in a little train that leaves from Tijuca and goes through some wonderful vegetation. The north side of the city
                        is remarkable for having the biggest shanty tons, known as Favelas, in the world, such as La Rocinha. We recommend visiting
                        the flower gardens of Tijuca, the botanical gardens, the Museum of Modern Art, the Monastery of Sao Benito, Paco Imperial,
                        the exotic-looking Cathedral, the Maracaná stadium, the Municipal Theatre and the attractive promenade.    The spectacular
                        beaches are places where you will be able to try water sports, volleyball, football and much more. One of the main attractions
                        of Río de Janeiro is its atmosphere by night: discos, bars, parties, shows and the happy attitude that is typical of the Brazilians.
                        You will also find good accommodation, restaurants and shopping centres. Visit Río de Janeiro.
