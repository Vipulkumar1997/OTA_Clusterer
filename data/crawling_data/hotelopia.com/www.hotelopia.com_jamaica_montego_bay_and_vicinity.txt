Information about Montego Bay and vicinity



Montego Bay is Jamaica's second largest city, and thanks to its mild climate, can be visited all year round, although the
                        winter is drier. A tourist resort, it is surrounded by beaches and gentle hills. Hotelopia recommends a trip to its beautiful
                        beaches, an excursion into the jungle and taking part in kayaking or rafting.
