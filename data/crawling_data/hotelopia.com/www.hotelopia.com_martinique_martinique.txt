Information about Martinique



Martinique is an overseas department of France, being one of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. Its capital is Fort-de-France,
                        a place that has all the best of France with fashion, art and culture. Its beaches are an invitation to those who want to
                        try some water sports like diving, swimming, fishing and sailing, while its mountains are great for hiking and excursions;
                        here you can discover the plants and animals of the forest areas.    The north of the island is volcanic, with woods, rivers
                        and waterfalls. The highest point is Montagne Pelée, at 1,397 metres above sea level. The south offers excellent beaches with
                        lovely coves and the temperature here ranges between 25º and 30º Celsius. You can explore the coral reefs with their multicoloured
                        sea life.    The architecture of the capital is of great interest, with its wrought-iron balconies. Don't miss the 19th-century
                        Schoelcher library and Saint Louis Cathedral.    Other sights include the Rum Museum and the island's important distilleries.
                        The range of accommodation on Martinique is excellent, as is the food and drink.    Christopher Columbus discovered this island
