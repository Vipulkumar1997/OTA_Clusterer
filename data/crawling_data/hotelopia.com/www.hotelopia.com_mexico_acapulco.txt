Information about Acapulco



Acapulco de Juárez, better known simply as Acapulco, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Its beaches
                        are famous for their natural beauty and excitement. This beautiful city, often referred to as the “Pearl of the Pacific” is
                        divided into three recreational zones: Traditional Acapulco, Golden Acapulco and Diamond Acapulco.     Acapulco combines the
                        comforts of a modern metropolis with the excitement and mystery of a city just waiting to reveal its ancient history and secrets:
                        Acapulco has it all!    Its beaches are a veritable paradise of golden sand, tepid water and majestic palm trees. Among the
                        most famous of these are: Revolcadero, Condesa, Roqueta, Papagayo, Caleta, Caletilla and  Puerto Marqués. There are also some
                        unspoiled beaches, like La Bonfil and Barra Vieja, which are reached by a road that runs next to the seashore near the airport.
                        If you want to enjoy a wonderful sunset or just relax by the sea, Acapulco is the place for your next holiday.
