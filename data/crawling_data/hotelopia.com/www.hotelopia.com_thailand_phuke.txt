Information about Phuket



Phuket is the largest island in Thailand. It is very hilly and its highest point is the Mai Tha Sip Song, at 529 metres. 
                        The west coast boasts some beautiful sandy beaches. Patong is the most popular one, although Karon and Kata, among others,
                        also attract a great many visitors. These white sand beaches and the clear waters of the sea make this the perfect place for
                        all kinds of water sports such as sea kayaking, surfing, snorkelling, sailing, jet skiing, parasailing, fishing and, of course,
                        diving to see the coral reefs and the amazing seabed, full of life.    Don't miss the sunset from the southernmost point of
                        the island, Laem Promthep; it is truly spectacular.  Patong is the place to go if you want to go shopping or you fancy some
                        nightlife, since here there is a wide array of restaurants, bars and nightclubs, especially around Bangla Road. The range
                        of hotels and bungalows is also very good.     Some of Phuket's most visited monuments include the Wat Chalong temple and
                        the Big Buddha. Have a stroll through the old part and take in Phuket's colonial architecture or visit one of the museums
                        or exhibition centres.    Your holiday in Phuket will be unforgettable.
