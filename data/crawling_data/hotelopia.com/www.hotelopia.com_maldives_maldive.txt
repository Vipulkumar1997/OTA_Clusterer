                        Sultan Mohammed Thakurufaanu-al Azam) and the President's Palace, home to current President, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.     A stroll
                        through Malé's fruit and fish markets, full of flavours and colours, is a real joy. Visit Baa Atoll, where you can buy some
