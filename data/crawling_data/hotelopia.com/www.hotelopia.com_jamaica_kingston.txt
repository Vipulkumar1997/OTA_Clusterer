                        there are heavy showers. The city lives to the rhythm of reggae music, which started in Jamaica, and the Jamaican Bob Marley
                        made this form of music popular worldwide. In Kingston, there is a museum dedicated to the great man, with artefacts which
                        belonged to him and recordings of him and about his life. It is Jamaica's most popular museum, and reggae lovers who visit
                        the city will not want to miss it.    Another of the city's attractions is the National Gallery, where works by Jamaica's
                        most important artists can be found.    Kingston is also the perfect base for visiting the island, which has a great many
                        beaches with white sand and crystal-clear waters. In fact, the city's beaches are very well cared for.    A visit to Kingston
