Making my booking
1. How do I make a hotel reservation?
To enable you to make your booking you will be guided through
                  the Hotelopia site and offered selections or prompts for information where necessary. Our site is designed with simplicity
                  in mind to save you time in searching and booking. The steps are as follows:
Step 1
:
Search
                  for destination and dates required.
Step 2
:
Review search results and click on the link for
                  more information.
Step 3
:
Select the hotel of your choice and on our booking page, enter names
                  and payment details.
Step 4
:
Your reservation will be confirmed and you will receive an email
                  with a voucher to present to the hotel upon arrival.
2. Are the rates on your site per person or
                  per room per night ?
All the rates quoted by Hotelopia are per room (not per person) per night and inclusive of tax.
                  We also advise whether or not breakfast is included. We always show the final hotel price upfront so that there will be no
                  surprise charges when you enter your credit card details. The price you see on the search results page is the price you pay.
3. Can I make reservations on the Hotelopia site without registering?
Yes. You can make bookings
                  without registering but we recommend that you do in order to receive our regular newsletter and gain access to exclusive offers.
                  It only takes a moment to subscribe and you can unsubscribe at any time. Simply click on the newsletter section on our homepage.
4. Why do I need to enter the age of my child?
The policy regarding child discounts varies from
                  hotel to hotel. This is why, when you are searching for hotels, we ask you for the number of children who will be staying
                  with you and their ages at the time of travel. All discounts are applied to the total price quoted.
5.
                  Do I receive a hotel voucher for my booking?
Yes, by email. You need to print this booking confirmation voucher and
                  take it with you to present to the hotel when you check in. It doesn´t need to be printed in color, a black and white copy
                  is sufficient.
6. What if I lose my voucher and/or booking reference number?
Phone our Customer
                  Services Center and they will look it up for you using your name and date of arrival at your hotel.
7. If the confirmation email does not arrive or I lose my booking voucher, how can I print a copy of the voucher?
Go
                  to the Access Your Booking section on the site. There you will be able to retrieve and print the details of your booking.
8. How do I know if my hotel reservation is confirmed?
Once you´ ve completed your hotel booking, your
                  reference number will be displayed on the screen. We will also email you your booking confirmation, which will show your complete
                  itinerary and your reference number. This email also includes a voucher to be printed and presented to your hotel on arrival
                  as proof of your reservation.
9. Do I need to confirm my booking with the hotel directly?
No. The
                  booking confirmation voucher printed from our site is all you need.
10. Who do I contact if I need help?
Thanks
                  to our Customer Services helpline and emergency phone number at destination, Hotelopia offers a service that is 24 hours a
                  day, 7 days a week. Reservations can be made online or with the

Changing or cancelling my reservation
17. How can I amend my booking?
Simply contact Hotelopia´s call center on the number you will find on your
                  voucher, and quote your booking reference number and/or your name, dates and the name of the hotel booked. A consultant will
                  then be able to help you with any changes you would like to make.
18. How can I cancel my booking?
Cancellations
                  can be effected through the web site in the "access your reservation" section. Please note any cancellation must be made through
                  us and not directly with the hotel and will be subject to our terms and conditions.
19. How much will
                  I be charged if I cancel a booking?
Before you confirm your acceptance of your booking, you will be advised of the
                  exact cancellation fee that will be applied for the particular hotel you have chosen. Reducing the number of nights booked
                  within a certain time limit may also result in similar charges.
20. What happens if I need a refund?
Hotelopia
                  will credit your refund directly to the credit/debit card that was used to pay for the booking. We do not store your credit/debit
                  card details on our website, but the bank will be able to identify your account from the booking reference number.
General
                  questions
21. How can I find out about the best deals?
We list selected offers on our homepage
                  and send out regular newsletters packed with great deals. All of the prices shown in our search results are the best prices
                  available at that time and are heavily discounted.
22. What happens to my hotel booking if my flight is
                  delayed?
All hotel rooms will be held until 10.00 pm on the day of arrival. If there is a possibility of late arrival,
                  please either enter your flight details in the special requests section while making your booking, and this will be passed
                  to the hotel, or call our toll-free call center number. If you are unexpectedly delayed at the airport, you can contact our
                  24/7 call center on number you will find on your voucher, and the hotel will be advised to hold your reservation.
23. Are transfers included?
Transfers are not included. It will be your own responsibility to arrange
                  your arrival and departure to and from the hotel.
24. How can your prices be so cheap?
Our parent
                  company services over 8 million customers a year and as a result we have negotiated greatly reduced rates for our clients.
                  Furthermore, since we are an internet business without a high street presence, our overheads are kept to a minimum enabling
                  us to pass on great savings to you. You can save up to 75% on your booking with us.
25. How many kilometres
                  are there in a mile?
Some useful metric conversions:
1.6 kilometres are equivalent to 1 mile.
1
                  kilo = 2.2 lbs.
1 pint = 570 ml.
1 litre = 1,75 pints.
26. Why is the price different
                  to when I last checked?
Changes may be made to reflect market conditions and currency fluctuations. We are continually
                  renegotiating rates with our suppliers to bring you the cheapest prices possible. Once a booking has been confirmed the price
                  will not change.
27. I´ve just phoned my hotel and they have no record of my reservation. Why has this
                  happened?
We have a guaranteed allotment of rooms every night of the year with our contracted hotels. We only need
                  to inform the hotel of who will be filling those rooms a couple of days in advance. Therefore, if you contact the hotel before
                  this time they will not yet have your name or recognize your booking reference.
28. What are your Terms
                  and Conditions?
