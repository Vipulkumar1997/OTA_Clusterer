Information about Macau



Macau is on the south coast of China, close to the province of Guangdong, in the western part of the Pearl River Delta. It
                        is a special administrative region that has a great degree of autonomy from the rest of the country.     It is a very successful
                        holiday destination thanks to its many restaurants, casinos, historical sites and much more. The Macau Peninsula is the region
                        to the north and it is one of the most popular. Taipa is an island in the south of the peninsula that boasts good casinos,
                        shopping centres and many other types of entertainment. Another very interesting island is Coloane, which is home to a very
                        famous golf course, two lovely beaches and lots to do in the great outdoors.     Macua has a rich historical legacy that is
                        evident in every corner of the city. A walk around Macau quickly reveals churches, fortresses, temples, museums and old alleyways
                        that show strong Portuguese and Chinese influences. Especially noteworthy is the statue to the Chinese Goddess Bodhisatta
                        Avalokitesvara. Fun is assured in Macau, given that the range of things to do is endless: casinos, go-karting, hiking, cycling
                        and swimming on Coloane’s wonderful beaches are just some of the options. Visit magical Macau, you won’t regret it.
