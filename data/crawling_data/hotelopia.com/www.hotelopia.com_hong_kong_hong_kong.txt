Information about Hong Kong



Hong Kong is a region in the People's Republic of China that is made up of a peninsula and a number of islands in the South
                        China Sea. The most famous of these is Hong Kong Island. The region is one of China's two special administrative regions,
                        the other being Macau.     One of Hong Kong's main attractions is Victoria Peak, the highest mountain on the island, at an
                        altitude of 552 metres. It offers amazing views over the city and the harbour. We also recommend you visit the Aberdeen district,
                        which is now a modern harbour area with a full range of facilities and leisure options. Another interesting place is Causeway
                        Bay, probably the most popular shopping area on Hong Kong Island.    The most impressive buildings here include the Bank of
                        China Tower, which was the city's tallest building for a long period, and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. You can also visit
                        Deep Water Bay and Repulse Bay, where you will find the best beaches in Hong Kong.     Don't think twice and come to discover
                        this amazing city!
