Information about Nassau



Nassau is the capital of the Bahamas. It is on the island of New Providence. It is the shopping, cultural and tourism capital
                        of the archipelago. It has a lot of sea and air traffic – its colonial-style port receives lots of cruise ships. Its Atlantis
                        complex, which is close to Paradise Island, is very well known.    We recommend visiting the Museum of Pirates, Fincastle
                        Fort and its huge tower, Fort Charlotte and the Governor’s Residence. If you want to buy attractive handcrafts and souvenirs,
                        go to Straw Market.    This is a tax haven where you will find good casinos that are open both day and night. Enjoy the colonial
                        splendour of Nassau by taking a carriage ride through its streets.    Cable Beach is the best beach. It has fine white sand
                        and crystal-clear water. Cabbage beach is also very popular and has big hotels and rental of all kinds of sporting equipment.
                        Caves Beach is small, but very picturesque and popular.    If you want to enjoy really quiet beaches, go to Adelaide Beach,
                        on the south coast, which is empty during the working week, or to Love Beach, home to the world-famous Compass Point Studios.
                        Explore the coral reefs and enjoy the heaven on earth that is Nassau.
