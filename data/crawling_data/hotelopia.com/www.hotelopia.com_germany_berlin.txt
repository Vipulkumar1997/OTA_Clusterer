Information about Berlin



Berlin is the capital city of Germany, and it possesses a huge variety of attractions for tourists of all ages, both cultural
                        and recreational.     One of the most visited places is the Berlin Wall, stretches of which are still standing. Another popular
                        place is the Potsdamer Platz, which in 1920 was one of Europe's most important centres and which, since the fall of the wall,
                        has been reconstructed. Today, it is the site of modern shopping centres and skyscrapers, making it the symbol of the new
                        Berlin.     The city is home to a great many museums, 153 in all, and so if you are looking to broaden your mind, you can
                        choose one of these. If you want to spend an afternoon surrounded by nature, this is easy thanks to the many parks and gardens
                        where you can enjoy some peaceful moments. If you want to see a lively city, with lots of interest, and where you can also
                        relax, Berlin could be your best option.
