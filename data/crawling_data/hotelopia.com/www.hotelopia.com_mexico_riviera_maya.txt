Nestled within over 130 hectares of extraordinary nature reserve and sitting a short 10-minute drive from Playa del Carmen,
                              this modern resort lets its guests experience utter relaxation and discover endless activities. They will be close to all
                              the excitement of the Riviera Maya, with the ocean right on the doorstep, the spa just down the hall and the best dining around
                              just minutes away. Those who are looking for an adventure can sign for the guided kayak tours through mangrove forests or
                              for some snorkeling at the nearby beach. While the daily yoga classes will allow the others to restore their well-being and
                              will help with alleviating some recurring pains and aches. There is hardly a better way to follow a class than some soaking
                              in the sauna or refreshing in the 2 outdoor pools.

Information about Riviera Maya



Riviera Maya is a Mexican holiday destination that goes from Puerto Morelos to Punta Allen, on the Caribbean Sea.    It shares
                        with Cancun the honour of being the country’s most visited region. Its 160 kilometres of coastline include some resorts and
                        beaches that you simply cannot allow yourself to miss, including the following: Puerto Morelos, Playa del Carmen, Playacar,
                        Xcaret Ecological Park, and the wonderful tropical gardens of Xpu-Ha, Akumal, Xel-Ha and Tulum. These are beaches of white
                        sand and placid turquoise waters that are home to the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, the second biggest barrier reef in
                        the world. Other remarkable natural features of the region are the amazing flora and fauna of the jungle and the underground
                        rivers and sinkholes. Among the many activities you can engage in are windsurfing, snorkelling, diving, fishing, golf and
                        hiking your way to some stunning archaeological sites.    At Tulum you will be able to see the remains of the only Mayan city
                        built close to the sea. The city is perched over a beautiful cliff. Slightly inland of this is Cobá, home to the Nohoch Mul
                        pyramid, the highest in the region.     As any visitor will soon realise, this is the ideal place for enjoying an exciting
                        adventure, resting or just soaking up an ancient culture.  Riviera Maya is waiting for you!
