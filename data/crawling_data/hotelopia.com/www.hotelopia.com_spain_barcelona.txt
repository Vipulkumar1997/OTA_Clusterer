Information about Barcelona



Barcelona is the capital of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia and of the province of Barcelona, in Spain. The city lies
                        on Spain’s Mediterranean coast, barely one hundred kilometers from the Pyrenees and from the French border. This wonderful
                        city boasts a perfect blend of architectural styles, with the modern, the Gothic, the medieval and the Roman blending perfectly
                        to make an invigorating mix. There is also a series of buildings by Gaudí that are on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites,
                        among which are Casa Milà (La Pedrera), Palau Güell and Parc Güell.    We recommend visiting Barcelona Cathedral (the Cathedral
                        of the Holy Cross and of Saint Eulalia of Barcelona, to give it its full name), which was built in Gothic style, the Magic
                        Fountain of Montjuic (1929), which puts on a lovely light, music and water show, and the former home of the poet Joan Maragall,
                        which is now a museum.    You will find plenty of parks and gardens in which to relax and soak up the atmosphere of this grand
                        city.  Discover the magic of a truly captivating city, visit Barcelona!
