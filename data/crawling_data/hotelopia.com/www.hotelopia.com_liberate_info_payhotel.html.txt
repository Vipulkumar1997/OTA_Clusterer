Payment directly at the hotel – New Payment Method




1) A flexible system











Hotelopia offers you the possibility to choose the payment method you prefer:
Payment via the website or payment at the hotel
.





What is
direct payment at the hotel
?

Payment at the hotel allows you to make direct payment of your reservation once
                                    you arrive at the establishment rather than through the website. This type of payment
                                    is increasingly requested by customers.










2) Booking process for payment at the hotel










The booking process in Hotelopia is the same as always. You can book in 3 easy steps
                                    and without any extra charge. The only difference is the one at the time of choosing
                                    your hotel in the search results page.


The hotels will be identified with two different colors:






Green hotels for “
Pay on-line
”







And yellow hotels for "
Pay at hotel
"











We also added a new filter to adjust your search. It is called:
"How to
                                            Pay."




By using it, the results are automatically filtered to show only the hotels with
                                    the payment method you selected.

Once you have decided the hotel that best fits your needs, just follow the usual
                                    process of booking by clicking on
"Book"












3) Print the service voucher





Once the booking process is finished, you can print the voucher from the website.



You can also print it from the file that we will send you to the email provided
                        during the booking process.


It is essential to show the voucher at the arrival at the accommodation establishment.





Access your booking

You can access your booking at any time from the top right side of the web by entering
                        the booking code and the email used during the booking process.




From this page you can cancel your reservation directly or send again to your email
                        the service voucher.



To make any changes to your booking, you must contact our Customer Service Center.








FAQs






Does Hotelopia charge anything to your [my] credit card?





Hotelopia.com will not charge any amount to your card. The payment will be made
                        directly at the hotel on arrival or departure depending on the hotel's payment conditions.






Why do I have to provide my credit card details?





The hotel requires these data to guarantee a booking made in case that it is cancelled
                        after the deadline or if the client does not show up at the hotel.






Is it necessary to leave a deposit or make a payment in advance to the hotel?





No, the payment for the stay is to be made once you arrive to the hotel. The hotel
                        reserves the right to check the validity of your credit card details before your
                        arrival.

Some accommodations establishments that function on “check-in” systems, with the
                        objective of avoiding credit card fraud, may employ verification methods for the
                        use of your credit card at a cost of no more than €1, or of one unit of currency
                        in the country of the location. The value of this charge will be returned once the
                        verification has been made. Likewise, prior to check-in, the establishment may,
                        in accordance with cancellation costs, charge your credit card for any costs, to
                        be deducted from the payment made in the end by the accommodation establishment.






Am I allowed to pay at the hotel by using a different credit card than the one
                            I used to make my booking?






Generally, hotels accept different cards or cash. However, we recommend you to find
                        out by contacting the hotel directly.






Can I make a booking with a debit card?





No, hotels do not accept debit cards to guarantee reservations. To make a booking
                        it is essential to use a valid credit card.
