The only hotel located within the Iguaçu National Park, it enjoys an unrivalled location just a short stroll from the sensational
                              waterfalls. Guests enjoy exclusive access to this magnificent sight when the park is closed to other visitors. A Portuguese-colonial
                              residence, this classic hotel is redolent with the atmosphere of lazy days lounging on a veranda or beneath sub-tropical palm
                              trees. This natural paradise also offers white water rafting, helicopter trips over the gorge and jungle treks to view amazing
                              wildlife including colourful toucans and giant butterflies.

Information about Iguazu Falls



The Iguazú Falls are located in two neighbouring countries: Argentina and Brazil, within the Parque Nacional do Iguaçu.  
                        The name is Guaraní for “big water”. The Iguazú River rises on the Brazilian side.  When it joins the Paraná River they form
                        a system of waterfalls on the Brazilian-Argentine border. The system has over 270 original waterfalls, which reach a height
                        of 83 metres and cover 4 kilometres.     These characteristics make them among the most spectacular waterfalls in the world.
                        The Iguazú Falls are 4 times bigger than the Niagara Falls. After the fall, the Iguazú River is submerged in a canyon known
                        as the Garganta del Diablo (Devil’s Throat).     By falling so violently, the water is vaporised into a fine mist that creates
                        a magical rainbow when exposed to the sun’s light. This is one of the most beautiful and striking parts of the whole system.
                        The falls are visited by thousands of visitors from all over the world every year.     They are a natural attraction that
                        can be enjoyed by the whole family. Get to know the Iguazú Falls, you won’t be disappointed!
