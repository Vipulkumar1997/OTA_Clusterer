Information about Halifax



Halifax is the capital of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia; it is one of the world's most important fishing ports and
                        it is Canada's largest naval base.    The Citadel of Halifax is an 18th-century historical enclave, being the most important
                        in the region. It contains a fort, which was an emblem of the British Empire's naval power. 150 of the 328 bodies recovered
                        from the Titanic disaster are buried in Halifax Cemetery, as this city was the base for the operation to search for survivors
                        in 1912. You can discover some of the history of this place by visiting the Atlantic Maritime Museum. You can also enjoy walks
                        in Point Pleasant Park and on McNab Island, with their lovely sea views, and in the evening you can take an excellent meal
                        in the Historic Properties. The Lake Bayers mall is a great place for shopping while you enjoy nature.    The view of the
                        port, with its pleasure craft and schooners, its pubs, shops, museums, parks, street artists, concerts, crafts, excellent
                        food and its people's hospitality make Halifax an unforgettable place."
