Guests will follow the light this exclusive hotel at Toronto. The sun glistens off this 66-story glass tower, while the dazzling
                              open lobby is designed to let in maximum daylight. The same is true of the floor-to-ceiling windows in the residential-style
                              rooms, which only add to their spacious feel (they are among the most generously sized rooms in the city). A steel sculpture
                              by Chinese artist Zhang Huan and other Asian accents — including walls covered in raw silk — add their own lustre. Guests
                              will enjoy the distinctly Canadian menu at Asian inspired Bosk Restaurant. The hotel is ideally situated in the centre of
                              the financial and entertainment districts and is an easy walk to major downtown office buildings. Bloor & Yorkville shopping
                              and dining areas, theatres and performance venues are also easily accessible.
