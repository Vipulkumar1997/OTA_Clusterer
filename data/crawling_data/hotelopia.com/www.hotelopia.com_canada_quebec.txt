Information about Quebec



Quebec, capital city of the province of the same name, is in eastern Canada. It is on the banks of the St. Lawrence River
                        and at the foot of a hill crowned by the famous Château Frontenac.    Its old quarter has been declared a Unesco World Heritage
                        Site. It is divided into the Haute Ville (High Town), which is on the Cap Diamant promontory, and the Basse Ville (Low Town),
                        which goes from the foot of the cliffs to the river.    The walk along the Terrasse Dufferin provides some incredible views.
                        At the summit of Cap Diamant is the Citadel, a fortress that is currently the property of the Canadian armed forces and which
                        recently suffered a terrible fire.    Before you go down the Côte de la Montagne make sure you go and see the Basilica of
                        Notre Dame de Quebec.  You can also take a cable car down to the Basse Ville, where you will find the picturesque old district
                        of Petit Champlain, which has the oldest church in Canada, some interesting museums, the riverside port and many other attractions.
                        Quebec is a wonderful place, both modern and historical, with cold winters and mild summers, it is a perfect place to relax
                        in the soothing peace and quiet of nature. You will have a really lovely time in Quebec, whatever it is you are looking for.
