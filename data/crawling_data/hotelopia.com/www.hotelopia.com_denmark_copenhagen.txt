Information about Copenhagen



Copenhagen is the capital and principal city of Denmark. It is a very clean and well-looked-after city with lovely canals
                        and bridges, not to mention friendly inhabitants.     Copenhagen’s main tourist attractions are: the old Tivoli Fun Park,
                        which was inspired by Walt Disney and holds shows and plays – it also has good restaurants and fireworks displays; the statue
                        of the Little Siren; the Amalienborg Palace; the Rosenborg Palace; the aquarium; the botanical gardens; the Carlsberg brewery,
                        where you can watch the beer being made and even sample some; the attractive pedestrian area of Stroget, with its luxurious
                        boutiques and restaurants; the National Museum, which is the most important one in Scandinavia; the Town Vestibule, which
                        has a tower that provides panoramic views; the zoo and the Christiania shops. You could always just sit back and enjoy a coffee
                        and Danish at one of the many fine cafes.    The nightlife is very good, especially around Nyhavn. There are numerous hotels
                        to suit all tastes and budgets. A good way to get to know the city is to cycle around it. The sight of cruise liners coming
                        and going from the port is a sight to behold. Visit Copenhagen, you won’t regret it.
