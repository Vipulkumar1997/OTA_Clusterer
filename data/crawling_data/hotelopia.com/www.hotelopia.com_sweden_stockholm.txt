Information about Stockholm



Stockholm is Sweden's largest and most important city. It is the capital of the country, and so the location of the seat of
                        government, the parliament and the head of state's residence.    Many of the city's most popular sites are to be found in
                        the old town, which is 750 year old. Here you can see the Royal Palace, with an exhibition of the crown jewels; the Three
                        Crowns Museum; the 13th-century cathedral; the Nobel Museum; the House of the Nobility; the German Church; and the Royal Coin
                        Cabinet.     Another interesting place to visit is the Riddarholmen. In the heart of Stockholm, this is where you can see
                        the statue of the city's founder: Birger Jarls.    If you enjoy open-air activities, you should visit Djurgården, which has
                        some excellent green areas and lovely natural scenery. The city has some attractive wooded spaces, and Galärparken is a good
                        choice, as one of the area's most beautiful parks.    Stockholm is a world-class city, and a very beautiful one. Come and
                        visit it!
