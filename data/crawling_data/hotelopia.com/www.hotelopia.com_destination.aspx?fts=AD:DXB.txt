Information about Dubai



Dubai is one of the seven emirates, and the second largest, that make up the United Arab Emirates. It is located on the south
                        coast of the Persian Gulf.     Dubai is considered to be a luxury destination of great interest with its buildings, its artificial
                        islands, its hotels and architecture making this a paradise in the middle of the desert.    We recommend visiting Dubai Creek,
                        a natural bay that crosses the city and is considered to be Dubai's historical centre. You can also take a stroll along the
                        coast to take in the area's customs and traditions. Worth visiting is the modern group of buildings known as Deira Creekside,
                        with such examples as: the Etisalat Tower, the Department of Economic Development, the National Bank and the Chamber of Commerce
                        and Industry (constructed of blue glass and a symbol of Dubai's prosperity).    Discover this true emblem of Arab wealth which
                        offers many opportunities for recreation: museums, buildings, beaches, artificial islands, mosques, shopping centres, a zoo
                        and many parks and gardens.     Visit Dubai!
