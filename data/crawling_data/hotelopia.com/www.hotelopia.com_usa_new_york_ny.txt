Information about New York - NY



New York City, in New York state, is the United States' largest and most important city.  It has long been one of the world's
                        most important business and finance centres.    Some highlights include the site of the new World Trade Center. The design
                        for this was proposed in 2003 and the centrepiece will be one of the world's highest buildings, at 541.3 metres. The building
                        is to be called the Freedom Tower. There is also to be a monument in honour of the victims of the attacks on the old World
                        Trade Center. There are many other sites to see.     Recommended are the Bronx Zoo, New York's largest; the Brooklyn Bridge,
                        which, crossing the East River, is an emblem of the city; and Central Park, with its artificial lakes, two ice rinks and much
                        more besides, surely one of the world's most famous parks. Perhaps the true symbol of New York, however, is the Statue of
                        Liberty, which is one of the most visited sites in the world.     Live your dreams and visit New York!
