Payment directly at the hotel




1) A flexible system


Hotelopia offers you the possibility to choose the payment method you prefer: Payment via the website or payment at the
                     hotel.
What is direct payment at the hotel?
Payment at the hotel allows you to make direct payment
                     of your reservation once you arrive at the establishment rather than through the website. This type of payment is increasingly
                     requested by customers.



2) Booking process for payment at the hotel


The booking process in Hotelopia is the same as always. You can book in 3 easy steps and without any extra charge. The
                     only difference is the one at the time of choosing your hotel in the search results page.
Exceptions
will
                     be Non Refundable bookings, which cannot be cancelled nor modified, and where the hotel reserves the right to charge the full
                     amount of the booking when receiving the booking confirmation.
The hotels will be identified with two different colors:
                     Green hotels for “Pay on-line” and yellow hotels for "Pay at hotel".






Payment directly at the hotel


We have also included a new filter to adjust your search called "Payment procedure"
Using this filter, the results
                     will automatically be filtered to only show the hotels that use the payment method that you selected.
Once you have
                     chosen the hotel that best fits your needs, all you have to do is follow the normal booking process by clicking "Book".






3) Print the service voucher


Upon completion of the booking you can print the voucher directly from the website.
You can also print the voucher
                     attached in the email that will be sent to the email address provided during the booking process.
You must present your
                     voucher upon arrival at the Hotel.


Access your booking


You can access your reservation at any time from "Your booking" tab at the top of the Hotelopia website. Then, just enter
                     your reservation number and the email address used during the booking process.
From this page, you can cancel
                     the reservation directly, print and email your voucher and receipt, and even request an invoice.
To make changes
                     to your reservation, you must contact our
Customer Service Centre.



FAQ

Do we charge anything to your credit card?

To check the cards validity, Hotelopia may charge 1 Euro to the card during the booking process. This amount will
                     automatically be returned after the card has been checked and the reservation has been made. The payment for the stay will
                     be paid in full at the hotel. The accommodation establishment also has the right to check the validity of your card by charging
                     the cancellation fee to it. In this case, this amount will be deducted from the total due to be paid at the hotel.
EXCEPTION:
If
                     you have booked a Non Refundable Rate, the hotel will charge the total amount to be paid upon confirmation of the booking,
                     by directly entering the total for the full amount.


Why do I have to provide my credit card details?

The hotel requires these data to guarantee a booking made in case that it is cancelled after the deadline or if the client
                     does not show up at the hotel.

Is it necessary to leave a deposit or make a payment in advance to the hotel?

No, you only pay for your stay once you arrive at the hotel. The accommodation establishment can pre-authorize your booking
                     for the amount of the cancellation fee or they can charge you the cancellation fee in order to guarantee the booking. In this
                     case, the fee will be deducted from total amount due to be paid at the hotel. If the hotel is unable to validate the credit
                     card, the hotel has the right to cancel the booking.
EXCEPTION:
If
                     you have booked a Non Refundable Rate, the hotel will charge the total amount to be paid upon confirmation of the booking.
                     Modifications or cancellations are not permitted if you have purchased a Non Refundable Rate


Am I allowed to pay at the hotel by using a different credit card than the one I used to make my booking?

Generally, hotels accept different cards or cash. However, we recommend you to find out by contacting the hotel directly.

Can I make a booking with a debit card?

No, hotels do not accept debit cards to guarantee reservations. To make a booking it is essential to use a valid credit card.
