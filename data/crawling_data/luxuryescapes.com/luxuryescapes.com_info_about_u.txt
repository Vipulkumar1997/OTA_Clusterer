Luxury Escapes Exclusive Offers


At Luxury Escapes, we make sure that any escape featured for a ‘Limited Time Offer’ has been personally reviewed by a member of the Luxury Escapes expert travel team.  We’ll test the beds, swim in the pools, dine in the restaurants and even check out the spa treatments.

While the offers may only be available for purchase on Luxury Escapes for a short time, the travel period is often for twelve months or even  two years, so you can pre-pay your trip to secure the package, and book dates and arrange flights in your own time. Don’t forget to check the ‘fine print’ though, as the exact terms and conditions for each offer is different.

If you do run in to any issues though, don’t hesitate to contact our super helpful support team who work seven days a week.
