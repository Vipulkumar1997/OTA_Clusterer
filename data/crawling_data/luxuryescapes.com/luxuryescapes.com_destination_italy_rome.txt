Holidaying in Rome


Ancient yet cosmopolitan, gritty yet glittering with gold, Rome is a city of contrasts. Surrounding the majestic ruins of the Colosseum, the Pantheon, the Roman Forum and the Trevi Fountain, the frenetic streets pulse with mopeds and locals and tourists alike spilling from oh-so-fashionable shops, restaurants and cocktail bars.


Rome is an embarrassment of riches when it comes to art and culture, and you won’t even have to step into a museum to find it. Set back from the unassuming streets are the most spectacular gilded churches boasting priceless treasures, frescoes and sculptures from the likes of Michelangelo, Caravaggio and more.


Of course, a huge draw card for those visiting Italy is the cuisine on offer, and Rome is no exception. You’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to local trattorias serving up authentic pasta, pizza, gelato and dreamy, feather-light tiramisu, so prepare to arrive with an empty stomach: you have been warned.


The Best of Rome


Soak Up the Sights

Walking the streets of Rome is like stepping into a Dan Brown novel. Get your comfy kicks ready as there is an absolute abundance of must-see landmarks scattered around the city, including the world-famous ancient Colosseum, Vatican City, the Pantheon with its incredible domed ceiling and oculus, the remains of the Roman Forum, the famous Baroque-style Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps and more, not to mention the incredible churches you’ll stumble upon by simply wandering the backstreets.


Sample Authentic Italian Fare

When in Rome, do as the Romans do and tuck into irresistible Italian fare crafted from simple, fresh ingredients. Get your fix at the city’s many trattorias, pizzerias, wine bars and gelaterias, scour local markets for cheese, olive oil, prosciutto, veggies and fresh pasta, or join a local food tour to find hidden gems. Coffee is also a huge part of Roman culture, so a mid-morning stop between sightseeing for an authentic Italian espresso is an absolute must.


Go to the Opera

Where better to see an opera than in the country of its birth? Catch an unforgettable performance at Rome’s beautiful opera house, Teatro dell’Opera di Roma, or during summertime at the Baths of Caracalla, where the ruins of the old Roman baths provide a spectacular and atmospheric backdrop.
