Holidaying in Paris


Glittering and glamorous Paris, reigned over by the glorious
Tour Eiffel
, is renowned as the most romantic city in the world with good reason. For centuries, aspiring artists, writers, poets and performers have flocked to the City of Lights to seek inspiration in its streets. In modern-day Paris there are plenty of romantic moments to be captured, whether that’s strolling over an ornate bridge at twilight as the lanterns flicker to life, sipping on a glass of vino on the terrace of a softly-lit bistro or taking a walk through the Tuileries Gardens, where centuries of lovers have passed before.


The Best of Paris


See World-Famous Sights

At the top of every Parisian tourist’s list is the postcard-perfect Eiffel Tower, which is well worth ascending for the views across the city skyline. Other must-sees for first-timers are the grand and Gothic Notre Dame church,
the iconic Arc de Triomphe monument and
the
Champs-Élysées avenue lined with boutiques and theatres.


French Cuisine

French gastronomy is celebrated the world over and its techniques considered a benchmark by which many great chefs train. Whether or not you have the budget for the upper echelons of fine dining in the city, no matter; you can still enjoy simple pleasures such as a crusty French breads and cheeses, light-as-a-feather macaroons and flaky pastries, and of course, excellent wine.


Fashion and the Arts

Lovers of art and fashion are truly spoilt with riches in the city of Paris. You can literally lose yourself for hours in the depths of The Louvre
which is
home to da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, one of the world’s most iconic artworks,
while fans of contemporary design will be in their element at The Foundation Louis Vuitton. Paris is also, of course, one of the world’s most revered fashion capitals: shop the famous Avenue Montaigne, the home of Christian Dior’s couture house, and walk in the footsteps of Coco Chanel on Rue Cambon, where the designer’s original apartment sits preserved above the Chanel boutique.
