Indulge in an Overwater Paradise









Holidaying in Bora Bora


Bora Bora is arguably one of the most beautiful places in the world and the most famous island in French Polynesia. A-list celebrities and honeymooners flock to this tropical island paradise to immerse themselves in the privacy of the turquoise lagoons, palm tree-speckled beaches and iconic overwater villas that allow guests to dive straight into the coral-filled water below. Boasting some of the world’s most luxurious hotels, Bora Bora truly is a magical destination that many only dream of visiting.



Beyond the bungalows and beachfront cocktails, the beauty about Bora Bora is that visitors can do as much or as little as they want. Famous for its glistening lagoon filled with tropical underwater wildlife, it’s only natural that most of the activities in Bora Bora take place in (or under) the water. Visitors can enjoy scuba diving, snorkeling, diving, fishing, paddle boarding, kitesurfing, jet skiing, and even shark and ray feeding.



The Best of Bora Bora



Feed Sharks & Stingrays



Explore the island’s vibrant coral gardens by getting up close and personal with some of the lagoon’s biggest residents. Tours are available that give guests the opportunity to snorkel through the lagoon’s clear, shallow waters before being allowed to feed the sharks and stingrays under the watchful eye of a guide.



Dine at Bloody Mary’s



Dine on delicious seafood at the world-famous Bloody Mary’s restaurant which has been visitors by celebrities including Kim Kardashian, Martin Sheen, Billy Idol, Steven Tyler, Ringo Starr, Harrison Ford, Jane Fonda and Olivia Newton John. Guests can enjoy fresh seafood and signature cocktails alongside spectacular views of the stunning surrounding landscape.



4x4 Jeep Safari



Cruise through the lush tropical landscape on a 4 x 4 with an exhilarating jeep safari around the island. Learn about the island’s legends, visit local villages, discover World War II artifacts and meet the locals on their fruit plantations.



Visit Vaitape

Vaitape is the largest city on the island of Bora Bora and home to local shopping boutiques and an abundance of seafood restaurants serving freshly-caught delights. Vaitape is also the perfect place to arrange tours to the iconic Monte Otemanu, the highest point on the island of Bora Bora.
