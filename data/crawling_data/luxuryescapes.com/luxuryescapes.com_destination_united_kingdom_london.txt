Holidaying in London


London is really the city that has it all: a rich heritage, both historic and cutting-edge contemporary architecture, palaces, leafy parks, trendy restaurants and bars, vibrant nightlife and world-class shopping, museums, art, culture and sport.


Perhaps the most breathtaking experience of all is standing in the midst of the Big Smoke’s world-famous landmarks that have witnessed the city’s evolution throughout the centuries: the majesty and history of Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, the Tower of London, Westminster Abbey and Tower Bridge are truly something to behold.



Beyond the typical (but worthwhile) tourist traps, if you venture out of the centre you’ll get a taste of this vibrant city’s diversity, from edgy and arty Hackney in the east to Chelsea, Kensington and beyond in the well-heeled west.


The Best of London


Soak Up the History

From the glorious to the downright dastardly, London’s history is chequered and fascinating. Learn all about the fate of the high-profile prisoners at the Tower of London, make a stop at Pudding Lane, the scene where the Great Fire of London began, catch a show at Shakespeare’s Globe –
a recreation of the original theatre which burned to the ground in the 1600s – and get the heeby-jeebies at the London Dungeons or during one of the city’s popular ‘ghost walks’,
which tell the stories of the likes of Jack the Ripper and more.


Shop ‘Til You Drop

Welcome to a shopper’s paradise. The much-treaded Oxford Street is the place to go for affordable high street favourites (with the colossal Topshop flagship as the ultimate mecca for fast fashion lovers), while Bond Street offers the
crème de la crème
of high-end. You can lose yourself for hours in iconic emporiums Selfridges, Liberty of London and Harrods, which are each something of an institution. Devoted (and monied) fashionistas need look no further than the edgy and upmarket Dover Street Market in Mayfair, while hipsters will enjoy truffle-hunting for one-offs and vintage down Brick Lane.


Tuck In

From stalwarts to trendy pop-ups, there is never a shortage of exciting places to dine in this multicultural city. The backstreets of Soho are scattered with gastronomical gems serving everything from Greek to Asian fare, where chattering diners and drinkers spill onto the pavements come evening. Marble Arch is a great spot for Lebanese cuisine, and if you want to taste an authentic curry, head east to Brick Lane.
