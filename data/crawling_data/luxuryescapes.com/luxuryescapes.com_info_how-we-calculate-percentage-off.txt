How We Calculate Percentage Off


We guarantee that our exclusive offers give you the lowest possible price for your holiday. If you find a better price on the same offer with the same inclusions, within 14 days of purchasing, we’ll beat it by 10%!

We calculate the percentage off in our deals based on the ‘rack rate’ of the room and the inclusions at the time the deal is live for the validity period of the deal (that’s hotel-speak for ‘Recommended Retail Price’). Hotels may change accommodation charges depending on peak seasons, low seasons and events so we use the rack rate which is consistent through the year and 100% verifiable.
