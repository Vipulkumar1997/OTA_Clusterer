<p><strong>Holiday Highlights</strong></p>
<p>Whisk your other half away for a romantic<strong>&nbsp;five-night escape</strong> at the<strong>&nbsp;Hotel Tugu Bali.&nbsp;</strong>Includes private return airport transfers, daily breakfasts, one candlelit dinner under the stars, cocktails, daily high tea, signature couple's massage and more.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT CANGGU -&nbsp;Often referred to as&nbsp;&lsquo;the new Seminyak&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>ultra-stylish area of Canggu</strong>&nbsp;is regarded as Bali&rsquo;s hipster hotspot. Located on the coast just&nbsp;<strong>20 minutes from Seminyak</strong>, Canggu is home to&nbsp;lush rice paddies, a&nbsp;<strong>vibrant surf beach</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;happening strips&nbsp;lined with trendy<strong>&nbsp;</strong>coffee shops,&nbsp;chic clothing boutiques&nbsp;and&nbsp;cool bars&nbsp;frequented by a chilled crowd.</p>
<p><strong>THE HOTEL - Voted one of the Top 25 Luxury Hotels in Indonesia on TripAdvisor</strong></p>
<p>Hotel Tugu Bali is a boutique stay with arty touches, featuring a unique collection of art and antiques that tell of the romantic stories and legends of ancient Indonesia. History and romance aside, what you really need to know is that this boutique property is&nbsp;<strong>located one minute from the beach,&nbsp;</strong>features an<strong> ultra-cool cocktail bar with sea views</strong> and has <strong>rave reviews on TripAdvisor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR ROOM -&nbsp;Indulge in a&nbsp;couple's massage in your private spa area</strong></p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from romantic tales, folklore and legends of Indonesia, the hotel's owner designed each room to be unique and reflect the art, soul and spirit of the country, featuring antique timber, four-poster beds and luxurious bathrooms handcrafted by local artisans with <strong>cosy bathrobes&nbsp;</strong><strong>that you can take home</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Rejang Suite</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;perfect for honeymooners with an intimate private spa area where you can enjoy your unique&nbsp;<strong>included signature couple's Balinese dance and massage,&nbsp;</strong>while the&nbsp;<strong>upgraded Dedari Suite&nbsp;</strong>is great for those celebrating a special anniversary or wedding night with&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>tropical plunge pool&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;dreamy day bed.</p>
<p><strong>THE FOOD - Enjoy your included breakfasts, traditional daily afternoon teas and cocktails</strong></p>
<p>Devour your&nbsp;<strong>included daily breakfasts&nbsp;</strong>(chosen from a set menu) whenever and wherever you want - in bed, by the pool, in the garden, it's your choice! But make sure to leave room for more indulgent goodies. From 4pm - 6pm you can enjoy traditional bite-sized delights and local&nbsp;delicacies served on banana-leaf lined woven baskets&nbsp;for your&nbsp;<strong>daily afternoon tea </strong>and don't forget your<strong> included cocktail &nbsp;</strong>(one cocktail per person, per package).</p>
<p>After a day exploring local coffee shops or chilling out on the beach, get into romance mode with&nbsp;<strong>one candlelit dinner&nbsp;</strong>under the stars with Javanese inherited recipes, heritage cuisine and&nbsp;the fresh catch of the day all on the menu.</p>

<p>Discover peace and tranquillity with&nbsp;<strong>seven nights&nbsp;</strong>staying at the serene&nbsp;<strong>Kahanda Kanda&nbsp;</strong>in<strong> Sri Lanka.</strong></p>
<p>Exclusively <strong>for guests aged 12 or older,</strong>&nbsp;the<strong> five-star</strong> Kahanda Kanda is a stunning boutique property&nbsp;situated in the jungle just outside the UNESCO World Heritage-listed city of <strong>Galle&nbsp;</strong>next to Koggala Lake and a working tea plantation. Galle is famous for the iconic&nbsp;<strong>stilt fishermen,&nbsp;</strong>beautiful beaches, lush tea plantations and colonial architecture including the&nbsp;<strong>Old Town&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Galle Fort.</strong></p>
<p>Kahanda Kanda is ideally located close to&nbsp;Galle, and just a 2.5 hour drive&nbsp;from&nbsp;Colombo Airport&nbsp;on Sri Lanka's&nbsp;South Western coast. This is a fantastic launching pad&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>safari day trips&nbsp;</strong>(not included in this package) with&nbsp;<strong>Udawalawe National Park </strong>and<strong> Yala National Park</strong> both about three hours away and home to leopards, Asian elephants, buffalo, eagles, langur monkeys and many more exotic animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sri Lanka is easier to access than ever before, with&nbsp;direct flights from Melbourne and connections from the rest of Australia and an&nbsp;<strong>AU$150 credit per person&nbsp;</strong>to use towards flights (see the 'Fine Print' for more details).</p>

<p>Enjoy a blissful <strong>two-night getaway</strong> in the <strong>Adelaide Hills</strong> at the historic <strong>Mount Lofty House</strong>, including <strong>daily continental breakfasts</strong>, a <strong>AU$100 spa credit</strong> to share, a <strong>welcome drink</strong> each on arrival, Wi-Fi and <strong>late checkout</strong> at 12pm for two adults.</p>
<div class="package-includes"><strong>What You&rsquo;ll Love&hellip;</strong></div>
<p><strong>THE HOTEL &ndash;&nbsp;Historic grandeur&nbsp;with Piccadilly Valley views</strong></p>
<p>Walk in the footsteps of <strong>Victorian high society</strong> at the historic <strong>Mount Lofty House</strong>. Set amongst <strong>22 acres of manicured gardens</strong> and <strong>vineyards</strong> and perched majestically atop a hilly landscape, this stunning <strong>country manor</strong> &ndash; which dates back to <strong>1852</strong> &ndash; was once the summer home of politician&nbsp;<strong>Arthur Hardy</strong>, who used it to host lavish parties. To this day, indulgence is still a cornerstone of Mount Lofty House. Part of the renowned <strong>MGallery by Sofitel</strong> collection, this boutique hotel is home to a<strong> two chef-hatted-restaurant</strong> and a beautiful<strong> day spa</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE LOCATION &ndash; Countryside serenity close to the city</strong></p>
<p>Nestled on the border of <strong>Mount Lofty Botanic Garden</strong> overlooking the <strong>Piccadilly Valley</strong>, this countryside retreat offers the <strong>best of both worlds</strong> with all the attractions of <strong>Adelaide CBD</strong> a mere 20-minute drive away. It&rsquo;s also just minutes from <strong>world-famous wineries</strong> such as Shaw &amp; Smith, Penfolds Magill Estate and Hahdorf Hill Winery.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT TO DO &ndash; Wine, dine and&nbsp;unwind at the day spa&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Start your day with a continental breakfast of <strong>artisan breads</strong> and <strong>home-made muesli</strong> at the hotel&rsquo;s Piccadilly Restaurant (included in your package), before heading out into the Adelaide Hills on a <strong>winery-hopping tour</strong>. Sampling the region&rsquo;s finest nectars in the sunshine is a tough job, so in the afternoon a relaxing <strong>hot stone massage</strong> might be in order at the hotel&rsquo;s <strong>Stables Day Spa</strong>, putting your spa credit to good use. In the evening, sit down to dinner at the hotel&rsquo;s two-chef-hatted <strong>Hardy&rsquo;s Verandah Restaurant</strong>, where you can devour <strong>Australian cuisine</strong> paired with wines selected by the<strong> in-house sommelier</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR ROOM &ndash; Heritage style meets modern amenities</strong></p>
<p>Opening onto <strong>tranquil gardens</strong>, the peaceful <strong>Piccadilly Garden</strong> rooms offer period <strong>Victorian style</strong> married with the convenience of <strong>modern amenities</strong> such as <strong>complimentary Wi-Fi</strong>, <strong>air-conditioning</strong> and <strong>HDTVs</strong>. Wake from a restful night&rsquo;s sleep and enjoy a <strong>morning coffee</strong> on your <strong>outdoor balcony</strong> overlooking the lush greenery of the hotel&rsquo;s gardens.</p>

<p>Wake up to the sparkling azure waters of the <strong>Adriatic Sea</strong> when you spend <strong>three nights</strong> at the <strong>five-star Regent Porto Montenegr&oacute;</strong> with <strong>daily buffet breakfasts</strong>, a glass of <strong>homemade lemonade</strong> and <strong>plate of macarons</strong> on arrival and <strong>20% off</strong> all <strong>spa treatments</strong> and <strong>onsite dining</strong> for two.</p>
<div class="package-includes"><strong>WHAT YOU&rsquo;LL LOVE</strong></div>
<p><strong>The Hotel &ndash;&nbsp;Awarded 'best newly opened hotel' by Vogue Australia</strong></p>
<p>Crowned the Best Newly Opened Hotel by Australian Vogue, it&rsquo;ll be love at first sight the moment you arrive at the hotel and are handed a <strong>welcome glass of homemade lemonade</strong>. Grand in every sense of the word, the architecture pays homage to Montenegr&oacute;&rsquo;s Venetian ties &ndash; be dazzled by the stunning <strong>Murano glass chandelier</strong> hanging in the elegant lobby. The interior designer calls <strong>Mick Jagger</strong> a client so expect touches of refined rockstar royalty. Here your hardest decision of the day will be deciding between lazing in the <strong>outdoor pool overlooking the marina</strong>, <strong>hot tub or hammam </strong>or spend a day of pampering with<strong> 20% off all spa treatments including&nbsp;</strong>luscious face and body beauty treatments using <strong>Aromatherapy Associates</strong>&nbsp;products.</p>
<p><strong>The Room &ndash; Sprawling sea views and complimentary plate of macarons </strong></p>
<p>The European elegance carries through to your room, decorated in a subtle nautical theme (think: blue, cream and beige colourways, a dreamy <strong>linen canopy</strong> hanging above your <strong>king bed</strong> and polished wood). This is where you&rsquo;ll find everything you could ever want with a personal <strong>Nespresso machine</strong>, <strong>large bathroom</strong> with a luxuriant <strong>free-standing bath</strong>&nbsp;and breathtaking <strong>sea views</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The Food &ndash; Complimentary daily buffet breakfasts and 20% all-day dining at The Dining Room</strong></p>
<p>Wake up to a gourmet spread of <strong>American breakfast classics</strong> with <strong>complimentary breakfast each day</strong>. Feast on fresh Mediterranean cuisine with <strong>20% off lunches and dinners</strong> at The Dining Room helmed by <strong>Executive Chef Željko Knezović</strong> (of <strong>Noma fame</strong>). Slip into <strong>The Library Bar</strong> where you can curl up on a leather armchair with a whisky on the rocks in front of the open fireplace, or indulge in a flaky French pastry or refreshing sorbet at the <strong>Gourmet Corner Caf&eacute;.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Location &ndash; Prime waterfront location </strong></p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better location! Situated on an enviable stretch of <strong>palm-fringed coastline</strong> along the <strong>Adriatic Sea</strong>, you&rsquo;ll have the <strong>UNESCO-listed Boka Bay</strong> (one of the most beautiful bays in the world) on your doorstep with towering mountains behind you and <strong>superyachts </strong>mooring in your front yard. Shop <strong>luxury brands</strong> like Balenciaga and Fendi, visit the well-preserved <strong>medieval town of Kotor</strong> or visit <strong>Ostrog monastery</strong> breathtakingly carved into a vertical cliff face.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect For &ndash; Couples wanting a romantic European getaway</strong></p>
<p>Treat your loved one (and yourself at the same time) to one of the <strong>most luxurious and romantic</strong> escapes in Europe. The <strong>perfect addition</strong> to a larger European getaway or an ideal weekend getaway for locals in nearby countries.</p>
<div class="package-includes"><strong>Upgrades and Extended Stays</strong></div>
<p><u>Extended Stay Options</u></p>
<p>Want more time in paradise? Extend your stay by selecting a <strong>four-night or five-night package</strong> above. Or alternatively you can <strong>purchase multiple packages and combine</strong> for an even longer stay.</p>
<p><u>Junior Suite Upgrade </u></p>
<p>For the ultimate indulgence, upgrade to a <strong>Junior Suite</strong> offering 69sqm of refined luxury with <strong>a separate living area, private furnished terrace</strong> and breathtaking <strong>views of Boka Bay.</strong></p>

<p>Discover the vibrant delights of<strong> San Francisco </strong>staying at the city&rsquo;s<strong> super stylish </strong>and<strong> ideally located Kimpton Sir Francis Drake Hotel </strong>with two-for-one daily breakfast for two.</p>
<div class="package-includes"><strong>What You&rsquo;ll Love</strong></div>
<p><strong>THE HOTEL &ndash; Old World decadence </strong></p>
<p>As you pull up to the iconic Kimpton Sir Francis Drake hotel, a doorman in the form of a <strong>red-suited Beefeater</strong>&nbsp;waits to greet you. The doors open to a striking ornate lobby, home to grand staircases, gilded ceilings, sleek marble walls and crystal chandeliers. As a guest at one of San Francisco&rsquo;s <strong>most storied hotels</strong>, it&rsquo;s hard not to get swept up in the<strong> Old Hollywood Glamour</strong> &ndash; after all, it wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that celebrities&nbsp;mingled here in their finery with crystal champagne glasses in hand, on the very same floor that you now stand on.</p>
<p><strong>THE ROOM &ndash; Quirky and cool</strong></p>
<p>As you step into your room, you&rsquo;ll feel as though you&rsquo;ve entered a bygone era of <strong>cheeky grandeur</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Old World decadence</strong>. A red Chinese lacquer dresser lines the wall where <strong>retro animal print bathrobes</strong> hang waiting for you. Quirky lamps by hot American designer Jonathan Alder finish off the space and place the spotlight on your <strong>regal king bed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>THE DRINKS &ndash; One of the best bars in San Francisco</strong></p>
<p>Head upstairs to the <strong>Starlight Room</strong>, aptly regarded as the <strong>diva of all San Francisco lounges</strong>. Positioned on the <strong>21<sup>st</sup> floor</strong> of the hotel, red velvet curtains frame <strong>sprawling city views</strong> and you&rsquo;ll half expect to find Hollywood&rsquo;s Rat Pack lounging in the corner with a cigar and a bottle of&nbsp;premium whisky. If you&rsquo;re here on a Sunday, book a table for <strong>Starlight&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sunday&rsquo;s a Drag&rsquo; brunch drag show</strong> &ndash; bound to be the most tongue-in-cheek mimosa brunch you&rsquo;ll ever experience.</p>
<p><strong>THE FOOD &ndash; Star pastry chef</strong></p>
<p>Indulge your sweet tooth with culinary creations by executive pastry chef<strong> Kimberly Bugler.</strong> The celebrity chef has featured on <strong>Discovery Channel, TLC</strong> and the <strong>Food Network</strong> in the US, she&rsquo;s a <strong>five-time finalist</strong> in the US pastry competition and has been named one of the <strong>Top 10 Pastry Chefs in America</strong>. And she&rsquo;s even cooked for <strong>legendary cook Julia Child</strong> &ndash; if it&rsquo;s good enough for Julia Child, it&rsquo;s good enough for us!</p>
<p><strong>THE LOCATION &ndash; In the heart of Union Square</strong></p>
<p>San Francisco locations don&rsquo;t come better than this. The hotel boasts prime position in the<strong> heart of Union Square</strong> &ndash; the city&rsquo;s premier shopping, dining and entertainment district. Flagship stores like <strong>Macy&rsquo;s</strong>, numerous <strong>theatres</strong>, <strong>opera</strong> and <strong>world-class museums</strong> are literally right on your doorstep. Venturing further afield is easy with the<strong> Powell Street cable car</strong> running past the hotel to <strong>Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf</strong> or alternatively, a 10-minute walk takes you to Market Street where trains, streetcars and buses can take you anywhere you want to go.</p>

Upgrade <strong>Queen Classic Room </strong>(20.4sqm) offering additional space and two queen beds that can <strong>accommodate two adults and two children</strong> (alternatively four adults can stay for a surcharge, see &lsquo;Fine Print&rsquo; for extra guest policies).</p>

Stay <strong>two nights</strong> and enjoy a <strong>complimentary bottle of wine</strong> on arrival, <strong>AU$50 minibar credit</strong>, <strong>early midday check-in, late 1pm checkout</strong>, <strong>complimentary parking and Wi-Fi</strong>, plus a <strong>complimentary hotel art tour</strong> for two. Plus two kids under the age of 12 can<strong>&nbsp;stay free</strong>&nbsp;when booking a Twin Room.</p>
<div class="package-includes"><strong>What You&rsquo;ll Love&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></div>
<p><strong>THE HOTEL - Celebrate the grand opening with a free bottle of wine<br /><br /></strong>Opening 22 November 2017, you&rsquo;ll be <strong>one of the first guests</strong> to step inside the newest Art Series Hotel. The eighth art-inspired hotel is located in the <strong>tallest and most dynamic development</strong> outside of the Melbourne CBD. Pop open your <strong>complimentary bottle of wine</strong> atop the architecturally spectacular <strong>rooftop pool</strong> and <strong>sundeck </strong>as you enjoy<strong> sweeping views of the city.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>THE ARTIST - Discover Zhong Chen's creations on a complimentary art tour</strong></p>
<p>Be inspired by Chinese Australian contemporary artist <strong>Zhong Chen </strong>on your<strong> complimentary art-tour.&nbsp;</strong>As you learn about the transcultural influences of his work, you'll love the bold, colourful combination of his<strong> original and digital art</strong> displayed throughout the hotel.&nbsp;The Box Hill local&rsquo;s <strong>flamboyant yet relaxed</strong> flare reflects the ethnic diversity of the area. &ldquo;I have lived and worked in Box Hill for nearly a decade. I am passionate about my community and its emergence as a cultural powerhouse outside of Melbourne. I look forward to meeting guests and seeing how they interact with the hotel and my artworks,&rdquo; says Chen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>YOUR ROOM - Be the first...and enjoy early check-in, late checkout, free parking and complimentary Wi-Fi<br /><br /></strong>Open your window to beautiful views of <strong>Melbourne&rsquo;s city skyline</strong>, snuggle into <strong>plush bedding</strong> that quite possibly has never been slept on before and get your cultural fix with the Art Series Hotel Group&rsquo;s <strong>signature amenities</strong>&nbsp;where you can learn even more about the art inspired locale through dedicated <strong>art channels</strong>, <strong>artist documentaries</strong> and <strong>art libraries</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION, LOCATION - Best of both worlds<br /><br /></strong>Located 14kms from the CBD, <strong>Box Hill</strong> offers you&nbsp;<strong>suburban tranquillity</strong> with <strong>easy access</strong> to the city. The Chen is within walking distance to the <strong>train station</strong> (in less than 30 minutes&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll be in Melbourne Central), <strong>Box Hill Central shopping centre</strong> and lush <strong>green parklands</strong>.
