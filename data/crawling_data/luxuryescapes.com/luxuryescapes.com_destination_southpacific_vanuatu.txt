Holidaying in Vanuatu


Vanuatu is a South Pacific paradise made up of 83 unique islands that remain largely untouched by tourists. Each tropical drop in the ocean is its own individual island with deserted beaches, hidden swimming holes and even volcanoes dotted across the rugged landscape. While adventurers and explorers are attracted to the islands’ underwater caverns, coral reefs and WWII shipwrecks, honeymooners and couples looking for a romantic escape can also find everything they desire at one of the country’s blissful five-star resorts.



The most popular island in Vanuatu is Efate, where the country’s capital Port Vila is located. Efate is the most developed island in Vanuatu and is perfect for those looking for luxury resorts, colorful marine life and an abundance of restaurants and bars. Other popular islands include Santo, home of world-class diving, giant turtles, turquoise swimming holes and the world-famous Champagne Beach, or Tanna, where travellers will find active volcanoes, traditional Kastom villages and easy access to Mystery Island, a hidden white-sand paradise.



The Best of Vanuatu



Mount Yasur



Located 361-metres above sea level, the bubbling active volcano of Mount Yasur on Tanna Island is one of Vanuatu’s most popular tourist attractions. The volcano has been continuously erupting for over three years with eruptions occurring several times and hour. Regular tours to the volcano’s crater rim are available, and the best time to view the spectacular performances is at dusk.



Mele Cascades



Just 10 kilometres from Port Vila, the Mele Cascades is a popular swimming spot made up of a series of clear aquamarine pool terraces that tumble down a tropical hillside. Visitors can climb a rope to the top of a 35-metre waterfall that flows into a natural plunge pool or enjoy a relaxing picnic in the relaxed setting.



Champagne Beach

Beaches don’t get much more amazing than this. Champagne Beach was given its glamorous name because the sparkling lagoon is filled with effervescent water that resembles a bubbling glass of champagne at low tide. Boasting white side and crystal clear water, this unbelievable haven is one to add to the bucket list.
