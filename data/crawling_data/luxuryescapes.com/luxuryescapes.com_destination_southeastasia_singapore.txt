Holidaying in Singapore


It’s all about bright lights in the big city in Singapore. Whether you’re looking for a quick stopover stay or a week-long holiday in a tropical climate, Singapore has it all. From beautiful gardens to five-star hotels, theme parks, beaches, fine dining restaurants and night markets, this vibrant metropolis has something for the whole family.

Most of the city’s best hotels are centrally located near Marina Bay with easy access to all of Singapore’s iconic attractions including Sentosa island which is home to Universal Studios. Singapore also hosts many of the world’s most exciting annual events including the Formula One Grand Prix and Singapore Food Festival.


The Best of Singapore

Gardens by the Bay


Covering almost 250 acres of land, Gardens by the Bay is a huge futuristic park near Marina Bay. Featuring exotic flora and fauna from around the world artistically displayed in bio-domes designed to replicate the conditions of cold mountains and tropical forests. At Gardens by the Bay the plant kingdom comes alive with ever-changing floral displays and iconic Supertree structures that can be explored using an skywalk.

Sentosa


The entertainment island of Sentosa’s slogan is, ‘Asia’s Favourite Playground’, and it truly is. Over 20 million people visit Sentosa each year to enjoy the island’s incredible attractions which include the Universal Studios Singapore theme park, Adventure Cove Waterpark, Madame Tussaud, S.E.A Aquarium and many more. The island also features 14 hotels and a two-kilometre-long sheltered beach that provides visitors with the perfect combination of a beach holiday in a big city.

Singapore Botanic Gardens


Escape the chaos of the city and take some time out in the beautiful Singapore Botanic Gardens. The gardens feature a diverse landscape made up of a rainforest, lakes and plants from around the world and are perhaps best known for the National Orchid Garden where you’ll find a seven-acre area covered with over 60,000 orchid plants.

Head to a Hawker Food Market


There are over 20,000 eateries in Singapore feeding just five million people, so it’s no surprise that this nation takes their food very seriously. While the Michelin Star restaurants are worth a visit, for an authentic experience visit a hawker food market like Lau Pa Sat or Maxwell Road. At these markets you’ll find a wide selection of Asian dishes and local favourites including Hainanese chicken rice, dim sum, and the national dish of nasi lemak.

Chinatown


Immerse yourself one of Singapore’s more  chilled out neighbourhoods with a visit to Chinatown. Take a stroll around the lanes to see the traditional ‘shop houses’ situated below the city’s skyscrapers, observe the locals playing a game of chess, or relax at a rooftop bar on Club street.
