Holidaying in Hawaii


Hawaii is a dream holiday destination that attracts visitors for its lush flora and fauna, tropical rainforests, world-famous beaches and laidback vibes. From the five-star hotels of Honolulu, to the world’s best surf beaches and hula-dancing locals on the popular islands of Oahu and Maui, and the secret beaches, towering waterfalls and active volcanoes on Kauai and The Big Island, the Hawaiian islands have everything travellers need to create their perfect escape. The only question is, which island paradise do you choose?



With its stylish five-star hotels, two-mile stretch of white-sand beach and luxury shopping boutiques, the beachfront neighbourhood of Waikiki on Oahu island is Hawaii’s most popular holiday destination, while for those looking for spectacular natural beauty with a touch of glamour, Maui boasts some of the world’s best beaches, colourful reefs filled with turtles and tropical fish, dreamy waterfalls and luxury spas. The quieter, lesser-known islands of Kauai, Molokai and The Big Island attract nature lovers to their active volcanoes and beautiful wildlife.

Rainbow Falls

Rainbow Falls is an iconic Hawaiian waterfall located in Hilo. The waterfall is 80 ft tall and is known for its beautiful rainbows that are formed in the surrounding mist. The best time to visit is early in the morning when visitors can catch the best views of the water cascading over a lava cave that legend says is home to the Hawaiian goddess of the moon.
