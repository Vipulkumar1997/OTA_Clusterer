Holidaying in Vietnam


The enchanting country of Vietnam is one of Southeast Asia’s most popular treasures due to its colourful culture, inspiring local traditions, rich history and exotic locations. From tiered rice fields to UNESCO World Heritage-listed sites, vibrant local markets, French-influenced architecture and some of the world’s best beaches, Vietnam has it all.



There’s so much to see in Vietnam, and while many choose to travel to a few places during one visit, others want to simply flop-and-drop in just one beautiful location. The county’s capital city of Hanoi is famous for its French influences, bustling street markets and easy access to the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Ha Long Bay, home to the country’s iconic limestone islands. For those looking to unwind, Hoi An is one of Vietnam’s most popular holiday destinations because of its amazing beaches and charming ancient town that is home to delicious eateries, tailors and art galleries, while Ho Chi Minh City attracts those looking to taste the chaos of vibrant city life with its busy markets, stylish bars and war museums.



The Best of Vietnam



Sapa



Located near the Chinese border, Sapa is a popular trekking town which boasts Vietnam’s iconic terraced rice fields of the Muong Hoa Valley. Visitors are attracted to Sapa for the dramatic mountainscapes, colourful local hill tribes and emerald landscapes that can be explored for days.



Hoi An



The UNESCO World Heritage-listed Hoi An Ancient Town attracts visitors looking to experience Vietnamese charm and culture. Home to an abundance of restaurants, French-colonial architecture, tailors, art galleries and night markets, there’s so much to discover in this quaint town located close to some of the world’s best beaches in Da Nang.



Ho Chi Minh Market



Vietnam’s bustling Ho Chi Minh City is bursting with treasures to discover - both old and new - from historic landmarks such as the 19th-century Saigon Central Post Office and the Romanesque Notre-Dame Cathedral, to glamorous modern-day skyscrapers, bustling local markets and shopping malls.



Halong Bay



It’s easy to fall in love with Vietnam, especially when you visit the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Halong Bay (just 3.5 hours from Hanoi). Vietnamese legend says that the nearly 2,000 towering limestone pillars rose from the emerald waters of the bay when a mountain dragon charged towards the coast. Nowadays, this bucket list natural beauty is dotted with charming Chinese junk boats, quaint markets and five-star hotels.



Hanoi



Vietnam’s bustling capital city of Hanoi is rich in culture, with elegant Paris-style buildings and towering pagodas juxtaposed with mazes of narrow laneways dotted with street vendors and hole-in-the-wall style eateries serving up steaming bowls of pho and bánh mìs in the city’s Old Quarter.
