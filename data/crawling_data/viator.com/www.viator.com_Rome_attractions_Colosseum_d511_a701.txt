Rome ATTRACTIONS

Colosseum Tours



The Colosseum has been a symbol of ancient Rome since it was completed in 80 AD, and today, it is one of the most iconic monuments in all of Italy. Up to 50,000 spectators once gathered in this massive amphitheater to watch gladiatorial games from the soaring tiered seats, which led to the site's complex architecture becoming the standard for modern-day stadiums. Though portions of its original marble facade were pilfered over the centuries to build St. Peter’s Basilica and other churches, the Colosseum remains remarkably intact almost 2,000 years on.
The Basics
As the second most popular attraction in Italy after only the Vatican, the Colosseum hosts some 4 million annual visitors, meaning that long lines are nearly inevitable if you don't book a skip-the-line tour. Choose from a number of tours suited to any age or interest, such as a Colosseum underground tour that heads beneath the arena floor to explore a network of passages; a small-group guided tour of the third tier with its bird's-eye views; or a night tour that offers an eery experience and relief from the daytime heat. Consider group tours, self-guided audio tours, or private tours with a guide to gain an understanding of this very well-preserved ancient Roman amphitheater and its historical importance.
Things to Know Before You Go
The Colosseum is a particularly family-friendly archaeological site, firing the imaginations of kids of all ages.
Purchase Colosseum tour tickets in advance to avoid any long lines to enter.
This is an open-air amphitheater, so bring a hat and sunscreen and wear comfortable shoes and attire.
The Colosseum is also known as the Coliseum and the Flavian Amphitheatre.
How to Get to the Colosseum
Alongside the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill, the Colosseum is in the center of Rome, just across the street from the Colosseo station on Line B of the city's underground metro system, which also stops at the main Termini train station.

When to Get There
Since the Colosseum is most crowded during the middle of the day, begin or end your Rome tour with a visit first thing in the morning or just before last entry (which is an hour before closing time) in the late afternoon. Alternatively, choose a night tour for a unique, less crowded experience. Summer is the most popular time of year to visit, while the site receives fewer crowds in November through February, aside from the Christmas and New Year holidays.
The Colosseum in Numbers
The Colosseum is the world's largest amphitheater, has 76 entrances, and measures 615 feet (189 meters) long by 510 feet (156 meters) wide. The total area of the stadium covers six acres (24,000 square meters), and its highest tier reaches 157 feet (48 meters). It was built in under 10 years and was used for games and hunting for over four centuries.




Practical Info


Metro line B stop Colosseo is located right at the entrance to the Colosseum, while tramway line 3 also stops at the stadium site. Various buses stop outside the metro station. Lines can be very long, so booking a skip-the-line tour is recommended.
