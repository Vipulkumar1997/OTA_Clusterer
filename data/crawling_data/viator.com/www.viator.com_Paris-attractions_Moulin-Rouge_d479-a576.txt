Paris ATTRACTIONS

Moulin Rouge Tours


Expect bright lights, extravagant costumes, and raucous music at the world-famous Moulin Rouge. Opened in the Belle Epoque of 1889 to celebrate Paris' thriving creative scene and the end of the civil war, the windmill-cum-cabaret hall has never stopped basking in fun and frivolity. As a staple of Parisian nightlife, an unforgettable evening at the Moulin Rouge is a must on any traveler's France itinerary.
The Basics
During the show, your vision is flooded with large troupes of Doriss Girls, colorfully clad in sequins and glitzy headpieces, performing flawlessly choreographed French cancan beneath vibrant lights. Intense and innovative, the Feerie show transports viewers to a land of dream-like beauty. As the No. 1 show in Paris and Europe (especially since the release of Baz Luhrmann's cinematic masterpiece) the legendary Moulin Rouge cabaret enjoys immense popularity. That said, tickets sell out fast — book in advance to avoid missing Paris' most sought-after show.
Tour packages cater to all budgets, with some combining VIP seats on a private balcony with gourmet 4-course dinners and Champagne, and others including convenient hotel pickup and drop-off. For the ultimate after-dark experience in Paris, combine a show ticket with an evening dinner on a Marina de Paris or Seine River cruise, or a night-time Paris city illuminations tour that showcases landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower (Tour Eiffel) and Notre Dame Cathedral at their most magical.
Photography and video recording are not allowed inside the Moulin Rouge Paris.
Opt for a tour that includes roundtrip transfers to avoid having to worry about transportation.
Despite the show's adult themes, children ages 6 and up are allowed inside the venue.
The cabaret's dress code prohibits shorts, flip-flops, and sneakers.
How to Get to the Moulin Rouge
From central Paris, the Moulin Rouge is easily accessible by public transport: disembark at Place de Clichy on Metro line 13, or at Blanche on Metro line 2, after a 30- to 40-minute journey. By taxi, Moulin Rouge is a 15-minute drive from central Paris depending on traffic.
When to Get There
The famous cabaret stages shows at 9 and 11pm, with occasional matinee performances. If you opt for the late Moulin Rouge show, the performance can run as late as 1:30am, meaning public transport will have ceased operation. If your tour doesn't include roundtrip transportation, be prepared to wait in the taxi line at the end of the street, or soak up Paris' evening ambiance at one of the bars in the area.
