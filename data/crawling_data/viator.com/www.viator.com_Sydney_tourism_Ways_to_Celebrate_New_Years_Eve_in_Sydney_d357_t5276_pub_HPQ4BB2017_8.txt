Sydney is the grand focal point of Australia's New Year's Eve celebrations. If you're counting down here, expect fireworks over Sydney Harbour, all-night parties at the city's top venues, and a host of family-friendly events. Here are our picks for the most memorable ways to spend New Year's Eve in Sydney.
See a Sydney Opera House Performance
Catching a performance at the Sydney Opera House is a highlight of any visit to Sydney, but the New Year's Eve Opera Gala is undoubtedly the most spectacular show of the season. Settle into your seats for a show-stopping performance by the renowned Opera Australia Orchestra and head out onto the opera house's viewing deck during intermission to watch the fireworks over the harbor.

Enjoy an Evening Cruise
A New Year's Eve boat tour affords the best views of the holiday fireworks display, so set sail across Sydney Harbour aboard a luxurious cruise boat or a traditional tall ship for the ultimate experience. Hit the dance floor, tuck into a barbecue dinner on-board, and sip cocktails on deck as fireworks rain down over the Sydney Opera House and Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Take in the City from Sydney Tower
Look out over the glittering city from the Sydney Tower Eye observation deck, the most unique vantage point from which to watch the holiday festivities. Book ahead to secure a Skywalk ticket for the NYE firework displays and enjoy an unrivaled aerial view of the harbor below.
