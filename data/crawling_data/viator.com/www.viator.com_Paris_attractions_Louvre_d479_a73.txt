Paris ATTRACTIONS

See all


Louvre Tours


Primarily associated with the steady gaze of Leonardo Da Vinci's famous
Mona Lisa
, Paris' Louvre museum is home to a 35,000-strong collection of paintings and sculptures considered one of the greatest in the world. The contemporary glass Louvre Pyramid heralds the museum's entrance, which millions of tourists flock to every year to feast their eyes on masterpieces that span from antiquity to the 20th century.
The Basics
Highlights of the antiquity section include the
Seated Scribe
, the
Jewels of Rameses II
, and the armless
Winged Victory of Samothrace
and
Venus de Milo
. From the Renaissance, don't miss Michelangelo's
Slaves
sculpture or the famous works by Raphael, Botticelli, and Titian. French masterpieces from the 19th century include Ingres'
La Grande Odalisque
, Gericault's
The Raft of the Medusa
, and the work of David and Delacroix.
The large crowds attracted by the Louvre are evidence of the museum's global fame—book a skip-the-line ticket to avoid long lines and save precious sightseeing time. And whether you're a lifelong art fan or a creative novice, exploring the museum with a tour guide is an excellent way to ensure you see all of its highlights and hidden gems. Take a tailored private tour if your interests lie in a particular area, or opt for the skip-the-line and audio guide package if you prefer browsing independently. If you're short on time, choose a sightseeing tour that combines a visit to the Louvre with stops at the Eiffel Tower, Montmartre, and Notre Dame Cathedral, or take in city sights from the water on a Seine River cruise.
Things to Know Before You Go
The Louvre always has big crowds—book skip-the-line entry to save time.
Photography of certain major works inside the Louvre is prohibited.
A Paris museum pass (valid for your choice of two, four, or six consecutive days) includes skip-the-line access at the Louvre and Musee d'Orsay, while also covering entry to other top attractions such as the Arc de Triomphe and Napoleon's Tomb.
Family-friendly Louvre tours tailored to entertain children are available.
How to Get to the Louvre
Located next to the Seine River in central Paris, the Louvre is easy to find. Catch Metro line 1 or 7 to the Palais Royal/Musee du Louvre station.
When to Get There
On Friday evenings, the Louvre stays open until 9:45pm, making it a great time to enjoy the museum with fewer crowds. You'll also see the pyramid majestically illuminated. From October through March, access to the Louvre's permanent collection is free for all visitors on the first Sunday of every month.
