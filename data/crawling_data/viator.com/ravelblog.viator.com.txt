A Taste of Trastevere in a Hidden Roman Villa



Ah, Italy. Red-checked tablecloths, fat candles dripping wax into empty tomato sauce cans. Carafes of red wine. It’s already an obvious fact that dining out in Italy is a memorable event. And if you’re looking for another authentic Roman dining experience, cross the River Tiber to Trastevere, into a historic working class neighborhood that boasts […]

Holy, Hot Wheels!



Hot Wheels cars. Micro Machines. The Hess Truck at Christmas. I have a deep connection to anything with wheels and it started early in life.
