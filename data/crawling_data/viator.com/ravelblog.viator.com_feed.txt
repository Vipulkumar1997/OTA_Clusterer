<p>In a country known for it’s coastline, Paraty is widely regarded as one of Brazil’s most charming beach towns. With a stunningly preserved colonial center, a verdant jungle backdrop and a bay filled with turquoise waters and white sand beaches, it’s a place right out of a postcard. Unfortunately for my travel companion Heather and I, our stay was largely shrouded in clouds and storms. However, during one reprise from the rain, we seized the day in order to escape the city center and enjoy one of my favorite pastimes — <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Paraty/Horseback-Riding-Tour-from-Paraty/d5426-2484PARHORSE" target="_blank">horseback riding</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Our driver met us at our hotel and drove us to the stables. We arrived at the stable and met our guide Joao, who then introduced us to the horses. We knew the group sizes were deliberately kept small but we were delighted when we realized it was just going to be the two of us. While Heather and I are similar in many ways, our heights happens to be about a foot apart. Luckily Joao was there to help match our horses to both our stature and personality.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39137" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Paraty_1-540x360.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>Once aboard our steeds we trotted off into the rainforest to explore Brazil&#8217;s infamous Costa Verde. As we ascended the winding road up a mountain Joao made sure we were comfortable riding our new friends. While we did not exactly share a common language, we both did our best to communicate with smiles and gestures.</p>
<p>We rode past some local farms where we got a glimpse into the life a local in rural Paraty. I thought this would be my favorite stop of the day, but that was before we rode up to a beautiful stream to refill our water bottles and soak up the scenery. Joao humored us by taking my camera and snapping some photos of Heather and I practicing silly yoga poses by the water.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39141" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Paraty_4-540x360.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>As we rode back into town many of the local kids ran up to pet the horses and greet Joao, who was clearly a beloved figure in the community.</p>
<p>The three-hour tour was full of reflective silence and beautiful scenery, and was a refreshing way to spend the afternoon. We relished the chance to experience a slice of rural existence in Paraty from a vantage point we might not have otherwise experienced — and were thrilled to find an activity for when the weather wasn&#8217;t beach-friendly.</p>

<p>Whether you live in Sydney or you’re a first-time visitor, you can’t witness the majestic Sydney Harbour without a soulful longing to be out on the water. And when there are one million people lining the harbor to see the world’s biggest fireworks display on New Year’s Eve, the only way to escape the crowds is setting sail.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tall Ship New Year’s Eve Dinner Cruise</strong> is the perfect tour for anyone searching for the New Year’s Eve celebration of a lifetime. It’s an evening that will trump every other, and make your friends green with jealousy.</p>
<p>The booking process was simple. We received a phone call and email the day before with directions to the departure wharf and meeting time. Thankfully it was only a short walk from our hotel and we arrived promptly at 7:45pm for an 8pm boarding.</p>
<p>Having walked around the city that morning and witnessed the multitudes that spent the entire day waiting for this moment, I could not have been more thankful to be leaving solid ground and boarding our 1850’s style tall ship, the <em>Southern Swan</em>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39122" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/P1010984-2-540x360.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>The <em>Southern Swan</em> was built in 1922 and holds only 90 guests. There was plenty of room to move around and it didn’t feel crowded. When it sailed into the port to collect us, I literally swooned. Crafted from Danish oak, the <em>Southern Swan</em> first sailed to Australia in 1988 to be part of the Australian Bicentennial First Fleet re-enactment and has lived at The Rocks ever since. The ship&#8217;s beauty and majesty was a sight to behold. Long firm lines, tall sails, wooden decks. Straightaway, I knew this was going to be a night to remember. The authentically aged wooden planks of the ship set the stage nicely. Seating could be found everywhere from railings, to benches, to boxes.</p>
<p>We gathered at the front of the ship for a quick safety briefing and then the drinks flowed. The entire 6-hour cruise included an open bar of soft drink, juice, beer and wine. And soon, we detected the delightful scent of food wafting from the galley kitchen. Staff made their way around the ship throughout the night delivering finger food to guests. Our choices included prawns, mini pies, meatballs, sushi and more. Desserts of brownies and fresh fruit followed.</p>
<p>During the first part of the evening, we sailed under the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge and sailed by the Sydney Opera House before stopping for the 9pm Family Fireworks. After these finished the boat turned on its sparkling fairy lights to join the <em>Harbour of Light Parade</em> and our boat was off again on a tour of the harbor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39125" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/P1010999-2-540x360.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>Under the twinkling lights, the mystic moon, and the most iconic Sydney landmarks, the magical evening flew by. Hours were filled with live music and good laughs with our fellow shipmates.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39128" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/P1020004-2-540x360.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>It seemed far too soon that we were dropping anchor in our nominated spot to witness the stunning midnight fireworks display that welcomed in 2017 with a big bang. Over 30,000 pyrotechnic effects lasting 12 minutes were set off from the Sydney Harbour Bridge in front of us and even barges behind us. I didn’t know which direction to look, it was all so enchanting. Without a doubt, we had the best vantage point in the harbor.</p>
<p>After the fireworks finished we started cruising the harbor again, slowly making our way back to the dock just after 1:30am. We hugged fellow guests and stepped onto land in a brand new year. Nothing could have been more delightful than this special night.</p>
<p>Want a New Year’s Eve to remember? Then Sydney, Australia is it. But don’t join the landlubbers for a glimpse of the fireworks behind someone else’s head. Get aboard a tall ship and party the night away like it’s 1849.</p>
<p><em>Heads-up, dear travelers: Although this is a seasonal attraction, <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/" target="_blank">Viator</a></strong> has plenty of <a href="https://www.viator.com/search/sailing" target="_blank"><strong>water-centric activities</strong></a> like this and more.

<p>“I am your captain and this is my espresso,” said the captain as he passed out traditional Croatian <em>rakija</em>, the most common form of domestic alcohol served throughout Croatia, to the passengers on board his ship.</p>
<p>“Cheers, salud, Živeli!”</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39087" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-20-at-4.14.03-PM-1-540x403.png" alt="" width="540" height="403" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-20-at-4.14.03-PM-1-540x403.png 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-20-at-4.14.03-PM-1-768x573.png 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-20-at-4.14.03-PM-1.png 893w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>And with that we set sail across the turquoise waters of the Adriatic Sea on the <a href="http://www.viator.com/tours/Dubrovnik/Dubrovnik-Island-Hopping-Cruise-in-the-Elaphites-Including-Lunch/d904-55623ISLANDS">Dubrovnik Island-Hopping Cruise in the Elaphites Including Lunch</a>. As the fresh sea breeze picked up, I felt instantly relaxed. Our boat cruised along, headed to three different Dalmatian islands. Accompanied by unlimited complementary wine and soft drinks, I knew we were all in for a refreshing and enjoyable day trip.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39075" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/View-from-the-boat-540x403.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="403" /></p>
<p>Not long after departing the dock, we arrived at the small island of Kolo?ep, home to only 130 inhabitants. The welcoming and friendly crew quickly anchored the boat and helped each passenger down to shore safely. On Kolo?ep you can make yourself at home on the sandy beach, where there’s both sun and shade depending on your preference.</p>
<p>If you’re up for more exploring, go for a walk along the crystal clear waters or journey up the hill to some of the island’s many sacred buildings such as St. Mary Church. With a few extra minutes to spare after walking around a bit, I decided to take a seat on one of the benches next to the water and listened to the waves lapping up onto the rocks while looking out over the open sea. Ah, calm.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39090" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Island-of-Kolocep-540x417.png" alt="" width="540" height="417" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Island-of-Kolocep-540x417.png 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Island-of-Kolocep-768x592.png 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Island-of-Kolocep.png 866w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>Before long, it was time to return to the boat and continue on to the next island. Šipan is the longest of all the Elaphite Islands and is known as <em>the</em> place for fishing, homemade extra virgin olive oil and for their red wine. Old meets new with a fifteenth century castle located in the middle of Šipan, nestled in among modern shops and restaurants.</p>
<p>After a quick walk through some of the narrow cobblestone streets, I headed down to one of the pebble beaches where I basked in the tranquility of the island and went for a swim in the Adriatic – the water’s warm, yet another lovely benefit of this unique destination.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39092" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Island-of-Sipan-540x390.png" alt="" width="540" height="390" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Island-of-Sipan-540x390.png 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Island-of-Sipan-768x554.png 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Island-of-Sipan.png 830w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>An hour later I headed back to the boat where a delicious vegetarian meal had been prepared and was waiting for me. Fish and chicken options are also available for omnivores and carnivores alike. After our meals, it was time to visit our third, and final, island for the day.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39076" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/On-Board-Lunch-540x486.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="486" /></p>
<p>As we approached the island of Lopud, our ship captain serenaded us with traditional Croatian songs to welcome us. You have about three hours to spend on Lopud so there’s plenty of time to journey to the other side of the island or browse through the many shops.</p>
<p>I found a peaceful spot on one of the island’s sandy beaches and bathed myself in the warm Croatian sun. Afterwards, I cooled off with the help of fresh gelato from one of the many restaurants dotted along the beach.</p>
<p><em><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-39078" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Island-of-Lopud-540x401.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="401" /></em></p>
<p>Each new turn along the pristine Adriatic Sea revealed island after island, presenting a mesmerizing contrast of cliffs and sea. If you’re ready to escape the crowds of Dubrovnik like I was, jump on board this island-hopping tour, sit back, relax, and enjoy the views!</p>

Quiet Time with Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro

<p>Visiting Rio de Janiero was on my bucket since before I’d even filled out my first passport application. At the very top of the list? A visit to the famous Christ the Redeemer Statue – an imposing concrete and soapstone statue that soars over 100 feet into the air and whose arm span seems to encompass all of Rio de Janiero. You may have seen its likeness in both movie clips and gracing countless postcards alike.</p>
<p>In reality, it’s hard to get that elusive perfect shot because of the significant crowds that the statue attracts. So when I stumbled across the <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Rio-de-Janeiro/Viator-Exclusive-Early-Access-to-Christ-Redeemer-Statue-with-Optional-Sugar-Loaf-Mountain-Tour/d712-6823GIGCHRIST" target="_blank">Early Access to Christ the Redeemer Statue Tour</a></strong>, I was thrilled. This one is a <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/" target="_blank">Viator</a></strong> Exclusive so it can only be booked through Viator – and from experience, I can tell you it&#8217;ll be one of (hopefully) many highlights of your trip to Brazil.</p>
<p>There were several different nationalities in my Viator group but our expert and multilingual guide, spoke handily with all of us in our native tongues. Once we arrived at the midway point of Corcovado Mountain, we hopped off and got in line for tickets.</p>
<p>Now since we were also first in line, we were ready to pop into the official park ranger&#8217;s vehicles just as the gates opened. This, however, is one of the tradeoffs of the early morning exclusive tour – not getting to ride the scenic train up the mountain. And if you struggle with motion sickness, the van transfer and ride with the park ranger may prove to be a challenge. But in my opinion? Worth it.</p>
<p>We were then led to an elevator that took us up the final ascent. There’s also the option to skip the elevator and dash up the staircase which my travel companion and I took advantage of in hopes of beating the crowd. It paid off big time as the two of us got the place to ourselves and took turns snapping shots with the statue, crowd-free. Being serious shutterbugs, this was paradise.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-39003" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ChristoRedeemer_4.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></p>
<p>The tour advertised thirty minutes of tranquility which is pretty accurate, although after the first five minutes, the first guests of the day began to trickle up, so if you want to capture some great photos, solo, act fast.</p>
<p>Once the rest of the guests began to arrive, we’d already gotten our best shots, and then turned our attention out towards the beautiful view until it was time to leave.</p>
<p>For those of you short on time, there’s an option to combine this early morning Christ the Redeemer VIP tour with a second stop at Sugarloaf Mountain located at the tip of Guanabara Bay in the Atlantic Ocean. We chose to save Sugarloaf for another day, though it seemed to be a popular second destination as most of our fellow tour takers were headed that way.</p>
<p>Although it’s not easy to get a few moments alone with arguably the most famous piece of installation art in Rio de Janeiro, with just a few simple tips – take the stairs (if you’re able) to beat the crowd and setting your vacation alarm just a little bit earlier for this special tour – you’ll end up with amazing, exclusive photos and of course, some stunning memories to go home with.</p>

<p>You’re a traveler in search of thrills. Those experiences that get the adrenaline flowing, the blood pumping and of course, boost those hard-earned bragging rights. A good story to tell your friends, and the photos to back it up. You open up your browser and start searching destinations: Climbing Everest? Too dangerous. Surfing the world’s biggest swells in Portugal? Too far. Hiking in Bhutan? Good luck getting a visa.</p>
<p>Those on-the-go adrenaline-junkies have a dirty little secret. Las Vegas.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38999" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Vegas2.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="358" /></p>
<p>Sin City is known of course for slots, quickie weddings and a range of stage spectacles, but it also excels in offering visitors a different set of thrills.</p>
<p>Put down that poker chip and check out some of the following exciting activities in Vegas.</p>
<h4>Go Fast</h4>
<p>Zoom down one of the nearby zip line options, including the SlotZilla that runs over bustling Fremont Street or the <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Bootleg-Canyon-Zipline-Tour/d684-5192ZIP" target="_blank">Bootleg Canyon Zip Line</a></strong> in Boulder City. If you’re more into control then head to the <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Las-Vegas-Race-Car-Driving-Richard-Petty-Rookie-Experience/d684-5089RPRE" target="_blank">Las Vegas Motor Speedway</a></strong> and race NASCAR-style cars around the track – with the guidance of professional driving instructors of course. Conquer the rugged terrain Hidden Valley and Primm Valley in an extreme <a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Hidden-Valley-and-Primm-Valley-Extreme-RZR-Tour-from-Las-Vegas/d684-3501O0074"><strong>RZR</strong></a>  — a juiced up, all-terrain golf cart. And for the ultimate adrenaline-by-sky ristaker, there’s the <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Top-Gun-and-Air-Combat-Experience/d684-5278TOPGUN" target="_blank">Top Gun Air Combat Experience</a></strong>, where you can either ride along or fly a combat plane with the assistance of an experienced pilot.</p>
<h4>Get High</h4>
<p>You can’t do Vegas without also doing the nearby Grand Canyon. And there are indeed ways to experience this natural wonder that goes beyond the average coach tour. Descend into the canyon <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Grand-Canyon-West-Rim-Day-Trip-by-Coach-Helicopter-and-Boat-with-Optional-Skywalk/d684-3951HELIBOAT" target="_blank">by helicopter</a></strong>, shoot down the Colorado on a pontoon boat, and get right to the canyon’s edge via the Skywalk. For other options at dizzying heights, book a trip on a <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Las-Vegas-Hot-Air-Balloon-Ride/d684-5100LASBALLOON" target="_blank">hot air balloon</a></strong> or go <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Las-Vegas-Tandem-Skydiving/d684-3461TANDEM" target="_blank">tandem skydiving</a></strong>. For epic views and photo ops of the sparkling nighttime Vegas strip, reserve an <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Las-Vegas-Strip-Night-Flight-by-Helicopter-with-Transport/d684-5847NIGHT" target="_blank">evening helicopter ride</a></strong> high above the desert landscape.</p>
<h4>Something Different</h4>
<p>Zipped every line, flown every plane (jumped from them too), and looking for something even more unique to Vegas? Board the <strong><a href="https://www.viator.com/tours/Las-Vegas/Happy-Hour-on-The-High-Roller-at-The-LINQ/d684-5084LASHIG_HH" target="_blank">High Roller</a></strong> at the LINQ for Happy Hour 500 feet above the Strip.

<p>Ah, Italy. Red-checked tablecloths, fat candles dripping wax into empty tomato sauce cans. Carafes of red wine.</p>
<p>It’s already an obvious fact that dining out in Italy is a memorable event. And if you’re looking for another authentic Roman dining experience, cross the River Tiber to Trastevere, into a historic working class neighborhood that boasts the most authentic Roman cuisine in town.</p>
<p>Getting to know your fellow diners is easy since the <strong><a href="https://www.partner.viator.com/en/11835/tours/Rome/Evening-Trastevere-Walking-Tour-and-Villa-Dinner/d511-3731TRASTEVERE">Trastevere walking tour and villa dinner</a></strong> is an intimate experience – max capacity is 15. Strolling through town to this gorgeous villa that feels hidden away from the rest of the world (including other tourists) provides the perfect opportunity for relaxed, on-the-go conversation.</p>
<p>The evening begins with a short walking tour of the town of Trastevere with your expert guide pointing out key sights of the neighborhood. It’s here in Trastevere that the hectic vibe of Rome is left behind in exchange for a tamer, more local feel.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38977" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Trastevere.jpg" alt="" width="950" height="634" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Trastevere.jpg 950w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Trastevere-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Trastevere-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></p>
<p>Upon arriving at the villa, the hosts give a brief tour and share tales about the mysterious house that had been discovered hidden deep in the Trastevere forest. You’re then taken to the garden for an aperitif where everyone’s made to feel as if they’re spending time at a friend’s home who just happens to live in a gorgeous villa. It truly doesn’t feel as if you’re taking a tour.</p>
<p>Sit down to a three-course meal beginning with a classic Roman pasta – all’Amatriciana. This is a sauce made with cured pork cheek and tomatoes. It actually wasn’t prepared with tomatoes until the late 18th century because Italians believed tomatoes were poisonous.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-38981" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-4.25.47-PM-540x336.png" alt="" width="540" height="336" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-4.25.47-PM-540x336.png 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-4.25.47-PM-768x478.png 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-4.25.47-PM-1024x637.png 1024w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Screen-Shot-2017-01-12-at-4.25.47-PM.png 1476w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>Some juicy tidbits on the tomatoes while we’re at it. Tomatoes, though now a staple of Italian cuisine, aren’t native to Italy. They originated in the Andes, which is present day Chile, Boliva, Peru and Ecaudor. They were only introduced to Europe when the Spanish Conquistadors brought them back in the mid-sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Meatballs and mashed potatoes were featured in the second and third course and true to genuine Italian cuisine, although simple in concept, the ingredients were anything but. Our chef explained that in reality, over 20 spices, herbs and ingredients had been used in creating the dish. An added plus? The chef gifted each dinner guest with a copy of the recipe.</p>
<p>It’s rare that an Italian dinner ends without something sweet, although it was surprising to learn that there are very few Roman desserts. Arguably, the most renowned are sweet treats like cannoli which hails from Sicily, and tiramisu comes from the town of Treviso in the northeast of Italy. To cap off this unique experience, we had a beautiful panna cotta, Italian for “cooked cream”, and for this one night, this Piedmont dessert would masquerade as Roman.</p>

<p>Hot Wheels cars. Micro Machines. The Hess Truck at Christmas. I have a deep connection to anything with wheels and it started early in life. Just thinking of driving somewhere fast fills me with the kind of adolescent glee associated with snowy Christmas mornings or news of A-ha’s latest album release.</p>
<p>So when I learned that ordinary folks like me could test drive NASCAR race cars around a proper race track, I couldn’t believe my ears. Yet, that’s exactly what Viator’s New Hampshire Motor Speedway Ride Along Experience provides. And for those with no interest in driving, yep, you can sit back and be a passenger too.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38966" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mike-Suited-Up.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="200" />And so that&#8217;s how I found myself at New Hampshire’s legendary Motor Speedway on a bright, cloudless October afternoon – ready to roll. Upon arrival, there was surprisingly little fanfare in the lead-up to my ride. There was no mandatory course on the theory of g-forces or tips on how to avoid accidentally launching yourself from the car (it wouldn’t happen). I simply checked in at the track’s entrance, signed a one-page insurance waiver, collected my commemorative plastic name tag and was declared ready to race.</p>
<p>The prep garage was abuzz with on-deck drivers shuffling between piles of canary red, one-piece racing uniforms and varying sizes of helmets.</p>
<p>Once I’d found my appropriately sized gear and suited up, the staff pointed me toward others standing in line awaiting their turn to ride. The line moved fast, just like the cars zipping by us. The staff clearly appreciated a quick turnaround which was fine by me as I could feel myself growing anxious.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later, my purple and white NASCAR ride pulled to the side of the track in front of me. The driver left the engine running while the crew ushered me to the passenger side. With the nylon safety webbing removed from the window, I was able to climb inside. Within seconds, the staff had me clipped into the six-point safety harness. Two taps on the roof of the car and we were off to the races.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-38969" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Car-30-in-The-Pit-540x405.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Car-30-in-The-Pit-540x405.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Car-30-in-The-Pit-768x576.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Car-30-in-The-Pit.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>Wordlessly, my driver depressed the pedal and we leisurely pulled away from the pit. With the track clear, he (excuse the technical term) <em>goosed</em> it. The car shot forward like a bullet train. The engine’s deep guttural roar was enough to jar a filling loose. In less than 10 seconds, we were pushing the first turn at more than 100 mph. The g-force even at “only” that speed was enough to convince me that we were going to flip. Thankfully, the wide racing slicks – a special type of tire – kept us glued to the track.</p>
<p>As we pulled out of each turn and into the next straightaway, the driver again slammed his foot down on the gas pedal. Instinctively, I gave a shout much like Mel Gibson’s victorious cry of “FREEDOM!” in <em>Braveheart</em>. It was equal parts terror, exhilaration, and sheer joy. We topped out north of 150 mph — a speed that gave me instant tunnel vision, blurred at the edges.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-38960 size-medium" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cars-at-the-Starting-Line-Ready-to-Race-540x363.jpg" width="540" height="363" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cars-at-the-Starting-Line-Ready-to-Race-540x363.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cars-at-the-Starting-Line-Ready-to-Race-768x517.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Cars-at-the-Starting-Line-Ready-to-Race.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>Sadly, at that speed, my five-lap ride was over in what felt like seconds. We pitted the car, and I climbed back out of the car window, dazed. For a short time, I’d had a glimpse of the raw energy and excitement of life as a professional NASCAR driver. I peeled my racing suit off and with a huge grin plastered on my face stumbled back to my pedestrian Toyota 4Runner.</p>
<p>For most of us, these kinds of tours are as close as we’re likely to come feeling what it’s like to be a professional race car driver. Whether you’re a NASCAR fan or not, it’s a three-minute rush of adrenalin that makes for one hell of a bucket-list-worthy experience.</p>

<p>Just like with music, a city&#8217;s greatest hits can often be found underground. Though churches, theaters, mountains, and museums are staple attractions when getting to know a new location, a look below the surface can reveal spectacular and little-known sights you probably wouldn&#8217;t find on a postcard. Found in places as diverse as underground churches, gardens, wineries, and music festivals, these top attractions from around the world are worth the trip below ground.</p>
<h2>Waitomo Glowworm Caves</h2>
<h3>Waitomo, New Zealand</h3>
<div id="attachment_38885" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38885" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/waitomo.jpg" alt="Waitomo Glowworm Caves" width="540" height="361" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/waitomo.jpg 1980w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/waitomo-540x361.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/waitomo-768x513.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/waitomo-1024x684.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The New Zealand glowworm caves in Waitomo</p></div>
<p>No matter how you feel about worms, a visit to the Waitamo Glowworm Caves in New Zealand is certain to leave an impression. Found below rolling green hills about two hours south of Auckland, these native glow-in-the-dark worms make for one of the coolest sci-fi shows in nature. Tours will take you on a boat ride down an underground river, and while there are other activities available in the caves, seeing the glowworms scattered like stars is a highlight.</p>
<h2>The Jarvis Estate</h2>
<h3>Napa, California, USA</h3>
<div id="attachment_38882" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38882" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Napa_UndergroundWinery_Eustacio_Blogpost.jpg" alt="Sample wines in the cool temperature of Jarvis Estate's underground winery" width="540" height="405" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Napa_UndergroundWinery_Eustacio_Blogpost.jpg 3264w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Napa_UndergroundWinery_Eustacio_Blogpost-540x405.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Napa_UndergroundWinery_Eustacio_Blogpost-768x576.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Napa_UndergroundWinery_Eustacio_Blogpost-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sample wines in the cool temperature of Jarvis Estate&#8217;s underground winery</p></div>
<p>Though many Napa Valley wineries use caves to barrel age their wine, few are able to accommodate an entire estate underground. Northern California&#8217;s Jarvis Estate does precisely that (and was the first in the U.S. to do so). A 45,000-square-foot (4,181-square-meter) cave tunneled into the Vaca Mountains brings wine country visitors directly to the vino in a visually and technologically stunning subterranean estate that gets bigger the further you journey through it. Two full basketball courts could fit in the winery&#8217;s farthest chambers, which are fitted with brass wall sconces, arched alcoves, and chandeliers for an interior design as attractive as the wine.</p>
<h2>Llechwedd Slate Caverns</h2>
<h3>Snowdonia, Wales</h3>
<div id="attachment_38884" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38884" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Wales_Llechwedd_SlateCavern_Viator_TripAdvisor_UGC_153775.jpg" alt="Llechwedd Slate Caverns" width="540" height="423" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Wales_Llechwedd_SlateCavern_Viator_TripAdvisor_UGC_153775.jpg 1000w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Wales_Llechwedd_SlateCavern_Viator_TripAdvisor_UGC_153775-540x423.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Wales_Llechwedd_SlateCavern_Viator_TripAdvisor_UGC_153775-768x602.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Llechwedd Slate Caverns in Wales, UK</p></div>
<p>The Snowdonia region in Wales is known for its beautiful national park, majestic mountains, and dramatic coastline, but its most unique outdoor attraction never sees the sun. Once a slate mining town, Snowdonia has introduced an activity center into one of the old mines. Far more than your average cave tour, a visit to Llechwedd Slate Caverns not only includes seeing the mines, but can also offer the opportunity to zipline below ground or bounce around on a network of giant trampolines.</p>
<h2>Salt Cathedral of Zipaquira</h2>
<h3>Zipaquira, Colombia</h3>
<div id="attachment_38879" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38879" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Zipaquira_SaltCathedral_lights_shutterstock_309505745.jpg" alt="Zipaquira Salt Cathedral" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Zipaquira_SaltCathedral_lights_shutterstock_309505745.jpg 3122w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Zipaquira_SaltCathedral_lights_shutterstock_309505745-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Zipaquira_SaltCathedral_lights_shutterstock_309505745-768x512.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Zipaquira_SaltCathedral_lights_shutterstock_309505745-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The underground church of Zipaquira, Colombia, located in an old salt mine</p></div>
<p>The Salt Cathedral of Zipaquira sits 660 feet (200 meters) below ground in an old salt mine in small town in Colombia—but that doesn&#8217;t stop it from serving as many as 3,000 churchgoers each Sunday mass. Though technically not a cathedral (it doesn’t have a bishop), the Roman Catholic church is a sight to see. Spectacularly illuminated by pink, purple, green, and blue lights and entirely carved by hand, this underground attraction is worth the hour to two-hour train ride from Bogota, and can be paired with a visit to the museum of mining and mineralogy.</p>
<h2>Cumberland Caverns</h2>
<h3>McMinnville, Tennessee, USA</h3>
<div id="attachment_38883" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38883" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tennessee_CumberlandCaverns_Blog_27122987341_56ba298fc5_b.jpg" alt="Cumberland Caverns" width="540" height="304" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tennessee_CumberlandCaverns_Blog_27122987341_56ba298fc5_b.jpg 1024w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tennessee_CumberlandCaverns_Blog_27122987341_56ba298fc5_b-540x304.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Tennessee_CumberlandCaverns_Blog_27122987341_56ba298fc5_b-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Bluegrass Underground takes place in Mcminnville&#8217;s Cumberland Caverns</p></div>
<p>For those who are really into “underground” music, the Cumberland Caverns in McMinnville, Tennessee let you jam out 333 feet (101 meters) underground. The acoustically pure natural space doubles as a stage for some of the world’s greatest bluegrass musicians during its monthly musical event, Bluegrass Underground. Take the short hike down to Volcano Chamber for an experience like no other, nestled into the jagged rock.</p>
<h2>Coober Pedy</h2>
<h3>Coober Pedy, Australia</h3>
<div id="attachment_38875" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38875" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CooperPeddy_Australia_underground_shutterstock_306257345.jpg" alt="Coober Pedy, Australia" width="540" height="359" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CooperPeddy_Australia_underground_shutterstock_306257345.jpg 2500w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CooperPeddy_Australia_underground_shutterstock_306257345-540x359.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CooperPeddy_Australia_underground_shutterstock_306257345-768x511.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/CooperPeddy_Australia_underground_shutterstock_306257345-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The whole town&#8217;s underground in Coober Pedy, Australia</p></div>
<p>Daytime temperatures higher than 120°F (48.8°C) make living &#8216;down under&#8217; a necessity for the approximately 1,500 locals of Coober Pedy, Australia. The northern South Australia town is as big a destination for opal mining as it is for tourism, its subterranean hotels, restaurants, and art galleries attracting visitors below desert ground. Hide from the heat in this authentic Aussie town or brave the outdoors for some grass-less golf. It&#8217;s not for everyone, but it&#8217;s certainly unique.</p>
<h2>Forestiere Underground Gardens</h2>
<h3>Fresno, California, USA</h3>
<div id="attachment_38880" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38880" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fresno_ForestiereUnderground_Garden_TUGC_0228a969.jpg" alt="Forestiere Underground Gardens" width="540" height="405" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fresno_ForestiereUnderground_Garden_TUGC_0228a969.jpg 3264w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fresno_ForestiereUnderground_Garden_TUGC_0228a969-540x405.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fresno_ForestiereUnderground_Garden_TUGC_0228a969-768x576.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Fresno_ForestiereUnderground_Garden_TUGC_0228a969-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Beat the Fresno heat with a visit to this underground estate</p></div>
<p>Turn-of-the-century immigrant Baldassare Forestiere wanted to stay connected to his Italian roots, so he literally planted them below Fresno, California. The Forestiere Underground Gardens is an enchanting subterranean home and terrace, inspired by Forestiere&#8217;s Sicilian hometown—and namely, perhaps, its ancient catacombs. The approximately 10,000-square-foot (929-square-meter) space features multiple rooms, a chapel, and a pond for fishing (because who doesn’t want to fish below ground?). Built by Forestiere over the course of 40 years, this 10-acre (.4-hectare) labor of love offers a glimpse of Italy and a unique respite from the California heat.</p>
<h2>Dambulla Cave Temple</h2>
<h3>Sri Lanka</h3>
<div id="attachment_38876" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38876" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dambulla_Temple_buddha_shutterstock_421486012.jpg" alt="Dambulla Temple in Sri Lanka" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dambulla_Temple_buddha_shutterstock_421486012.jpg 3466w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dambulla_Temple_buddha_shutterstock_421486012-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dambulla_Temple_buddha_shutterstock_421486012-768x512.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Dambulla_Temple_buddha_shutterstock_421486012-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The underground Dambulla Temple of Sri Lanka</p></div>
<p>A 100-foot (30-meter) tall golden Buddha is the centerpiece—and guardian—of the sacred Dambulla Cave Temple in Sri Lanka, located 92 miles (148 km) east of Colombo, 45 miles (72 km) north of Kandy, and 600 feet (183 meters) below a slab of cold, hard rock. Though there are plenty of cave temples around Southeast Asia, few are as majestic as this UNESCO World Heritage Site. With more than 150 Buddha statues as well as images of deities and kings, this five-cave complex is the largest and best preserved in the country.</p>
<h2>Dom im Berg</h2>
<h3>Graz, Austria</h3>
<div id="attachment_38877" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38877" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Grazi_DomImBerg_CastleHill_shutterstock_171881531.jpg" alt="Castle Hill in Graz, Austria" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Grazi_DomImBerg_CastleHill_shutterstock_171881531.jpg 5184w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Grazi_DomImBerg_CastleHill_shutterstock_171881531-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Grazi_DomImBerg_CastleHill_shutterstock_171881531-768x512.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Grazi_DomImBerg_CastleHill_shutterstock_171881531-1024x683.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Go below famous Castle Hill for the best of the Graz underground</p></div>
<p>Dom im Berg might translate to &#8220;Cathedral in the Mountain,&#8221; but this underground Graz attraction hosts a club scene like no other. Journey below the iconic Schlossberg (also known as Castle Hill) to dance the night away at a sound-and-lights show that is unmatched throughout the city. Originally part of a system of World War II air-raid shelters, the vaulted space is now a destination for those wishing to have an experience yards below any other.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard of the Terra Cotta Warriors, uncovered near Xi’an, China. But did you know that they were buried under an almost 30-story-tall funeral mound at the heart of a massive necropolis constructed for the first Qin emperor? These life-sized clay soldiers, each with a different face, were modeled after real people and—along with their terra cotta horses and weaponry—have sat waiting for their emperor&#8217;s command for thousands of years. Until then, they stand guard in excavated tunnels, which attract thousands of visitors below ground every year.</p>

One of the largest, deepest, darkest, oldest, and quietest motels in the United States is decorated in classic kitsch (you can find the record player by the stack of Nat Geo magazines from the &#8217;70s) and is fed fresh air from limestone caverns some 65 miles (105 km) away. It sleeps six.</p>

My husband and I didn’t know what to expect from our evening out in one of the most famous nightclubs in Paris. Arriving at the Lido de Paris on the glamorous Champs-Elysées, it was obvious it would be a memorable experience. From dressing nicely to seeing the famous Bluebell Girls and an impressive cabaret show, [&#8230;]

<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-38848 size-medium" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/429d73c7-c723-8060-d33ea35d2ef299a7_hd-540x305.jpg" width="540" height="305" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/429d73c7-c723-8060-d33ea35d2ef299a7_hd-540x305.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/429d73c7-c723-8060-d33ea35d2ef299a7_hd-768x434.jpg 768w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/429d73c7-c723-8060-d33ea35d2ef299a7_hd-1024x578.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /></p>
<p>My husband and I didn’t know what to expect from our evening out in one of the most famous nightclubs in Paris. When we arrived at the Lido de Paris on the glamorous Champs-Elysées, it was obvious it would be a memorable experience. From dressing up for the occasion to seeing the famous Bluebell Girls and an impressive cabaret show, <a title="Viator Tour: Lido de Paris" href="http://www.viator.com/tours/Paris/Lido-de-Paris-Dinner-and-Show/d479-5091LIDOPARIS" target="_blank">the night was spectacular</a> beginning to end.</p>
<p>The nightclub ran like clockwork. Service was polite and slick; visitors were ushered to their private tables and Champagne and menus came out fast. The service staff felt both pleasant and unobtrusive. The celebratory atmosphere in the club continued to ramp up as Champagne flowed and cameras flashed, with people chatting across tables and waiters scooting around the dining hall with personalized birthday cakes and fire-spewing cocktails.</p>
<p>Dinner was superb—three courses of impeccable cooking from Chef Philippe Lacroix, including traditional specialties such as foie gras, prawns, duck, and veal, as well as chocolate Lenôtre macarons for dessert.</p>
<p>Entertainment-wise, the run-up to the cabaret was fun and fast-paced. A six-piece jazz combo, a few rock ‘n’ roll numbers, and a well-loved Blues Brothers routine got everybody up and dancing on the famous Lido stage. About an hour and a half into dinner, the music stopped for a change of pace with magic tricks and a mime artist. Soon after, the floor lowered and the curtains parted as the legendary Bluebells Girls made their entrance—all  long-legged and glittery—to kick off a 90-minute spectacle of feathers, sequins, leopard print, and rousing sing-along performances to changing 3D-backdrops and a light show.</p>
<p>The cabaret starred numerous dancers, a powerful solo singer, and acrobats from Cirque du Soleil who romped through 23 sets and songs relating to different themes and eras. Fountains rose out of the floor, dry ice hung in the air, and at one point, even a horse made a brief appearance on stage. The high spot of the evening, however, was the spirited cancan dance, performed (as tradition dictates) with the girls largely topless—a true taste of an iconic Parisian tradition from a bygone era.</p>

What makes a great concert hall? The conductor? Acoustics? Its design? All these elements come together in the concert halls of the world’s top 10 classical music cities.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes a great concert hall? The conductor? Acoustics? The design? All these elements come together in the concert halls of the world’s top classical music cities.</p>
<p>In addition to the venues mentioned below, there’s the beautiful architecture of the Sibelius Hall in Lahti, Helsinki and the fabulous Frank Gehry–designed Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, which scores a double whammy as it is also noted for its record-beating acoustics. And for sheer romance, you can’t beat a balmy open-air operatic concert at the ancient Arena in Verona, Italy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Amsterdam</h2>
<div id="attachment_38806" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38806" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Amsterdam_GreatHall_PassingTram_shutterstock_385332322.jpg" alt="Amsterdam's Concertgebouw" width="540" height="405" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Amsterdam_GreatHall_PassingTram_shutterstock_385332322.jpg 3963w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Amsterdam_GreatHall_PassingTram_shutterstock_385332322-540x404.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Amsterdam_GreatHall_PassingTram_shutterstock_385332322-1024x767.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Amsterdam’s neo-classical Concertgebouw.</p></div>
<p>Opened in 1888, Amsterdam’s neoclassical Concertgebouw is one of the world’s best-loved concert halls, proving that not everybody heads for the city intent on boozy weekends, clubbing, and soft drugs. The Great Hall is universally revered for its perfect sound quality, and the concert hall is home to the renowned Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, as well as the Netherlands Philharmonic and Chamber orchestras. The concert season runs from September to June, with free lunchtime concerts held year-round at 12:30pm every Wednesday. The Robeco Summer Nights series of jazz, classical, and opera-lite concerts take over the hall for summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Beijing</h2>
<div id="attachment_38807" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38807" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Beijing_CenterforPerformingArts_Night_shutterstock_61656514.jpg" alt="The Center for Performing Arts in Beijing" width="540" height="385" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Beijing_CenterforPerformingArts_Night_shutterstock_61656514.jpg 4781w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Beijing_CenterforPerformingArts_Night_shutterstock_61656514-540x384.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Beijing_CenterforPerformingArts_Night_shutterstock_61656514-1024x729.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Center for Performing Arts in Beijing, China.</p></div>
<p>In a city more renowned for its Chinese opera and martial arts than Western-style classical music, the controversial and blingy glass dome of Beijing’s Center for the Performing Arts has nevertheless been a resounding success with the burghers of Beijing. The concert hall, known locally as the &#8220;Giant Egg,&#8221; opened in 2007 and includes three performance halls seating a massive 5,452 people, as well as a mesmerizing calendar of orchestral concerts, classical and contemporary dance, hard-hitting drama, and opera—Chinese and Western in style. There’s also much on offer for families, from traditional acrobatic shows to the musical version of <em>Kung Fu Panda.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Berlin</h2>
<div id="attachment_38808" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38808" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Berlin_Philharmonie_Night_shutterstock_355669406.jpg" alt="Berlin's Philharmonie" width="540" height="324" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Berlin_Philharmonie_Night_shutterstock_355669406.jpg 5162w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Berlin_Philharmonie_Night_shutterstock_355669406-540x323.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Berlin_Philharmonie_Night_shutterstock_355669406-1024x614.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Berliner Philharmonie Concert Hall in Germany.</p></div>
<p>The Philharmonie sits in the Berlin’s stylish Kulturforum, built when the city was divided by the Iron Curtain to show the people of East Germany what they were missing. Designed by Hans Scharoun and opened in 1963, it is one of the world’s great concert halls thanks to its acoustics, and it is home to the world-acclaimed Berlin Philharmonic, which was brought to fame by impresario Herbert von Karajan during the post-war period. Sir Simon Rattle has led the orchestra since 1987. Concert seasons start at the end of August, and there is also a full schedule of concerts in the smaller Chamber Music Hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Boston</h2>
<div id="attachment_38809" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38809" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Boston_SymphonyHall_Interior_shutterstock_265744382.jpg" alt="Boston's Symphony Hall" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Boston_SymphonyHall_Interior_shutterstock_265744382.jpg 5120w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Boston_SymphonyHall_Interior_shutterstock_265744382-540x359.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Boston_SymphonyHall_Interior_shutterstock_265744382-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Boston&#8217;s Symphony Hall is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra.</p></div>
<p>Historic Boston’s neoclassical Symphony Hall opened in 1900; it was built for the Boston Symphony Orchestra and still remains home to the leading orchestra. The architects of the auditorium employed an acoustics expert to ensure the quality of sound, placing it among the best concert halls in the world. Led by youthful Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons, a full schedule of orchestral and operatic performances occurs from September through June, while the crowdpleasing Boston Pops, who first played in 1885, join in with crossover concerts in the summer months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>London</h2>
<div id="attachment_38801" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38801" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/london-opera.jpg" alt="London's Royal Albert Hall" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/london-opera.jpg 2500w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/london-opera-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/london-opera-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Royal Albert Hall in London hosts the popular Proms series of concerts.</p></div>
<p>Opened in 1871 by Queen Victoria, the barrel-shaped Royal Albert Hall is a massive venue with an audience capacity of 5,272. These days, it is best known for the Proms, the popular classical music concert that runs between July and September and features some of the best artists in the world at decent ticket prices. Other mainstays of London’s classical music scene include the Royal Opera House (ballet as well as opera) and the two concrete monstrosities of the Barbican and South Bank, whose aesthetic deficiencies are more than compensated for by the quality of their concert repertoires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Milan</h2>
<div id="attachment_38810" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38810" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Milan_TeatroLaScala_Exterior_shutterstock_119995828.jpg" alt="Milan's Teatro La Scala" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Milan_TeatroLaScala_Exterior_shutterstock_119995828.jpg 3804w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Milan_TeatroLaScala_Exterior_shutterstock_119995828-540x359.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Milan_TeatroLaScala_Exterior_shutterstock_119995828-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Milan&#8217;s Teatro La Scala by night.</p></div>
<p>Sophisticated and cultured Milan is stuffed with quality museums and galleries, a soaring cathedral, and a shopping scene to rival London, New York, or Paris, but it&#8217;s also home to the second most famous opera house in the world. Teatro La Scala was built in the late 18th century, a flamboyant theater swathed in red velvet, crystal chandeliers, and gilding. Its season kicks off on December 7 each year, and the repertoire consists of opera, ballet, and classical concerts. Attending a performance is a dressy affair and tickets are generally booked far in advance, but same-day tickets are released 2.5 hours before curtain up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>New York</h2>
<div id="attachment_38811" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38811" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NYC_CarnegieHall_Exterior_shutterstock_350824922.jpg" alt="Carnegie Hall in New York City" width="540" height="438" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NYC_CarnegieHall_Exterior_shutterstock_350824922.jpg 5616w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NYC_CarnegieHall_Exterior_shutterstock_350824922-540x437.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/NYC_CarnegieHall_Exterior_shutterstock_350824922-1024x829.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">New York City&#8217;s Carnegie Hall.</p></div>
<p>In addition to cloud-piercing high-rises, fabulous shopping, and its bevy of Broadway musicals, New York is endowed with a brace of world-class classical music venues. Carnegie Hall was built by the famous philanthropist in 1891, and its three auditoriums are thriving under the leadership of artistic director Clive Gillinson; it has no resident companies but offers a roster of classical and chamber music concerts. The Lincoln Center is a one-stop classical entertainments complex, encompassing the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Metropolitan Opera House, New York City Ballet, and NYC Opera, with the season lasting September to May.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Sydney</h2>
<div id="attachment_38802" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38802" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sydney-opera.jpg" alt="The Sydney Opera House" width="540" height="405" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sydney-opera.jpg 3264w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sydney-opera-540x405.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sydney-opera-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sydney Opera House is Australia’s most famous building.</p></div>
<p>The Sydney Opera House is one of the most recognizable buildings in the world. Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon in 1973, it sits on the flank of Sydney Harbour, crouched opposite the equally iconic Harbour Bridge. In a city celebrated for its beaches and outdoor activities, it is home to seven different performance venues and more than 1,500 performances of ballet, opera, circus, classical music, and drama attended by more than one million people every year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tokyo</h2>
<div id="attachment_38812" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38812" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tokyo-concert-hall.jpg" alt="tokyo concert hall" width="540" height="405" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tokyo-concert-hall.jpg 980w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tokyo-concert-hall-540x404.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tokyo&#8217;s Opera City Concert Hall</p></div>
<p>In tune with its reputation as one of the world’s fastest-moving, forward-looking cities, Tokyo also has a remarkable classical music venue. The Tokyo Opera City Concert Hall may be no great architectural shakes with its skyscraper exterior, but many musicians regard it as home to some of the best acoustics in the world. The theater opened in 1997, and its auditorium was carefully designed in &#8220;shoebox style&#8221; with a pyramid-shaped interior clad in oak to help with resonance and reverberation. It is home of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by South Korean Myung-Whun Chung, and holds an audience of 1,632; the smaller Recital Hall seats 265.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vienna</h2>
<div id="attachment_38804" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38804" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vienna-opera.jpg" alt="Musikverein, Vienna" width="540" height="359" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vienna-opera.jpg 849w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Vienna-opera-540x359.jpg 540w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Vienna’s Musikverein still has a place among the best concert halls in the world.</p></div>
<p>Long one of the leading bastions of culture in Central Europe, elegant Vienna is home to peerless concert halls. First among equals is the Musikverein, the neoclassical style home of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. Built in 1870 by Theophil Hansen, it is still regarded as having some of the best acoustics in the world, thanks to the Great Hall Auditorium’s long and high but narrow design. It can seat 1,744 people, with standing room for 300 more, and is the venue of Vienna’s traditional New Year’s Eve concerts, which are televised across the world.</p>

<p>TexMex is delicious; we had been eating it by the bucketload in the United States. But now that we were in Mexico, I wanted to further explore the local cuisine. I knew I couldn’t find that on the popular and touristy 5th Avenue in Playa Del Carmen, so I found the <a href="https://www.viator.com/Playa-del-Carmen-tours/Food-Tours/d5501-g6-c80" target="_blank">Viator Playa del Carmen Food Tour</a> to get the real, behind-the-scenes authentic Mexican experience we were craving.</p>
<p>Our meeting spot was easy to find near the bus terminal and Cozumel ferry terminal. Our group consisted of just five people, the perfect size for an intimate tour. Our friendly guide came prepared with a heat-quenching bottled water for each guest, and we were off. During the tour, we caught several cabs. There was not too much walking, which was really appreciated by our kids. The walking we did do was often over uneven surfaces, so be careful to watch your step and wear comfortable walking shoes. Our Spanish is very much lacking, but fortunately our guide took care of all communication with restaurants so we could effortlessly follow along. The food tour included five stops, and of course, the best was saved for last.</p>

<h2>Stop #1: Quesadillas at Las Quekas</h2>
<p><em>Corner of Ave 30th &amp; Calle 14</em></p>
<p>Across the road from Mega shopping mall, we found a small restaurant with room for about four tables and a bench. Three ladies inside were cooking fresh quesadillas over a large, open, flat grill. These ladies make their own corn tortillas from scratch and use Oaxacan cheese (the authentic Mexican quesadilla cheese). We sat down at a table to try three different varieties: chorizo, cheese, and corn. And to quench our thirst from the heat, sipped a Mexican Coke, which is very different from the US version, using real cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup.</p>

<h2>Stop #2: Market at DAC</h2>
<p><em>Avenida 30th between Constituyentes &amp; Calle 20th</em></p>
<p>This stop was at a local market filled with fresh fruit and vegetables, as well as barrels of dried spices and chiles. Our guide pointed out several different fruits and chiles that are native to the region, including the <em>jamaica</em> (hibiscus), which was featured in our next stop.</p>
<div id="attachment_38791" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38791" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4742-2.jpg" alt="Market at DAC" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4742-2.jpg 5472w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4742-2-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4742-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Market at DAC</p></div>

<h2>Stop #3: Pozole and Jamaica at Mi Abuelita</h2>
<p><em>Avenida 30th between Calle 20th &amp; 22nd</em></p>
<p>This small hole-in-the-wall restaurant is a local <em>pozoleria</em> fitting roughly four tables. It was here we tried jamaica. No, it wasn’t a slice of a Caribbean island, but perhaps just as refreshing. This hibiscus water is similar to a cranberry or black currant drink, like Ribena. After our agua de jamaica, we were each served a bowl of hearty Mexican stew, known as pozole. The soup is made from nixtamalized cacahuazintle corn (which involves soaking corn in alkaline solution, the first step to making corn usable for food preparation, like tortillas), better known as hominy. This soup is usually served with pork, but we tried the chicken variety. A layered stand of extra toppings was served tableside to add to the soup – lime, lettuce, and chiles. This hearty soup is filled with complex flavors that are traditionally found in Mexican cuisine. It’s usually served at celebrations, and it can certainly turn a warm day into a red-hot one if you have a low threshold for spicy food. Phew!</p>

<h2>Stop #4: Tacos at Merchant</h2>
<p><em>Benito Juarez between Ave 30th &amp; Ave 25th</em></p>
<p>This unassuming restaurant stole my heart, or rather ran away with my taste buds. It was my favorite stop, hands down. Plastic tables and chairs gave it a very simple feel. At the entrance stood an unassuming chef chopping pork for all to see. There were no hidden ingredients here. We sat down at the back of the restaurant and were served a tray of condiments – guacamole, hot sauce, chiles, and other bits and pieces. Next up, we were given a choice of “greasy” or “non-greasy.” We ordered one of each so we could compare both. I recommend the greasy <em>vor cochinita pibi</em>l &#8211; it was by far our favorite Yucatecán street taco. This pork dish is typically done in the Michoacán style, with selected cuts of meat (pork) that are roasted or braised at low heat in a copper pot. The pork is seasoned with salt, oregano, and sometimes crushed garlic. The tortilla was soft and light and just thick enough to hold the full-flavored meat filling. I could have done with several more of these.</p>
<div id="attachment_38779" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38779" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4775-2.jpg" alt="Tacos at Merchant" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4775-2.jpg 5472w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4775-2-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4775-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Tacos at Merchant</p></div>
<h2>Stop #5: Ice Cream @ Nieves Mexicanas Street Stall</h2>
<p><em>Corner of Avenida 25th &amp; Benito Juarez</em></p>
<p>Our last stop was at a super small stall on one of the city’s busiest streets selling house-made artisanal ice cream. <em>Nieves</em> is the Spanish word for snow, and is a general term for frozen Mexican treats. Everyone choose one frozen dessert, and we stood on the busy street corner licking continuously, watching the cars, pedestrians, bike,s and general comings and goings of Playa Del Carmen.</p>
<div id="attachment_38780" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38780" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4776-2.jpg" alt="Ice Cream @ Nieves Mexicanas Street Stall" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4776-2.jpg 5472w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4776-2-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_4776-2-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Ice Cream at Nieves Mexicanas Street Stall</p></div>
<p>After the refreshing ice cream, our guide walked us back to the plaza near our starting point and said her goodbyes. The day after our tour we received a follow-up email with details of each place we visited. This was a great bonus, because I for one knew I was headed back for more tacos from Merchant. Mmmmm…</p>

There’s no better way to discover a country or understand its culture than meeting the locals. To help you break down the boundaries and seek out unforgettable experiences, here are 10 ways to connect with locals on your travels.

<p>In an age when Instagram-worthy selfies and travel bucket lists are top priority for many tourists, it’s easy to find yourself wanting more out of your trip. Whether you’re seeking insider tips on where to eat or party, hope to gain a new perspective on your destination, or simply want to meet up with kindred souls around the world, finding a local connection can help give your travels meaning. There’s no better way to discover a country or understand its culture than meeting the locals. To help you break down the boundaries and seek out unforgettable experiences, here are 10 ways to connect with locals on your travels.</p>
<div id="attachment_38772" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38772" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/HoiAn_TravelInspiration_StreetView_shutterstock_259757666.jpg" alt="Hoi An, Vietnam" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/HoiAn_TravelInspiration_StreetView_shutterstock_259757666.jpg 3000w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/HoiAn_TravelInspiration_StreetView_shutterstock_259757666-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/HoiAn_TravelInspiration_StreetView_shutterstock_259757666-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Make a local friend to share adventures with in Hoi An, Vietnam.</p></div>
<h2>1.    Organize a homestay</h2>
<p>The most authentic way to immerse yourself in a new culture is to spend a night with a local family. There are some incredible homestay tours to choose from, whether you wish to spend a night in a traditional Vietnamese stilt home in the Mekong, join a local family to celebrate Diwali in India, or camp out with a nomad tribe in Tibet. For the most memorable experience, look for tours that allow you to live like a local and help out with the shopping, cooking, and farm work.</p>
<h2>2.    Learn the language</h2>
<p>Mastering a few phrases in the local language can be a real door-opener; even a clumsy attempt at a sentence will be sure to elicit a smile, especially in countries where the local language is rarely spoken by tourists. Book a language class at the start of your trip and practice some useful phrases, or join an immersion course to take your skills to the next level. Keep an eye out for conversation classes and meet-ups, and be sure to practice – strike up a conversation with local parkgoers, talk to a friendly stranger on the bus, or quiz your taxi driver on the best local spots.</p>
<h2>3.    Volunteer</h2>
<p>Volunteer opportunities are available in almost every country around the world and are a great way for visitors to get to know the local community. Doctors, nurses, and TEFL/TESOL qualified teachers will find a large demand for their skills, especially in less developed countries, but there are opportunities for every traveler. Look for something that interests you and matches your skills. Animal lover? Help out with giant pandas in China or the turtle conservation in Central America. Love kids? Visit a local school or help out at an orphanage. Want to work outdoors? Swap farm work for a free bed through volunteer programs like WWOOF or HelpXchange.</p>
<h2>4.    Hire a local guide</h2>
<p>Even if you normally prefer to go it alone, exploring a destination with a local guide who is truly passionate about his or her hometown can add a whole new dimension to your visit. Look for a guide who has similar interests, whether it’s history, art, or nightlife, and don’t be afraid to ask questions – most guides are more than happy to offer their opinions, give recommendations or explain local customs.</p>
<h2>5.    Make connections online</h2>
<p>There are new travel websites and apps springing up all the time, so make sure you log on before you board your flight. Connect with like-minded locals on Couchsurfing, or rent a room (rather than a whole apartment) via Airbnb to benefit from your host’s local knowledge. Alternately, sign up for a unique foodie experience via EatWith (international) or Feastly (U.S. only), where professional chefs will cook for you in their own homes, or use apps like MeetUp, Party with a Local, or Withlocals to find yourself some friends.</p>
<div id="attachment_38773" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-38773" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Delhi_HoliFestival_shutterstock_143879677.jpg" alt="Holi Festival of Colors in Delhi, India" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Delhi_HoliFestival_shutterstock_143879677.jpg 3500w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Delhi_HoliFestival_shutterstock_143879677-540x359.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Delhi_HoliFestival_shutterstock_143879677-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Holi Festival of Colors in Delhi, India</p></div>
<h2>6.    Attend local festivals and events</h2>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s for Munich’s Oktoberfest, Mexico’s Day of the Dead, or India’s colorful Holi Festival, visiting a town or city during one of its famous festivals guarantees unforgettable travel memories. To make the most of your experience, find out where the locals go: Rather than heading to Rio for Carneval, why not check out the less-touristy festivities in northern cities like Recife or Salvador? For a better chance at meeting locals, consider joining some of the world’s more unusual cultural traditions, like the Naadam festival in Mongolia, Up Helly Aa! in Scotland’s Shetland Isles, and Catalonia’s ‘correfoc’ fire-running festivals.</p>
<h2>7.    Use local services</h2>
<p>It can be easy to stay inside the &#8220;tourist bubble&#8221; when you travel. But even with a busy itinerary, there are easy ways to incorporate local life into your stay: Hop on the subway or tram to get around, pick up picnic supplies at the town market, or stop by the supermarket to grab some snacks for your journey. Whatever you need to do, consider if there’s a local service you can use, whether that&#8217;s doing your laundry at the local launderette, heading to the hairdresser or barber shop, or treating yourself to a traditional massage or manicure.</p>
<h2>8.    Escape the tourist trail</h2>
<p>Climbing the Eiffel Tower, walking the Great Wall of China, or marveling over Machu Picchu might be on your travel bucket list, but you’ll likely be shoulder to shoulder with other tourists the whole way. For a more local experience, take the time to get off the beaten track by traveleling to smaller villages, lesser-known beaches, and suburban neighborhoods. Don’t be shy about asking for recommendations either – quiz locals on the best places to eat or shop, or follow local insiders to the coolest bars or clubs.</p>
<h2>9.    Try something new</h2>
<p>Even if you’re only in town for a few days, look for classes and activities that will give you a chance to meet others. Attend a yoga class in the park; take part in a cooking class or crafts workshop; or join local running, walking, or rollerblading groups for an off-piste tour of the city.</p>
<h2>10.    Travel slowly</h2>
<p>If you’re aiming to connect with locals on your travels, the best advice is to take your time and travel slowly rather than rushing to check off the sights and hopping back on a plane. Opt for a leisurely road trip, ride the sleeper train, or sign up for an epic multi-day trek. Keep your itinerary flexible, be spontaneous, and give yourself extra time in each destination so you are open to invitations. The best moments always happen when you least expect it.</p>

<p>The glittering shop-fronts and designer emporiums of the Champs-Elysées and the world-renowned Galeries Lafayette department store might be top of the itinerary for shoppers in Paris, but some of the city’s most atmospheric shopping arcades are hidden from view down the side streets. Paris’ Passages Couverts (&#8220;Covered Passageways&#8221; or &#8220;Les Arcades&#8221;) date back to the early 19th century, when some 150 such shopping arcades sprung up around the city, fast becoming the place to be seen for affluent Parisians.</p>
<p>Despite losing their popularity to the major department stores at the turn of the 20th century, around 20 of the passageways still remain, renowned for their ornate designs and unique selection of designer and jewelry boutiques, artisanal shops, and tearooms. Most can be found around Paris’ Grands Boulevards in the 2nd arrondissement, but the easiest way to explore them is on a <a href="http://www.viator.com/tours/Paris/Covered-Passages/d479-9204P7" target="_blank">walking tour of the Passages Couverts in Paris</a>.</p>
<p>Highlights include the Passage des Panoramas, the oldest of all the passages, which dates back to 1799; Galerie Vivienne, with its dazzling glass roof and beautiful mosaics; and the Grand-Cerf, one of the largest and most architecturally striking passages — a masterpiece of glass panels, marble, and wrought iron.</p>
<p>Alternatively, designer fanatics will want to visit Passage du Claire, where Jean-Paul Gaultier has a ready-to-wear shop, or swing by Galerie Véro-Dodat, home to a Christian Louboutin workshop-boutique. Adventurous foodies can stop for a curry in Passage Brady, nicknamed &#8220;Little India&#8221; for its numerous spice shops, sari boutiques, and Indian restaurants.</p>

<p>Europe’s beaches are legendary, from the celeb-studded French Riviera to the wilds of the Baltic coastline. There are hundreds of family-oriented choices, from shingle coves to vast sandy strips, but each family comes with its own rulebook and own set of demands. Different age groups have different criteria and so what suits one family won’t suit another; here are some suggestions of family beaches in Europe that match the needs of all ages.</p>
<h2>1. Best for All Ages</h2>
<div id="attachment_38751" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38751" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lake-balaton-540x356.jpg" alt="Lake Batalon" width="540" height="356" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lake-balaton-540x356.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/lake-balaton-1024x675.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Lake Batalon, the largest lake in Central Europe.</p></div>
<p>Hungary’s freshwater Lake Balaton is the largest lake in Central Europe. Its waters are clean, shallow, and safe for toddlers, and most beaches are grassy, although some have imported sand. Many charge a small fee for entrance, and their amenities include showers, umbrellas, and sun loungers. Sports from sailing to water skiing to cycling and riding should appeal to families, while teenagers can be safely let loose at night in the party resort of Siófok.</p>
<h2>2. Best for Toddlers</h2>
<p>Es Grau beach is tucked into a bay about six miles (nine kilometers) north of Mahon, the photogenic main town of Menorca. It is perfect for toddlers, as the Mediterranean waters remain stubbornly at shin level for many meters out to sea and are calm thanks to the protection of the embracing cliffs. The beach also adjoins the S’Albufera des Grau Nature Reserve, in which older kids can scrabble up sand dunes and spot butterflies. There are paddleboards and kayaks available for teens. A sprinkling of restaurants and facilities in the whitewashed village of Es Grau make this an ideal spot for families traveling with young children.</p>
<h2>3. Best for Lazy Vacations</h2>
<p>At Ksamil beach on Albania’s burgeoning Riviera, there’s little else to do except lie back, pick up a good book, and reapply the sun lotion hourly. With crystal-clear aqua sea, manicured sand, and parasols in clusters on boardwalks over the sea, this is pretty close to the paradise beaches of the Caribbean right in Europe, but with sensible prices and fabulous beach bars serving up steaming mussels as well as child-friendly plates of pasta.</p>
<h2>4. Best City Beach</h2>
<p>All self-respecting European cities have their own beaches these days, but Amsterdam has several. Best among these is the exclusive, man-made Strandzuid, found near Beatrixpark in the city’s Oud Zuid. A popular weekend hangout with Amsterdam’s affluent classes, it has a smart restaurant that is packed with families at Sunday brunch, a wooden boardwalk, and a laid-back outdoor bar with hammocks and chill-out music. To make a real impact, some beachgoers moor up their boats right outside the restaurant.</p>
<h2>5. Best for Views</h2>
<div id="attachment_38745" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38745" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rhossili-Bay-540x360.jpg" alt="Rhossili Bay is on the Gower Peninsula, Wales." width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rhossili-Bay-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Rhossili-Bay-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Rhossili Bay is on the Gower Peninsula, Wales.</p></div>
<p>Located on the Gower Peninsula on the south coast of Wales, Rhossili Bay is repeatedly voted Britain’s best beach, backed by grassy cliffs and overlooked by one solitary windblown cottage. At its eastern end, it is possible to walk to the bizarre Worm’s Head at low tide (tide times are displayed at the Coastguard Center). The beach stretches for three miles (five kilometers) and has few facilities, but it offers a raw, dramatic beauty encompassing endless tide pools plus the undulating waves of the Atlantic Ocean. The beach is just the spot for family picnics, horse riding in the shallows, surfing, and dolphin spotting.</p>
<h2>6. Best for Educating Kids</h2>
<p>Wild, wonderful Patara beach in Gelemi on Turkey’s Mediterranean coast is backed by endless sand dunes that roll into the horizon. At the ruins of a once-mighty Lycean ancient city, kids can learn about the ancient world as they walk to the beach. If families are at Patara between May and October, they may be lucky enough to see loggerhead turtles laying their eggs in the sand.</p>
<h2>7. Best for Urban Families</h2>
<div id="attachment_38746" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38746" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Barceloneta-540x361.jpg" alt="Overlooking the beach at Barceloneta, Barcelona." width="540" height="361" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Barceloneta-540x361.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Barceloneta-1024x686.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Overlooking the beach at Barceloneta, Barcelona.</p></div>
<p>Barcelona’s beachfront was given a facelift for the 1992 Olympics, and today, Barceloneta beach is the meeting point of the city, backed by a magical mixture of cool bars and tapas restaurants, a stream of contemporary architecture and Frank Gehry’s glittering copper fish sculpture. The sand is raked over daily and stretches for miles along a boardwalk crowded with families jogging, skateboarding, and cycling.</p>
<h2>8. Best for Late Teens</h2>
<p>Croatia’s beaches first started opening up in the late 1990s and very quickly have become the party destinations of Balkan Europe. The best parties are found around the Pakleni Islands off Hvar, where family-friendly beach clubs such as Carpe Diem Beach Stipanska and Hula Hula are the summer playgrounds of a gilded youth born after the Balkan Wars. The best way to arrive is by dinghy from a super-yacht moored offshore. Prices are inexpensive, the water is clear and warm, the music laid-back, and visitors are virtually guaranteed hot, sunny weather.</p>
<h2>9. Best for Watersports</h2>
<p>Sitting at the point where the Atlantic and the Mediterranean crash together, Tarifa is the hippest resort along Andalucia’s wild Costa de la Luz. Thanks to the almost constant winds, it is one of Europe’s coolest hot spots for kiters, surfers, parasailors, and windsurfers. With 6.25 miles (10 kilometers) of unspoiled but windblown sand, the coastline shimmers with color in summer as kites zoom overhead against a backdrop of Morocco’s Atlas Mountains. Tarifa itself is a cute little town with plenty of low-key bars and beach shacks for visitors 18 and over to enjoy.</p>
<h2>10. Best for Schmoozing</h2>
<div id="attachment_38748" style="max-width: 550px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-38748" src="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cannes-540x360.jpg" alt="The waterfront in Cannes" width="540" height="360" srcset="http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cannes-540x360.jpg 540w, http://travelblog.viator.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cannes-1024x682.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The waterfront in Cannes</p></div>
<p>Celebrity-struck youngsters adore star spotting on the sandy strand along La Croisette esplanade in Cannes on the French Riviera, especially when the film festival is in town in May. Boulevard de la Croisette is wrapped around the Baie des Anges and is lined with immaculate sandy beaches owned by ritzy hotels such as the Carlton and Majestic. Most beaches charge a small fee for admission, but there is a strip of public sand tucked behind the Palais des Festivals.</p>
