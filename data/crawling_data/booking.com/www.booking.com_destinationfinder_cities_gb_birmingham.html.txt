Visit Birmingham: Your Travel Guide


Birmingham skews young. With nearly half its population under 25, it’s a youth-centric city that brims with cheerful optimism. For proof, mall-shop at The Bullring and The Mailbox, see creative street art in vintage-loving East Side, or take to the scintillating nightlife on Broad Street.

Things to Do in Birmingham









Thinktank

There’s no time like the present to discover the past. Take a deep-dive into the foundations of modern science at this family-friendly museum. It holds a massive collection of classical artefacts, including some of the world’s earliest coins. Explore the city’s industrial past, the IMAX cinema and the state-of-the-art Planetarium.



Millennium Point, Curzon Street, Birmingham, B4 7XG




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00.









Bullring Shopping Centre

It’s all bull. A giant bronze one, to be precise. This 5-ton statue stands at the middle of the mall, ready to charge. Charge your credit card at one of 140-odd stores, including big-brands like Gap, Armani Exchange, Forever 21 and G-Star Raw, plus English department store stalwart Selfridges. Afterwards, grab a treat from Millie’s Cookies and count your purchases.



Bullring Shopping Centre, Birmingham, B5 4BU




Open Monday–Friday 10:00–20:00, Saturday 09:00–20:00, Sunday 11:00–17:00









Hippodrome Theatre

No hippos were harmed in the making of this theatre. Or cast in a production. Home to the Birmingham Royal Ballet, many a lithe body has piqued and pirouetted across the stage since it first opened in 1895. Outside of ballet season, the theatre hosts the works – opera, pantomimes, dramas and a never-ending parade of West End shows.  Book early for tickets.



Hurst Street, Southside, Birmingham, B5 4TB




Open Monday–Saturday 10:00–20:00. Check website for details









Birmingham Back to Backs

Get back to basics. These back-to-back houses are built around a communal courtyard. Once upon a time, a quarter of Birmingham’s residents lived here in cramped conditions. They squeezed into places much like this to work, rest and play. Learn about the lives of Birmingham’s forefathers on the quirky walking tour, or visit for a spot of boutique shopping.



55-63 Hurst Street/50-54 Inge Street, Birmingham, B5 4TE




Open Tuesday–Sunday 10:00–17:00. Check website for details.









The Mailbox

Bring a healthy appetite … for shoes! This building has gone from Royal Mail sorting centre to the hottest mall in town. Dandy up at fashion shops like Emporio Armani, or mix it up with a medi-pedi and a facial at Harvey Nichols. Whether you’re catching a film at the Everyman Cinema or dining out bistro-style, there’s always something happening here.



Wharfside Street, Birmingham, B1 1RD




Check website for details.









Symphony Hall

The orchestra is in session. Cue strings, woodwind, brass and percussion – and with a ding of the humble triangle, the music begins. See a performance by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and hear the orchestra reach a thunderous crescendo. Rock, pop and stand-up comedy shows are regular fixtures, in a venue celebrated for its acoustic flexibility.



Broad Street, Birmingham, B1 2EA




Open Monday–Friday 10:00–18:00, Sunday 12:00–16:00. Check website for details









National Sea Life Centre

Very Good


Lots to see and do. Shopping is phenomenon. Every brand you can think of is in the Bull Ring. Theatres, museums and the Jewellery Quarter is a mustVery popular so it is very crowded but not overwhelmingly so. Expect to queue for popular eateries.Highly recommended for a weekend

We stayed a night for a concert at the arena and a shopping trip. The arena is a great concert arena and the shopping areas are fantastic. The Christmas market was a real bonus and really well done, we had a great weekend for our first trip to Birmingham and would definitely recommend.

Very vibrant city. Offered a fantastic selection of restaurants and bars. Shopping centre was excellent and the music venues for concerts easily accessed. However the oneway system was horrendous and multiple road works caused congestion even at 1am!!

Felt like a cow at market being pushed and barged around but you have to expect that at a busy time of year. Great places to eat a lot of choice.

Popular Neighborhoods in Birmingham












The Westside


37 properties

Westside has gone from blah to hurrah! In mere decades, it rocketed from fun-free industrial zone to an entertainment free-for-all. Walk the series of Canals in the Gas Street Basin, shop it up on Broad Street, get literary inspiration in the new Library of Birmingham, or stare at the Rubick's cube that is "The Cube".

Accommodations in The Westside













Jewellery Quarter


12 properties

Arrive bare-necked and leave dripping with diamonds. This semi-residential area holds over a hundred jewellery stores. Buy truly outrageous gems from Mitchel and Co., or find an artisan to craft your perfect bespoke piece – which usually sell for much less than popular retailers. For divine inspiration, stop by the Museum of the Jewellery Quarter.

Accommodations in Jewellery Quarter













Theatreland Birmingham


11 properties

Get a box seat at the best theatres in town. The Hippodrome, New Alexandra Theatre and the Old Rep represent the triumverate of noteworthy theatres in the area. From touring productions to musicals, foot tap the night away in style. After curtain call, head to one of the area's swanky restaurants.

Accommodations in Theatreland Birmingham













Eastside


8 properties

Up-and-coming Eastside brims with student life. Activities in the area orbit around the Eastside City Park, which is flanked by a host of science and art-themed institutes. Evolve your view of the natural world at the Thinktank Science Museum. Watch aerial acrobatics at RoguePlay, or check out the giant cinema screen at Millennium Point.

Accommodations in Eastside













Chinatown


6 properties

Chinatown had us fooled – it’s nowhere near as big as China, but the breadth of restaurants here is truly staggering. Luscious Asian cuisines are ripe for the picking, with restaurants that sell everything from bento boxes to egg foo yong. The area is plonked amidst a series of trendy nightclubs, just a stone’s throw from New Street Station.

Accommodations in Chinatown













Digbeth


5 properties

Do you dig? Birmingham’s creative quarter is a laid-back place to dive into the city’s heritage. The Typhoo Tea HQ and Wharf and Banana Warehouse underline the area’s industrial roots, which have given way to a hip café culture. Explore the vintage boutiques in the legendary Custard Factory, or snap funky street art like the mosaicked JFK Mural.

Accommodations in Digbeth













Brindleyplace


4 properties

Brindleyplace has the whole shebang. A conglomeration of eateries, shops and entertainment venues are here, each with something for everyone. Dine al fresco at the quaint Café Rouge, then catch some musical theatre at The Crescent Theatre off Broad Street. Big kids will love The National SEA LIFE Centre’s bubbling aquariums.

Accommodations in Brindleyplace













Gay Village Birmingham


3 properties

Out and proud, or just ready to get loud? Hit Hurst Street's nightspots for a howler of a glitter-filled evening. Drag queens, leather kings and fun-loving locals create a jubilant atmosphere. From cocktails to cabarets - and with nary a dowdy outfit in sight, thanks to the Bullring Mall next door - the village never runs out of steam.

The Electric




by Laura

A Brummie born and bred, cinema-lover Laura lived in Birmingham until she was 18.


The Electric is the oldest working cinema in the UK, and shows everything from retro classics to the latest blockbusters. It’s great to settle down in one of the comfy sofa seats and enjoy their homemade cakes or even a cheeky drink from the absinthe fountain!

The Rainbow Venues




by Judith

When she’s not visiting Birmingham for work, Judith enjoys travelling and exploring new cultures.


The Rainbow’s got it all – a Victorian pub on the ground floor, a club in the cellar and a warehouse-style covered courtyard. I love the easygoing atmosphere and wide variety of events which bring together different genres and their crowds, from indie and hip-hop to house and reggae.

What should you avoid to make the most of the nightlife in Birmingham?





Anonymous


We was told to avoid Broad Street as its the trouble-some area but we found it very pleasant and less drama then a Friday night in Brighton. Deff recommend if your under 25. If your over 25, check out the Arcadiam - its more up market, so nice dresses and heels for that one.

Is there more to shopping in Birmingham than just brand-name stores?





Anonymous


There are some very good vintage stores out towards the Custard Factory in Digbeth with is worth a look if you are into those sorts of clothes. The meat and rag market is also great to look around and there are some lovely things to get to eat there.

Did the theater performances in Birmingham live up to their reputation?





Anonymous


The Alexandra theatre is small and cosy and puts on good productions. It's fairly comfortable although the tiered seating is not great. If you are short you will struggle to see above the head of the person n front.

Transportation





Birmingham Transportation









Air - Birmingham Airport



The free AirRail Link connects Birmingham Airport to Birmingham International Station every 2 minutes from 05:15–02:00: just follow the signs in Arrivals. From the station, 7 trains an hour make the 10-minute trip to Birmingham New Street for GBP 3.60. Buses also stop outside the airport 24 hours a day and reach the centre in 25 minutes. Tickets are available on board for GBP 2.20 (exact change only). A taxi will charge about GBP 30 and take around 20 minutes.




Birmingham Airport
birminghamairport.co.uk











Taxi



Licenced taxis in Birmingham are generally black London-style hackney cabs, which can be hailed in the street or found at taxi ranks. All hackney cabs are wheelchair accessible. Fares are standardised by the council and are metered, although the driver can negotiate a fixed fee for journeys which finish outside the Birmingham metropolitan boundary. It’s advisable to avoid any taxi which isn’t a hackney cab, and any unmarked car apart from pre-booked radio taxis.










Bus



Buses criss-cross the city, departing from various different points – you can pick up a route map at a tourist office, library or Travel West Midlands shop. Tickets are sold on board (cash only, no change given) and prices range from GBP 1.90–2.20 for adults, with reduced fares for kids. If you plan to make several journeys, a day pass offers better value at GBP 4. National Express West Midlands buses let you make a single trip within the city centre for just GBP 1.




Network West Midlands
www.networkwestmidlands.com











Train



Trains are mainly used to reach other cities, rather than for travel within Birmingham. The main city centre stations are New Street, Moor Street and Snow Hill, while Birmingham International serves the airport and NEC. Birmingham New Street is the city's major railway hub, with direct links to most major UK cities. Trains run between New Street and International from 05:29–23:53. Tickets are sold at desks and machines in stations, but are up to 40% cheaper online.




Network West Midlands
www.networkwestmidlands.com











Tram



Midland Metro trams run out from the city centre as far as Wolverhampton. Trams operate from 05:15–00:00 (Sunday 08:00–23:45), with up to 10 an hour at peak times. Stops are marked with a pink and blue logo, and tickets are sold by an on-board conductor. Exact change is encouraged, and notes above GBP 10 can’t be accepted. A single ticket costs GBP 2.30 or a day pass is GBP 6.20. Fares are lower outside peak hours and for under 16s, while kids under 5 travel free.










Bicycle



Birmingham isn’t particularly well equipped for cyclists and doesn’t yet have a municipal bike hire service. Some local residents do cycle, but the traffic and absence of bike lanes make this a fairly unappealing option for most visitors. If you do decide to cycle in Birmingham, there are several private bike hire companies to choose from. It’s best to plan your route in advance and avoid the city centre whenever possible.










Car



Birmingham's roads can be confusing and somewhat daunting for visitors. Weekday traffic tends to be heaviest from 08:00–09:00 and 17:00–18:00, while Saturdays are busy with shoppers. Patience is needed when trying to get out of the city centre. There are many council-run Pay & Display car parks dotted around the city – tickets must be purchased from machines and displayed in the front windscreen. It’s advisable to carry a supply of small change in order to pay.










Scooter or Motorbike



A small minority of Birmingham’s road users choose to travel by motorbike or scooter. While this is a very effective way of getting around the city centre, it may be tricky for visitors who aren’t familiar with the Birmingham road network. On the upside, scooters and motorbikes can park for free in most major car parks, making them a convenient and cost-effective way to get about.
