Visit Prague: Your Travel Guide


For 600 years the 30 statues of Christian saints that line Charles Bridge have watched footsore pilgrims, fictional spies and avid tourists cross from Malá Strana to the Old Town. In the near distance, the city’s baroque castle looms over a cityscape that’s straight from a fairy tale.

Things to Do in Prague









Old Town Square

This expanse of well-trodden cobbles has been the heart of Prague for centuries. With Christmas Markets in the winter and street bands in the summer, the square is alive with tourists and locals bustling to and fro. Watching over the scenes below are the Old Town Hall tower, the spires of the imposing Týn Church, and the surrounding patchwork of colourful facades.



Staroměstské náměstí, 110 00 Prague 1









Old Town Hall with Orloj Astronomical Clock

Is it a sculpture? Is it a spaceship? No, it's a clock! This labour of love attracts a glittering sea of cameras every hour on the hour. Drawing on ancient knowledge, the 600-year-old Astronomical Clock’s cluster of golden symbols, circles and dials can tell you the position of the sun, the moon, the stars – and it can even tell you the time!



Staroměstské náměstí 1/3110 00 Prague 1




Open Monday 11:00–22.00, Tuesday–Sunday 09:00–22.00









Old-New Synagogue

A curiosity if only for its contradictory name, the Old-New Synagogue has stood on this spot for the best part of a millennium. It is Europe’s oldest active synagogue, and its soaring gothic arches are said to be built on stones brought from Jerusalem … by angels. Legend has it that the attic above these arches houses a golem created to protect the city from harm.



Maiselova 18, 110 01 Prague 1




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00–17:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Charles Bridge

This faithful friend has spanned the watery divide between the Old Town and Malá Strana for over 600 years. The stream of footsteps on the cobbles sounds out a restless beat, accompanying the myriad street musicians and performers. Bronze statues stand watch over the crowd, giving an eternal sense of grandeur to this most majestic of Prague’s bridges.



Karlův most, 110 00 Prague 1









Wenceslas Square

Wenceslas Square’s sweeping boulevard of shops and restaurants runs from the edge of Prague’s medieval centre to the National Museum. Watched over by a statue of the Good King himself, pivotal moments in recent Czech history took place right here. The square is hallowed ground for protestors and freedom fighters, and is seen as a home for Czech national pride.



110 00 Prague 1









Prague Castle

The alabaster-coloured Prague Castle drapes along the hillside. It overlooks the clay-tile rooftops of Malá Strana from its stately seat seeming more like a citadel – with towers and palaces from all periods surrounded by ramparts and gardens. You’ll wind through grand halls and courtyards from the Gothic to the Romanesque.



119 08 Prague 1




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00–17:00. Check website for details.









Dancing House Fred & Ginger

Dancing like nobody's watching, this curvaceous and fluid building leaves its neighbours looking like wallflowers. Designed by Czech architect, Vlado Milunić, and the legendary Frank Gehry, Dancing House was inspired by film idol dance partners, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Cut in and dine at the top floor restaurant, or sip champagne with the stars on the roof terrace.



Jiráskovo náměstí 1981/6, 120 00 Prague 2









St Vitus Cathedral

Amid the dull echoes of Prague Castle’s courtyard, the Gothic spires of St Vitus Cathedral thunder skywards and dwarf the surrounding palace buildings. Step into the cavernous sanctuary to marvel at the delicate carvings and vivid stained glass windows. Then, the glint of silver cherub wings will draw your gaze towards the towering vaulted ceilings.



III. nádvoří 48/2, 119 01 Prague 1




Open Monday–Saturday 09:00–16.00, Sunday 12:00–16:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Petrin

Scale to the top of Petřín hill and you'll find a solitary sentinel watching over Prague below. Petřín Tower was inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and gives an almost birds-eye view of the snaking river and the historic centre. Whirring its way up and down the hill is the Petřín funicular railway, giving visitors a more leisurely ascent to the tower and its gardens.



Petřínské sady, 118 00 Prague 1




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00–18.00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Vysehrad

You could spend hours exploring this ancient hill fort’s grounds. Its pathways criss-cross lawns dotted with ancient gnarled trees and sleepy statues. Stroll along the ramparts for romantic views of Prague Castle, or discover Dvořak’s final resting place amid the cemetery’s forest of gravestones. Crowning the site is the Gothic Basilica of St Peter and St Paul.



V pevnosti 159/5b, 128 00 Prague 2




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30–17:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Municipal House

Always the belle of the ball – Municipal House’s stucco work and stained-glass windows make it one of Prague’s prettiest buildings. It’s been the setting for everything from royal residences to declarations of independence. To sample the pageantry today, you can catch a classical concert in Smetana Hall or grab a coffee in the chandeliered Art Nouveau cafe.








The Beer Festival at Prague Castle

There’s more to Prague than just pilsner or lager. Not your average beer garden, the impressive grounds of Prague Castle welcome thousands of beer enthusiasts for this yearly celebration of Czech microbreweries. Entrance includes a program, souvenir glass and all the beer you can drink. Na zdraví (Cheers)!








Prague Beer Spa Experience

Who knew beer could be so good for you? This unique combination of spa bathing and beer tasting makes for a foamy experience. You’ll get to soak in traditional wooden tubs full of real Czech hops and herbs, while sipping on an unlimited supply of pilsner lager from your own personal tap. What will make you woozier, the bath or the beer?








The Grand Bohemian Beer Tasting Experience

If only you could bottle Bohemia! This beer-tasting experience actually comes pretty close. With the help of mouthwatering meat and cheese platters, a local expert will guide you through the region’s best brews. The variety of dark, light, and fruity drinks go down even better on sunny days when you can enjoy them out on the charming cobblestone courtyard.








Prague Beer Museum Pub

A microbrewery, museum, and bar all rolled into one – this place is a real find for beer connoisseurs. There’s nowhere better to learn about the Czech craft beer scene, and more importantly, nowhere with as many independent brews on tap! Open from lunch until late, the bar serves hearty meals to help you savor the beer’s hoppy goodness – and to keep you going when your eyes get droopy.








Carlo's Bridge

This faithful friend has spanned the watery divide between the Old Town and Malá Strana for over 600 years. The stream of footsteps on the cobbles sounds out a restless beat, accompanying the myriad street musicians and performers. Bronze statues stand watch over the crowd, giving an eternal sense of grandeur to this most majestic of Prague’s bridges.








Prague's Castle

The alabaster-coloured Prague Castle drapes along the hillside. It overlooks the clay-tile rooftops of Malá Strana from its stately seat seeming more like a citadel – with towers and palaces from all periods surrounded by ramparts and gardens. You’ll wind through grand halls and courtyards from the Gothic to the Romanesque.








Jewish quarter

Prague’s Jewish Quarter is a compact tangle of streets weaving between historic synagogues and elegant townhouses. Side-by-side with the oldest synagogue in Europe runs the boutique-bedecked Pařížská street. Here you can peruse the glittering shop windows as shoppers clatter over the cobbles from Fendi and Prada to Louis Vuitton.








Old City Hall and the Astronomic Clock

Is it a sculpture? Is it a spaceship? No, it's a clock! This labour of love attracts a glittering sea of cameras every hour on the hour. Drawing on ancient knowledge, the 600-year-old Astronomical Clock’s cluster of golden symbols, circles and dials can tell you the position of the sun, the moon, the stars – and it can even tell you the time!








Saint Vitus Cathedral

Amid the dull echoes of Prague Castle’s courtyard, the Gothic spires of St Vitus Cathedral thunder skywards and dwarf the surrounding palace buildings. Step into the cavernous sanctuary to marvel at the delicate carvings and vivid stained glass windows. Then, the glint of silver cherub wings will draw your gaze towards the towering vaulted ceilings.








Letna Park

Letna Park makes the perfect ending for any walking route around Prague. Perched on a hilltop, it has incomparable panoramas of the city below. And that’s not all – this leafy park is home to a cozy, shaded beer garden where you can order a refreshing drink after a long day’s exploration.








Petřín Park

Getting lost might not normally be what you're looking for on a city walk. But at the mirror maze in Petřín Park, confusion is just part of the fun. When you exit, get back on track with a trip up the funicular train from Újezd for breathtaking city views. Then head down the path through the forest towards Malostranské náměstí.








Josefov

Josefov is the name of Prague’s former Jewish ghetto. Sadly, many of the old buildings were demolished in the early 20th century, but some stand-out gems remain. The Old New Synagogue, the High Synagogue, and the Old Jewish Cemetery are definitely worth a visit for their historic beauty and intriguing backstory.








St. Vitus Cathedral

Built up over more than 1,000 years, this towering Gothic temple is part of the vast Prague Castle complex. Spires stretch towards the sky around St. Vitus Cathedral, and the arched interior draws the eye up to its soaring vaulted ceiling. Stained-glass windows splash color onto the chapels lining the aisles – including the fresco-covered tomb of Czech patron, St. Wenceslas.








Astronomical Clock

Mounted on the southern facade of Prague’s Old Town Hall, this 600-year-old timepiece is a true architectural treasure. Ornate Gothic sculptures guard the Astronomical Clock, with a vaulted arch protecting its gilded dials. The clock face shows the positions of the sun, moon and stars, while the figure of Death strikes the hour – a signal for the 12 apostles to parade around the tower.








Old Town Hall

This Medieval masterpiece is one of Prague’s most loved buildings. Founded in 1338, the Old Town Hall is spread across several historic houses. These were joined over the centuries, with a hodgepodge of architectural styles including Gothic and Renaissance. Crowds gather daily beneath its central stone tower to see an ancient Astronomical Clock count out the hours.








Týn Church

Officially called Our Lady Before Týn, this imposing church looms above the medieval houses of Prague’s Old Town. Its two towers pierce the sky with a miniature spires, with intricate reliefs decorating the northern portal. Inside, soaring Gothic columns contrast with an ornate black-and-gold altarpiece that could only be Baroque.








Schwarzenberg Palace

If the Renaissance is your thing, don’t miss the impressive 16th-century Schwarzenberg Palace. Standing opposite Prague Castle in Hradčanské Square, this architectural gem has a perfectly preserved facade covered in elaborate black-and-white sgraffito designs. The painted canvas ceilings inside show scenes from ancient mythology, and its halls house the Czech National Gallery’s Baroque art collection.








St. Nicholas Church

St. Nicholas Cathedral is a Baroque wonderland set within Prague’s Lesser Town Square. Colorful frescoes, gilded statues, and marble-clad columns all fight for attention with the dazzling crystal chandelier donated by a Russian Czar. Even though it's still used as a place of worship, today the church also doubles as a heavenly concert hall.








Goltz-Kinský Palace

Prague’s finest Rococo facade dominates one side of Old Town Square. The striking pink-and-white Goltz-Kinský Palace is all intricate twists and twirls, richly decorated window frames, and classical columns and sculptures. The Baroque interior formerly housed a German grammar school where Franz Kafka once studied, but today the space belongs the Czech National Gallery.








Obecní Dum Building

The Obecní Dum, or "Municipal House," was built on the site of the Bohemian Royal Court. Today this Art Nouveau treasure houses many famous cafes and restaurants, along with the celebrated Smetana Concert Hall. Architecture buffs should book a guided tour to get a sneak peek at spaces that would otherwise be off limits.








House of the Black Madonna

Cubism might have been short-lived, but its impact lives on in design – and nowhere more so than the House of the Black Madonna. Proving that Prague’s architecture didn’t peak in the Middle Ages, this landmark building is a geometric masterpiece of pyramids and prisms. Inside, the Czech Museum of Cubism shares the space with Grand Cafe Orient, the world’s only Cubist cafe!








John Lennon Wall

In the heart of the Mala Strana District, an explosion of colors decorates this downtown wall – celebrating the life of John Lennon and recognized as a symbol of peace. Keep an eye out for references to Lennon’s songs, as well as political graffiti.

Great for a city break of sight seeing and culture. I was lucky enough to visit while the Christmas markets were opening and the Old Town Square Christmas lights were turned on. Such a beautiful place at this time of year with so much to see and do. I can’t wait to visit again!

Lots to see and do. Great mix of historic and modern. One word of warning. If you gave any specific dietary requirements eg. Coeliac then plan ahead. Most restaurants don't seem to be able to handle special requirements but there are some hidden gems if you do your research

Great city, plenty to see and do, beautiful buildings, can see most of it on foot if you are a good walker. Trams are a good way to get around, and run very frequently. Food and drink reasonable, especially away from city centre. Beware of over priced taxis.

Prague Center

Prague’s historic core is an enticing brew of culture, monuments and new experiences, always beckoning you to take another sip. Forget sleep. Watch dawn break over the city from the steps of Prague Castle. Spend the day browsing and soaking in the atmosphere on Charles Bridge. At sundown, tuck yourself away in one of the city’s genial bars and swig Staropramen 'til the wee hours.

Accommodations in Prague Center













Wenceslas Square


692 properties

Hit the shops here for high-street labels and to mix with a more local crowd. The square itself was a crucible for change during the country's Velvet Revolution against communism. Grab a 'trdelník' (don't try to say it, just eat it) from a vendor on the square and try bar-hopping your way towards the 500-year-old U Fleků brewery.

Accommodations in Wenceslas Square













Old Town (Stare Mesto)


449 properties

Tucked into a bend of the Vltava River, the Old Town has been a centre of commerce for over a thousand years. In its heart, the famous Astronomical Clock maps out the heavens, while the twisty streets brim with shops and restaurants catering to visitors' every whim, from “knedliky” (Czech dumplings) to souvenirs and traditional glassware.

Prague 02


403 properties

Prague 02 mixes old and new. For a taste, just follow its riverside promenade from the eccentrically curvy Dancing House to the ancient Vyšehrad fort. Away from the traffic and hubbub of Sokolská and Legerova, Náměstí Míru square is a calm retreat under the watch of the Vinohrady Theatre and Church of St Ludmila.

Accommodations in Prague 02













Vinohrady


258 properties

Take a stroll in Vinohrady to spot yuppies and urbanites sipping designer coffees. Kick back in laid-back style at Havlíčkovy Sady Park or peruse Pavilion Market Hall's boutiques. International restaurants like Samurai and Las Adelitas bring cosmopolitan flair, and Paul bakery will have your every sugar-whim covered.

Accommodations in Vinohrady













Lesser Town (Mala Strana)


184 properties

Adventurers will want to scale Petřín for a view over Malá Strana’s terracotta rooftops towards the dome of St Nicholas church. Afterwards, wander down quiet lanes past inviting bars and sellers of hand-carved marionettes – a Czech speciality! Then tuck into some sizzling pork with fluffy dumplings at any of the traditional local restaurants.

Local Tips for Prague







Different way to Prague Castle, through Letna Park




by Lada

Lada is a travel-lover with a passion for food and new places! Her life motto? "Eat, sleep, travel".


This is a wonderful alternative route up to Prague Castle. Letna Park gives you beautiful views of the Old Town and is less crowded that the usual way to the Castle. Enjoy a nice picnic in the park, visit the large beer garden, or stop by Metronome aka “the time machine”.

Great party in the city centre




by Lukas

When he's travelling, Lukas loves meeting the locals and hearing their personal city tips.


Music Club Zlaty Strom is an underground club with a young atmosphere, fresh music and friendly staff. The club is always full of people whatever the day of the week. On top of it all, there's nothing better than the early-morning walk home over the deserted Charles Bridge!

Kralovská obora - Stromovka - Relaxing area




by Tomas

Tomas has lived in Prague all his life, and knows exactly how to escape the crowded centre!


Stromovka is every Praguer's favourite park. It's perfect for wandering, relaxing, picnicking and playing sports, and it dates right back to the 13th century. I'd also recommend it for Letna beer garden and Prague Zoo, as well as the Vystaviště exhibition grounds.

Go back in time




by Tereza

Tereza was born and raised in Prague, but the city still surprises her every day!

How can you enjoy the sights in Prague while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


Be prepared to wander off the beaten track. There are lovely gardens in Mala Strana and around the castle which are usually very peaceful. Petrin Hill is great for walking - it is steep, but there is a great funicular railway if you don't fancy the climb. The view rom here is lovely - and also from Letna Park, by the giant metronome. Stromovka is another nice park where you won't be tripping over other tourists and the area around Vysehrad tends to be quiet too. Prague Castle opens quite early and a ticket will give you entry on 2 days. Buy your ticket early to avoid the queues and give you time to see around everything. If you are an early riser, head to Charles Bridge before 10am to avoid the crowds. May is a great time to visit Prague. It is usually sunny, the cherry blossom is out and there are fewer tourists than in the summer. Avoid July and August when it is hot and crowded if you can.

Transportation





Prague Transportation









Air



Václav Havel is Prague’s main airport. The best way to reach the city centre is using the Airport Express bus service - the station is 100 metres from the main exit of the airport. You can buy tickets from the driver for 60 CZK one way. The Airport Express has 4 stops around the centre of Prague. If you're in a hurry there's a taxi rank just outside the airport entrance, but check with prices before getting in - taking you to the city centre shouldn't cost more than 500 CZK.




Václav Havel Airport Prague
www.prg.aero











Metro



The metro can get you to all corners of the city, and runs from 05:00 to around midnight. The city isn't big so there are only 3 lines (green, yellow, red). Stations have a red sign combining an 'M' with an arrow - get a ticket inside then validate it at the machine in the entrance. There are lots of different tickets (60 minutes, 90 minutes, 1 day, 3 days) but the most usual is for 90 minutes which costs 32 CZK. These tickets can also be used on buses and trams.




Prague Public Transport Company
www.dpp.cz











Train



The tram network is a very popular form of transport in Prague and allows for a spot of sightseeing as it even runs in the historic centre. The tickets are exactly the same as for the metro and the bus, and can be bought either at a metro station or in any newsagent / tobacconist shop. Once you're on board, just stick the ticket into one of the yellow boxes to validate it.




Prague Public Transport Company
www.dpp.cz











Bus



The bus network mainly covers the surroundings and outskirts of Prague, leaving the city centre to the trams and metro. Bus tickets can be bought at any metro station / newsagent / tobacconist shop and used across all forms of public transport. Hop on and validate your ticket in one of the mounted yellow boxes.




Prague Public Transport Company
www.dpp.cz











Taxi



Taxis are almost everywhere in Prague, especially in the city centre. The easiest and usually the cheapest way is to order a taxi at the hotel reception. The most known are the yellow AAA Taxis. Watch out for drivers trying to charge tourists more than the usual rate. To avoid this it's always better to order a taxi on the phone. In these cases they'll ask you where you're heading and give you an estimated price in advance.










Car



Prague is a busy place and traffic restrictions in the centre make driving stressful. Be prepared for tricky one-way streets and not much available parking in the centre. Parking meters mark out the few areas where parking is possible. One thing to note is that parking in Prague 1 and 2 is reserved for resident only. A quick guide: blue line - only for residents (you'll risk being clamped!), yellow line - no parking, red line - no stopping at all.

Booking.com is part of The Priceline Group, the world leader in online travel & related services.



























Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
