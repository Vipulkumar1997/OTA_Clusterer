Oxford Travel Guide










City of Dreaming Spires
Featuring a magnificent academic heritage, Oxford is a beautiful city where Gothic spires intermingle with medieval colleges. The home to England’s oldest university, most of the 38 unique colleges are sadly only viewable from the outside. Two that you can visit are Magdalen College, considered one of the most beautiful, and Christchurch College whose quadrangle was used in the 1st Harry Potter film. Its cathedral choir also sings evensong.
Other notable colleges are Balliol and Merton, the 2 oldest, while Hertford College has the Bridge of Sighs. Next door is the cavernous Bodleian Library, overlooking the round Radcliffe Camera, the city’s best-known landmark.
The university also has a botanical garden and the best Oxford museums, including the Ashmolean Museum and Natural History Museum, where swifts nest in summer.
Unsurprisingly for a student town, it has lots of bars and restaurants. Oxford shopping is also good and includes England’s oldest covered market, brightly colored High Street shops, and the Clarendon and Westgate shopping centers.
Whether you arrive by road or fly into London Oxford Airport, don’t leave without trying Oxford punting. In contrast to rival Cambridge, you punt here by standing in the front (rather than on the back). Easily accessed from the Oxford accommodations on Booking.com, the routes take in the River Cherwell and the Isis (the name for this part of the Thames).

Oxford is a very walkable city, but also has good bus...

Oxford is a very walkable city, but also has good bus service, and taxis are readily available. We enjoyed touring the colleges of the University of Oxford. The University Botanical Gardens, Ashmolean Museum, Natural History Museum and Pitt Rivers Museum are also must sees! I would also recommend a relaxing afternoon punting on the Cherwell river, perhaps with a picnic. Oxford has many interesting shops, including those in the historic Covered Market, and in the pedestrian mall on Corn Market Street. Several times a week, vendors set up stalls in the square adjacent to the Gloucester Green bus terminal. The city has lots of restaurants featuring every cuisine imaginable, and of course many traditional pubs - we enjoyed the Royal Oak and the Old Bookbinder's. Blenheim Palace, the home of the Dukes of Marlborough, and the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill, and the charming village of Woodstock are a short bus ride away. WindsorCastle, Bath, Stratford Upon Avon, and the excitement of London are all easy day trips from Oxford, and are accessible via public transportation.-

Great city, wonderful cultural experience, bastion of education - everything to like!!I loved the tours around the city and the university, I mostly ate in different spots at the city centre, it was easy to get around with the bus system.

I stayed here for 6 days.

I stayed here for 6 days. This city breathes culture and knowledge. You feel as if you were near to C.S. Lewis and Tolkien, there world and images. I visited a lot of University Colleges: it's the best part. Our trip was before Christmas, it was a special wonderful atmosphere. Would return any time, although every time I come here it rains.

Love all the historical buildings and international feel to the city . Shops boutiques and pubs are fabulous . Too many international summer school children , heavy foot traffic . No police presence  in light of the times we live in .








Hotels That Guests Love in Oxford





Malmaison Oxford









“
The room was exactly what we ordered/expected.  There is nothing worse when booking a hotel and the pictures look nothing like the room.  The hotel was spotless (from what I saw), the garden is beautiful, and the best sleep I had in Oxford.
”






The Old Bank









“
Beautiful hotel, super comfortable, fabulous views on Oxford, friendly staff.
”






The Bocardo Hotel









“
The hotel was in walking distance of work and in the middle of Oxford.
”






Macdonald Randolph Hotel









“
I decided to stay at the Randolph because it is a famous traditional hotel, and when in Oxford, tradition is to be enjoyed! After last year's fire, the hotel was being repaired which probably explains why we got a big discount on the room. The staff were very attentive and with the kind of service of a 5* hotel. We got a small but beautiful room overlooking the Ashmoleon on.
”






St Margarets Hotel









“
Good location able to park car and use bus service or 20 min walk into central Oxford.Hotel has faults but considering price it is great value for money.Staff always available for your requirements
