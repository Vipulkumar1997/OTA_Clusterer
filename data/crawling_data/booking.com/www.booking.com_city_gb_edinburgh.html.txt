Edinburgh Travel Guide










A Feast for the Senses
A city of heritage, heart and of course Hogmanay, Scotland’s capital is vibrant and edgy. Whether or not you come for one of its many festivals, Edinburgh is quite simply a feast for the senses.
The wealth of Edinburgh sights ranges from Holyrood Palace to the Botanical Gardens, Princes Street to the Royal Mile. Overseeing them all is majestic Edinburgh Castle. Be there at sunset on a clear day to see the city below bathed in a warm, orange glow. Simply stunning.
Wandering the streets, the smell of fish and chips wafts by, with the unique twist of salt ‘n’ sauce – a must-try variation on this favourite dish. Follow it up with a smooth whisky and you’ll start to feel like a local.
For a taste of Scottish culture, a kilt-wearing busker often plays the bagpipes on Waverley Bridge, while traditional folk music can be heard in some Old Town pubs. Complete your stay with a rugby match at Murrayfield or a round at one of the city’s 14 golf clubs, and you’ll have the true Edinburgh experience.
Whether you are looking for hotels near Edinburgh Airport or accommodations in the city center, Booking.com has a great range to choose from.

Wonderful old city.

Wonderful old city. Lots to see and absorb. My daughter lived there for two years while attending the University. So we did travel there a few times to visit. Weather can be an issue as it gets a fair amount of rain. Much to see in surrounding country as well.

What a great time of year to have visited.

What a great time of year to have visited. The Christmas Market is So Beautiful!!! And so much of what we wanted to see was all within walking distance. I recommend the Hop On Hop Off bus tour too. Favorite restaurant was The Badger.

Walking especially in the Old Town, the tour through the Royal Yacht Britannia, the castle. If you like cozy restaurants I recommend Broughton Street.  There is so much to see and nice to just take a direction and have an adventure.

Every person we encountered was extremely nice, personable and helpful. The city has so much to do for falimies traveling with kids. The Christmas market was entertaining and had a variety of things for everyone to enjoy. The Southern Cross Cafe was our choice for breakfast every morning. The Whiskey Experience tour tasting was excellent. Get the gold package! The castle was beautiful and the entire city was picturesque. Will definitely go back!

Edinburgh is magical.

Edinburgh is magical. I’d love to come back, but I’d come in the summer. The cold rain in November made it hard, especially with kids. Even so, everything from the architecture to the friendly residents make it a must-visit.








Hotels That Guests Love in Edinburgh





Ballantrae Hotel









“
Although not in Old Town, we were within walking distance of the Castle, grass market, Royal Mile, Hop-on Hop-off bus tour.  We were very close (block or two) to many delicious restaurants and pubs. Super public transportation in Edinburgh.
”






Apex Grassmarket Hotel









“
This hotel is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in Europe. The location was fantastic, right by the Grassmarket, with a stunning view of the Edinburg Castle (do spend the extra pounds to get a castle view room, you will not regret it), and a short walk from pretty much anywhere in the Old Town. The rooms were also incredibly large and comfortable, the bathroom was also large. The staff was friendly and welcoming. I recommend this hotel highly.
”






Radisson Blu Hotel, Edinburgh









“
Room furnishings, bedding.  Location was in the center of Old Town Edinburgh. Front desk was very friendly and helpful.
”






Fraser Suites Edinburgh









“
This is a good location to experience Old Town Edinburgh with easy access to New Town and the train station
”






Apex City of Edinburgh Hotel









“
Amazing location in view of Edinburgh Castle. Great access to public transport. Best place for access to the old town.
