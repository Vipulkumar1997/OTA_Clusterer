Rome Travel Guide










Discover the Secrets of the Eternal City
With over two and a half thousand years of history and astonishing classical beauty, Rome truly deserves to be called the Eternal City. From the breath-taking Colosseum to the famous Trevi Fountain, Rome has something for every taste.
Enjoy a freshly brewed espresso on one of the Rome’s popular piazzas and admire the everlasting beauty of frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. Caravaggio’s paintings in Santa Maria del Popolo are a definite must-see.
Rome is also home to the Pantheon, built in 125 AD, the stunning St. Peter’s Basilica as well as another classic, the Roman Forum. Many of the world’s most famous churches, museums and galleries are just around the corner allowing you to have it all.
Make sure you explore the popular Trastevere and its cafes and trattorias, sit down on the Spanish Steps or just relax and enjoy Rome’s picturesque and sunny atmosphere. Rome will surely convince you that it is one of Italy’s gems.
No matter if you’re looking for a room with a view, a cheap hostel or an over-the-top design hotel, Booking.com offers all of them and more. Close proximity to the Termini Train Station, Fiumicino and Ciampino Airports is included.

The juxtaposition of ancient ruins amidst Baroque...

The juxtaposition of ancient ruins amidst Baroque architecture was breathtakingly beautiful. Rome is a very walkable city, and I enjoyed exploring the many side streets and stairs in the different neighborhoods.

I love Rome.

I love Rome. I am a city girl and love the history and energy.  I could stay for a month and not see everything I want to see. Of course, I keep going back to my favorite places time and again. I never miss the Pantheon and the Castro Sant'Angelo.

Nice architecture.

Nice architecture. Must See!Veryyyyyy disappointed with mentality and politeness of Italians from Rome.Shocked how rude they can be to turist. Been in all countires in EU. This is the worst mentality ever!  Trying to trick you ALL THE TIME!Look out for thiefs!Additionaly awful food comparing to South Italy.

Rome is your typical Euro city.

Rome is your typical Euro city. You have to see all the usual touristy sites. Usual crowds. We only had a week this time so hard to explore much more than those. Warrants a return trip. Not as many outdoor cafes as I thought, as compared to, say, my recent visit to Poland. No "old town" area.

Loved everything!

Loved everything! We walked everywhere from Trastevere where we stayed. The location is amazing in a beautiful old part of Rome. There are restaurants and cafes on every corner. Try all the traditional Roman dishes. They are great, especially the fried artichoke.

There is no place as beautiful as the sights you will see in...

There is no place as beautiful as the sights you will see in Rome. The people are wonderful. And you can walk or take a bus(cheap) to any sights. Getting around is easy. You will love the sidewalk cafes(great food).








Hotels That Guests Love in Rome





Hotel Victoria









“
We used this hotel as are base to travel all through Italy it was great Central Rome area
”






MyRooms San Pietro









“
Location of the place was excellent few minutes from the metro station & bus and very close to the Vatican city. We could see the Vatican museum from our window.Rooms were clean and big. It is note to mention that breakfast was also very nice. Staff was helpful and kind. They even let us for late check out.In our Italy tour we stayed many hotels but non of them was good as this one.
”






Hotel Villa Torlonia









“
I had the pleasure of staying in Rome for my first night in Italy. This 4 star hotel didn't feel quite 4 star. Definitely is not at the standard of other 4 stars. Good location though and very clean.
”






Hotel Castelfidardo









“
This was my second time in this hotel after spending two weeks in other cities of Italy and I now have a more favourable opinion of this place when comparing it with the other hotels I stayed in. It is close enough both to the train station and to the historic sites. The air conditioner is really nice after a full day of walking in Rome during summer!
”






Ostello Des Artistes









“
Close to train terminal. Good connections and transport. This hostel is a mix of hostel and hotel. The room i had was very good, big for two persons. No ambience.Very close to a supermarket (no too big) but you can buy meals and put it hot in the microwave. You have a fridge to put your meals. This is a bonus considering that is Rome. In general is a good deal considering the ridiculuous prices of Rome. Consider that, like in whole Italy, you have to pay extra for a municipal tax.
