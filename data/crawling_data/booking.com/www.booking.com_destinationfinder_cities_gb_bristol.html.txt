Things to Do in Bristol









St Mary Redcliffe Church

“The fairest, goodliest and most famous parish church in England” is how Elizabeth I once described St Mary Redcliffe Church. She was right to be so gushing – it’s a Gothic masterpiece, all spindly buttresses and pointy windows, and the spire stretches heavenwards like a pencil scribbling on the clouds. Come with a camera and see if you agree with Good Queen Bess’ assessment.



12 Colston Parade, Avon, Bristol BS1 6RA, United Kingdom




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00-17:00









St Nicholas Market

This covered market is packed with stalls selling a dizzying range of items. Kitsch homeware, amusing postcards, dusty vinyls, trippy hippy hoodies… the one thing St Nick’s specialises in is diversity. Even if you’re not in a buying mood, head down for lip-smacking cuisine, from classic pie to tangy tagines. Foodies shouldn’t miss the farmers’ market on Wednesdays.



The Glass Arcade | The Exchange, Bristol BS1 1HT, England




Open Monday-Saturday 09:30-17:00









Bristol Cathedral

Fancy an uplifting experience? Head to Bristol Cathedral around mid-afternoon for choral evensong, when heavenly voices intertwine and echo off the ceiling’s soaring vaults. It’s the best time of day to enjoy this magnificent neo-Gothic building, which is full of intricate details like carved wooden pews, a rose window and well-preserved stonework from Anglo-Saxon times.



College Green, Bristol BS1 5TJ, United Kingdom




Open Monday-Sunday 08:00-17:00









Castle Park

Sun’s out? Must be picnic time! This park is Bristol’s go-to spot for an al-fresco nibble. This park is dotted with trees and sculptures, and St Peter’s Church stands in the middle. It had its roof and windows bombed out during WWII, and the remaining Gothic arches frame snippets of sky and greenery. Look out for the ruins of the 11th-century castle that give the park its name.



Castle St, Thornbury, Bristol, South Gloucestershire BS35 1HB, United Kingdom









Cabot Tower

Off we go! Cabot Tower sits atop Brandon Hill and looks out over the city. It was built in the 19th century, and was named after discoverer John Cabot. He set sail from Bristol in 1497 on his way to North America, and founded colonies in Newfoundland. Huff and puff up the staircase and gasp as you gaze out over the tower's peerless panoramas.



Brandon Hill Park, Great George St, Harbourside, Bristol BS1 5RR, United Kingdom




Open Monday-Sunday 08:00-17:00









Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery

No matter how much of a brainbox you are, there’s always more to learn. This museum covers the span of planet earth’s history, from some locally discovered dinosaur skeletons right up to the abstract spatterings of modern art. Wander its corridors and feed your mind. Keep an eye out for Alfred the gorilla, a 1930s celebrity who’s now a beloved mascot of the city.



Queens Rd, Bristol BS8 1RL, United Kingdom




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00









The Matthew

Shiver me timbers! On this replica 15th-century ship, you can sail the waters of the River Avon just like an explorer of old. The Matthew is a working reconstruction of the little caravel that John Cabot sailed on his way to discovering parts of North America in 1497. Enthusiastic volunteers spin the yarn as you sail, and tip-top fish and chips complete the nautical experience.



51 Redcliff St, Bristol, City of Bristol BS1 6LP, United Kingdom




Open Tuesday-Sunday 10:00-16:00









University of Bristol

What do Prince Albert of Monaco, James Blunt and mathematician Paul Dirac have in common? They’ve all studied at Bristol University, of course! Bristol is one of England’s leading universities, which opened for class in 1876. Feel young and happy-go-lucky again by rubbing shoulders with the fresh-faced students. For views over the city, whizz up the Wills Memorial Building.



Senate House, Tyndall Ave, Bristol, City of Bristol BS8 1TH, United Kingdom









Banksy Grafitti

Banksy is one of Bristol’s most loved sons. Dripping in subversive wit, his distinctive street art took graffiti from a fringe art form and catapulted it into the mainstream. It was here, in his hometown, that a young Bansky cut his artistic and comic teeth. Get the skinny with a walking tour of his cheeky vignettes, which are dotted around the city.



80 Stokes Croft, Bristol BS1 3QY, England









Clifton Suspension Bridge

Isambard Kingdom Brunel. What a name, what a guy. This giant of civil engineering changed the face of 19th-century Britain with his dockyards, railways and ships. Clifton Suspension Bridge is one of his crowning achievements. It soars a hundred meters above the Avon Gorge, with two stone towers linked by a giant iron chain. Wander across for unparalleled views of the valley.

A bit left wing. Slogans and graffiti everywhere.  People constantly coming up to you asking for money. Nice places to eat, but you had to walk quite a distance to get to the particular areas.

Popular Neighborhoods in Bristol












Bristol Old City


21 properties

The Old City packs a lot into a small area. These cobbled streets ooze history – take a heritage tour to learn about what the Normans did for Bristol a millennium ago. Grab a bargain at St Nicholas Market, and sip a spot of scrumpy in Bristol Cider Shop. Cap it off with dinner aboard a boat, at The Glassboat or Three Brothers Burger restaurants.

Accommodations in Bristol Old City













Clifton


18 properties

A class apart. Clifton is an upmarket bubble of Georgian housing, lush parks and cutesy antique dealers. Pick up retro home-ware from Abode, seek out shiny bangles in Bees & Graves and go vintage at Clifton Vintage Boutique. Sink a pint in style at the White Lion, whose terrace looks out over the Avon Gorge and Clifton Suspension Bridge.

Accommodations in Clifton













Temple


6 properties

Knights of the boardroom table. Temple takes its name from the Temple Church, built by the Knights Templar in the 12th century. Today you’re more likely to see pin-stripe suits than suits of armour – the area’s been invaded by swanky law firms and zingy start-ups. Mosey along to Yurt Lush for a hipster lunch inside a shipping container.

Accommodations in Temple













Old Market


5 properties

A Bohemian air blows through Old Market. Kooky independent shops like J’s Unique Boutique or Global Collectables line the area’s well-preserved streets. This district’s home to some of the city’s oldest buildings, like St Jude’s Church and Palace Hotel. If you like your nightlife free and fab, flounce down to West Street.

Accommodations in Old Market













Broadmead


4 properties

Shopaholics flock to Broadmead. This district echoes with the “ker-ching” of cash registers, as bag-laden visitors pick up high-street fashion at H&M; and TK Maxx, and spruce up their wardrobes at Thomas Pink and The White Company. In need of a breather? Rest your weary legs on the lawns of grassy Castle Park. Get your wallet ready!

Accommodations in Broadmead













Harbourside


4 properties

Harbourside is a classic case of docklands-turned-trendy hotspot. Once upon a time, it was the beating heart of Bristol’s tobacco industry, but these days it’s home to hip eateries, funky museums and rocketing real estate. Trawl through Bristolian history at M-Shed Museum, gasp at the SS Great Britain and take a river cruise aboard the Matthew.

Accommodations in Harbourside











Local Tips for Bristol







The Louisiana Bar




by Terrie

Born-and-bred Bristolian Terrie loves her hometown's passion for live music and events.


The Louisiana is a local hot-spot for live music. It promotes up-and-coming bands, and past acts have included Muse and Bloc Party back before they were big. Though small in size, it has a great atmosphere and it's a short stroll away from Bristol harbourside and other pubs and clubs.

The Louisiana, Wapping Rd, Bathurst Terrace, Bristol BS1 6UA, United Kingdom

Open Monday-Saturday 17:30-23:00, Sunday-12:00-22:30








Cheddar Gorge X-Treme




by Max

Family man and skydiver Max spends his free time seeking out the best adrenaline highs.


Drive south for less than an hour from Bristol and you'll end up in Cheddar Gorge, an adventurer’s playground. Here you can go caving, rock climbing and hiking among the narrow cliffs that dot this landscape. If rock climbing isn't your thing, the caves are also beautiful to walk through.

Illusions




by Steven

Numbers man Steven can often be found counting cards at a casino or dividing a round at the bar.


For a night out with a twist, head to Illusions, where its bars double as magic show stages. Grab a seat and let your mixologist whip up a cocktail while distracting you with a myriad of card tricks and sleight-of-hand. Shazam!

Undercover Rock




by Kirsten

Kirsten spent many years in the West Country, where she developed her love of hiking and climbing.


For an adrenaline-filled day out without leaving the city, head to Undercover Rock in Mina Road. The team have completely converted the 15th-century St Werburgh’s Church into a covert indoor climbing centre – you can even climb up the spire!

Bristol Harbourside




by Louise

Growing up in Somerset, Louise always enjoyed visiting nearby Bristol for its hustle and bustle.


Bristol Harbourside docks offers various boat trips. Bristol Packet boat company do day trips to Bath and Beeses’ tea gardens and 45-minute tours of the docks. There's a bar on deck and you learn all sorts of interesting facts about the River Avon and Bristol’s industrial and maritime past.

What should you avoid to make the most of the nightlife in Bristol?

The 'triangle' at the top of Park street has some lovely spots for a cocktail, including a few secret bars to discover. They are expensive but worth finding as the environment is lovely and no rowdy hen or stag parties.

Transportation





Bristol Transportation









Air- Bristol Airport



Bristol has a little airport that flies to various international destinations around Europe. To get into town from the airport, you can take the Airport Flyer bus - the stop is located just outside the terminal. At peak times, it leaves every 8 minutes. A single ticket costs GBP 11 and the journey takes around 30 minutes. You can book online or get it from the driver on board. The flyer stops at several points in the city, including Temple Meads and the Bus Station.




Bristol Airport
www.bristolairport.co.uk











Train



As a relatively small city, Bristol doesn't have an inner-city train network. However, Bristol Temple Meads Station is a major hub for travel outside the city. There's a direct train to London Paddington, which only takes 1 hour and 45 minutes, and you can get to Manchester Piccadilly in 3 hours. You can buy tickets from the machines at the entrance or just head to the ticket office, which is open until 21:30 every day. You can also buy tickets online.




First Great Western
www.nationalrail.co.uk











Bus



Bristol's bus network covers most of the city, and given the hilliness of the place, it can be a real life saver. The buses are run by First, and they're white with a pink and purple trim. You can buy single tickets for between GBP 1 and GBP 3.50, depending on the distance. Alternatively there are day tickets for GBP 4.40, or 10-journey tickets for GBP 19. You can buy tickets on the bus.




First Group
www.firstgroup.com











Ferry



The River Avon runs right through Bristol, and there are whole districts that are on the riverfront. There's a ferry service that goes round the Floating Harbour, taking people to and from seventeen different stops. It's a community-run service with a really friendly atmosphere, as well as being a cool way to move around town!




Bristol Ferry
www.bristolferry.com











Taxi



If you need to get from A to B quickly, taxi is probably the best way to do it. You'll be able to spot them by their distinctive blue colour. You can hail them in the street or call and book. There are also taxi ranks around the city, including at Bristol Temple Meads Station. Price is always calculated using the meter, which should show zero when you get in.




Taxi Bristol
www.taxibristol.co.uk











Car



Bristol has a lot of car parks dotted around the city, although it's generally recommendable to park outside the centre and take public transport in. This is because there's usually plenty of traffic in the city centre, as well as some slightly confusing one-way systems and bus lanes.
