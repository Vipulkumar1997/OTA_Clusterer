Doha Travel Guide










Qatar's Pearl on the Gulf
The ultra-modern Doha is best known for its busy airport, impressive skyline and stunning waterfront. With plenty of newly built sports facilities, large shopping venues and growing commercial centers, Doha is a true representative of the fast-developing Qatar.
From its old souqs (open-air markets) to new shopping malls, Doha is home to half of Qatar’s population. Pearl Qatar, which is a commercial, residential, recreational and tourist complex, reflects the vibrant expansion and growth of the city. A highlight of Doha is Al-Corniche, a long seaside promenade that curves around Doha Bay offering stunning views of Palm Tree Island and the city's skyscrapers.
Due to the population diversity, a large variety of cuisines are available ranging from Indian to Italian, American and, of course, Middle Eastern. For travelers wanting an alcoholic drink, alcohol is only available in bars attached to international hotels.
Perched on a stand-alone island, The Museum of Islamic Art is a showpiece of the world’s most complete collection of Islamic artifacts, and the first of its kind in the Gulf area. For day excursions, Doha Zoo features a variety of animals, including the Oryx, Qatar's national animal. Aladdin's Kingdom is an amusement park located in the West Bay.
Booking.com has a variety of self-contained apartments, luxurious hotels and resorts, overlooking the picturesque Gulf and near Doha International Airport.

A safe city but not pretty much to see.

A safe city but not pretty much to see. Hope there will be a reliable public transport to get around more easily. Now we only could rely on taxis but the traffic jam could be terrible.I like the atmosphere of the souq waqif especially at nite.

Safe and relaxing.

Safe and relaxing. For me, safetiness of the guest in the country is more important. I mean, you can take your mobile anywhere not to be afraid that someone may steal it. You can just put your wallet in your pocket, can walk around even your bag is open, and finally no tax, what price you get on the display, thats the price you gonna pay, no hodden extras.

Hotels That Guests Love in Doha





The Ritz-Carlton, Doha









“
We stayed in this hotel for 4 days and 3 nights to celebrate my son's birthday. (We've been to different 5 Star hotels). But our experience in Ritz Carlton is different. Kuddos to all Staff of Ritz Carlton-Doha. You guys are amazing...thoughtful and sweet...keep it up!
”






DoubleTree by Hilton Doha Old Town









“
New hotel great staff
”






Ezdan Hotel Doha









“
The buffet breakfast is really good. The location allows you to go everywhere we wish. Almost all services can be found right in the hotel: money exchange, supermarket, restaurant, swimming pools, etc. And all of this comes with the best price per night: it was almost 2 times cheaper in comparison with the most of the hotels around Sheraton! But it does not affect the great quality of this hotel.Additionally, I liked the fact that I lived on 34 floor) The view was really beautiful.
”






The Westin Doha Hotel & Spa









“
A brand new hotel...very luxurious..food super..Rooms state of art..SPA wo0ow
”






Zubarah Hotel









“
Zubarah is a new hotel with an beautiful decoration and excellent staff. we got a room with  classic Twin Room that was really clean and organized. The room decorations will make you get you conformable quickly. Overall the hotel is great value for your money. it's highly recommend and I would book rooms with me again.
