Things to Do in Dublin









General Post Office (GPO)

Well, you can buy stamps at Dublin’s General Post Office (universally known as the GPO), but this landmark is better known for the more bloodthirsty fact that it was here, in Easter 1916, that republican rebels faced the might of the British Army. You can’t miss its magnificent Greek-style portico. The three statues are Mercury, Hibernia and Fidelity.



O’Connell St Lower, Dublin 1, Ireland









Temple Bar

Trip across the River Liffey on the delightful Ha’penny Bridge to Temple Bar – Dublin’s cultural nerve centre. Spot the brightest star in Ireland’s galaxy of contemporary artists at the Project Arts Centre; tap your foot along with the catchiest traditional tune at the TradFest; and press your nose against shop windows where you can buy just about anything under the sun.



Temple Bar, Dublin 2, Ireland









Trinity College

Modelled on Oxford and Cambridge, Trinity College was founded in 1592 in the heart of the city centre. Among its most illustrious graduates are Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, Samuel Beckett, Bram Stoker, Edmund Burke and Mary Robinson. Mingle with today’s star students in the quad, then queue to see the exquisite “Book of Kells” – the four Gospels handcrafted by medieval monks.



College Green, Dublin 2, Ireland




Open Monday–Friday 09:00–17:00.









Dublin Castle

There’s been an occupied castle on the same site in the city centre since 1204 AD – so imagine how much history it’s seen! The nucleus of British rule in Ireland until 1922, it now hosts state dinners and international conferences. The lavish “state apartments” are open to the public by guided tour. You might even recognise them as the backdrops of some major movies.



Dame Street, Dublin 2, Ireland




Open Monday–Saturday 09:45-16:45, Sunday 12:00-16:45









The Old Jameson Distillery

“Sláinte!” A visit to Dublin wouldn’t be complete without toasting your health at a traditional whiskey distillery. There’s been one bubbling away on this very spot off Smithfield Square since 1780. Follow the entire process from grain to glass, see the original vats through the glass floor, and become an instant connoisseur at the tutored whiskey tastings.



Bow Street, Smithfield Village, Dublin 7, Ireland




Open Monday–Saturday 09:00–18:00, Sunday 10:00–18:00.









St. Patrick's Cathedral

It’s Ireland’s largest church with a 43-metre high spire. And that’s not its only claim to fame: the satirist, Jonathan Swift, author of “Gulliver’s Travels”, was Dean here from 1713 to 1745. Built in the Gothic style, it was completed in 1191, though the Lady Chapel was added around 1270. For the perfect acoustic treat, take time out to listen to some organ music here.



St Patrick's Close, Dublin 8, Ireland




Open Monday-Friday 09:30-17:00, Saturday 09:00-17:00, Sunday 09:00-18:00.









Croke Park Stadium

Ireland’s dynamic national games are Gaelic football and hurling. And the home of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) is Croke Park in the suburb of Drumcondra. After an enormous €260-million redevelopment, it’s now Europe’s fourth-largest stadium with a capacity of more than 80,000. It’s also a major music venue, hosting bands such as U2, The Script and One Direction.



Jones' Road, Dublin 3, Ireland




Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Grand Canal

More than 130 kilometres long, the Grand Canal runs from the old Dublin suburb of Ringsend to the River Shannon in the west. It’s not used by working barges any more, but it remains one of south Dublin’s beauty spots. Do what the Dubliners do – find a bench by one of the locks and share your lunch with the ducks … or if you’re the energetic type, walk, cycle or canoe it!



Grand Canal Dock, Dublin 4, Ireland









Guinness Storehouse

If you’re a fan of dramatic buildings, how about this: the Guinness Storehouse is a glass atrium on seven floors in the shape of a pint of Guinness. Each floor tells part of the brewing tale, starting with its four ingredients – water, barley, hops and yeast. The tale ends at the Gravity Bar on the seventh floor, with spectacular views over the city and a drink in hand …



St James's Gate, Dublin 8, Ireland




Open Monday–Sunday 09:30–17:00.









Dublin Zoo

With almost a million visitors every year, Dublin Zoo is one of the city’s most popular attractions. And why wouldn’t it be, with a fabulous array of birds, reptiles, giraffes, ostriches, white rhinos, lions and even gorillas – all spread over 28 glorious hectares of Phoenix Park. Its famous tearooms were built in 1898, and have since been joined by the Meerkat Restaurant!



Phoenix Park, Dublin 8, Ireland




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30–18:00.









Harcourt Street

Just when you think the party's momentum is starting to die down, you end up on Harcourt Street. This mile-long stretch off St. Stephen’s Green is home to a handful of clubs that are favorites with students, shift workers and generally all late-night barflies. After a summer gig in the Iveagh Gardens, try Coppers or Krystle to keep the party mood going.








Grafton Street

When the stores of Dublin’s prime shopping street close for the day, the side-street pubs around it are just getting started. Head to Kehoe’s for a smooth pint in a genuine old pub setting, or try The International comedy bar for a laugh. If you’re a true rocker, swing by Bruxelles to pay tribute to Thin Lizzy singer Phil Lynott – his statue stands right outside the bar.








George's Street

As you stroll along George’s Street by day, there’s so much to take in while admiring its well-kept Victorian storefronts. By night, its diverse eateries, pubs and clubs are equally satisfying. Take your pick from the quaint, old-world vibes of The Long Hall pub, the disco-thump of the rainbow-flagged George nightclub, or the music-free and chatter-filled Market tapas bar.








Merrion Row

Who’s up for a classic bar crawl? Merrion Row’s watering holes are renowned haunts for politicians, journalists and celebrities. You can even catch all three mingling in the Shelbourne Hotel’s glitzy Horseshoe Bar. Soccer and rugby fans love to fuel up for a big game at Doheny & Nesbitt, and O’Donoghue’s traditional Irish music sessions are the stuff legends are made of.








Vicar Street

This intimate club is a favorite spot for top music and comedy acts. Bob Dylan and Neil Young both played legendary “secret gigs” at Vicar Street, and Irish comic Tommy Tiernan once completed a 104-night run here. The bar’s usually packed, so head to Arthur’s nearby for a few pints before showtime – it’s the closest pub to the Guinness brewery.








The Grand Social

If you like the idea of eclectic music in a circus-chic setting, get ready for The Grand Social. You're guaranteed a wonderful time under its tented roof. You can catch live bands upstairs, go for electro-ska club nights downstairs, or watch the world go by in the front bar – it looks out over Dublin’s iconic Ha’penny Bridge.








JJ Smyth’s

Three hundred years of entertainment – the name might have changed over time, but this site has still had a pub since 1734! Today you can soak up the old-timey vibes and raise a glass to Irish poet Thomas Moore (he was born upstairs). Then kick back to the smooth sounds of top jazz and blues bands, plus get to know the chatty locals over a few drinks.








The Button Factory

There’s no hiding place for performers here. Soulful acoustic balladeers, beat-busting DJs, and ear-ringing metal bands all meet the whites of their audiences’ eyes in this tiny venue. Whether you want to discover unknown acts or mingle with strangers, you’ll fit right in with the friendly, tight-knit crowd at The Button Factory.








Cobblestone Pub

Jigs, reels, and one of whatever you’re having. Located on Smithfield’s old market square, this cozy Cobblestone is the home of traditional music in Dublin. It’s run by a family of fiddlers and uilleann pipers, so you’re guaranteed an authentic session. Drop in any night of the week for everything from sean-nós singing to bluegrass hoedowns.








The Wright Venue

Can’t get enough of clubbin’ in Dublin? This three-tier club is only ten minutes from the airport, so you can party late and still catch your flight home. The main floor hosts top DJs like Nicky Romero and special guests like Rihanna. If you want some VIP treatment, try the roof terrace for 5-star champagne and private cabanas.








Whelan’s

This is without a doubt the home of live music in Dublin. Tons of local and international acts built their careers on playing standing-ovation shows in Whelan’s snug back bar. Upstairs, you can catch everything from indie club nights and silent discos, to singer-songwriter shows – with a late license every night of the week as the cherry on top.








Irish Craft Beer Festival

Brewed, bottled and kegged in Ireland. This three-day festival celebrates the country’s best independent breweries, along with some special international guests. Whether you like chocolatey stouts, bittersweet IPAs or gluten-free lagers, there’s something for all everyone. Throw in some live music and top-notch food, and you've got yourself a real party.








St. Patrick's Day Festival

Where better to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day than in Dublin? Ireland’s capital puts on quite a party, with a four-day festival on either end of the country’s national day. On March 17th, join groups of partiers covered in green and cheer on the colorful floats and marching bands as they wind their way through the city. Then hit the cobblestone streets of Temple Bar for a pint and some live Irish music.








Against the Grain Pub

Located in the hip and always-cool Camden Street area, this modern pub is a beer-lover’s paradise. Its walls are stacked with bottle upon bottle of international brews, with only the finest Irish craft beer on tap. Sit yourself down on a stool and ask the helpful bar staff for their top picks.








57 The Headline Pub

Irish pub grub at its finest. The Headline bar has made headlines for its take on traditional food. You can dig in to everything from lamb kofta burgers to sea trout salads, and wash it all down with craft beers from every corner of Ireland. If you're looking for something stronger, try a tasting tray of whiskey, gin or vodka produced by local independent distilleries.








Porterhouse Temple Bar

There’s more to Irish beer than Guinness. Long before it was in style, the Porterhouse was brewing its own sturdy stouts and hoppy ales. Stop in and order a sampler tray to find your favorite brew. The pub’s just on the edge of Temple Bar, so you can either start your night here or get away later from the tourist crowds.








The Brew Dock Bar

Close to Connolly Station and Dublin’s rejuvenated docklands, this busy bar is a popular after-work spot for commuters in suits and laid-back students. The 3Arena is just along the docks, so you can easily spend a couple hours here before a gig. How does juicy beef stew, craft-brewed porter and a few rounds of Jenga sound?








The Brazen Head

Locals have been sipping pints in the Brazen Head since 1198. Laden with history, Dublin’s oldest pub can count Irish revolutionary Wolfe Tone and literary rebel James Joyce among its past patrons. Sneak inside this old-timey stone building to chat with modern-day Dubs, and enjoy a magical night of storytelling, traditional music, and tasty pub grub!








O’Donoghue’s Suffolk Street

Ask any Dubliner where to go for a good pint and a chat and O’Donoghue’s will be one of the top answers. This pub’s distinctive black-and-white roof beckons you inside, away from the shopping bustle of Grafton Street. It’s the kind of place where you’ll easily strike up a conversation with a friendly local – and suddenly wonder where the time went!








Anseo

Anseo prides itself on being unpretentious. It’s a laid-back watering hole where people come to mingle with like-minded souls, listen to great music, and just have a good time. Start your weekend off with a bang, or head here in the middle of the week and get to know the friendly regulars over a couple of casual pints.








The Temple Bar

Find your spot at the bar and get in line for your own dose of "craic" in Dublin’s buzzing historic and party-filled downtown area. The Irish are known for their charm and conversation, so you’re in the right place to find a bar playing folk music, or a pub full of partiers from home and abroad.








Cliffs of Moher

Dublin is only a few hours from Ireland’s wild western coast. Take advantage of the Emerald Isle’s pint-sized geography and hop on a day tour to the majestic Cliffs of Moher. Reaching heights of over 200 metres, this 8 km-long rugged precipice loftily overlooks the powerful Atlantic Ocean. Head to the tourist office on Suffolk Street for independent advice on which tour to take.








Historical Walking Tours of Dublin

Natives, Norsemen and Normans. This popular walking tour lets you uncover the fascinating history of Dublin, from its foundation as a Viking village in 988 AD to its 20th-century status as capital of an independent Ireland. You’ll visit the site of the city’s first settlement at Temple Bar, the medieval Christ Church Cathedral and Dublin Castle, a former bastion of British rule.








Medieval City of Kilkenny

Castles, cathedrals and craft shops. Just 90 minutes from Dublin, Kilkenny makes for a great day trip. You can trace the city’s history through its buildings, from the 9th-century Celtic round tower by St Canice’s Cathedral, to the imperious medieval edifice of Kilkenny Castle –a lasting footprint of Norman occupation that now houses the National Craft Gallery and workshops.








The Wall of Fame

Irish artists have shaped the face of modern music – and this local landmark celebrates the best and brightest of them. Located outside the Rock ‘N’ Roll Museum in bustling Temple Bar, the Wall of Fame showcases homegrown stars from U2 to Van Morrison. Pose beside your favourite singer’s photo for a memorable souvenir shot.








Marsh's Library

Dedicated bookworms will delight in a visit to Dublin’s oldest public library. First opened in 1707, this well-kept city secret is tucked away in tranquil gardens next to Saint Patrick’s Cathedral. Take a guided tour for a true taste of the treasures contained in its 25,000-strong collection of historical books and manuscripts.








Temple Bar Area

Buzzing with life at any time of day or night, Temple Bar is never short of action. This densely packed slice of Dublin city centre has earned a reputation as a cultural hub. Restaurants and bars line its quaint cobbled streets, while quirky craft shops and food stalls spill into alleyways and courtyards.








Georgian Dublin

Tall townhouses line leafy streets and squares in this south-eastern section of Dublin city centre. Dating back to the 18th century, these red-brick buildings now house museums, restaurants and upmarket offices. The scenic stretch between Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square is perfect for a stroll – keep an eye out for picture-postcard façades, ornate windows and colourful front doors along the way.








O’Donoghue’s

Dating back to 1799, this cosy watering hole is tucked behind an unassuming façade near St. Stephen’s Green. The place fills up quickly, but  squeeze in to grab a spot by the bar and enjoy the nightly music sessions.  There are regular appearances from fiddles, bodhran drums and uilleann pipes and the this lively joint is where popular band, The Dubliners (one of Ireland’s favourite bands) made their name.








McDaid’s

A true Dublin locale, this haunt had a rather more morbid start to life as the city’s morgue. A favourite of poet Brendan Behan, the watering hole is famed for its ‘gift of the gab’ and its strong literary connections. It was even the setting for James Joyce’s short story, ‘Grace’. Nowadays it’s full of life, packing in the students, visitors and long-standing locals.

Popular Neighborhoods in Dublin












Temple Bar


84 properties

In the days before the Celtic Tiger economy, penniless artists lived in Temple Bar. Now this web of narrow streets, bang in the city centre, is a mix of art galleries, restaurants, pubs and music venues. Handel’s Messiah was first performed here in 1742. Cow’s Lane has a Saturday fashion and design market – there’s a surprise round every corner …

Accommodations in Temple Bar













Ballsbridge


57 properties

With its grand Victorian houses and leafy avenues, this is the heart of well-heeled Dublin. This is where you’ll find many diplomatic outposts, including the landmark US Embassy, a striking circular building with echoes of Celtic design. For echoes of the sporting kind, just down the road you’ll find Lansdowne Road, the home of Irish rugby.

Accommodations in Ballsbridge













Saint Stephen's Green


53 properties

If shopping is your bag, start from St Stephen’s Green – and make elegant and affable Shelbourne Hotel your campaign headquarters. Grafton Street has all the luxury boutiques your wallet can bear. Dawson Street adds restaurants. And believe it or not, the Irish parliament, Trinity College and the National Gallery are all in the same square mile.

Accommodations in Saint Stephen's Green













Parnell Square


28 properties

Cross the River Liffey to O’Connell Street, which runs all the way to Parnell Square. Here you’ll see monuments dedicated to two very different Dublins: the GPO, with its Greek-style porticos, is where Irish independence was won in 1916; while the 398-foot stainless steel Spire of Dublin was completed in 2003 as a salute to Ireland’s new prosperity.

Accommodations in Parnell Square













Drumcondra


25 properties

There’s a lot to see on these classic Dublin suburban streets – including the Gaelic games stadium, Croke Park, which towers over much of Drumcondra. Start at Fagan’s Pub, local haunt of former Taoiseach (Irish for “Prime Minister”), Bertie Ahern. It was here he brought US President, Bill Clinton, in September 1998. See the photo on the wall.

Accommodations in Drumcondra













Rathmines


19 properties

Dublin has a plethora of vibrant little village-style suburbs on the outskirts, with a splendid mix of redbrick Victorian and Edwardian mansions and terraces. The “Three Rs” – Rathmines, Rathgar and Ranelagh – are on the south side and rank among the best of them. The majestic Grand Canal flows through all three, less than 5km from the centre.

Accommodations in Rathmines













Clontarf


3 properties

The first thing Dubliners will tell you about Clontarf is that it’s where Ireland’s last High King, Brian Boru, trounced the Vikings in 1014. The second thing they’ll tell you is that the only battle today is for desirable homes – preferably with views of Dublin Bay. It’s also the perfect setting for a walk in St Anne’s Park or Fairview Park.

Local Tips for Dublin







The Pieman Cafe




by Ben

Songwriter and musician Ben loves travelling. He's also a huge fan of Italian cooking and cinema.

Viking Splash Tours




by Niamh

Niamh lives in peaceful County Wicklow, but loves the excitement of exploring lively Dublin city.


I always recommend that visitors take this tour with a difference – you get the chance to explore Dublin on a "viking boat": basically a floating school bus! It’s an exciting journey along the famous Grand Canal, with a Viking guide who fills you in on the city's vibrant history.

The Powerscourt Shopping Centre




by Bianca

Florida-born Bianca loves to explore: she worked in New Zealand before moving to Dublin 6 years ago.


I recommend visiting the Powerscourt Shopping Centre. It’s inside a townhouse which was once the city retreat of Lord Powerscourt, and most of the exterior and interior of the building remain the same. It’s really neat to see little boutique shops where the bedrooms used to be!

The National Leprechaun Museum




by Vanessa

Even after 10 years living in the USA and Germany, Vanessa always knew she’d come home to Dublin.


When you think of Ireland, you think of leprechauns, right? The National Leprechaun Museum offers guided tours with fascinating storytelling. It’s a great place to learn all about Irish mythology and folklore (not just leprechauns!)

Iveagh Gardens




by Paula

Dublin native Paula loves living within 30 minutes of both the beach and the mountains!


The Iveagh Gardens are one of the least known of Dublin's parks, even though they’re right in the city centre. They were designed in 1865 and have a real “secret garden” feel, with grottos, waterfalls and a maze – great for a quick escape within the city!

Grafton Street




by Julie

Wicklow girl Julie feels lucky to live in the countryside close to Dublin: the best of both worlds!


Grafton Street runs between Saint Stephen's Green and College Green, and is one of Dublin’s two main shopping streets. It’s pedestrianised so it’s a haven for avid shoppers, as well as being a great spot to see talented musicians, poets and mime artists perform in the street performers.

Phoenix Park




by Louise

English-born Louise loves travelling the world but has put down roots since buying a run-down house.


When in Dublin, make sure to take a scenic cycle or stroll through the beautiful Phoenix Park. It's the largest inner-city park in Europe, and is also home to Dublin Zoo and the house of the president of Ireland.

Local girl Sarah has just swapped Dublin for London. She loves baking, shopping and partying.


You should definitely visit George's Street Arcade! It’s filled with boutique shops and stalls selling jewellery, souvenirs and other homemade goodies. It’s quite small but it’s perfect for a little wander around, and it’s only a 5-minute walk from Grafton Street and Temple Bar.

Temple Bar Markets




by Diana

Diana’s originally from Germany but after 8 years in Dublin, she can't imagine living anywhere else.


The Temple Bar markets take place at the weekend in the small, cobbled streets of Temple Bar – one of the oldest parts of the city. There’s a food market, a book market and a Designer Mart that are all worth a visit!

Meeting House Square/Temple Bar Square/Cow's Lane, Temple Bar, Dublin 2, Ireland

Glasnevin Cemetery Museum




by Dave

Family man Dave is a proud Dubliner who loves immersing himself in the culture of his native city.


It may seem odd to visit a graveyard as a tourist, but Glasnevin Cemetery is beautiful, gothic and intriguing. It’s the final resting place for many of Ireland’s most influential sons and daughters: the on-site museum tells their story, and in the process, the history of Ireland itself.

Ha'penny Bridge




by Tom

Shopaholic Tom enjoys travelling, listening to good music and spending time with friends.


You can’t leave Dublin without a photo of the Ha’penny Bridge, a beloved local landmark. This charming little bridge is especially pretty when lit up at night – you can use it to cross the River Liffey, then head to the Ha’penny Bridge Inn for a pint.

I had two mishaps while in Dublin. One was the loss of my driver's license and credit cards, which I already described. The other was losing my balance and tumbling in a busy intersection, landing right in front of a bus. A number of people stopped to help me up and gather my things, but one young woman in particular took charge of me. She steered me to the nearest coffee shop for a cup of hot tea (Irish panacea). She stayed with me until my nerves were steadier and then walked me to a pharmacy for a few things to take care of my scrapes and bruises before leaving. When I got back to my hotel, the receptionist noticed my bedraggled appearance and asked if there was anything she could do to help. Shortly after I went up to my room, she appeared with a bottle of wine and her wishes that it would give me a more pleasant evening. I think that's amazing treatment from two total strangers!

How can you enjoy the sights in Dublin while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


It sounds obnoxious and annoying, but I purchased my ticket to & from the airport along with a 2 day hop on/hop off bus ride. So touristy, I know - but - it's a great way to spend time seeing the city if you have to wait to check into your hotel/hostel or if you are trying to acclimate to the time difference but are too tired to walk or figure out where to walk on a map. You ride easily into town and then on O'Connell street, change to the hop on/hop off bus, where you swipe your bus card over the reader to validate, grab a pair of headphones (or not) - sometimes it's a live guide - and you get a great lay of the land very quickly. I rode both the city and dockside tours, and then felt I really understood the layout of Dublin for further exploring on foot. It can seem cheesy, but I think it's helpful.

What should you avoid to make the most of the nightlife in Dublin?

As much as it is heralded, I would avoid Temple Bar. It's not a realistic representation of Dublin nightlife, and you will pay a premium for drinks, with prices in some pubs rising at varying times through the night.

Dublin International Airport is less than 15 km north of the city centre and is easily accessible by bus. Aircoach, a 24-hour shuttle bus, costs EUR 7 when paying directly at the bus stop or EUR 6 if booked online in advance. Journey time is approximately 30 minutes. Dublin Bus also runs the Airlink 747 service, which costs EUR 6 and takes about 45 minutes. Tickets can be bought from the Travel Information desk in Terminal 1 or from ticket machines at the bus stops.

Train



Train travel in Ireland is relatively efficient but is limited to major towns and cities. Trains to Cork, Belfast and the west coast originate from Dublin's two main stations, Connolly and Heuston. Connolly Station is also a hub for the DART, a local rail line which runs north-south along the Dublin Bay coastline, carrying a mixture of city commuters and daytrippers heading for the beach. DART tickets cost EUR 1.70–EUR 4.35 and can be bought online or at the station.

Bus



Buses are a great way to move around Dublin, with over 100 routes criss-crossing the city. You can pay directly on the bus (EUR 1.80–EUR 3.05 depending on destination, exact change only) or buy a pre-paid ticket offering unlimited travel within 90 minutes, 1 day, or several days. Tickets and Leap top-up cards are available from newsagents all over the city: the Leap Card entitles you to discounted fares and automatically calculates the cheapest ticket for you.

Taxi



Taxis in Dublin are safe and efficient, though not particularly cheap. They're clearly marked with a yellow and blue sign on the roof, and can be hailed in the street, found at a taxi rank or ordered via phone or app. All taxis use the same metered prices: you should find cards in the seat pockets detailing the pricing scale. Initial fares range from EUR 4.10 to EUR 4.45, with an extra charge added for each additional passenger. Payment is generally cash only.










Tram



Luas is the Irish word for 'speed' and these trams are a speedy way to move around Dublin, with two lines spreading out from the city centre to the southern suburbs. Single tickets range from EUR 1.70 to EUR 2.90 depending on distance travelled. If you’ll be travelling frequently, pick up a Leap top-up card and you won’t pay more than EUR 6.40 per day, no matter how many journeys you make. Make sure to check in and out using the card readers at the tram doors.

Bike



Dublin is ideal for cycling: it’s small, flat and has extensive cycle lanes. Grab a bike from one of the many Dublinbikes stations situated throughout the city – bicycles are available between 05:00 and 00:30 daily, and can be dropped off at any time. To use the service, you’ll need to buy a Dublinbikes access card from the card machines found at selected bike stations. A 3-day ticket costs EUR 5 and the first 30 minutes of each journey is free.

Car



Dublin is a small city and is best explored on foot, by bike or using the extensive public transport network. If you do decide to drive, keep in mind that there are lots of one-way streets and that street signs are often hidden away on the corners of buildings. Parking spaces are at a premium: illegally parked cars will quickly be clamped or towed away. It’s also worth noting that petrol stations may not be as easy to find as in other similar-sized cities.
