All the facilities listed under the room type are included in the room price. To see the facilities, just click on the room name. You can see if breakfast or anything else, such as taxes, are included by rolling your cursor over the text in the column called "Conditions." This information will also be in your confirmation email, and can be found in your account when you sign in.

Are the prices shown on Booking.com per person or per room?

Are taxes included in the price?

This depends on the hotel and the room type selected, but it’s easy to see what's included by checking the text under the room name.

Is breakfast included in the price?

What does the crossed out rate mean next to my room type?

In the event of a crossed-out rate, we look at the prices currently being charged by the hotel in the 30-day window around your proposed check-in date. From the prices within this window, we display the third-highest price on offer as the crossed-out rate. To ensure we are making a fair comparison, we always use the same booking conditions (meal plan, cancellation policy and room type). This means that you get the same room for a lower price compared to other check-in dates at the same time of year.

Can I use discount coupons (e.g. issued by magazines, stores, etc.)?

No, you cannot use discount coupons when booking on our website. In such cases you will need to follow the instructions given by the organization issuing the coupon.


Credit Cards

Quick answers to the most common questions from our guests



Can I make a reservation without a credit card?

You'll need a valid credit card to guarantee your reservation with most hotels. However, we are offering an increasing number of hotels that will guarantee your booking without a credit card. You also have the option to book a hotel using someone else’s credit card, provided you have their permission. In this case, when making your reservation please note the cardholder’s name and confirm that you have permission to use their card in the "Special Requests" box.



The property has charged my credit card. What should I do?

The charge you see could be any one of the following:

Pre-authorization:
A pre-authorization is just a validity check that temporarily blocks on your credit card an amount roughly equivalent to the cost of your reservation. The amount will be unblocked after a certain amount of time. How long this takes will depend on the property and your credit card provider.

Deposit or prepayment:
Some properties require a deposit or prepayment at the time of reservation. This policy is clearly highlighted during the reservation process, and you can see it in your confirmation email as well. If your reservation allows for free cancellation, this amount is returned to you if you choose to cancel it.

If you feel you've been charged in error, our Customer Service team is happy to find the best possible solution for you. Please contact us with your reservation number and details of the charge made, and we'll follow up with the property on your behalf.





Can I use a debit card to complete my reservation?

In general, hotels can't accept a debit card to guarantee a booking. However, there are some exceptions. You'll be able see if it is possible during the booking process.



What is a pre-authorization?



When you make a reservation, there may be instances where the hotel will contact your credit (or debit) card company to confirm that the card you are using is valid and hasn’t been reported lost or stolen. At this time, they may also check to see if the card has enough money to cover the transaction. This is communicated in the form of a pre-authorization for the full amount of your reservation.

The hotel, however, will not proceed with the charge. The time at which your card will be charged will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking.





What’s the difference between a pre-authorization and an actual charge to my credit card?

Pre-authorizations are common but are often confused with actual charges. While in-store purchases are immediately charged and deducted from your available balance, pre-authorizations are temporary holds. The length of the hold will vary, and your credit card company can advise you on how they handle this.



How will I know if my card has been pre-authorized?

Your available balance will be reduced temporarily by the full amount of your reservation. You may also see “pending transactions” on your credit card account summary. If you’re not sure if your card has been pre-authorized, both the hotel and your credit card company can verify this.



How long will the pre-authorization hold affect my available balance?

Your card provider can better explain this, along with the general terms and conditions associated with their pre-authorization procedures. These terms vary across the board, so it’s best to contact them for specific details.



Will the hold always equal the exact amount of my reservation?

In most cases, the hotel will pre-authorize your card for the full amount of your reservation. On occasion, you may see an amount slightly higher than the rate shown on Booking.com. If this does happen, the hotel can explain why this has occurred.



Will this happen with all bookings made through Booking.com?

Hotels reserve the right to pre-authorize your card, but this doesn't mean it will occur with every booking. Don’t worry, if your card is pre-authorized, both the hotel and your credit card company are there to help. They may also be able to assist you with removing these holds sooner.



Can I make a reservation for myself using someone else’s credit card?

Yes you can, but only if you have the cardholder's permission. In this case, when making your reservation please note the cardholder’s name and confirm that you have permission to use their card in the "Special Requests" box, and be aware that the hotel may also require authorization from the cardholder. In the case of no-shows/late cancellations, any penalties will be charged to the card provided.



Why do I need to give my credit card details?

In most cases, Booking.com requests credit card details to confirm your reservation with the hotel, on your behalf. Your credit card may be checked (pre-authorized) to ensure that it is valid and/or that sufficient funds are available. After the check, the full amount will be available to you again. In some cases, your credit card details will be used to process the payment for the reservation at the time of booking. Your credit card will only be charged if you have requested a prepaid room or if the cancellation policy, found under "Hotel Policies" and room "conditions" has not been followed.



Which credit cards can I use to complete my booking?

To guarantee a reservation via Booking.com all hotels accept:

MasterCard

Visa





Are my credit card details safe?

Booking.com uses a secure connection for your booking:

Your personal data and credit card details are encrypted.

Our secure server uses "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) technology, the online industry’s standard.

Our SSL certificate has been issued by Thawte.





The credit card that I used to make a reservation is no longer valid. What should I do?

Please contact the hotel directly. You can find their contact information in your confirmation email or online via My Booking.com. For security reasons, never provide your credit card details by email.




Property Policies

Quick answers to the most common questions from our guests



I will be arriving earlier/later than the stated check-in time. Can I still check in?

Usually this is not a problem; you can arrange for an after-hours check-in with most hotels. However, you should always confirm with the hotel. You can use the "Special Requests" box in the booking process to inform them of your estimated arrival time in writing. Once you’ve received your confirmation you can follow up with the hotel directly using the contact information provided.

You can specify your estimated check-in time while making the reservation.

You can manage your booking online to request check-in outside of the standard hours.

You can contact the property directly using the contact details in your booking confirmation.

It's important to remember that the property can't always accommodate these requests.

It's always best to check with the property directly and in advance to avoid confusion.





How can I find a hotel's check-in/check-out times?

How do I get more information about the room or hotel facilities?

I want to check out after the stated check-out time. What should I do?

A late check-out can only be arranged with the hotel and usually depends on availability at the time of your stay. You can ask about the possibility at the front desk upon arrival.



I want a smoking room, but I can only choose a non-smoking room. How can I request a smoking room?

If there are no rooms listed as "smoking rooms," it means that the hotel does not allow smoking in rooms.

Pet policies are always displayed on the hotel’s page under  "Hotel Policies."

If the hotel offers a shuttle service it will be listed under "Hotel Facilities," by "Services." Once you have made your reservation you can arrange the airport shuttle directly with the hotel. The hotel’s contact information is listed in your booking confirmation. Please remember to have your flight details ready.



Can I store my bags at the hotel before check-in or after check-out?

You can see if a hotel offers luggage storage under "Hotel Facilities" on the hotel's page. If you need more information about the hotel's luggage storage facilities, please contact the hotel directly using the contact details provided in your booking confirmation.

We recommend calling the hotel prior to your arrival to guarantee your request. You can find the hotel’s contact information in your confirmation email.








Pricing

What does the price include?

All the facilities listed under the room type are included in the room price. To see the facilities, just click on the room name. You can see if breakfast or anything else, such as taxes, are included by rolling your cursor over the text in the column called "Conditions." This information will also be in your confirmation email, and can be found in your account when you
sign in.
If you don’t have an account, you can
create one here
.


Are the prices shown on Booking.com per person or per room?

The price we show is for the room for the entire length of the stay, unless otherwise stated in the room type and description.


Are taxes included in the price?

This depends on the hotel and the room type selected, but it’s easy to see what's included by checking the text under the room name. Tax requirements change from country to country so it's always good to check.  You can see more detailed information about what is included in the price by moving your cursor over the text in the "Conditions" column. This information will also be in your confirmation email and can be accessed via
My Booking.com
.


Is breakfast included in the price?

This depends on the hotel and the room type. You can see if it's included by checking the text just below the room name. If it's not included, you can move your cursor over the text in the column "Conditions" to find out if it's available and what, if any, the additional costs are. This information will also be included in your confirmation email and at
My Booking.com
.


Do I pay a reservation fee to Booking.com?

No, we don't charge any fees at all.


What does the crossed out rate mean next to my room type?

The crossed-out rate shown for rooms is based on the third highest current price of the Supplier for your product or service with the same booking conditions in a 30-day window around your check-in date (15 days before and 15 days after check-in date; if less than 15 days are between today and the check-in date, we will use the corresponding number of days after the check-in date to result in a 30-day total). To ensure we are making a fair comparison, we always use the same reservation conditions (e.g. meal plan, cancellation policy and room type). This means that you get the same room for a lower price compared to other check-in dates at the same time of year.


Does Booking.com offer any special consideration discounts, or discounts with airline or hotel loyalty cards?

Booking.com provides the best available rates for the dates of your stay. It's not possible to have any further reductions on the price.


Do I pay the full price for my child(ren)?

Information regarding children can be found under "Hotel Policies." Please take note of the following:

Added fees for children, if any, are not included in the reservation price.

During the online booking process, please note your request for any extra beds/cribs in the "Special Requests" box provided.

If you’ve already booked your stay, just click on the link provided in your email confirmation or at
My Booking.com
to request an extra bed.

We suggest calling the hotel prior to arrival to guarantee your request. You will find the hotel’s contact information in your confirmation email.




Can I use discount coupons (e.g. issued by magazines, stores, etc.)?

No, you cannot use discount coupons when booking on our website. In such cases you will need to follow the instructions given by the organization issuing the coupon.


Credit Cards


Can I make a reservation without a credit card?

You'll need a valid credit card to guarantee your reservation with most hotels. However, we are offering an increasing number of hotels that will guarantee your booking
without
a credit card. You also have the option to book a hotel using someone else’s credit card, provided you have their permission. In this case, when making your reservation please note the cardholder’s name and confirm that you have permission to use their card in the "Special Requests" box.



The property has charged my credit card. What should I do?

The charge you see could be any one of the following:

Pre-authorization:
A pre-authorization is just a validity check that temporarily blocks on your credit card an amount roughly equivalent to the cost of your reservation. The amount will be unblocked after a certain amount of time. How long this takes will depend on the property and your credit card provider.

Deposit or prepayment:
Some properties require a deposit or prepayment at the time of reservation. This policy is clearly highlighted during the reservation process, and you can see it in your confirmation email as well. If your reservation allows for free cancellation, this amount is returned to you if you choose to cancel it.

If you feel you've been charged in error, our Customer Service team is happy to find the best possible solution for you. Please
contact us
with your reservation number and details of the charge made, and we'll follow up with the property on your behalf.





Can I use a debit card to complete my reservation?

In general, hotels can't accept a debit card to guarantee a booking. However, there are some exceptions. You'll be able see if it is possible during the booking process.



What is a pre-authorization?

When you make a reservation, there may be instances where the hotel will contact your credit (or debit) card company to confirm that the card you are using is valid and hasn’t been reported lost or stolen. At this time, they may also check to see if the card has enough money to cover the transaction. This is communicated in the form of a pre-authorization for the full amount of your reservation.
The hotel, however, will not proceed with the charge. The time at which your card will be charged will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking.



What’s the difference between a pre-authorization and an actual charge to my credit card?

Pre-authorizations are common but are often confused with actual charges. While in-store purchases are immediately charged and deducted from your available balance, pre-authorizations are temporary holds. The length of the hold will vary, and your credit card company can advise you on how they handle this.



How will I know if my card has been pre-authorized?

Your available balance will be reduced temporarily by the full amount of your reservation. You may also see “pending transactions” on your credit card account summary. If you’re not sure if your card has been pre-authorized, both the hotel and your credit card company can verify this.



How long will the pre-authorization hold affect my available balance?

Your card provider can better explain this, along with the general terms and conditions associated with their pre-authorization procedures. These terms vary across the board, so it’s best to contact them for specific details.



Will the hold always equal the exact amount of my reservation?

In most cases, the hotel will pre-authorize your card for the full amount of your reservation. On occasion, you may see an amount slightly higher than the rate shown on Booking.com. If this does happen, the hotel can explain why this has occurred.



Will this happen with all bookings made through Booking.com?

Hotels reserve the right to pre-authorize your card, but this doesn't mean it will occur with every booking. Don’t worry, if your card is pre-authorized, both the hotel and your credit card company are there to help. They may also be able to assist you with removing these holds sooner.



Can I make a reservation for myself using someone else’s credit card?

Yes you can, but only if you have the cardholder's permission. In this case, when making your reservation please note the cardholder’s name and confirm that you have permission to use their card in the "Special Requests" box, and be aware that the hotel may also require authorization from the cardholder. In the case of no-shows/late cancellations, any penalties will be charged to the card provided.



Why do I need to give my credit card details?

In most cases, Booking.com requests credit card details to confirm your reservation with the hotel, on your behalf. Your credit card may be checked (pre-authorized) to ensure that it is valid and/or that sufficient funds are available. After the check, the full amount will be available to you again. In some cases, your credit card details will be used to process the payment for the reservation at the time of booking. Your credit card will only be charged if you have requested a prepaid room or if the cancellation policy, found under "Hotel Policies" and room "conditions" has not been followed.



Which credit cards can I use to complete my booking?

To guarantee a reservation via Booking.com all hotels accept:

MasterCard

Visa

Some hotels also accept other credit cards for the actual payment of stay; these are indicated during the booking process.



Are my credit card details safe?

Booking.com uses a secure connection for your booking:

Your personal data and credit card details are encrypted.

Our secure server uses "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) technology, the online industry’s standard.

Our SSL certificate has been issued by Thawte.





The credit card that I used to make a reservation is no longer valid. What should I do?

Please contact the hotel directly. You can find their contact information in your confirmation email or online via
My Booking.com
. For security reasons, never provide your credit card details by email.



Property Policies


I will be arriving earlier/later than the stated check-in time. Can I still check in?

Usually this is not a problem; you can arrange for an after-hours check-in with most hotels. However, you should always confirm with the hotel. You can use the "Special Requests" box in the booking process to inform them of your estimated arrival time in writing. Once you’ve received your confirmation you can follow up with the hotel directly using the contact information provided.

You can specify your estimated check-in time while making the reservation.

You can
manage your booking
online to request check-in outside of the standard hours.

You can contact the property directly using the contact details in your booking confirmation.

It's important to remember that the property can't always accommodate these requests. They'll be happy to let you into your room early if possible, but there might not be anyone there in person to welcome you if you arrive late at night at a remote apartment. It's always best to check with the property directly and in advance to avoid confusion.



How can I find a hotel's check-in/check-out times?

Check-in/check-out times differ for each hotel. You can find a specific hotel's check-in/check-out times in the  "Hotel Policies"  section at the bottom of the hotel's page, as well as in your confirmation email.



How do I get more information about the room or hotel facilities?

To see the full list of room facilities and room photos, just click on the room type (e.g. "Queen Room"). You can find all of the hotel's facilities just below the list of room types under "Hotel Facilities."



I want to check out after the stated check-out time. What should I do?

A late check-out can only be arranged with the hotel and usually depends on availability at the time of your stay. You can ask about the possibility at the front desk upon arrival.



I want a smoking room, but I can only choose a non-smoking room. How can I request a smoking room?

If there are no rooms listed as "smoking rooms," it means that the hotel does not allow smoking in rooms.



How do I find out if a hotel allows pets?

Pet policies are always displayed on the hotel’s page under  "Hotel Policies."



Extra Facilities


How do I know if the hotel has parking facilities and how can I reserve a space?

Under "Hotel Facilities" you can see if the hotel has parking, and if any restrictions apply. If the hotel requests that you reserve parking, please contact them directly with the contact information provided in your booking confirmation.



How can I find out if the hotel offers a shuttle service and how can I book it?

If the hotel offers a shuttle service it will be listed under "Hotel Facilities," by "Services." Once you have made your reservation you can arrange the airport shuttle directly with the hotel. The hotel’s contact information is listed in your booking confirmation. Please remember to have your flight details ready.



Can I store my bags at the hotel before check-in or after check-out?

You can see if a hotel offers luggage storage under "Hotel Facilities" on the hotel's page. If you need more information about the hotel's luggage storage facilities, please contact the hotel directly using the contact details provided in your booking confirmation.



How do I find out if a hotel has a certain facility, e.g. an elevator?

Under "Hotel Facilities" you can see a list of all the hotel’s facilities, activities and services.
