New Delhi Travel Guide












Colorful Microcosm of India
A part of supposedly one of the oldest existing cities in the world, New Delhi is an ultimate destination for those seeking mind-altering experiences.  With almost an endless supply of interesting sites, this city offers more than just what meets the eye.
From intimate temples to impressive promenades, from ancient ruins to 20th-century constructions, and from Metros to rickshaws – New Delhi is a city of strong contrasts and a true microcosm of Indian culture and history.
Step through the Lahore Gate and explore the Red Fort, a famous red sandstone building with marble halls and gardens filled with streams and fountains. Or admire stunning Humayun’s Tomb, which has been described as the predecessor of the great Taj Mahal.
But Delhi is not only about historic monuments, it’s also about thriving shopping and delicious cuisine! Its colorful and busy bazaars and super-modern malls are every shopper’s dream. Don’t miss the opportunity to try the best street food in the whole of India!
The modern Indira Gandhi International Airport lies to the west of the city, a short ride from major places of interest. With over 350 hotels and bed & breakfasts available, Booking.com has the perfect accommodation for your New Delhi adventure.

What Guests Said About New Delhi:

Go to Delhi!

Go to Delhi! Mega city, full of contradictions, chaos and delicious food. Sights galore, Delhi is an assault to the senses, you will be challenged and confronted, but it is most definitely worth it. Lots of historic and spiritual landmarks, but equally, lots of youth vibrancy and hospitality to engage with. Excellent value for money and easy access to other parts of India and the world from Delhi. Enjoy! You’ll be back - this trip was my third time, still lots more to see and do, not least, soaking up the frenetic energy that characterizes this city for me. Top spot: Jama masjid, like many a beautiful mosque, this place is serene and peaceful and inviting. Need an upmarket coffee moment? Try Haus khas/deer park.

Hauz khas

Hauz khas Reservoir with cool old buildings, interesting village with interesting shops and great cafes - we went to the one above orgaan, fantastic prawn moilee with appam, decent coffee and g&t’s, though expensive for India, nice to be able to get decent coffee and gluten-free dessert! We had maybe 2 hours there inc lunch, could have done with longerQutab minarDef worth seeing. Closes at 5 and re-opens at 6 for night tour - nicely lit, but not a sound show. Allow an hour, not sure if you can go up the tower in the day, that may take longer.Humayan’s tombNeed an hour or so. Def worth seeingThe metro was clean, frequent and easy to use, but most sights are not that close to a metro stop and everything is further away than you think, walking is therefore not recommended due to distances and lack of English signage, take a tuk tuk to and from stations.There is bad air pollution, unfortunatelyThe bar at the Taj, expensive, but worth it

You have to see it to believe it.

You have to see it to believe it. Two and a half days was just enough. If anyone tries to talk to you (sad to say but they just want to sell you something); just move on. Don’t go with anyone to a government approved tourist office or shop.It dirty and noisy and smelly with high pollution levels. The sites to see are very nice but other than the temples they are in disrepair and not very interesting other than for some nice pictures. I did not walk around late at night, but plenty after dark and never felt unsafe anywhere and I went to some nasty places. Really glad I went but hope I never have to go back.

Oh my gosh.

Oh my gosh... wonderful, exciting and such an adventure. Delhi is a city of different contrasts I personally enjoyed visiting the Lodhi gardens and walking on the street to discover this vibrant city life, what I enjoyed the most is the people precense here, the city is busy and there are all kinds of people involved in some craft that they are working on daily.

Delhi has great Indian history architecture to offere...

Delhi has great Indian history architecture to offere whether the Mughals or British. It is a vast city filled with monument. 
If you want to take photo's make sure you go really early and beat the crowds. 
Delhi also has great food to offer with some of he best restaurants in India and across the world. 
It is however slightly unsafe for women so be vigilant when travelling. 
It is a bucket full of cultures and worth a visit.
