York Travel Guide










England Through the Ages
Although abounding in reminders of the past, York is very much a city for the here and now, with excellent shops, bars and restaurants, many along the River Ouse. Surrounding it are the medieval city walls – the longest and best preserved in England – and many of the gates that once gave access to the city.
Walk the walls for wonderful views of the city and towering York Minster. Standing proud on a hill, this cavernous church is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the 2nd highest position in the Church of England.
A little south is The Shambles, a narrow street with medieval buildings that now house quaint shops. Going further back in time is the Jorvik Centre, a fascinating museum showcasing the city’s Viking remains. You can even try out archaeology for yourself at the DIG excavation pits, with replica finds from York’s Roman, Viking, medieval and Victorian eras.
Other York attractions include the National Railway Museum, home to the Flying Scotsman and Mallard trains. Around a 30-minute drive away, Castle Howard is a stately home on an over 1,000-acre estate.
Leeds-Bradford Airport is the nearest airport, and there's a great range of hotels, B&Bs; and guesthouses in York and on the outskirts available on Booking.com.

York is stunning especially in the late afternoon/evening...

York is stunning especially in the late afternoon/evening run up to Xmas(late night shopping Thursday) with the Christmas market in full flow & light deco's in every street. Locals are very friendly. I have been advised to miss the weekends though, especially if taking family, because of the numerous stag/hen party 'revellers'. So best, if you can, visit on the weekdays.

We added York as a quick stopover on our drive from London to Edinburgh, and what a fun surprise it was! Absolutely loved the historic nature of the city, and our one night wasn’t enough to do more than just walk around. I’d love to come back and spend time in the museums.

Plenty of things to see with various museums and landmarks.

Plenty of things to see with various museums and landmarks. Good selection of cocktail bars and other quirky pubs in city centre. Evil eye is a must for a decent cocktail or next door at house of trembled madness is great for a flavoured beer or other unique drinks

I'm a local who moved away so I'm massively biased but that doesn't mean I'm wrong. I brought my partner to visit my home town and meet my family he loved it and I'm sure he'll be coming back soon. I come back at least once a month because it's great.

Lovely city with plenty of restaurant & shopping opportunities. We had a sunny day for our wall walk. Loved the ASK restaurant in the sumptuous building it is in. Had a beer stop at the Golden Fleece & Starr Inn, both historic pubs. Would definitely visit again.

Vibrant city who has retained many of its original features...

Vibrant city who has retained many of its original features and is clearly proud of its history. Nighttime reveals a different vibe with many stag/ hen nights visible which is not so good. Something for all ages to enjoy.

Where the hotel is situated is very handy for public transport etc.also to walk into york and amenities was an asset to the hotel. The complimentary coffee on arrival was also a lovely gesture as the reception staff was very busy when we arrived.

The Hedley House Hotel was well located for visiting York town center and the minster.  Rooms and common areas were spacious and nicely furnished - comfy, king-sized bed was a real treat!  Staff was friendly and very helpful.  Parking in back so no need to worry about finding a space on the road.  Would definitely love to  stay here again!
