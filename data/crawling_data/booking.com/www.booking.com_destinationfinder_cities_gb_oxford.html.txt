Things to Do in Oxford









Bodleian Library

With over 11 million printed items, the Bodleian stamps its authority as one of the oldest libraries in Europe and the second largest in Britain. As the main research library of the University of Oxford, its collection includes a copy of every book published in England. It’s free to stroll around the central quad and foyer, and guided tours offer further access.








Pitt Rivers Museum

Featuring half a million artefacts from around the world, this museum will have you doing 360 turns in every room. As you ramble through the organised chaos you’ll see dinosaur skeletons and boats suspended from the neo-gothic roof. With relics in every nook and cranny, you’ll feel like you’re on a personal treasure hunt.








Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology

Possibly the world’s oldest public museum, the Ashmolean boasts a treasured collection of prized artefacts ranging from mummies to Michelangelo. Combining wonders of eastern and western civilisations, you can cram half a million years of art and archaeology into half a day. Exhibitions regularly change so the events calendar is worth checking out before you go.








The Botanic Garden

This Garden is a national reference collection of 7,000 different types of plant, making it the most compact yet diverse collection of plants in the World ­ there is even more biological diversity here than there is in tropical rain forests and other biodiversity hotspots.



Rose Lane









Headington Hill Hall

Headington Hill Hall is a stunning 19th century Italianate mansion set amidst 14 acres of grounds which makes the perfect venue for both private and corporate functions throughout the year.

Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
