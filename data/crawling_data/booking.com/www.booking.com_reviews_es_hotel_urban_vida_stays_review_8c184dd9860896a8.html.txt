눉
The instructions weren't clear enough to get into the main door of complex. In fact they were incorrect but was rectified later. No hairdryer despite several requests. This is a basic requirement and each apartment should have one. For short city stays it would have been nice to have tea / coffee in the apartment even though we got everything in the supermarket across the road. In addition I also stipulated that we would need the sleeper couch and yet it wasn't made into a bed. Small touches make a big difference.

Modern, clean apartment centrally located.

Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.
