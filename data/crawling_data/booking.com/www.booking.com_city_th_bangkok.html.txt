Bangkok Travel Guide










Something for Everyone in Bangkok
Bangkok never sleeps, or so you might think as you fly into Suvarnabhumi International Airport. From luxurious mega malls like MBK and Siam Discovery in Siam Square to the famous Khao San Road in the Banglamphu district, this hard working city is packed with commerce, fiery food and soothing temples.
Catch a boat up river on the Chao Phraya Express or discover different neighborhoods on the blissfully air-conditioned BTS Skytrain. A taxi or exhilarating tuk-tuk ride is never far away from the big attractions, which include Chinatown, Jim Thompson House and the floating markets at Damnoen Saduak.
To step out of the frenetic energy of street food stalls, amulet markets and the sizzling temperatures, discover an oasis of calm in one of the many Buddhist temples. Be awed by the majesty of the Grand Palace and marvel at the world’s longest reclining Buddha at Wat Pho. While you’re there why not relax even more with a traditional Thai massage?
From the sky-scraping luxury hotels with world famous rooftop bars to a cheap hostel bed in the center of town, Booking.com will help you explore all that Bangkok has to offer.

A contrast of street food and fine dining, excellent shopping choices, and a great place for services like massage, manicure/pedicure. We found interesting pet cafes, one with large dogs, and another with a raccoon & fox

I will be back to Bangkok in a few days but to a different location so that I experience more of the area. If shopping is your goal, aim to be on this main road for convenience. Siam Mall, MBK mall, etc. All there. Where comfortable shoes there are a lot of stores. (Expect equal if not more expensive pricing compared to the USA). I have more to explore in the second half of my visit in Bangkok, Thailand.

Bangkok isn’t where you’d want to go if you were to visit Thailand. But if it comes to partying and shopping you’re at the right place. It’s a city after all, there isn’t much to do touristically.

If you go to Thailand, you have to see Bangkok.

If you go to Thailand, you have to see Bangkok. Great temples and history...but city is big, noisy, hot and feels dirty with bad air. We were happy to leave and see other parts of Thailand...1-2 days in Bangkok was plenty.

Must see Angkor Wat and the Palace even if you don’t like to do touristy things. The Chatuchak weekend market is a must. Ayutthaya day trip is great, but don’t take the local train!!! They take FOREVER. Our was stalled for an hour on the track before we jumped ship and ordered an Uber.

The bad staff:

The bad staff:We considered Bangkok a somehow hostile city. Every taxi and tuc tuc driver will try to really over price. You have to bargain everything. Streets are heavily crowded with motorcycles. There is lack of commitment for promisses, like for pick up times and things like that. Tuc tuc's will try to carry you to stores with an agreement with them. The good staff:The temples and palaces are beautiful. You can take lovely night dinner cruises. The food is delicious and cheap. The floating market is cool.

“
The property is located in main city of Bangkok and has most of the shopping districts & outlets such as Pratunam Market, Indra Square, Platinum Mall, Palladium Mall on a walking distance. Nana square is also 10 minutes drive away from the hotel. Facilities was very well furnished & clean, Staff are very friendly and Polite, House keeping was excellent. Would highly recommend this Hotel to any couple or family traveling to Bangkok city. Excellent Value for Money !

Riva Surya Bangkok









“
The hotel was super nice. The location is awesome - it's right on the river but still walking distance from the party spots and shopping. Lots of restaurants within walking distance. Having the pool was great as well. Staff was really great - helped us find the best way to get around, helped us with our ride to the airport, and gave us access to a shower so we could clean up after we'd checked out of our hotel room but were heading to the airport in the evening (100+ degree days in Bangkok)
”






Baiyoke Sky Hotel









“
Awesome view! Really bangkok tallest hotel. Great shopping area. Night market just below the hotel. Shopping at Pratunam wholesale, Platinum mall, Krung Thong all within 10mins or less walk from hotel. Very near Ratchaprarop train station -  less then 5mins walk. Staff upgrade my 2 room booking to a suite so that's a plus point. Thank you.
