Visit Kuala Lumpur: Your Travel Guide

Things to Do in Kuala Lumpur









Menara KL

What's tall, round and spins around in KL? That would be this 1,550-foot telecommunications tower! It doubles as an entertainment hub that offers a serious dose of kid-friendly fun. Immerse yourself in an action film on the 6D motion simulator ride, watch an albino python slither around in the Animal Zone or dine buffet-style while revolving around KL at Atmosphere 360.



Menara Kuala Lumpur, No. 2 Jalan Punchak off Jalan P.Ramlee, 50250 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia




Check website for details









Petronas Twin Towers

Icons of modern Malaysia. Cesar Pelli designed this 1,500-foot twosome, the central offices for oil company Petronas. You shouldn't try this yourself, but Catherine Zeta-Jones crossed the buildings by high wire in the 1999 Hollywood film "Entrapment." Head up to the viewing deck, wring your hands together and picture yourself as an oil magnate (or screen siren) staring out at your kingdom!



Lower Ground (Concourse) Level, Petronas Twin Towers, Kuala Lumpur City Centre, 50088 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia




Open Tuesday to Sunday 9 am – 9 pm. Check website for details









KLCC Park

A superlative fusion of natural and constructed beauty. Thanks to the "No Roads Without Trees" policy from the 1970s, KL’s beautification and rapid development went hand-in-hand. This is one result: 125 acres of tropical parkland. Stroll among the mangrove and mahogany trees, admire the “red flame” trees' leaves, or watch the “Fountain Show” erupt from the man-made lake.



Jalan Ampang, Kuala Lumpur City Centre, 50450 Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia




Open Tuesday to Sunday 7am – 9 pm. Check website for details









Pavilion Kuala Lumpur

The “Pavilion” reads like a retail phonebook. From Adidas to Zegna, you'll find clothes, gadgets, gizmos, rings, underthings and more in this mega-mall's 500+ shops. Centre Court is the site of regular festivities and performances that captivate children. Ditch hubby and dash to the 7th floor's “Beauty Hall” for French tips, facials and reflexology worthy of a Queen.



168 Jalan Bukit Bintang, 55100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia




Open every day 10 am – 10 pm









Jalan Alor

Om nom nom! Jalan Alor is an open-air food hall that covers every taste of Asia. Eat sizzled or seared crustaceans, slurp up some hokkien mee (KL-style noodles) or try the pad thai; whatever you eat, every growling belly will be satisfied. The vibe here is energetic, and families and friends share laughs along with the food. It's also open until late (really late).



Jalan Alor, Bukit Bintang, 50200 Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia









Petaling Street

Get your bootlegs here! From high-quality to no quality, Petaling's street markets brim with knock-offs, knockdowns and even the occasional knock-out – dress, that is! However, you'll need to brush up on the art of haggling – asking prices here are rarely final. There are genuine finds between the "Praga" and "Guggi" bags, if you're willing to get your hands dirty!



Jalan Petaling, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia









Merdeka Square

Malaysia was freed from British Colonial rule in 1957. This historic year is marked with a flagpole on this freshly mowed patch of parkland in KL's Colonial District. For architecture devotees, the buildings around it are like a repository of continental styles: the Tudor-style Royal Selangor Club, Moorish Sultan Abdul Samad Building and Gothic St Mary's Cathedral.



Dataran Merdeka, 57000 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia









National Mosque (Masjid Negara)

The National Mosque is a wondrous fusion of traditional and contemporary Islamic design. Inspired by Mecca's Grand Mosque, it has called KL's faithful to prayer since its completion in 1965. Its star-shaped dome represents the thirteen states of Malaysia, as well as the Five Pillars of Islam. Non-Muslim visitors can visit the mosque and the lush gardens at certain times.



Jalan Perdana, Tasik Perdana, 50480 Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia




Saturday to Thursday 9 am – 12 pm and 3 pm – 4 pm and 5:30 pm – 6:30 pm, Friday 3 pm – 4 pm and 5:30 pm – 6:30 pm









Bird Park KL

This is “billed” as the world's largest walk-in aviary. Over 3,000 rainbow-colored birds swoop like celebrities in search of a camera and sound like an assault by a mariachi band. Mom, dad, kids – you'll all be enthralled! See the carnival-colored “sun conure” bird, or witness the salmon-crested Moluccan cockatoo puff and pose. Bring tissues – birds like to eat!



920 Jalan Cenderawasih, Taman Tasik Perdana, 50480 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia




Open every day 9 am – 6pm









Batu Caves

To the Batu Caves! The colossal statue of Lord Murugan stands guard at the foothills of this awe-inspiring, 400-million-year-old cave complex. Scale the stairway for a heavenly view: shafts of light streaming in from every angle, colorful statues of Ganesh, Shiva and Kali commanding attention at every turn, and welcoming visitors from far and wide to this sacred site.



Jalan Batu Caves, Selangor, 68100 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia




Open every day 6 am – 9 pm









Kuan Ti Temple

Guarded by two stone lions, this bright red Taoist temple is right in the heart of Chinatown. Inside you’ll find hanging coiled incense, colorful architecture and intricate carvings. Visit in the early morning—when locals come to pray to the God of War and other deities—to really get a feel for the serenity and beauty found here.








Sri Mahamariamman Temple

Covered in small carvings of Hindu Gods, the 5-tiered roof of Sri Mahamariamman is a blast of color. As you enter the temple, take a second to appreciate the unique energy radiating within its walls. The oldest Hindu temple in all of Kuala Lumpur, it's truly an oasis right in the busy heart of Chinatown.








Central Market

If you’re in the mood for a feast, look no further than Central Market. The food you can find in this indoor shopping center is some of the yummiest in all of Chinatown. Start off with some shrimp fritters doused in sweet-spicy peanut sauce, then try Pie Tee, a crispy rice-flour cone filled with egg, turnips and coriander. To finish, treat yourself to sweet cakes at Putu Bambu!

A beautiful, vibrant, clean city that’s very easy to navigate. Tons of ethnic diversity, and a great selection of restaurants and street food. Hours spent strolling around uncovering hidden gems, between visiting famous landmarks and taking breathtaking photos.

Food can be found easily. Train station is also near to the hotel we are staying in. BUt we were with a 3 year old and a pram. No elevators or escalators in the train stations. Have to literally carry a sleeping boy in the pram up and down the flights of stairs.

Popular Neighborhoods in Kuala Lumpur












Bukit Bintang


419 properties

Lot 10, Imbi Plaza, Sungei Wang, BB Plaza, Fahrenheit, Starhill and Pavillion ... high-end and mid-range, the gang’s all here – at least in terms of big malls, all of which run the gamut from tired to tasteful. Don't miss the Bintang Walk Streets for amazing street food, or Cosmo’s World Theme Park in Berjaya Times Square for kid-friendly fun.

Accommodations in Bukit Bintang













Downtown Kuala Lumpur


392 properties

KL city center is an amalgamation of all things commercial. It's filled with soaring skyscrapers that symbolize the capital's wealth and power, like the Petronas Twin Towers and the KL Tower. Yet there's also a softer side. Families stroll in Taman Tasik Perdana, children play in Butterfly Park and the health-conscious jog in KLCC Park.

Accommodations in Downtown Kuala Lumpur













Mid Valley


61 properties

Come one, come mall! Mid Valley Megamall and The Gardens are pendant malls for those with a penchant to shop, eat, drink... and do little else, except maybe see a film. The malls are both connected by corridors. To get in or out, the KTM Komuter—Malaysia's first electric train—will get you anywhere in the city in a jiffy.

Accommodations in Mid Valley













KL Sentral Train Station


60 properties

Two reasons to stay in KL Sentral – food and connections! It's known as a transport hub, with easy links to anywhere in the city. For some great local eats, try Warong Kita or Kelantan Delights, famous for its strictly Malaysian buffet. The nearby Sooka Makan Foodcourt and Nu Sentral Mall offer an unending parade of dazzling pan-Asian flavors.

Accommodations in KL Sentral Train Station













Golden Triangle


45 properties

Golden Triangle encompasses several districts and has something for everyone. Find food and fashion on Bukit Bintang and Petaling Streets. Culture vultures can get crafty with traditional batik painting and basket weaving at Karyaneka. At night, find wacky nightclubs along Jalan P. Ramlee (the "clubbing street") and fist pump the night away.

Accommodations in Golden Triangle













Chinatown


44 properties

High quality, best deals! You'll hear these words repeatedly on Petaling Street, known for its designer duds at a fraction of the retail price. Vendors here sell watches, clothing, belts, shoes and luggage galore. If you decide to skip the retail madness, admire the Hindu Sri Mahamariamman Temple's colorful five-tiered “gopuram” (tower).

Accommodations in Chinatown











Local Tips for Kuala Lumpur







No Black Tie




by Rebecca

Rebecca likes to relax with a game of golf, or by taking in a musical or live jazz performance.


This venue offers quality jazz performances and attracts both local and international artists. The interiors are also worth a mention — acoustics-friendly wood panelling, a speakeasy vibe and a bar tucked into the corner, transporting you to a bygone era!

KLPAC




by Brana

Brana spends his spare time theatre-going, at his local bar and volunteering at an animal shelter.


This is one of the best performance venues in the country and dates back to the 1960s, when the owners' theatre company was started. There’s a huge auditorium, a smaller black-box-style theatre and a more intimate venue for gigs.

When at 1 Utama Shopping Centre, go up to the rooftop to check out The Secret Garden. This 30,000 square foot botanical beauty has hundreds of plant species. My personal favorite has got to be the Victoria Amazonica – the largest water lily species in the world. Best of all, it’s free!

by Wee Loong

What do you need to catch fish? According to Wee Loong, you need a line, bait and a lot of patience!


If you are in Kuala Lumpur and want to chill out with friends over an evening drink or two, this is the place to be. At 30 stories high, the VIEW Rooftop Bar allows you to enjoy a drink while catching panoramic views over the Kuala Lumpur city skyline. Definitely a must-go.

How can you enjoy the sights in Kuala Lumpur while avoiding the crowds?

The City Tour bus ( Hop on Hop off) is extraordinary value.In fact I would say the best anywhere I have been. I would have happily paid the full fare but we were asked our ages and being 60+ were offered a concessionary ticket costing less than £5 (24myr). The bus even had an aircon room on the top deck. The full circuit takes about 3 hours and is highly recommended.

Why do you recommend Kuala Lumpur for food?





Anonymous


Malaysia has a diverse range of food from their Indian, Chinese and local Malay influence. There is something for everyone. You'd want to try a lot of the different dishes and because everything is so cheap you might as well! At least try a curry laksa, curry puffs, cha kway teow and some chilli crab!

Transportation





Kuala Lumpur Transportation









Air



Kuala Lumpur’s black airport taxis can get you to the city center in 45 minutes, depending on traffic. Get a budget taxi voucher for MYR 75 or a luxury one for MYR 210 and proceed to Gate 3. To KL Sentral, the fastest way is the KLIA Express Train that leaves every 15-30 minutes between 5 am – 1 am. These cost MYR 25 and will get you there in 30 minutes. A cheaper alternative is a 1-hour Express Coach ride for MYR 10, which runs every 30 minutes between 6:30 am – 12:30 am.




Kuala Lumpur International Airport
www.klia.com.my











Air



This budget terminal is a 10-minute drive from KLIA. As with the main airport, an airport taxi is the most convenient way to the city center at similar prices and times. To KL Sentral, a 30-minute journey on the KLIA Express Train is the fastest way and costs MYR 25. A cheaper option is the red Sky Bus at MYR 15, which takes you to KL Sentral in 75 minutes and runs at intervals of 30-60 minutes (5 am – 10:15 am and 10:45 am – 2:45 am). Watch your luggage at all times!




Kuala Lumpur International Airport 2
www.klia2.info











Light Rail Transit (LRT) and Monorail



Three major lines connect the city. The Monorail Line costs MYR 1.20 to 5.10, Star LRT (Ampang Line) costs MYR 1 to 4.20 and Titiwangsa and Putra LRT (Kelana Jaya Line) costs MYR 0.70 to 2.50, depending on distance traveled. They operate daily 6 am – 11:30 pm, or ‘til 11 pm on Sundays and public holidays. Buy a ticket or token from the machines (coins only) or get an electronic MyRapid Card at the counter. Signs and audio announcements are in Malay and English.




MyRapid
www.myrapid.com.my











Train



For intercity travel, take the KTM Komuter Train operating daily 6 am – 10:30 pm, with a ladies-only pink cabin. Popular destinations are Pulau Ketam (Crab Island), Mid Valley and Batu Caves (some walking needed). Be patient in case of delays! Tickets range from MYR 1 to 77 according to coach type and distance traveled and can be purchased at any KTM station, including the interchange at KL Sentral. Remember to take supplementary charges to your fare into account!




KTM Berhad
www.ktmb.com.my











Bus



If you spot a cheerful light purple Go KL City Bus, look for the Go KL sign, make a run for it, ask the driver for your desired destination and hop on for a free ride! With 4 lines, the routes include hotels, business areas, train stations, shops and sightseeing attractions. The bus runs every 5 to 10 minutes all week (Monday to Thursday 6 am – 11 pm, Friday to Saturday 6 am – 1 am and Sunday 7 am – 11 pm). The complimentary WiFi means you can check out other places on the go!




Go KL City Bus
www.gokl.com.my











Bus



The blue-red-white RapidKL Bus heads to attractions in the city center and the outskirts, operating daily from about 7 am – 11 pm along 6 area routes. Schedule and hours vary according to day and area so check full details online. Flag one down from a bus stop with a "Rapid" sign on it, tell the driver where you're heading and pay for your fare (about MYR 1 to 3 for one-way travel within the city center). Make sure you have exact change!




MyRapid
www.myrapid.com.my











Car



Rental cars aren't recommended, especially with a pretty comprehensive train network and attractions within walking distance. If needed, rent one from the airport. On-street parking is not allowed in the city, and those who do so risk a fine of MYR 300 or the displeasure of having their car towed! Locals will warn you about the horrendous traffic, especially Monday to Friday 8 am – 9:30 am and 5 pm – 8:30 pm. Friday around lunch, 12 pm – 2 pm, can be pretty hairy too!










Taxi



With about 17 companies in town, taxis are readily available at taxi stands in all shades from red, yellow and green/orange (from MYR 3) to premium ones in blue (from MYR 6). They are an affordable way to get around and would be great... if not for the traffic! Make sure they use a meter before boarding or you might get fleeced. Extra charges apply for tolls, prior booking and travel to or from the airport. Avoid disputes with drivers for your safety!

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
