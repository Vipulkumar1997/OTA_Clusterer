Galway Travel Guide










Cracking City of Craic
Welcoming Galway is a small city with fantastic nightlife and an infectious atmosphere. Outside of the Galway Arts Festival, there’s still plenty of live music in the Irish pubs to get the party started.
The Galway Races at Ballybrit Race Course west of Galway Airport attract a good crowd, as does Eyre Square, a green space with flags of previous ruling families who gave it its nickname - City of Tribes. To the south are cobbled streets housing brightly colored shops and restaurants.
Sights in Galway include its cathedral and city museum which has an interesting insight into the history of the city and Ireland. Lynch’s Castle is the last remaining 17th-century merchant house, and the Spanish Arch is a small section of city walls by the Corrib River, linking Galway Bay to huge Loch Corrib. Where river and ocean meet is Claddagh Park, a great spot for a picnic with a view.
Further around the coast is Salthill Promenade, home to Atlantaquaria, Ireland’s national aquarium, focussing on sealife off Irish shores. It’s a Christmas Day tradition to jump from Blackrock Diving Tower nearby into the icy Atlantic Ocean, though you may well spot some wag giving it a go.
Booking.com has an excellent range of Galway hotels, apartments and B&Bs; to complete your stay.

The locals were extremely welcoming and very knowledgeable.

The locals were extremely welcoming and very knowledgeable. We felt like we were home. We are already planning another trip back for a much longer stay to enjoy the rest of what Galway has to offer! We fell in love with 1520 for dinner and drinks.

What an experience.

What an experience.  Wonderful restaurants...if you’ve a foodie, there are lots of options.  The Irish music scene was great.  Lots of really good musicians playing true traditional Irish music.   It was also a good base for touring a lot of the nearby smaller towns.

A lovely town for walking through shops and listening to music at the many pubs. The restaurants were top notch, especially the fresh seafood. Many natural attractions nearby such as Connemara national park and the Cliffs of Moher. Loved the Jungle Cafe for breakfast and The Quay for music.

I visited Galway to attend the International Oyster Festival.

I visited Galway to attend the International Oyster Festival.  It was just an okay event. I expected so much more.  There was a live band with dancing, 2 bars, only 3 seafood vendors and 1 oyster vendor.  Although, I only attended on opening night, I expected more competitive oyster vendors, different types of ways to eat oysters.  They only had raw oysters.  Barilla the pasta company was there giving a demo.  You would have thought the demo would have somehow involved oysters.  Not!  but the people were great.  I would love to be on the planning committee I could help really make that festival something  fun, special and make a ton of money at the same time.  Thanks

We spent most of our time in the city centre around Eyre Square and the Claddagh.  Lots of neat old buildings, shops, and pubs. We were there on a Saturday in October and there was a great little famers'/craft market, St. Nicholas Market, on Church Lane just off Shop Street.Lots of shopping available in the pedestrian mall including a two-storey indoor mall with your regular High Street shops plus much more.We ate at the Skeff on Eyre Square.  It's a beautiful old bar with multiple rooms in the Skeffington Hotel.








Hotels That Guests Love in Galway





Western Hotel









“
Beds were great, we thought we had 2 beds but they do not think of a double as 2 beds only 2 people, we found a few things different in Ireland than we do in the US, but were both good, no problem.
”






Claremount House B&B









“
My husband and I stayed for one night while passing through Galway in early June. Places like this are why Ireland has such a wonderful reputation for hospitality. The owners and family are friendly, welcoming, and genuine. We felt like we were visiting a family member, who happens to have a great view, and cooks a mean Irish breakfast. Our room was elegant and clean. It was one of the best nights of sleep we had during our time on the west coast. Highly recommended!!
”






Adare Guesthouse









“
Nicest people and staff, best food I had in Ireland, endearing town of Doolin was the highlight of our 2 weeks trip, we even stayed and extra day because we could barely bring ourselves to leave.
”






The Connacht Hotel









“
Location one bedroom suites were not great. For the price I paid, it did not include breakfast. Also didn't include servicing of rooms. Within the four night stay I requested fresh towels on 2 different occasions to return after work, to no towels. Had to ring reception numerous times to get this done. Breakfast was mediocre. 10 euro is fairly standard in Ireland for a decent breakfast however I wouldn't rate the quality. Meals on restaurant again, only mediocre quality.
”






Ardawn House









“
The hosts, Breda and Mike were extremely warm and helpful. The suggestions for dining led us to one of our best meals in Ireland. Breakfast was excellent. I could not have had a better experience in a hotel or B & B.
