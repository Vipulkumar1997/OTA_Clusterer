Exceptional


We liked Mumbai for what it is. Noise, confusion, beeping horns, touts trying to sell all the things you do not need and the beer at Cafe Mondegar, Colaba. You either love Mumbai or leave her.

Bustling city, pretty expensive taxis were plentiful but would not listen to concierge you would get half way through a journey and they would ask where it is you wanted to go. You don't have wifi so difficult every trip. Make sure u have location on google maps before you leave wifi.

Mumbai is a mad mad city - be prepared for it before you head there. If you’re going to go to Mumbai I’d recommend staying in the south of Mumbai as there’s a lot more to do/see there - in the centre there isn’t much at all.

Very Good


Great dining options, loved the hotel. To be honest we didn’t get out that much as we were a tiny bit ill after two weeks in India! I’m sure there is much scope for exploration! Dinner at The Table was great, and they do a good Pisco sour!

How can you enjoy the sights in Mumbai while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


We hired a guide to take us to sites (specifically not shopping!) and saw many places that we would not have ventured to by ourselves.  Agree a price and time frame for the visit (we arranged for 4 hours and to be dropped off at the airport.  We saw the beautiful railway station, hanging gardens, wholesale market (sells everything from puppies to fruit and veg), temples, washing laundry, the necklace of Mumbai (across the coast) and many other sights we would not have gone to ourselves.  The guide brought an air conditioned taxi with driver with him.

Describe what other people like you would like about shopping in Mumbai.

Bombay is a shoppers paradise.  Homewares, fabrics, handmade paper, fabulous designer fashion, antiques, leather clothes and handbags and of course jewellery, diamonds are of good quality and cheaper than anywhere else in the world.  Word of warning, get a recommendation  of a good jeweller from a local.

How can you get the most authentic cultural experience in Mumbai?





Anonymous


Probably walking around some of the areas (tourist), like the Gate of India - that's a great place to interface with local Indian people - they are marvelous people - or take a Rick-shaw somewhere and then interact with the locals - they are really nice people.

The centre is quite nice with the gateway to India, Taj Hotel and Prince of Wales Museum. Definitively not a tourist destination though.
