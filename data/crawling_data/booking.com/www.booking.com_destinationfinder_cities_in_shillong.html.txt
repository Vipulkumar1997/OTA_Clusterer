Traveler's Reviews & Photos

Exceptional


Truly Scotland of the East. Great weather and scenery. Travel to and fro Guwahati is convenient. Less crowded than north Indian hill stations. Friendly and beautiful people. Lots and lots of Maruti 800 and Altos. Eateries and water holes are the only thing which can be better.

All points are away from Shillong. Great for trekking trips or for family trip. Very nice temperature. Need to be fully prepared to face rain at any time.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
