Malacca Travel Guide










History and Culture in Equal Measure
Historic Melaka (or Malacca) is the capital of the Malaysian state of the same name, home to one of the country’s first sultanates. The replica of the sultan’s palace is one of the city’s top attractions.
The end of the sultanate came with the Portuguese conquest of Melaka in the 16th century. Reminders of this period include part of A Famosa fort, and there is also a fort built by the next settlers, the Dutch. Several Dutch churches also remain, including Christ Church with its pinkish façade.
Nowadays, Melaka is a melting pot of various cultures, and Chinese temples, such as wonderful Cheng Hoon Teng, sit happily alongside Hindu temples and mosques. The most spectacularly located of the latter is Masjid Selat (or Malacca Straits Mosque), on stilts above waters lapping an offshore island.
Many Melaka hotels on Booking.com are near the promenade lining the narrow city beach, and others are near more secluded beaches in the suburbs. The Melaka River splits the city into 2, and the further inland you travel along it, the more traditional the buildings become.
Just before the river’s first bend is Jonker Street, the heart of Chinatown and popular for its night markets, while a few miles to the north is Melaka Airport in the Batu Berendam district.

many places to visits but during school holiday.

many places to visits but during school holiday. a lot of traffic jams and limited parking space. for the hotels, it is better to stay in town which means centre of interested places. so that you can walking along the distance..

Beautiful town with lots of colour and fun to walk around.

Beautiful town with lots of colour and fun to walk around.  2 nights is enough as it isn't very big but time your visit with the weekend so you can enjoy the night food market only on Fri-Sun evenings. A river cruise is short, cheap and a nice way to see the town. St Paul's hill is interesting and offers good views of the town. The cafes along the river make a nice spot to relax at!

MALACCA is one of my most visited destinations in Malaysia.

MALACCA is one of my most visited destinations in Malaysia.  I’ve been here many times, yet still, I can’t get enough of this place. From narrow lanes peppered with colorful Baba-Nyonya houses to a plaza fringed by red-painted Dutch brick buildings,  grandiose temples to commanding mosques, and from hand-crafted intricate souvenirs to cafes serving taste bud-tingling local dishes, everywhere I turn, Malacca reminds me that I am somewhere unforgettable!

The overall was good only that we went during the public holiday and it was full house. Everywhere was packed and the morning breakfast was chaotic. The staffs were unable to cope with the demands and foods was not top up fast, we had to wait for some time. The hotel staffs were very helpful in trying to provide a comfortable stay.
