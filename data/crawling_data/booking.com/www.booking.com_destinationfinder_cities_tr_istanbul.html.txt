Things to Do in Istanbul









Basilica Cistern

In the deepest, darkest recesses beneath Sultanahmet Square lies an amazing relic rescued from the sands of time. Around 7,000 slaves gave their blood, sweat and tears building these subterranean caverns, which look like a buried church. Inside, it’s awe-inspiring – 2.4 acres of marble columns, some topped with Roman mythological figures…and mood lighting for the gods!



Yerebatan Caddesi 13, Sultanahmet




Open every day 9 am – 5:30 pm









Sultanahmet Mosque ('Blue Mosque')

Sky, cerulean, azure…it’s a festival of blue! Light reflects every shade of the coolest color as it strikes the famous tiles of this mosque, one of the most celebrated in Islam. The mosque itself is part of a larger complex that includes a covered bazaar, Turkish baths, public kitchens, a hospital, schools, a caravansary, and the mausoleum of Sultan Ahmet.



Sultanahmet Mosque, 34122 Sultanahmet, Fatih, İstanbul




Open Saturday to Thursday 8:30 am –12:30 pm and 2 pm – 4:30 pm and 5:45 pm – 6:30 pm, Friday 2:30 pm – 4:30 pm and 5:45 pm – 6:30 pm.









Hagia Sophia

This 1500-year-old monument has seen it all. Built as a church then transformed into a mosque, it’s now one of the world’s great museums. Inside, you’ll find an amazing synthesis of Christian and Islamic design, reflected in the time-worn mosaics on the walls of this enormous space. It’s a good idea to purchase tickets online to avoid the long lines.



Ayasofya Meydanı, Sultanahmet Fatih




Open Tuesday to Sunday 9 am – 5 pm; changes seasonally (check website for details)









Grand Bazaar

If there’s money to be made, you’ll find one of the bazaar's vendors selling it. For flashy decorations, Turkish fashion or any number of tourist trinkets, the Grand Bazaar has 3,000+ shops to browse, spread throughout dozens of covered alleys. One of the world’s oldest and largest markets is also a prime spot to practice your haggling skills – never accept the first offer!



Beyazit Mah. Kuyumcular sk. Kapali Carsi, 34126 İstanbul, Turkey




Open Monday to Saturday 9 am – 7 pm









Topkapi Palace

Once upon a time, the Sultanate moved across town, and left behind 173 acres of prime real estate. Built in 1478, Topkapi Palace was the heart and mind of the Ottoman Empire for centuries. What lay abandoned in 1853 was restored 50 years later, when the palace became one of Istanbul’s premier museums, with elaborate courtyards, gates and a harem that remain largely intact.



Bab-ı Hümayün Caddesi, Sultanahmet (behind Hagia Sophia)




Open Monday 9 am – 5 pm, Wednesday to Sunday 9 am – 5 pm









Spice Bazaar

Faster than you can say "sugar and spice," the spices at this market will have you soaking up one fragrant scent after another. Pick up jasmine, juniper, and everything in between, from the vendors at one of the world’s oldest and largest markets. Search for Egyptian scented oils, Iranian saffron and Russian caviar – the world is at your fingertips here.



Yeni Camii Meydanı, Eminönü (next to the New Mosque)




Open Monday to Saturday 8 am – 7 pm









Suleymaniye Mosque

Süleyman the Magnificent’s (1520–66) taste was pretty…well, magnificent. Despite having wealth beyond imagination, his refined taste inspired this mosque’s minimal design. This allows simple touches, like beams of light through the stained-glass windows, to shine through. The complex also houses public service buildings and the charming Darüzziyafe Restaurant.



Tiryakiler Carsisi, Prof Sıddık Sami Onar Caddesi, Süleymaniye




Open every day 9 am – 12:30 pm and 2 pm – 4:30 pm









Galata Tower

Inmates imprisoned here during the Ottoman era would imagine flying across the Bosporous to freedom. Centuries later, Hezarfen Ahmet Celebi did just that, an early aviator who flew on artificial wings straight to the Anatolian side. These days, Galata Tower’s famous 360° panoramic views of the city and its popular restaurant offer plenty of fun for all visitors.



Bereketzade Mh., Galata Kulesi, Beyoğlu




Open every day 9 am – 8 pm









Taksim Square

Taksim Square might be associated with recent political unrest, but a trip here paints a vastly different picture. The square is the heart of modern Istanbul and functions mainly as a transportation hub. It’s also a popular entertainment area, surrounded by shops, restaurants and local cafes. Cross town on the historic tram for a nostalgic touch of old Istanbul.



Beyoğlu, Tak-ı Zafer Cd, 34435 Gümüşsuyu




Open every day









Dolmabahce Palace

Apartments with 285 rooms are hard to come by, but that’s exactly what Sultan Abdülmecid I was after. In 1856, he, his wife, children and pet hamster moved in with 6 other sultans. Blending Baroque, Rococo and Neoclassical influences, Dolmabahce’s amenities include 68 toilets, 6 steam rooms, dozens of opulent chandeliers, its own clock tower – and now even Wi-Fi.



Dolmabahçe Caddesi, Beşiktaş (across from the İnönü - Beşiktaş soccer stadium)




Open Tuesday and Wednesday 9 am – 4 pm, Friday to Sunday 9 am – 4 pm









Blue Mosque

Constructed between 1609 and 1616, the striking Sultan Ahmed Mosqueo—or "Blue Mosque"—is still a place of worship today. With no war victories to fund it, this expensive structure had to be paid for straight from the treasury – angering the Ottoman legal scholars of the time. Non-Muslim visitors are encouraged to visit, but should be respectful of the strict dress code.








Istanbul Archaeology Museums

In awe of the archaeological museums already established in London, Paris, and Vienna, Sultan Abdülaziz called for one to be constructed in Istanbul. The resulting campus consists of three buildings – the Museum of the Ancient Orient, the Archaeology Museum, and the Museum of Islamic Art or "Tiled Pavilion."








Rumelihisari

Built by Sultan Mehmed II, this grand fortress was designed to control the flow of ships passing along the Bosphorus strait and helped him conquer Constantinople during the siege of 1453. Made up of three towers and thick battle-ready walls, the structure forms the shape of the Prophet Mohammed’s name in Arabic, when seen from above.








Beylerbeyi Palace

Built to include both eastern and western architectural elements, Beylerbeyi Palace was commissioned by Sultan Abdülaziz in 1861. A summer home for Ottoman royals, this luxurious residence has also housed many foreign dignitaries. It’s relatively small and only takes an hour or so to explore – don’t miss the decorative bathing area at the edge of the Bosphorus!

Popular Neighborhoods in Istanbul












European Side


1813 properties

Several districts make up this area. The salty sea air blows through the medieval ruins of Rumelihisari fortress, which makes for an unforgettable coastal stroll. Sisli has peculiar monuments like Ihlamur Palace (an Ottoman Summer Palace) and the Atatürk Museum (devoted to the life of Turkey's first president) that are worth a visit.

Accommodations in European Side













Fatih


866 properties

This historically conservative area has given way to the "new" Istanbul. Fatih’s historic Wednesday market is a mixture of sights and sounds that can’t be missed. Any other day, start at Sultanahmet Square and branch out to the historic Topkapi Palace and Complex, Hagia Sophia and the gorgeous coastal walkways along Kennedy Avenue.

Accommodations in Fatih













Old City Sultanahmet


767 properties

Begin your adventure in Sultanahmet Square: the gateway to the historic center. In Topkapi Palace, Byzantine artifacts shine proudly in the display cases. Hagia Sophia’s mosaics are time-worn, reflecting the history of a space that has been both mosque and church across 1.5 millennia. Funky bars and cozy cafes summon you to come enjoy a drink.

Accommodations in Old City Sultanahmet













Taksim


528 properties

Street culture, energetic cafes and antique stores with unique treasures await in this cosmopolitan district. Fashionistas will have a field day at the boutiques on Istiklal Avenue.

Accommodations in Beyoglu













Sisli


198 properties

Sisli is a large district on the European side of Istanbul, near the Bosporus Bridge. A mix of mosques, churches and synagogues make the area eclectic. The Trump Towers and Cevahir Shopping Mall are reminders of the growing tide of commercialism sweeping through the area. The narrow streets of Nisantasi are loaded with boutiques and galleries.

Accommodations in Sisli













Asian Side


194 properties

The Asian side of Istanbul lives on the edge of the past and present. Kadıköy is a mix of scents and sounds; in Moda, buy tapas-style food from a quirky street vendor, then wander past tattoo parlors and street art for a live exhibition of urban Istanbul flow. Buy branded clothing on Bagdat Avenue, then dine out in style.

Accommodations in Asian Side













Beyazit


134 properties

There’s a sort of haze around the palaces, towers and gardens around Beyazit Mosque, giving the feeling of being lost in time. The mosque has stood proudly since 1506 and weathered many storms over its cut-stone exterior. The Grand Bazaar is filled with the sights, smells and sounds of an authentic Turkish market.

Accommodations in Beyazit













Laleli


124 properties

Start your adventure at the Laleli Complex, which contains a historic mosque in the raised courtyard at its heart. The mosque is considered one of Istanbul's finest examples of 18th-century Ottoman architecture. From here, stop by one of the many textile merchants (the area's economic lifeblood) or sip a coffee in one of the cozy cafes.

Accommodations in Laleli













Sirkeci


104 properties

Sirkeci is a coastal district that has gone from shabby to chic. Search for some delicious street food or visit the delightful eateries around Hoca Pasa Street. Boutique shopping is fairly personalized here. It's also the perfect launchpad for adventures in the Old City, with many major attractions less than a 10-minute walk away.

Accommodations in Sirkeci













Besiktas


76 properties

Fragments of the Ottoman Empire remain in this district on the coast. Picnic or play in the flower-filled groves of Yildiz Park, followed by a walk to Ortakoy – inviting cafes by day and plush clubs by night. Salute the sea at the Turkish Naval Museum, see and be seen in trendy Bebek and Kurucesme, or crown your day at Dolmabahce Palace.

Accommodations in Besiktas













Kadikoy


74 properties

To stay in Kadıköy means immersing yourself in traditional Turkish culture, and it’s a fast ferry ride from this residential district to the city’s prime attractions. Elaborate wooden houses that creak with the passing of time, and remnants of the Roman Empire await as you wander the streets. Indulge in mouth-watering Turkish Delights from Akustik Market.

Accommodations in Kadikoy













Aksaray


54 properties

Aksaray is primarily known as a transportation hub, with easy connections to Taksim and the Old City, though there are still some charms in the area. The area is filled with budget hotels, but one sight worth seeing is Pertevniyal Valide Sultan Camii, a 19th-century imperial mosque built in a fusion of styles, known for its unique stone masonry.

Accommodations in Aksaray













Topkapi


33 properties

Take a decent pair of walking shoes to navigate the 3.4-mile stretch atop the 8th-century City Walls of Constantinople. Make sure to spend some time at Kara Ahmet Pasha Mosque, a medieval learning center that houses painstakingly detailed mosaics. The area maintains its scholarly nature, with many cafes and student haunts.

Accommodations in Topkapi













Ortakoy


29 properties

Ortakoy’s residents are youthful and cosmopolitan. Among the swathes of modern art galleries, you'll find eateries tempting you with delicious local delicacies. One of the area's oldest buildings is the Turkish Bath, followed by the neo-Baroque Ortakoy Mosque. Take a cruise across the Bosporus, or shop for trinkets at the emporiums.

Accommodations in Ortakoy













Uskudar


15 properties

You could spend your entire trip immersed in Turkish culture in Üsküdar. Head inland for antique shops and boutiques and bring a healthy appetite to the local eateries. Find a fragment of the lost Ottoman Empire in the lavish Beylerbeyi Sarayi (Palace). It’s a short ferry ride from Kiz Kulesi (The Maiden’s Tower) from the famous Greek myth.

Accommodations in Uskudar













Eyup


4 properties

Eyup has a long Muslim history. The Tomb of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari—dedicated to a slain friend of the Prophet—is an important pilgrimage site in Islam. The elaborate tiles of Eyup Sultan Mosque and Ottoman-era cemeteries with elaborate marble tombstones are definitely worth seeing. From here, take the Eyup Gondola to Pierre Loti, overlooking the Golden Horn.

Accommodations in Eyup











Local Tips for Istanbul







Mihrabat Grove




by Melike

Melike loves to be immersed in nature with family and friends, away from city life.


I really love a weekend away in Mihrabat Korusu, which is one of Istanbul’s biggest groves. Brunch with family and friends, followed by a long walk along the trails immerses you in pure and unspoiled nature. I’d recommend coming to the area with a private car or a taxi.

Mihrabat Caddesi 50, Kanlıca Beykoz

Bagdat Street




by Duygu

Duygu is a shopaholic – when she finds unusual clothes and accessories, out comes the cash!


Bagdat Street is heaven for a woman who has been shopping her whole life and still has nothing to wear! There are stores ranging from well-known international brands to local boutiques. It also includes a lot of cafes and restaurants where you can sip coffee after a tiring shopping adventure.

Accommodations nearby



Bagdat Street, Istanbul, Turkey

Open every day








Kadıköy Bar Street




by Baytan

Spontaneous Baytan loves grabbing a couple of drinks on a fun night out with friends.


Kadıköy Bar Street, also known as Kadife Sokak, is known for its good prices and relaxed atmosphere. Most of the places are cozy and casual and you don’t have to make a reservation. Sometimes I want higher quality meals, so I head to the wine houses for exquisite dishes and drinks.

Accommodations nearby



Kadife Street, Kadıköy, Istanbul, Turkey

Open every day








Bosporus Cruise




by Goksu

Goksu has lived in Istanbul for 26 years and loves seeing the city by boat.


A 1-hour-long Bosporus cruise may be the most unforgettable experience you have in Istanbul. I’d recommend setting aside a few hours, then setting out on the ferry from Ortakoy. It’s especially wonderful to take the ferry during the spring and summer months.

Accommodations nearby



Ortakoy Pier (between Mecidiye Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion)

Open every day








SALT Galata




by Oylun

On Saturday mornings, Oylun loves going to an exhibition and reading in a local park.


SALT Galata – the former Headquarters of the Ottoman Bank – is filled with history and excitement. I like to sip a coffee or have lunch at the restaurant overlooking the uneven roofs of Karakoy and the Golden Horn. The on-site gallery also has cutting-edge exhibitions to enjoy afterwards.

Accommodations nearby



Garanti Bankalar Caddesi 11,  Karaköy 34420

www.saltonline.org

Open Tuesday to Saturday 12 pm – 8 pm, Sunday 12 pm – 6 pm








Çiçek Pasajı (Cicek Pasaji)




by Aslı

Istanbul never ceases to surprise and amaze Aslı, even after 26 years of living here.


Çiçek Pasajı is the best place to spoil yourself in Istanbul! I recommend trying some "raki" (or any number of delectable Turkish dishes) at the eateries underneath the covered passages of Çiçek Pasajı. Some of the eateries even have live music right next to your table!

TT Arena




by Onur

Onur loves a bit of soccer therapy now and again – especially at the legendary stadiums!


I love the atmosphere in Turk Telecom Arena during soccer season. Galatasaray fans are some of the loudest in the world – they even made the Guinness Book of Records in 2011 with a 131.76-decibel roar from the crowd! You can also buy merchandise at the large store in front of the stadium.

Terkos Passage




by Eklimya

Not too luxurious, not too cheap – high-quality clothing at decent prices keeps Eklimya happy!


If you are looking for reasonably priced fashion, shop at Terkos Passage at the end of the Istiklal Street. Terkos has the atmosphere of a bazaar; you’ll find branded products and everything in between under one roof. Here’s a tip: negotiate with the sellers if you’re paying with cash!

How can you enjoy the sights in Istanbul while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


Get up early. Most museums open at 9 AM. Crowds are already gathering before opening. If you go later than 10 AM to Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sofia, Basilica Cistern - you're gonna have a bad time. Queues are hundreds of meters long, going slow. The rest of the monuments have reasonable queues, and can be visited later in the day.
Don't go to Taksim Square, or on the road that leads from Taksim to Galata Tower if you don't like large crowds. There are millions of people on that main street.
Might help getting a museum pass. At the time of our visit, it would've made up for its cost, and we wouldn't have to wait in long queues because we'd get an express pass.

Grand Bazaar! Amazing experience that no one should miss. It's not really about the products there but the atmosphere. 
There are 64 streets in the bazaar but I think only 10 types of stores, many of each of them. The sellers will try to reach to you by trying to guess where you are from and as you start communicating with them you'll experience their enthusiasm about their products and their love for the customers. Their goal is to sell you everything and they do it really well, I enjoyed it a lot! 
If the Grand Bazaar is too big for you then try the Spice Bazaar at the New Mosque, much smaller but similar atmosphere.

Why do you recommend Istanbul for food?





Anonymous


You can get Turkish food almost anywhere in the world but trying the local variants is just unforgettable. I never liked hummus or falafel too much before this but in Istanbul I tried the local ones and they were so delicious I'll never forget. Very creamy and you can actually taste the chickpeas. 
Also the Turkish breakfast was a delight (no pun intended) after my trip in France where they just have croissants in the morning. The Turkish breakfast is healthy and filling with eggs, cheese, olives, vegetables and butter and jams for bread.

The atmosphere. You can find most of these things in other places but not in market places with such heady atmosphere as in Istanbul. It is an experience to spend time in Grand Bazaar even if you buy nothing. Shopping areas in India, my country, are equally interesting but they tend to be dirty and full of traps like potholes and overflowing drains. Istanbul has the atmosphere without these problems. The place we liked most was Arasta Bazaar near the Blue Mosque.

Transportation





Istanbul Transportation









Air – Istanbul Ataturk Airport



Istanbul’s main airport is 12.5 miles from the city center. Taxis are readily available and are the most convenient way to reach the center – they cost around TRY 45 and take 30 minutes in mild traffic. The Havatas Bus to Taksim Square is a better value. It departs every 30 minutes on the hour between 4 am – 1 am, costs around TRY 10, and takes around 30 minutes. From Taksim Square, catch either a taxi or the metro to your end destination.




Ataturk Airport
www.ataturkairport.com











Metro



The "Hafif Metro" is very efficient. There are two main lines: Yenikapı to Ataturk Airport (M1A) and Yenakapi to Haciosman (M2). The M1 runs every 5 minutes from 6 am – 12:30 am from Monday to Saturday, and every 8 minutes on Sunday. The M2 line runs from 6:15 am – 12:30 am Monday to Saturday (from 6:30 am on Sunday). To use the Metro, purchase a token from a machine or swipe an "Istanbulkart" (available at some Biletmatik machines) to pass through the turnstiles.




Metro
www.istanbul-ulasim.com.tr











Taxi



Taxis are easy to find – just stop at a taxi stand or hail one from the street. They’re reasonably priced compared to prices in Western Europe and the U.S., making them an affordable way to travel. Official taxis are bright yellow with the words "taksi" on top, and always have digital meters. Language is often an issue, so always have your destination written on a piece of paper. If you go through tolls, these will be added to the final charge.










Bus



City center bus service hubs include Taksim Square, Aksaray and Beşiktaş on the European side, and Üsküdar and Kadıköy on the Asian side. Bus shelter stops are easily available on the main routes. Services run from 6:30 am – 11:30 pm and destinations are displayed on the front of the bus. Ticket prices vary by destination and must be purchased from the white booths near major stops before boarding. Purchase an Akbil or "Istanbul Kart" to save on fares.




IETT
www.iett.gov.tr











Car



Traffic in Istanbul is often heavy and it can take longer to cross the city by car than by public transportation. Drivers are also known to be quite aggressive. There are few multi-story car parks in the city and on-street parking can be difficult to find. However, road conditions in Istanbul are moderate, less so outside the main centers. If you do decide to drive, renting a GPS device with the latest updated maps is recommended.




Rental Cars
www.rentalcars.com











Ferry



Ferries and "sea buses" are a fun and fast way to move between the European and Asian sides. There are four ferry companies in operation; the fastest and most popular is IDO. The major docks on the European side can be found in Eminönü, Sirkeci and Karaköy. Tickets cost around TRY 3 for a single economy class ticket (around TRY 1.95 with an Istanbulkart), which can be purchased at the ferry terminal. Note that timetables change seasonally.
