Things to Do in Bournemouth









The Square

Once upon a time, the square was a roundabout. These days, it’s a pedestrian area of wide promenades that are flanked by boutique shops and bustling cafés. Shop along the seven roads that head off in every direction, or dine at the UFO-shaped Camera Obscura in the centre of the square – it’s a great place to sit for a casual lunch and to watch people going by.



35-37 Bourne Ave, Bournemouth BH2 6DT, UK









Bournemouth Balloon

Balloons aren’t just for children. This giant white balloon takes you on a vertical trip 150-metres upwards, giving you a birds-eye view of the town and beaches. It’s anchored to the ground by a steel cable, so you won’t run the risk of flying off into the Dorset countryside, never to be seen again! Head to Lower Gardens to buy a ticket and see what all the fuss is about.



The Lower Gardens, Bournemouth BH1 2AQ, UK




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-20:00. Check website for details.









Central Gardens

A walk in the park is nature’s tonic to cure all ills. This well-tended stretch of garden runs for around 3-km, right in the centre of Bournemouth. Amble along the paths past woodland glades and flowerbeds filled with pansies, violas and marigolds. The Lower Gardens is a little more action-packed, with an aviary, mini-golf, refreshment stands and other facilities.



Central Gardens, Bourne Ave, Bournemouth BH2 6DT, UK









St Peter's Church

Simply magnificent. This pre-Victorian gothic church stands opposite the Beales Department Store at the heart of the city. It services the Anglican congregation of Bournemouth, but for everyone else it’s main draw card is the sumptuous interior – it holds unusual paintings, eye-catching stained glass windows and alabaster statues, plus the nearby Shelley Family Tombs.



Hinton Rd, Bournemouth, Dorset BH1 2EE, UK




Check website for details.









Bournemouth Beach

Bournemouth Beach is an essential stop on a summer’s day. Nestled between the cliffs and the sea, it’s flanked by a promenade that’s dotted with an assortment of bars, eateries and ice-cream kiosks. Take a barefoot stroll or sprawl out your beach towel and bask in the sunlight. Fun fact: the beach has its own micro-climate, with some of the warmest sea temperatures in the U.K.



W Undercliff Promenade, Bournemouth BH1, UK









Oceanarium

Plumb the depths of the sea. Wedged between the pier and the seafront, the Oceanarium’s massive aquariums are filled to the brim with underwater life. They contain a dazzling array of seahorses and tropical sharks, piranhas and puffer fish. It also contains the world’s first interactive Dive Cage, which drops people into a virtual ocean … populated by virtual sharks. Scary!



Oceanarium, Pier Approach, Bournemouth, Dorset BH2 5AA, UK




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-18:00









Russell Cotes Art Gallery & Museum

This museum is on the east cliff overlooking the ocean. It was once the home of the Russell-Cotes family, who acquired a large collection of eclectic paintings, statues and cultural artefacts brought to the U.K. from Japan, Russia, the Americas and the Antipodes. Wander through the halls, admire the Moorish alcoves, then dine at the restaurant in the new annex.



Russell Cotes Rd, Bournemouth BH1 3AA, UK




Open Tuesday-Sunday 10:00-17:00









Bournemouth Pier

Part of the fun of the seaside is visiting the pier. Bournemouth Pier is loaded with amusements to keep children and parents busy for an afternoon, with arcade games, bustling cafes, theatres, pubs and a souvenir shop – accessible for a 60p entrance fee. Admire the sea views, or head to the Aruba Bar and Restaurant above the pier for cocktails and casual bites.



W Undercliff Promenade, Bournemouth BH2, UK




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00-19:00. Check website for details.









Westbourne

Westbourne is an eclectic shopping area that blends the old with the new. Most of the action is concentrated around Seamoor Road, which is known for its Victorian covered shopping arcade. It’s lined with unique boutiques where you can shop for clothes, vintage china, pottery, paintings and miscellanea. If you’re in the area, don’t miss the eateries around Lower Parkstone.

Christchurch Castle and Norman House

Cast your mind back to medieval times. England was built of castles and keeps, priories and fortifications, and the Normans had occupied most of England. The very first stonework at these castle ruins was laid in the late eleventh century, built over a 9th-century wooden fort. Today, several walls remain on a small mound amidst a residential area and quiet parkland.

West Cliff

West Cliff walks are the perfect remedy any time of year. On warm summer days, you can sit for a while with the sunbathers, maybe enjoying a delish ice cream. On windy winter mornings, the fresh sea air will invigorate your spirit if you head down and take a stroll along the seafront.








East Cliff

East Cliff Beach is known for its clean, cream-colored sands – just one of the reasons that it’s Bournemouth’s most popular beach. When the sun’s out, locals like nothing better than to head to East Cliff and stretch out on a towel. Work up an appetite with a stroll along the seafront before stopping into Harry Ramsden’s Restaurant on the promenade.








Fisherman’s Walk

If you’re after Bournemouth panoramas, head up the path from Fisherman’s Walk. From on top of the cliff, the views sweep all the way from Poole Harbour to Hengistbury Head. If you’re lucky, you can catch a glimpse of the Isle of Wight, too. Just make sure you bring your camera!








Alum Chine Beach

Hop on a train to make your way along the scenic Alum Chine Beach. With clear, blue water, soft golden sand, and the Treasure Island playground just a few steps away – it’s the perfect place for hours of family fun. The "kid zone" safety program is also in effect here, so lifeguards are on patrol throughout the summer.








Sandbanks Beach

The water at Sandbanks Beach is shallow and perfect for young kids! Plus parents can feel comfortable knowing that lifeguards patrol here the whole summer. On the promenade you’ll find a crazy golf course, kid's play areas, and a wide selection of shops and cafes. You can also rent out a beach hut and use the well-maintained shower facilities.








Swanage Beach

At Swanage Beach the kids will be busy for hours playing in the shallow water or enjoying the play areas on the promenade. Facilities include toilets, cafes, and a first-aid point, while lifeguards keep an eye on things throughout the summer. You can rent deck and lounge chairs, or even paddle boats if you want to take a trip out into the waves.

We had two sunny days which although very cold & windy my 10 Yr old daughter wanted to spend on the beach.It was so nice to spend time relaxing with her, watching her enjoyment of the beach & the sea. Good priceless memories were made that didn't cost a thing. Hope to come back soon.

Bournemouth is a beautiful place to visit. Never seen a beach so clean and everywhere was so well looked after. I would definitely consider moving there in the future. Went to a gig at the BIC, great place for shopping and plenty of bars. Lovely gardens to visit in the centre. Perfect mini break.

Popular Neighborhoods in Bournemouth












Bournemouth City Centre

Everything happens in the centre. Wedged between Boscombe and Westbourne, the centre brims with hotels, monuments and parks, as well as student life. Shop on Christchurch Road in Pokesdown for a plethora of vintage shops and quirky cafes, or visit the Russell-Cotes Museum for its eclectic collection of Japanese and Russian paintings.

Boscombe


52 properties

Go East – life is peaceful there. Boscombe is famous for its Victorian architecture, café culture and laid-back vibe. Take to the golden sands of Eastern Cliff Beach, follow the “arts trail” from Sovereign Shopping Centre along the waterfront, or visit the Thursday and Saturday vintage bric-a-brac markets inside Boscombe’s Royal Arcade.

Local Tips for Bournemouth







Boscombe Pier




by Danielle Robins

Danielle loves travelling to exotic spots, and uncovering hidden bars and clubs with her friends.


I travel to Bournemouth regularly for work and after a busy day, I like to take a walk along the beach towards Boscombe Pier - and away from the crowds. The Urban Reef Restaurant is a great, chilled place to have some first-class food and its balcony offers the most amazing views!

Boscombe Pier, Undercliff Drive, Bournemouth BH5 1








Candlelight Nights




by Lauren Mannion

Resident in Mexico City, Lauren loves photography and writing about all her travels.


When I was little I loved the Candlelight Nights held in the Lower Gardens. On Wednesday evenings in summer, tea lights are placed in coloured glass holders and families flock to light the candles. Best of all, it’s free – you'll find lit tapers at the stall next to the crazy golf.

Hengistbury Head to Mudeford Quay




by Nathan Payne

Welsh Nathan likes escaping to the country and coast where he can feel the sand between his toes.


Hengistbury Head is a beautiful coastal nature reserve that’s packed full of wildlife. It has fantastic sea views – you can even see the Isle of Wight on a clear day! If you walk past the colourful beach huts along Mudeford Spit, you can take the little ferry across to Mudeford Quay.

Transportation





Bournemouth Transportation









Air- Bournemoth Airport



Bournemouth Airport is located 6 km north-east of the city and is easily accessed by the Yellow Bus A1 route, which takes 20 minutes to reach the railway station. It runs between 07.00 and 20.00, 7 days a week and a single ticket costs GBP 2.10. Taxis can be found outside the terminal and should have official markings and badges showing. Journeys cost between GBP 30 and 40 to the city centre.




Manchester Airports Group
www.bournemouthairport.com











Air- Southampton Airport



Southampton Airport offers more national and international connections than Bournemouth Airport and is just a 35-minute train journey away. There are further swift rail connections to cities including Portsmouth, Reading and London with the station just a minute’s walk from the terminal. Taxis can be found outside the terminal but bear in mind that a journey to Bournemouth would cost in the region of GBP 60 each way. The airport closes between 23.00 and 05.00.




AGS Airports
www.southamptonairport.com











Train



The city has 2 main stations, Bournemouth Central and Pokesdown, which offers connections to Boscombe’s beaches. The city’s Central Station is a hub for local buses run by More Bus and Yellow Buses with the airport connection stopping here. Taxis stop outside and train tickets can be bought at machines inside. The station offers regular connections to Weymouth, Poole, Manchester and London, as well as surrounding towns.




South West Trains
www.southwesttrains.co.uk











Bus



The city's reliable bus network is run mainly by Yellow Buses, as well as some other operators. Tickets can be bought on board but change is generally not given. Single fares cost between GBP 1.50 and 2.10, depending on the journey length, while all-day tickets are GBP 3.90. Colour-coded bus routes generally run from 06.30 until between 23.00 and 00.00. A night bus single ticket will cost GBP 3 and these later routes are available between 00.00 and 05.00.




Yellow Buses
www.bybus.co.uk











Taxi



Taxis are offered by several providers in the city and can be booked in advance, or be picked up around the centre and train station. Most taxis offer a facility to pay by card and fares are charged according to a meter. Some fares will incur a surcharge after midnight and if you travel outside the city boundaries. After bars close on the weekends, you may have to queue at ranks, or wait longer for a taxi as it will be busy.










Car



If you’re travelling around the city centre, it’s best to stick to foot, or public transport. Public parking, both during the day and at night, is subject to charges that start around GBP 1.30 per hour, and range from GBP 10 to 12 for a whole day’s parking. On-street parking can be subject to restrictions according to areas and times, and you cannot park on double yellow tram lines. Rental car companies can be found around the centre and at the airport.
