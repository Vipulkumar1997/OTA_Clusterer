I loved the art deco feel.  I had a fridge.  Most important, I was a minute walk from Hollywood and Highland mall, Chinese Theatre, Dolby Theatre, walk of fame.  The staff, especially K, the receptionist, were so helpful. I loved that serve yourself breakfast was included.  This place has a wonderful guest house feeling and the white decor was so clean.

Beverly Hills Guest House









“
The location was perfect. The guest house was questionable. Furniture (chair) was torn, you needed to put toilet paper in a basket instead of toilet, a note was left that they are on a sewer system ( I wish I knew that prior to booking).

How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
