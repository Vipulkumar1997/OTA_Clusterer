Kuala Lumpur Travel Guide










The Happening Hub of Southeast Asia
Climb to astonishing heights a midst the skyscrapers of Kuala Lumpur. Look up at the Petronas Towers and, if you’re feeling fit, participate in one of the foot races to the top of the Kuala Lumpur Tower. When you descend the mixture of cultures that make up this vibrant city will greet you.
The capital of Malaysia offers a colorful array of cultures, cuisines and shopping opportunities. Kuala Lumpur’s diversity is on center stage in China town’s Petaling Street, the food stalls on Jalan Alor, the history of Merdeka Square and the temples and mosques scattered throughout the city. 
As the temperature soars in the year-round heat, find refuge in the manicured greenery of the Lake Gardens. Air-conditioning offers more comfort in the famous shopping malls including the Suria KLCC, where anyone can find the perfect gift or memento.
If you’re travelling in South East Asia, there’s a good chance you’ll fly into Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Within 30 minutes you can be in the heart of a city which offers every type of accommodation from spas to budget rooms, 5-star hotels to dormitories. No matter what your budget, with 250+ hotels Booking.com has a place for you in KL.

The city has a mix of culture and innovation, Asian and...

The city has a mix of culture and innovation, Asian and Western... not many sights but you can have many experiences such as walking around KLCC park and catch the water show - the light show is great. Petronas Twin Towers has a fun and organized tour but you get an amazing view of it from KL Tower - 10 to 15 minutes walking distance. You can have a taste of almost everything around town, I had Brazilian dinner one night, English another, local food as well... a little bit of everything for everyone. Depending on when you go, be prepared for the tropical rain. Sometimes it lasts for a very short period but it could last for a whole afternoon - it didn’t bother me however some people could be bothered by it. Lastly, getting around is super easy. If you don’t want to use public transportation - which isn’t a hard thing to do if you are not in a rush -, you can use Uber or Grab (they are very cheap and more trustworthy that most cab drivers). Overall, a fun place to visit.

The city, shopping malls and many more are so great!

The city, shopping malls and many more are so great!! It was so good to have monorail, LRT, GRAB, UBER transportation and many more. What I dont like are 1) GST 2) The worker who works at branded shopping mall, they looked down to us just because of our outfit looks doesn’t belongs to their shop. 3) i want more bridge or zebra cross to across the big highway road.

We have been kept warned by the local people about the theft around the area. Everyone told us to keep our jewels and mobile phones safely as the risk of snatching is high. This was little disappointing and worrying.








Hotels That Guests Love in Kuala Lumpur





NU Hotel @ KL Sentral









“
NU Sentral Mall & KL Sentral Station is just merely 5 minutes walk from this hotel. This hotel is newly opened & renovated from an old budget hotel.
”






Hotel Pudu 88 @ China Town









“
It is close to chinatown. The airport-shuttlebus stops 5 min away from pudu 88. It is a good spot to get picked up by a Uber. Good budget hotel.
”






The Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur, Autograph Collection









“
The hotel staff is very helpful and offered an early check-in. The location is opposite KL railway station and nearby independence square. KL Sentral (where the airport express train and a big interchange for public transportation) is quite close. However, have to either take hotel shuttle or taxi, no public transportation to KL Sentral and walking distance a bit too far.
”






Prescott Hotel Kuala Lumpur Sentral









“
It's located near the main train station Kl Sentral, about 5 minutes walk, hotel offers all necessary toiletries and daily cleaning. Staff members were very helpful and nice. Ok for a short budget stay
”






Silka Cheras Kuala Lumpur









“
The hotel was really desaster , bad location , noisy and dirty but the staff was friendly .. I belam booking.com because they minchin 4 star hotel but actually when saw the hotel was just a 3 star hotel
