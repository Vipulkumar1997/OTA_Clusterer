Perth Travel Guide










Serene as the Swan
Sun-drenched and laid-back, Perth is simply a joy to be in. However, the West Australian capital does have tourist attractions, such as the Colonial-era mint, important in the country’s gold industry. East is the WACA, a must-see for cricket fans, and the city is also mad for Aussie Rules football.
The city center has the historic Government House and Supreme Court, both dwarfed by the ultra-modern skyscrapers a few streets behind. The best skyline view is from leafy King’s Park, near the War Memorial overlooking the Swan River below, named after its black swans. Across the river in Perth Zoo are more native animals including koalas, crocodiles and free-hopping kangaroos.
Boats to the zoo leave from the Barrack Street jetty by a sail-shaped bell tower. Other day trips from Perth include Rottnest Island and Fremantle, down the river in the opposite direction from Perth Airport.
The apartments, B&Bs; and hotels in Perth are spread all over this fantastic city, interspersed with restaurants serving specialties such as western rock lobster and chili mussels. There are also a wealth of bars, many playing the indie music that the city is known for. Local brews from Swan Brewery and wines from the Swan Valley vineyards round off the evening.

Perth city was great with free public transportation (CAT buses for free and other buses as well if inside the city). You have to pay if you are traveling outside the city.City is clean, well planned, laid back and does not seem to be in a rush.Transportation (train and bus) is awesome. People are very friendly and helpful and always ready to help.Elizabeth quay (walking distance from city) is a nice little park. Then go around swan river to the brewery to have local beer along the cycling track.Northbridge (walking distance in perth or CAT bus) is good place with good food.Fremantle (Via direct train 7th station from Perth Underground)-Beautiful old city with nice restaurants and markets.Cottlesloe (Via direct bus from Elizabeth quay bus park)-Wonderful beach. Probably the cleanliest and least populated beaches I have ever been to until now.If you are traveling with you family the get a family ticket for around 12$ that will let all your family to travel with that ticket all day. That includes traveling through bus, train and ferry!!!Get the smart rider ticket for same price if you are traveling alone.Get a 20$ Vodafone sim if your stay is short (around 10 days).Perth is really such a beautiful place that looks expanding day by day. The city looks so young!!!

I stayed in the hills behind Perth and there were some lovely little wineries offering great food. Beaches are wonderful especially Scarborough and Mandurah is a very nice holiday place about an hours drive from Perth. Nice restaurants on the foreshore.

You could find any international food from different country.
