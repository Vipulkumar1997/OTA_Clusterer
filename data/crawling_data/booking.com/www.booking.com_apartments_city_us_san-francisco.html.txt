Hotels That Guests Love in San Francisco




Pier 2620 Hotel Fisherman's Wharf









“
Loved the carefully curated interior of the hotel, which is located near Pier 39 and Fisherman's Wharf.  It boosts modern San Francisco chic and is yet cozy. Would love to decorate my apartment that way. Bed was super-comfy. Breakfast was also real nice. The concierge service was great too, they've really made me feel welcome and followed up with text messages.
”






Mystic Hotel by Charlie Palmer









“
I had a great stay at the Mystic Hotel. I was visiting San Francisco and was looking for a place to stay that was a good value and the Mystic was definitely it. The complimentary breakfast was a great way to start my day. The room reminded me of a studio apartment and I loved the ambiance. If I'm in SF again, I will definitely be back.
”






The Fairmont Heritage Place Ghirardelli Square









“
The location of the property is great for those who wish to explore San Francisco. The 2 Trolley lines are both only a few blocks away and the location makes it very easy to explore Fishermans Wharf and all its amenities such as the Alcatraz tour, etc.  The apartment it self was very clean and tidy and had everything that you would expect regarding furnishings.
”






The Opal









“
i caught an Uber to Pier 39 from hotel and it was only $8. Older hotel no doubt, but was clean and reasonable prices for San Francisco Bed was comfortable, pillows were a little flat though.
”






Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco









“
Felt like our own little San Francisco apartment, never felt like I was in a hotel!  Would stay again.

Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
