Things to Do in Auckland









Sky Tower

In to win? Sky Tower is prime territory for a fun night out. Its casino was fraught with controversy when it opened in the mid-Nineties, with locals seeing it as little more than a heathen’s den. These days, the boil has reduced to a simmer, with bars, fine dining, theatres, convention centres and an award-winning hotel. Sear to the top and take a bungy jump … if you dare!



Corner Victoria and Federal Street, Auckland 1010




Open Sunday-Thursday 08:30-22:30, Friday-Saturday 08:30-23:30. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Viaduct Harbour

Auckland is a foodie’s best friend. Famous for its casual dining and brunches, not to mention its nightlife, the “Viaduct” is as open as the faces you’ll see downtown. Try Kermadec, the eons-old Auckland seafood staple, or cross the lifting bridge to Wynyard Quarter, where retro warehouse-style mega-bars and the Auckland Fish Market await (the sushi’s to die for!).



Viaduct Harbour, Auckland 1010









Auckland War Memorial Museum and Domain

Every Aucklander, young and old, will remember coming here for school trips and field days. This museum tells the story of New Zealand and is a link to the country’s collective memory. Stroll aisles of Māori and Pacific artefacts, like the full-scale Te Toki a Tapiri waka (war canoe) and marae (Māori meeting house), plus the moving “Hall of Remembrance” to NZ’s war-fallen.



The Auckland Domain, Parnell, Auckland 1010




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00.









Eden Park

“We’re not playing tiddlywinks here, mate!”. The words of former All Blacks captain Tana Umaga say it all – rugby is a national obsession. From Lomu to Meads, Muliaina to Shelford, All Blacks’ greats have scrummed, kicked-off and “haka”-ed here to roaring crowds. Take a tour of the grounds to relive the glory days of their 23-match winning streak between 1987 and 1990.



Reimers Ave, Kingsland, Auckland 1024




Check website for details.









Auckland Zoo

The dragon lives! 100 licks of paint later, the zoo’s sculpture lives on to entertain another generation of children. See him, the regulars, and a host of endangered creatures – like the shy brown kiwi, tuatara (an ancient reptile that predates the dinosaurs), skinks, geckos, and a forest-sized aviary with a rainbow of native birds, like the tūī, kākā, kea and morepork.



Motions Road, Auckland 1022




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30-17:30. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Kelly Tarlton's SEA LIFE Aquarium

Swim beneath the Pacific without flexing a calf muscle. A conveyer belt will move you slowly though an underwater world of slashing stingrays, silly seahorses, camo-coloured wobbly wobbegongs and schools of snap-happy sharks. Speaking of which, there’re shark dives for the adventurous, and king penguins for the not so adventurous (but still curious). Fun for all the family!



23 Tamaki Drive, Orakei, Auckland 1071




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30-17:00.









MJ Savage Memorial Park (Bastion Point)

Culturally significant. The monument here is dedicated to NZ’s first elected Labour prime minister, but it’s what you don’t see that matters most here. In the Seventies, the local Ngāti Whātua tribe opposed the development of high-cost real estate in the area. They succeeded – and today, the open views of Auckland Harbour and Rangitoto Island are unmatched.



Orakei, Auckland 1071









Waitakere Ranges

Time stops here. 16,000-hectares of volcanic mountains covered in rainforest, waterfalls and a chorus of native tūī and kererū birds. Sound good? Whether you trek, picnic or surf, the Waitakere Ranges arrest the senses. Try the rugged half-day Omanawanui Track, recover on Whatipu Beach, then drive to fam-friendly Piha Beach, where waves pound endlessly against Lion Rock.



Waitakere Ranges, Auckland 0772









Auckland Botanic Gardens

Barely a millennium has passed since humans first set foot in NZ, where trees and plant life had thrived unimpeded for thousands of years. This park is a tiny piece of paradise reclaimed; a quiet, contemplative refuge for all. Walk in mighty kauri forests, swan by crimson-coloured pōhutukawa, beds of thyme and canary-coloured dahlias, or take an easy trek in Tōtara Park.



102 Hill Road, Auckland 2105




Open Monday-Sunday 08:00-20:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Waiheke Island

Weekend getaway? You and everyone else! This beloved retreat in the Hauraki Gulf is the scene for city-folks on weekend bungalow breaks, vineyard-hopping wine lovers out for a delectable vintage (try Mudbrick – both wine and views are unmatched) and “cool dads” at Omaha Beach building sandcastles with their kids. Sanctuary is barely 45-minutes from Downtown Wharf by ferry.

Very Good


We have always liked Auckland but this trip was all about Family, and Health, problems, so we really only stayed one night Taupo and the rest of the trip in Gisborne with older Family members, and the drive there and back was Beautiful Great country to drive through

Lots of activity. Over crowded busy. Roads congested and hectic. Signage on routes can be confusing. Pick your places carefully and know your roads well. Drivers are very impatient.  Expect delays on motorways. Read and know where you are going. Plan ahead and leave early.

A bit expensive in some respects especially transport. Read the fine print when hiring cars. Otherwise it's a pretty clean city and the people are friendly and mostly helpful.

Popular Neighborhoods in Auckland












Auckland Central Business District


285 properties

From within, Auckland’s CBD contains a cluster of mini districts. Cool kids head to Britomart and High Street to shop: try Pauanesia for “Kiwiana” and Untouched World for sustainable clothes. Try open-air occidental dining at the family-friendly Eliot Stables, or see Māori and Polynesian art at the Auckland Art Gallery (dazzling after its $90 million upgrade!).

Accommodations in Auckland Central Business District













North Shore


186 properties

Say sure to the shore! Each suburb has its own flavor – Albany with its vibrant South African community, Takapuna for beaches and café culture, Devonport for a historic experience (and its haunting WWII barracks), and Greenhithe for solitude amid the evergreens. Hint: head further north to Long Bay, one of the city’s quietest beaches.

Accommodations in North Shore













Manukau


111 properties

Manukau gets some flak for its urban grit – but that’s only half the story. Each suburb is teeming with openness and warmth. For proof, visit Otara Markets on Saturday for Pacific street food and bootleg beats, Botany Town Centre and Westfield Manukau for one-stop shops, or Manurewa’s Botanical Gardens for a walk through NZ’s diverse flora and fauna.

Accommodations in Manukau













Viaduct Harbour


62 properties

This downtown dive has transformed from blah to hurrah! Auckland’s powers-that-be pumped money into developing this former no-go zone, building it up for the 2000 Louis Vuitton Cup yacht race. Today, the Viaduct and adjacent Wynyard Quarter are shrines to dining, bars and clubs. Whip over the lifting bridge to Wynyard Quarter for the same, only newer.

Accommodations in Viaduct Harbour













Britomart


44 properties

Only the façade remains of Auckland’s historic Post Office, now a transportation hub next to Downtown Shopping Centre. Shiny office blocks, haute diners and happening bars here represent the New Auckland – outwardly focused, chic and decorated with kiwis’ irrepressible taste for 60's retro and kitsch. Plus there’s an A+ gourmet hot dog stand (Dogmatic).

Accommodations in Britomart













Queen Street


36 properties

Stomping ground of students and nine-to-fivers. See the top attractions: The Civic, one of the world’s last surviving “atmospheric theaters”; Albert Park, with students from the two city universities studying under the oak trees; Aotea Square for frequent festivals; or just shop 'til the credit stops at the hipster haunts around Vulcan Lane and High Street.

Accommodations in Queen Street













Waitakere


34 properties

West Auckland is vast, but there are four must-dos: take the easy Omanawanui Track, a half-day adventure through native rain forest; sip on a flat white in the hippie enclave of Titirangi, a tiny township with links to vineyards (try Artisan in Henderson); and enjoy a day at breathtaking Piha Beach – for experienced surfers, runners, hikers and sunbathers.

Accommodations in Waitakere













Auckland Airport Area


21 properties

Strictly business. Freight forwarders, distribution centers, hotels, motels and “Holiday Inns” surround Auckland’s Airport Oaks. After touchdown, there’s little to compel the casual traveler to stay here – other than teeing off at the 18-hole Aviation Golf Club, or experiencing the medley of languages and Pacific cultures in Mangere Town Centre.

Accommodations in Auckland Airport Area













Parnell


10 properties

Parnell rising. Having recently shed its old-fashioned feel, this well-off, city-fringe suburb is flooded with techie start-ups and boutiques. Go to Parnell Rise (the main strip) on Friday night to dine and mingle with Auckland’s young movers-and-shakers – try Mink for café cool, Cibo for designer desserts or Non Solo Pizza for the best slice in town!

Accommodations in Parnell











Local Tips for Auckland







Takutai Square




by Cayla

Born and raised in Auckland, Cayla loves the city's beaches and great range of restaurants.


A green oasis in the heart of a concrete jungle, Takutai Square is a great spot to slow down and relax. In summer the lawn is dotted with beanbags, perfect for basking in the sun. The space also hosts live music and open-air cinema nights.

How can you enjoy the sights in Auckland while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


Queen Street is very busy, the rest of the streets aren't too bad except in the premium drive time hours, 5 - 6 PM. The city is very hilly, so be prepared for steep walks up and down. If it's really busy, look for a local park to relax for a bit and then set out again - great parks tucked in all over, with Albert Park being in the City center.

Transportation





Auckland Transportation









Air



The fastest connection from Auckland Airport to the city centre is by taxi: the 30-minute journey will set you back NZD 60–90. A cheaper option is the Airbus Express: NZD 16 (NZD 6 for kids; one-way) will get you to the city centre in around an hour. The 24-hour service runs every 10–15 minutes by day and every 20–30 minutes by night. Tickets can be purchased from a ticket machine, online or on board (cash only). Shuttle buses and rental cars can also be arranged at the airport or in advance.




Auckland Airport
www.aucklandairport.co.nz











Train



Britomart Transport Centre is the city’s main train station, with services running to the east, south, west and to Onehunga. Newmarket is the second major station. Trains operate between 06:00–00:00, running every 15–30 minutes. Tickets can be purchased at all stations, and range in price from NZD 2 to NZD 5. You can also load money onto an AT HOP card which can be used on all Auckland Transport train, bus and ferry services.




Auckland Transport
at.govt.nz











Bus



Auckland has an extensive bus network, with Britomart Transport Centre as the main hub. The City Link (red bus) serves the city centre, running every 10 minutes from 07:00–23:20. Tickets can be purchased at stations for NZD 1 (NZD 0.50 for kids), or you can use a pre-loaded AT HOP card. For travel to outer suburbs, use the Inner LINK bus: tickets are NZD 2.50 (NZD 1.50 for kids) each way.




Auckland Transport
at.govt.nz











Taxi



Taxis in Auckland are efficient, but expensive in comparison to the reliable public transport network. They can be hailed or pre-booked, and prices vary by taxi company – rates are displayed on the side of the vehicle and online. Air New Zealand Taxi and Airport Transfers allows you to pre-book taxis for a fixed fare.










Ferry



Ferries are a great way to explore Auckland’s surrounding islands, including Waiheke, Rangitoto and Devonport. Tickets can be purchased at terminals, with prices starting at NZD 6. You can also use a pre-loaded AT HOP card. The Auckland Ferry Terminal is where most major services depart.




Auckland Transport
at.govt.nz











Car



If you plan to travel outside the city, the north, south and north-west motorways are the main routes. Driving is on the left-hand side and rush hour is between 07:00–09:00 and 16:00–20:00. There are park-and-ride facilities at train stations, while parking in suburban areas is usually free. City centre spaces can be limited and hourly prices range from NZD 16 to NZD 24. Downtown Carpark offers weekend rates as low as NZD 2 per hour and a maximum of NZD 10 per day.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
