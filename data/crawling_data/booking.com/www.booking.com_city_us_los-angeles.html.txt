Los Angeles Travel Guide










City of Angels
Exploring Los Angeles, the place where movies are made, you feel like you’re in a dream. Santa Monica Pier is the end point of the fabled Route 66, while just south is bohemian Venice Beach, lined by tall, swaying palms. Go slightly inland from the boardwalk to catch a  glimpse of the canals that earned the area its name.
Head north to the golden beach and stunning scenery of Malibu and see why movie stars over the decades have settled here. Also popular with the rich and famous are Bel Air and Beverly Hills, home to exclusive Rodeo Drive.
And the reason for all this glitz and glamour? Hollywood, of course! Sitting high on a hill, the iconic sign is visible for miles around, while below the gold stars on Hollywood Boulevard immortalize celebrities of past and present.  Be there on premiere night to see them grace the red carpet of Grauman’s Chinese Theater.
Over the hill is Universal Studios, with behind-the-scenes tours as well as rides. Next door are the Warner Brothers Studios, and Paramount Studios are closer to Downtown LA.
Whether you decide to live like a star in a luxury LA hotel or choose a cheap motel through Booking.com, it’s worth renting a car to get around this sprawling city and out to Los Angeles Airport (LAX).

LA is a bit sketchy in places but if you’re going to a show in the Hollywood area and you need a great place to stay, I’d highly recommend the Loews hotel.  Super cool and just a great staff.  Excellent if you are traveling with a pet.

The Getty Museum was wonderful!

The Getty Museum was wonderful! The Griffith Observatory has great views of the city at night. Plan your day around morning and evening rush hour but there’s no way to completely escape traffic woes.  Lots of delicious food for vegans including my favorite donut place Donut Friend!

Loved the organic food and restaurants, the fitness centres, the fashion and shopping, the LA Makeup Show, the tours, the theatre, the museums. The people are very friendly. The Uber is convenient and affordable. Accommodation was great. Loved it all😊

Go downtown, close your eyes, and take a big whiff.

Go downtown, close your eyes, and take a big whiff. Smells exactly like downtown San Diego! Human urine and excrement, prevail. Honestly, I don’t know how you can expect folks to enjoy the awesome businesses while seeing and smelling the filth on the streets.

So much activity and character in the different LA...

So much activity and character in the different LA neighborhoods for the whole family. Breakfast at a Melrose cafe, dropped the teenagers at Universal Studios for the day, then shops, lunch and a glass wine in Larchmont. Hang out in Santa Monica with beach and boardwalk vists. Sunset view of LA and the Hollywood sign from Griffith Observatory, then dinner and an evening exploring "Hollyweird." Just the tip of the iceberg. Enjoy!

Uber is a fantastic way of getting around LA.

Uber is a fantastic way of getting around LA. Not too expensive, fast friendly comfy efficient service, perfect for a tourist.If you are a thrill seeker go to Universal Studios. Our driver also recommended Knotts berry Farm for thrills but we ran out of time. If you have kids under 10 go to Disneyland. You'll need at least 2 days to get around Disneyland with kids Hollywood blvd, the walk of fame, needs a make over so it looks like Rodeo Dr that's what a tourist is expecting to see. I recommend going on a Hollywood tour, great way to see the city. We ate at expensive restaurants and cheaper local diners and I must say the diner was the best hands down. Not crowded, fast service, the food was quick, salads were fresh and the flavours were delicious.

Americas Best Value Inn Los Angeles- 7th Street









“
Location is optimum to explore Los Angeles: 5 minutes to downtown and to nearest Metro (7th / Metro), which has connections to several lines and to Union Station (if arriving via AMTRAK)!!!
”






Sea Rock Inn - Los Angeles









“
Wanted a good price near LA airport (LAX). This was relatively cheap, but well-run. Everything worked, bed was comfortable and clean, parking is in the courtyard area, there is a pool. Don't miss eating at the unique Eatalia restaurant which is very close, and the Burnt Tortilla has good Mexican food.
