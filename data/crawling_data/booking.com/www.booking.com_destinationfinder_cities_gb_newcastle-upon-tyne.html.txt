Visit Newcastle upon Tyne: Your Travel Guide

Things to Do in Newcastle upon Tyne









Grey Street

Get to know the Earl Grey of teatime fame and take a sip of Britishness on a street dedicated to the man himself. From the foot of the Earl’s 7-storey monument, Grey Street sweeps grandly before you. Tuck into a Full English at Blakes then revisit the swinging 60s in High Bridge’s vintage shops. For the best of British dance and drama the Theatre Royal has it all, and even a good old pantomime!



Grey Street, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 6EE









St James' Park

Who said black and white was a thing of the past? The city’s football stadium is a star player in Newcastle’s line up. Follow the crowds of black and white football strips on match day as they stream from the city centre towards the stadium. If you’re not around to see the team play you can still take a peek behind the scenes, with stadium tours available daily.



Barrack Road, Newcastle upon Tyne NE1 4ST




Open Monday–Friday 09:00–17:30, Saturday 09:00–18:00, Sunday 11:00–17:00. Check website for details.









Castle Garth

How new is Newcastle’s castle? It may be nearing its 1000th birthday, but the Keep is still alive with activity. Timeworn stones echo anew with regular film screenings, historical talks and festive events. The adventurous can even join murder mystery evenings, but mind that the castle’s resident ghosts don’t try to steal the show!



Black Gate & Castle Keep, Castle Garth, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear NE1 1RQ




Open Monday–Friday 10:00–17:00









The Great North Museum

The Hancock is Newcastle’s very own time machine. Meet the local Romans, brush up on your hieroglyphics and even try your fiercest roar on the resident T-rex. Built over a century ago to house the growing collection of the local Natural History Society, you’ll find flora and fauna from around the world. Check out their calendar for events that bring the museum’s stories to life.



Great North Museum: Hancock, Barras Bridge, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4PT

Life Science Museum

Meanwhile, back at the lab… Newcastle’s got something brewing. Jump into the action on the 4D Motion Ride, explore the universe at the planetarium and meet aspiring Einsteins in the Experiment Zone. The fun’s open to all ages, with interactive games available for even the littlest of scientists. Come along, get experimental and discover something new about Newcastle.



Times Square, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne And Wear NE1 4EP

Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art

If you like to get inside the head of the artist then prepare for a mind-bending experience. The BALTIC is the region’s home of quirk and eccentricity. Stimulate your senses, step onto the canvas or be part of the art. If the gallery’s exhibitions aren’t inspiring enough, check out the cityscape from the 6th floor roof terrace or drink in the views at Six restaurant.



Gateshead Quays, South Shore Rd, Gateshead NE8 3BA




Open Wednesday–Monday 10:00–18:00, Tuesday 10:30–18:00.









The Biscuit Factory

The Biscuit Factory’s delectable contents are sadly not for nibbling. This gallery is a treasure trove for craft and design lovers, with exhibitions of ceramics, jewellery and artwork adorning the spaces beneath its vaulted ceilings. In the market for a masterpiece? You’re in the right place. Others might prefer a little food-art at the gallery’s Artisan restaurant.



16 Stoddart Street, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 1AN




Open Monday–Friday 10:00–17:00, Saturday 10:00–18:00, Sunday 11:00–17:00.









Metro Radio Arena

Get ready to sing your heart out! The Metro Arena is where all of the biggest names play when visiting the region. Beyoncé, Metallica, Kylie Minogue, Pavarotti… it’s even hosted all-night dance events for the truly dedicated! Comedy tours, ice performances and championship boxing are also on the list of events, just check out their calendar for more details.



Arena Way, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear NE4 7NA




Check website for details.









MetroCentre

Metrocentre, you are my Everest. This mammoth shopping centre is practically its own destination. Shops, restaurants, a cinema and entertainment park… it even has a train station! Famously one of the UK’s biggest shopping centres, it’d take over an hour just to walk past each of its storefronts. After all that exercise, why not end your spree with a foot massage at Herbal Inn?



Gateshead, Tyne and Wear NE11 9YG




Open Monday–Friday 10:00–17:00, Saturday 10:00–18:00, Sunday 11:00–17:00.









Angel of the North

The Angel welcomes travellers to the North with a vast embrace. Its out-stretched wings have a span almost as wide as that of a jumbo jet, and its rusty form towers over the surrounding landscape. Visitors by road and rail will see the Angel as they approach Tyneside, but to meet her in person you can hop on bus 21 or 22 from Eldon Square in central Newcastle.



Durham Road, Low Eighton, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear NE9 6AA









Quayside Area

Quayside is Newcastle’s bar-hopping district. Every weekend, the evening brings out the revelers – all looking to let their hair down in the bars and clubs. Brewdog serves craft beer for the more discerning beer lover, Aveika is Quayside’s cocktail capital, and Pitcher & Piano is a high-end gastropub overlooking the Tyne. After closing time, head to Riverside Club for music and snacks.








World Headquarters

A place for true music lovers – WHQ is about keeping it real, taking clubbing back to its roots, and bringing communities together through the medium of groove. Leave your bro-steppin’ at the door, come together with music lovers of all backgrounds, and get down to the freshest funk, soul, hip-hop and old-school house.








Ouseburn Area

This former industrial area has been reborn as a hub of creativity and fun. During the day artists’ studios, galleries, and an independent cinema set the scene. And there’s plenty to sink your teeth into at night, too. The Cumberland Arms stands out above the rest – this old-style bar stocks a wide variety of ales and ciders plus hosts comedy, music, and film screenings upstairs.








The Gate Complex

After dark, this complex trades shoppers for party-goers. On rainy nights, the succession of bars under one roof is a godsend – no wet hair, no running makeup, and no soaked pants. Take your pick from Opera Piano Bar, Players, Sam Jacks, Beyond, and more.

Popular Neighborhoods in Newcastle upon Tyne












Quayside


36 properties

The Tyne Bridge rests tiara-like over the city skyline – no wonder the Quayside is the area’s crowning glory. By day, culturites bustle over the sleek Millennium Bridge to the BALTIC gallery and Sage concert hall. By night, these architectural masterpieces cast a spectrum of light over the river as locals totter between the city’s busiest bars.

Accommodations in Quayside













Newcastle City Center


33 properties

Welcome to the core of Newcastle life. You need shops? Hit Eldon Square. You need nightlife? Strut your stuff on Collingwood Street. You need a “stottie” sandwich (this is a statement, not a question) – pop to Greggs bakery. For a truly Instagrammable afternoon, catch lunch at Two Fifths restaurant then relax and recharge at Pink Lane Coffee.

Accommodations in Newcastle City Center













Jesmond


21 properties

Hop on the metro and skip over to Leafy Jesmond. This village-like suburb is just outside the city centre, with a mix of well-to-do locals and a lively student population. Bask in a little luxury at Sohe Asian fusion restaurant – their culinary gems and bespoke cocktails will spark off your evening before a night out on Osborne Road.

Accommodations in Jesmond













Chinatown


2 properties

It’s that story of East meets North. Newcastle’s Chinatown may not sprawl like the markets of Shanghai, but it does have some hidden treasures. The main strip on Stowell Street welcomes you with its grand Chinese archway and traditional lanterns. For something a bit eclectic, explore the menu at Nudo for artistic sushi and yummy noodles.

Local Tips for Newcastle upon Tyne







Central Arcade Shopping




by Jaime

The song “Wherever you go you’re sure to find a Geordie” is pretty much Jaime’s theme tune.


Whenever I’m in the city centre I like to stroll through Central Arcade, just south of Grey’s Monument. Its ornate tiling and mosaics will make you feel like you just stepped into another century! You’ll also find the official tourist board shop for all of your Geordie nick-knacks!

Tyneside Cinema




by Kirstie

Kirstie loves cooking and will always seek out the best restaurants around.


The Tyneside Cinema is a great place to catch an independent movie and it’s also the only full-time newsreel theatre left in the UK. They have free daily screenings of archive footage and guided tours around the Grade II-listed building, so you can really delve into the past.

Tourist ferries along the Tyne




by Niamh

Irish Niamh loves visiting the north of England and meeting its friendly locals!


A river cruise is the best way to see Newcastle’s quayside and the bridges over the River Tyne. Some boats offer sightseeing tours, while others host parties and dinners. Just watch you don’t get caught out in The Toon’s infamous fog!

Roman Wall / Hadrian's Wall




by Bruno

Italian Bruno likes to complete a day’s sightseeing with an old-school Italian aperitif.


Newcastle sits right on the edge of what was the Roman Empire. Hadrian’s Wall was built to mark the boundary and you can visit remains of the wall, as well as Roman fort reconstructions such as Segedunum in Wallsend and Arbeia in South Shields.

Minchellas (ice cream) at Shields beach




by Aimee

Despite leaving her hometown nearly 10 years ago, Sanddancer Aimee will always be proud of her northern roots!


If the sun is shining, hop on the metro and head over to neighbouring South Shields. You can stroll along the beach and enjoy an ice cream at Minchella’s Ice Cream Parlour. Ask for it with a flake and extra monkey’s blood – the local nickname for raspberry sauce!

O2 Academy for gigs




by Delfines

Hailing from Brittany, Delfines loves travelling to seek out a new beat and great rock scene.


Did you know that Jimi Hendrix and Sting’s musical roots stem from the Newcastle gigging scene? If you want to catch some indie bands or just let your hair down to some live music, then head to the O2 Academy near Central Station.

Victoria Tunnel




by Louise

Louise is a big kid at heart and loves a little adventure, trying out new places and unusual things.


Armed with a hard hat and torch, tour guides lead you through these secret tunnels as oblivious shoppers wander the streets above. This is definitely a treat for history lovers, as the guides detail the tunnels' history, including its use as an air raid shelter.

Seven Stories




by Olivia

Olivia loves planning fun days out with her family.


I like to take my young niece to Seven Stories. Decked out in fancy dress, their story-tellers are able to engage and entertain little ones too young to read. For your first visit, I recommend hiring a sensory backpack, which helps you connect with your little reader in a whole new way.

Head Of Steam




by Ben

Ben has toured the UK with his band, so knows a thing or two about great live music venues.


This cool pub is set over 2 floors with a stage for unsigned bands and DJs to play on, a vaulted cellar and an awesome beer selection. If you're buying, mine's a pint of Erdinger.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
