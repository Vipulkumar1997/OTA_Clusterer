Things to Do in Killarney









Ladies View

Lakes? Check. Mountains? Check. Gigantic expanse of sky you can stare at for hours? Check! Ladies View has all the classic elements of unforgettable scenery, but the fact it's part of the Ring of Kerry takes things up to the next level. Rugged peaks rise like sentinels on either side of a valley floor that's carpeted with greenery and the shimmering waters of the Killarney lakes. It's the kind of view where every feature combines to make a truly breathtaking composition.








Muckross House and Gardens

From the small and quiet to the grand and sublime, a trip to Muckross House captures the full range of Killarney's natural beauty. Parts of the gardens are carefully cultivated, with neat paths, manicured hedgerows and plants selected with an eye for detail, so their blooms create bursts of color. But look out over Lake Muckross and you'll be surprised by the wild side of the Irish countryside – rugged mountains arcing towards the sky, untamed acres of woodland, and glittering waters that look silver in the sun.








Muckross Traditional Farms

We've all dreamed of living a life of rural bliss – who wouldn’t enjoy some fresh air and freedom while surrounded by endless greenery and sweet birdsong? The Muckross Traditional Farms gives visitors an eye-opening glimpse into this ideal, where you can learn how farmers lived in an age without electricity or mechanization. You'll definitely get a new appreciation for how tough the working day must have been, but the views across the serenely stunning Killarney countryside are a relaxing reminder of the appeal of this long-lost lifestyle.








Innisfallen Island

In characteristic Irish fashion, this small island in the middle of Lough Leane is steeped in history and romance. After a short boat ride you can explore the remains of a 7th-century monastery where the Annals of Innisfallen—a history of ancient Ireland—were written. These long-abandoned ruins give you a sense of tranquillity and silence that's worlds away from the hectic pace of modern life. The grand, shining expanses of the Killarney Lakes only add to this feeling of serene contemplation.

Went there to see nice nature and I got to see The nature. Killarney national park is insanely beautiful, splendid, mind-blowing! Dingle peninsula, which is reachable from Killarney, is beautiful as well, but my top is the view on the lake beneath those misty mountains.

Verified reviews from real guests.

How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
