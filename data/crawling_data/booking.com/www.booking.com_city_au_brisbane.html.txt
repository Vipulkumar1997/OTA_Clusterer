Brisbane Travel Guide










Sun-drenched & Leafy
At the meeting point of Australia’s Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast, laid-back Brisbane is spread around the meandering river running through it. The river’s artsy South Bank is home to Australia’s largest modern art gallery, tranquil gardens and an artificial beach. Just across the river is the towering skyline of Brisbane's central business district, the location of many hotels in central Brisbane.
Nearby are the botanic gardens and Queen Street Mall, the most popular Brisbane shopping spot. There are more shopping centers all over the city, and the out-of-town malls include one in the Indooroopilly suburb by the foothills of Mount Coot-tha.
This green hill offers fabulous city views and has a planetarium, nature reserve and yet more botanic gardens. In Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary to the south, you can hug one of the lovable animals, while Australia Zoo – Steve Irwin’s legacy – is a good day trip.
Brisbane is a very leafy city and one of its parks, Wickham Park, contains the Old Windmill, Brisbane’s oldest building. To the northeast, the Fortitude Valley suburb is known for its vibrant music scene and Chinatown. Across the river in Woolloongabba is The Gabba or Brisbane Cricket Ground, and nearby is the bohemian West End district.
Booking.com has plenty of downtown hotels, and other accommodations near Brisbane Airport in a northeastern coastal suburb.

It's a great town.

It's a great town. Never met so many nice people in one place. Brisbane is great to chill a bit or take a trip to the surrounding areas.I wouldn't recommend a stay longer than one week as the sightseeing within the city seems limited.

Such an lovely easy city to get around.

Such an lovely easy city to get around. Loved the hire bikes and at $2 for 24 hours at 30 Minutes a time. There are so many bike stations that it was never a problem fitting the 30 minute slot in. Also loved the free city hopper boats on the river. Great food, great weather and accommodation for all budgets.

Nice city within reasonable distance of the koala sanctuary...

Nice city within reasonable distance of the koala sanctuary and Australia zoo. Driving around was fairly easy, especially with signs reminding you to keep left at every junction (we drive on the right).  Try to avoid driving during rush hour.If you are walking to mount coot-tha from the visitor center, you have to cross than main road that you eventually come to then the trail continues to the left. That's not so obvious....

Brisbane is a gorgeous city that I would recommend to anyone visiting Australia. It is very walkable and easy to get around, with many great sights right along the river. People are friendly and I felt very safe.

Two days in Brisbane is enough to get to know this beautiful city, go out and party, get on de free ferry, nice walks and other activities such as climbing.  A bad thing, everything closes too early! We went looking for something to eat on a Saturday night, 9:30 pm and no restaurant was serving dinner.

We love Brisbane because it is close to Gold Coast.

We love Brisbane because it is close to Gold Coast. Messy roads designs and definitely NOT recommended for first timer to rent a car and drove on Brisbane’s Roads. Because of the hilly structure of the city, roads can be quite dangerous some times there were even bicycle lane assigned IN BETWEEN a road-side parking lane and a single car lane!And GPS system is definitely not fast enough to react to the messy roads (and lanes) layout. It gets “reactive” sometimes and we find it dangerous.








Hotels That Guests Love in Brisbane





Limes Hotel









“

”






Novotel Brisbane Airport









“
Good location close to the airport and DFO and shops.  Far enough out of the CBD to be convenient for travel.
”






Meriton Suites Herschel Street









“
Lap pool, jacuzzi ,sauna and workout machines available. Washing machine and dryer in apartment. Full kitchen in 1 bedroom apartment. Partial view of Brisbane river. Comfortable king size bed. Very clean. Secured elevators to rooms. Lots of places to eat nearby. Transit station closeby. Tallest building in Brisbane city and can be seen from afar. Walking distance to Queen's Mall. Bike stations nearby. I totally enjoyed staying at Meriton Serviced Apartments.
”






The Point Brisbane - Hotel









“
This is such a comfortable hotel, with very helpful staff. It is where we always stay if we can when we visit Brissy. The location is great and the city and Southbank easily accessible with the free ferry.
”






Morgan Suites









“
Great CBD fringe location. Great for QPAC/Southbank. Short walk over the bridge to Suncorp Stadium, Transit Centre or the CBD. Parking has a high clearance (about 3m from memory) which is good if you have a high 4WD. Parking was very reasonably priced for this close to CBD.
