Restaurants and coffee shops are plenty. One just need to strategize when going back to your hotel during rush hour because of traffic and many passengers waiting for an available taxi.  If it is a walking distance from your hotel to your destination, one may opt to walk instead.

Its really fun now driving to and from the city of pines. Thanks for expressways. Baguio is one way city you'll keep on coming back. Just forget the traffic in Baguio its almost like Manila specially if you are planning to visit Trinidad look for alternative routes..

I wish I could’ve stayed a bit longer, so many places to visit, people are nice. Taxi drivers are good. But waiting to get a taxi takes long like forever😅.

Recommended in Baguio







Booking.com asked travelers...

Tell us a bit more about an adventure you experienced...





Anonymous


Baguio is located on top of the mountains in the far north of the Philippines. It is well known for fresh vegetables. It is the gateway to Benguet which is the rice terraces of the Philippines and natives are still wearing G-string ang native costumes. Mot houses in Baguio are built on the edge of the mountains and most locals including the old people speak fluent English language this is because of the previous American Base at Camp John Hay.

It made for a relaxing trip although driving to find our hotel and tourists attractions was very stressful because of the lack of directional signage.

2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
