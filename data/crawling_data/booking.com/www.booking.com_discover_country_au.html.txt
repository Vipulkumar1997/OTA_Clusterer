Put sightseeing, harbors and shopping on your to-do list for your next trip to Sydney!

Whether it's the quirky King Street in Newtown or the elegance of the Woollahra, traveling outside of the center uncovers each suburb's distinct flavor. The famous Bondi Beach is the starting point of a walk along the cliffs to the equally photogenic beaches of Bronte and Coogee. 
Sydney’s Kingsford Smith International Airport is the main gateway to this capital city and only a short distance from the city center. From a dorm bed in King’s Cross to a 5-star, serviced apartment in the central business district, Booking.com will ensure you don’t miss the excitement in this dynamic city down under.

Put sightseeing, relaxation and beaches on your to-do list for your next trip to Perth!

Boats to the zoo leave from the Barrack Street jetty by a sail-shaped bell tower. Other day trips from Perth include Rottnest Island and Fremantle, down the river in the opposite direction from Perth Airport. 
The apartments, B&Bs; and hotels in Perth are spread all over this fantastic city, interspersed with restaurants serving specialities such as western rock lobster and chilli mussels. There is also a wealth of bars, many playing the indie music that the city is known for. Local brews from the Swan Brewery and wines from the Swan Valley vineyards round off the evening.

shopping, food and restaurants are just a few reasons why travelers enjoy Melbourne.

South of the Yarra River is St Kilda, home to the best beach and Albert Park, where the F1 Australian Grand Prix is held. However, this isn't the city’s only sports heritage. It’s also the home of Aussie Rules soccer and the MCG, a must-see for cricket fans.
Booking.com has a range of Melbourne accommodations from hotels to hostels and motels, some near Melbourne Airport.

shopping, restaurants and food are just a few reasons why you’ll love Brisbane.

Brisbane is a very leafy city and one of its parks – Wickham Park – contains the Old Windmill, Brisbane’s oldest building. To the north-east, the Fortitude Valley suburb is known for its vibrant music scene and Chinatown. Across the river in Woolloongabba is The Gabba or Brisbane Cricket Ground, and nearby is the bohemian West End district. 
Booking.com has plenty of downtown hotels, and other accommodations near Brisbane Airport in a north-eastern coastal suburb.

“This is a great place to stay. It would be awesome with kids, I can't wait to bring my grandson back here. Stay 2 days and you get an awesome experience to go into the park prior to it opening and have time with the Dolphins and trainers. It was great. The water park within the hotel was also great. I loved this place.”
