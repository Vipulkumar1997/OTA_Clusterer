Things to Do in Cardiff









Cardiff Castle

Who goes there? This castle has a highly unusual set of guards. An animal army of stone pumas, lions, wolves and even sea lions lines the walled perimeter. Above them, flags from every country in the world fly at full mast, like a banner-based love letter from Cardiff to the world. Go in for the guided tour and explore the posh apartments with trappings fit for kings.



Cardiff Castle, CF10 3RB




Check website for details.









Millennium Stadium

Crouch! Touch! Pause! Engage! In rugby-mad Wales, this magnificent stadium is its high temple. For sport fans, it’s a must-visit. For a true taste of Cardiff, head down when the national team’s playing and the place is packed to the rafters. A pint of local Brains beer and the rousing strains of the “Land of My Fathers” anthem will send shivers down your spine.



Westgate Street, Cardiff. CF10 1NS




Open Monday–Saturday 10:00–17:00, Sunday 10:00–16:00. Check website for details.









Bute Park

Dreamers, let your imagination soar in Bute Park. Amidst rare maples and Fraser firs you’ll discover a kind of serenity that stirs the soul. The young writer Roald Dahl used to come here to work. Picture him lazing by the Taff River, pen in hand, as he rejoiced in the quiet of this urban woodland. Take a walk through the arboretum and let your ideas bloom alongside the poppies.



North Road, Cardiff, CF10 3DX




Open Monday-Sunday 07:30-19:00









Wales Millennium Centre

“In these stones horizons sing”. This moving motto is carved into the side of this cultural centre. When it opened, a piece of music with this same title was performed. A fitting beginning for a centre designed for the arts. Cardiff’s culture vultures come here to see the city’s best opera, ballet and theatre performances. It’s also home to a variety of bars and coffee shops.



Bute Place, Cardiff Bay CF10 5AL




Check website for details.









Cardiff Bay

Once upon a time this waterfront needed a makeover, and a makeover it got. Today, Cardiff Bay is the most desirable place to live in the city. You’ll see cone-carrying locals licking artisanal ice cream on rare sunny days, and foodies huddled inside seaside restaurants chomping down on Glamorgan sausage filled with cheese and leek, sipping pints of stout.



Bute Place, Cardiff Bay, Cardiff, CF10 5AL









Doctor Who Experience

"Whovians” unite. For TV lovers, this place needs no introduction. The Experience is a total immersion in "Who" culture. For die-hard fans, the steep ticket price is well worth it – with interactive exhibits, action-packed videos, and a huge collection of artefacts. Start your journey in the Gallifrey Museum, but quickly spiral into the threat-filled TARDIS.



Discovery Quay, Porth Teigr, Cardiff Bay, Cardiff, CF10 4GA




Open Sunday-Wednesday 10:00-15:30. Check website for details.









National Museum Cardiff

Take a spin through history. You don’t need a time machine to find out about the Big Bang or carnivorous dinosaurs - you just need the National Museum. Located on museum mile, this sturdy stone building is a wealth of “fossilised” knowledge. Art lovers, there’s something for you, too. In fact, its Impressionist collection rivals any in Europe. The best thing? It’s free!



National Museum Cardiff, Cathays Park, CF10 3NP




Open Tuesday–Sunday, 10:00–17:00. Check website for details.









Roath Park

Roath Park: the perfect place to stretch your legs. These rolling parklands and peaceful ponds provide an ideal setting, whether you want to jog off some Welsh pastries, play a casual game of tennis or simply stroll. Paths wind through wildflowers and under the shade of trees. You’ll also find pitches for rugby and football, and a well-equipped playground.



Lake Road East, Cardiff, CF23 5PG




Check website for details.









St Fagan's - National History Museum

Venture back in time. This open-air museum’s star attraction is its street of rebuilt buildings. Original churches, farmhouses and schools were taken from around Wales and reconstructed, brick by brick, on one winding street. The buildings are lined up according to age, so by the time you get to the end, you’re almost back in modern-day Wales.



Cardiff, South Glamorgan, CF5 6XB




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00









Castell Coch

The “Red Castle” is straight out of a fairy tale, with its princess towers and blushing, crimson bricks. The rolling hills around it only add to its fantastical atmosphere. Rumour is that this building was built as a gift from a wealthy suitor for his bride. Talk about an epic gesture of love. No wonder it’s one of Wales’ most popular places for couples to say “I do”.



Tongwynlais, Cardiff CF15 7JS




Open Monday-Saturday 10:00-16:00, Sunday 11:00-16:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Cardiff Arms Park

Rugby fans still talk about “that try.” RT In 1973, a packed Arms Park witnessed what most believe to be the greatest try ever scored – an end-to-end, seven-man move by the Barbarians against the All Blacks that was finished off by Welsh legend Gareth Edwards. These days, you can catch a Cardiff Blues game to see the stadium’s current tenants attempt to keep that free-flowing tradition alive.








Principality Stadium

A sacred spot for rugby − Wales’ national sport – the Principality Stadium is a colossal venue. Complete with a retractable roof, it’s primed for sport and spectacle viewing − whatever the unpredictable UK weather. Tours take in the ‘Dragon’s Lair’ dressing room, the players’ tunnel and the President’s Box, where you can survey the stadium like royalty and lift a trophy like a champion.








Cardiff City Stadium

While the Principality Stadium is all about rugby, this hallowed home-ground celebrates Wales’ next-favourite sport, football.  Book early to see Cardiff City F.C play on their home turf, or you may be lucky enough to see the national side make an appearance. The stadium also plays host to lively music gigs through the summer.








International Sports Village

Looking onto Cardiff Bay, this sprawling complex is one of the UK’s largest sport centres. There’s plenty to keep water (and ice) babies content with an Olympic-sized pool, an ice rink, and a kayak and white-water rafting centre. The velodrome hosts cycling classes and there’s a 3G astro-turf pitch perfect for football and rugby practice.

Very Good


Lots of sports activities going on and the big castle is interesting from the outside. However, the traffic is horrendous and I spent one hour to travel 3kms one evening. Massive new shopping centre has everything anyone may wish to buy.

Popular Neighborhoods in Cardiff












Cardiff Bay


39 properties

This is a city that loves to party, and every weekend Cardiff Bay fills with revellers. Its stylish waterfront bars provide a festive alternative to the landlocked streets closer to the centre. Rugby fans rejoice in knowing that legendary winger Billy Boston came of age on these very docks, sipping these same brews.

Accommodations in Cardiff Bay













Cardiff Center


32 properties

Cardiff has grown a lot in the past decades. The city centre’s designer shops and lovely boutiques bear witness to a drive that keeps up with its kindred European capitals. The Holy Trinity of shopping streets are St. Mary’s, the Hayes, and Queen. In all three you’ll find sophisticates swinging bags and tourists sifting through vintage wares.

Saint Augustine's Church




by Louise

London-dwelling Louise is lucky to have a brother living in Cardiff to show her around the city.

Morgan's Arcade




by Judith

Judith lives in Bristol and often nips across the water to check out Cardiff’s vintage shopping.


The architecture of this striking Victorian shopping arcade is as beautiful as the wares it sells. It’s filled with quirky, individual retailers as well as little cafés. The place takes on a really magical feel during winter when it’s adorned with fairy lights!

Transportation





Cardiff Transportation









Car



Cardiff is a compact city and you can reach most of its attractions by foot, as many areas are pedestrianised, such as the Taff Trail (which can be used for walking and cycling). Multi-storey car parks cost approximately GBP 2.50 an hour and there is metered on-street parking but be aware that some areas require a permit. The city also has plenty of cheap Park and Ride options, which are car parks set on the city outskirts offering public transport connections.










Boat



The city’s ferry service “Aquabus” runs between the city centre at Cardiff Castle Grounds and Mermaid Quay, stopping at Taff Mead Embankment, which is next to the Millennium Stadium. The ferry runs between 10.00 and 17.00 and costs GBP 4 each way.




Aquabus
www.aquabus.co.uk











Train



The train is used mainly to travel to the outskirts and other cities, although Cardiff Central offers a 10-minute connection to Rhoose Rail Interchange, which links you to the airport by a shuttle bus. Queen Street Station is set in the east of the city and offers the majority of connections to the outskirts, the valleys and the Vale of Glamorgan. Meanwhile, Cardiff Bay Station is a 5-minute walk from the bay itself and 25 minutes’ walk from the centre.




National Rail
www.nationalrail.co.uk











Bus



Turquoise and orange-coloured buses follow an anti-clockwise route and run from around 06.30 until 23.00. Remember that exact change must be used on the bus. A single ticket costs GBP 1.80 and a day ticket is GBP 3.60 within the central Cardiff zone. You can also purchase a top-up "iff" card, which will allow you to buy a weekly pass for GBP 15 and can be bought at several PayPoint vendors across the city.




Cardiff Bus
www.buscms.com











Taxi



Official taxis are registered with Cardiff City Council and should show yellow licenses with the driver’s photo displayed in the back of the taxi. The city has London-style “Hackney” black cabs and the “Taxi” light lit on their roof when they are available for hire. You can hail these black cabs or private-hire taxis at city-centre locations, including Central Station, Wood Street, Greyfriars Road and Park Place.
