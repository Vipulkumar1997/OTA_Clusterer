Things to Do in Cork









St. Patrick's Street

Better known as ‘Pana’ to Cork locals, this sweeping city-centre street is one of Ireland’s top shopping spots. St. Patrick’s Street is lined with 18th-century buildings that today house big-name brands and department stores. Buskers and street performers keep shoppers entertained, while a plethora of pubs and restaurants provide the perfect place for a pit-stop.








The English Market

This vibrant corner of Cork city centre has been a marketplace since 1788. Today its grand 19th-century hall houses colourful stalls that stock everything from freshly caught seafood to locally grown veggies. Pick up picnic supplies and tasty souvenirs downstairs, or tuck into traditional Irish dishes in the top-floor café.








Fitzgerald Park

If peace and quiet is what you seek, this leafy spot has it in spades. Created for the International Exhibition in 1902, Fitzgerald Park’s original pavilion and fountain now sit alongside play areas, a skate park and the Cork Public Museum. Wander your way to the ‘Shaky Bridge’ for picture-perfect views of the River Lee.








Cork City Hall

Constructed from large limestone blocks the City Hall was opened by President Eamon De Valera in 1936. The funds were provided by the British Government in reparation for the burning of the original city hall by English Crown Forces on December 20th/21st 1920 during the Irish War of Independence.



Connolly Hall









The Cathedral of Saint Mary and Saint Anne

The Cathedral of Saint Mary and Saint Anne is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in Cork, Ireland. It is the seat of the Bishop of Cork and Ross, and the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cork and Ross.



Cathedral St









St. Finbarr's Cathedral

This Early French Gothic structure is built proportionately to scale and features highly ornamented, beautiful mosaic work and rich carvings



Bishop Street

Exceptional


The Imperial is a brilliant hotel for location but it is disappointing that the tea room and front bar don't open or serve food on a Sunday we we had no food included in the full price which meant we had to keep going elsewhere

People, shops and the buzz-pubs restaurants and general happy feeling leading into Christmas. Special weekend spent with friends. Great break overall.

I love the atmosphere of the city. The shops are brilliant and there’s so much excellent food choices. The highlight for me was The English Market, I’m a foodie so I loved it!Cork is easy to get around and easy to park, definitely worth a trip.
