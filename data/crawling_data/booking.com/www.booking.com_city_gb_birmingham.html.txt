Birmingham Travel Guide










First-class Shopping, Culture and Sports
The UK's 2nd largest city, Birmingham is one of its top cultural centers. Well-known for its M6 Spaghetti Junction interchange, it's also a surprisingly green city with lots of open spaces.
Most city center hotels in Birmingham are near New Street Station. To the east is the futuristic architecture of the new Bull Ring shopping center, and behind that is Digbeth Bus Station. To the west is Victoria Square, home of the town hall and a German Christmas Market.
The Mailbox is one of the newest additions to the Birmingham shopping scene, and behind it is one of the canals converging on the Gas Street Basin. By one canal are the ICC (International Convention Center) and the NIA (National Indoor Arena), both venues that host major events.
Just across the street is Brindleyplace, a canal-front complex of restaurants, bars and hotels near Broad Street – the main nightlife area. It is popular with students at nearby Birmingham University, whose clock tower is modeled on the one in Siena. Just south in Bournville is Cadbury World, and there are several hotels on Hagley Road to the north, which are available on Booking.com.
The city is also known for sports – Aston Villa and Birmingham City are the top soccer clubs, while Edgbaston Cricket Ground hosts international matches. Other Birmingham attractions include Hockley’s Jewellery Quarter and the NEC arena by Birmingham International Airport.

We went to a gig which was amazing followed by a day of shopping (which didn’t happen as they decided to shut the bullring for an unknown time to test the fire alarms or something). Went for a coffee and returned and it was still shut and so we got in the car and drove to Bristol.

Way better than expected.

Way better than expected. Great bars, restaurants, museums. Birmingham seems to being rebuilt, quite a lot of construction but also an interesting mix of old industrial (esp around the canals) and contemporary architecture. Little of the grey 50's concrete remains and extensive new residential downtown. Many dimensions to city, from high end shopping in Mailbox to varied nightlife!

Diverse range of shops and restaurants all within easy walking distance - very impressed with New Street station, ideal destination by public transport with plenty of good value accommodation available centrally.

We were in Birmingham for a concert, so really didn’t venture further. One downside was the traffic when we were trying to get to the hotel, it was more like a car park than a road, it took over an hour to travel five miles. We had a pre-concert meal in Amantia, a Spanish restaurant, we had a large mix of tapas which were really good.

Birmingham is a lot more attractive than we expected.

Birmingham is a lot more attractive than we expected. Found good non-chain restos around Gas St and New st., decent pubs and appealing mix of contemporary and industrial architecture with extensive shopping from upmarket Mailbox through to Grand Central and Bullring, all walkable. It's image might be a bit dull but Birmingham is surprisingly dynamic and interesting place. Thoroughly enjoyed business stay.

The shopping in birmingham is amazing, the Bullring has lots of choice for men and women. The town centre has lots to offer and Birmingham New Street Station is right in the middle of everything. We ate at The Stable, amazing spot for lunch - they serve a great chicken, gammon and leek pie with pickled chutney, side salad and thick cut herby potatoes. Would reccommend for day time drinks also! Traffic on a night was heavy, would not reccommend getting a taxi for a short journey, we found it was quicker and cheaper to walk. Bar at One was very lively, also would reccommend the Alchemist!
