Hotels That Guests Love in Chicago




Chicago Getaway Hostel









“
This is my go-to place to stay in Chicago because it suits my purposes very well & I like the ambience.The breakfast must be one of the best of any hostel in the US, in fact it puts some motels to shame.
”






Gateway Inn









“
The owners of the property and the staff were really great and welcoming and I would stay again if I'm in the area.There is parking on site which is great.The property isn't the newest but it is very clean and tidy and cannot be faulted.The location of the property is over ten miles out of the centre of Chicago which is fine if you have a car but the drive in is quite hectic so if you want to see central Chicago this may not be the best place for you.On balance this is a great little motel and we are pleased we found it.
”






Gateway Inn









“
Our room was clean and quiet. The motel has free parking which is rare in Chicago. In addition, the breakfast was included in the price, which was good. I recommend this property for people who want to save money in accommodation.
”






Gateway Inn









“
Clean and spacious room. To train station was 10-15 minutes walk, so we left the car at the motel and took the train to Chicago.
”






Ohio House Motel









“
It's the best motel in Chicago. Very easy to approach it from freeway. It's very good that there is a free parking option. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms were clean and well equipped. Location is very good. Can reach everything by walk.
”

It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
