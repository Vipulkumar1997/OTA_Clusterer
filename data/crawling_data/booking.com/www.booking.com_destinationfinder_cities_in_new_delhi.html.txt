Things to Do in New Delhi









Jantar Mantar

Moghul rulers had an insatiable thirst for astronomy. This classical observatory was built in the early 1700’s, commissioned by Sawai Jai Singh II, the Maharaja of Jaipur. Its thirteen sculptures are actually early scientific experiments, designed to measure the passing of time, the length of days and movement of stars. Take half an hour to investigate them for yourself.



Sansad Marg, Connaught Place, New Delhi, Delhi 110001




Open Monday-Sunday 08:00-18:00. Check website for details.









Jama Masjid

India’s largest mosque. It was built in the mid-1600’s by order of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. There’s a lot to admire here – it’s twin candy-striped minarets, and the arcades with intricately inscribed verses from the Koran. Don’t miss its collection of relics in the Dargah Asar Sharif building that belonged to the Prophet – a deerskin Koran, a sandals and remnants of hair.



Chandni Chowk, New Delhi, Delhi




Open Monday-Sunday 07:00-12:00 and 13:30-18:30









India Gate

Paris has the “Arc de Triomphe”. New Delhi has this – a massive arch that stands in tribute to India’s war-fallen. It commemorates the 70,000 Indian soldiers who died fighting for the British Army during WWI. Although it’s surrounded by parks, it’s best seen at night. The floodlights bathe the arch in preternatural light, a dramatic sight against the evening sky.



Rajpath, India Gate, New Delhi, Delhi 110001









Red Fort

History in vivid colour. Four hundred years ago, the fort was a tapestry of burnt crimson and white, typical of the late Mughal style. This was favoured palette of Emperor Shah Jahan, who commissioned the fort as his primary residence and to blockade against invaders. Painted a fiery red during the British Raj, it’s famed for its gateways, palace buildings and sublime sunsets.



Netaji Subhash Marg, Chandni Chowk, New Delhi, Delhi 110006




Open Monday-Sunday 07:00-17:30









Purana Qila (old fort)

Timeworn, but a survivor. These red sandstone fortifications were built over five hundred years ago, during the reign of Sher Shah Suri. See the incredible blend of materials that went into creating the Qila-e-Kuhna Masjid Mosque, one of the highlights among the arches, domes and temples inside. Its melange of peppery reds and yellows are a sight to behold, especially at dusk.



Mathura Rd, New Delhi, Delhi 110003









Lodhi Gardens

A treat for those fascinated by India’s long-gone overlords. The gardens double as picnic spot and open-air museum scattered with mosques and tombs. Don’t miss the impressive Bad Gumbad, a palace and mosque stood right next to the other. The three-domed mosque, with high-vaulted ceilings with painstakingly inscribed Koranic texts, is a welcome respite from the city’s chaos.



Main Lodi Road, Beside India International Centre, New Delhi, Delhi - 110003




Open Monday-Sunday 06:00-19:30.









Nizamuddin Dargah

Thousands gather here daily to worship. Wedged between bustling markets and street-food stalls, this mausoleum contains the tomb of celebrated Sufi Saint Nizamuddin Auliya. Many come to tie red threads to the screens to wish for good luck, but there’s also another treat on Thursday nights – a concert of “qawwali” music, a Sufi style popularised by singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan.

Open Monday-Sunday 05:30-22:30









Akshardham Temple

If you only see one temple complex in New Delhi, this should be it. The grounds are impressive – fourteen acres of manicured lawns scattered with bronze statues, musical fountains and quiet estuaries. Devotees trickle in and out of the temple complex and pay their respects to Lord Swaminarayan, but most come to sit and contemplate in harmonious surroundings.



Noida Mor, New Delhi, Delhi 110092




Open Tuesday-Sunday 09:30-18:30









ISKCON Temple

Whatever your religious inclination, this lavish temple will inspire a sense of wellbeing. The statues and religious tableaux inside are dedicated to Lord Krishna. His followers walk the path to enlightenment as laid out in the Srimad Bhagvad Gita. The best time to visit is during “aarti”, when devotees sing melodious chants and dance to a euphonious rhythm.



Hare Krishna Hill, Raja Dhirsain Marg, Sant Nagar, East of Kailash, New Delhi, Delhi 110065




Open Monday-Friday 04:30-13:30 and 16:00-21:00









Lotus Temple

This temple in South Delhi is a feat of engineering genius. It took famed architect Fariborz Sahba ten years until 1986 to design and realise his vision – a lotus-shaped building that seems to float in concentric pools of water. Originally conceived as a place of worship for Bahá'í believers, it’s now open to all. Admire the building or meditate in quiet solitude.

The traffic is horrific. The poor and rough sleepers are everywhere and it is a real human tragedy . Otherwise the touristy bits are fine. The tourist express train up to Aggra and back is very good but I would recommend a guide.

Traffic was terrible but the locals can handle it. There is a clear divide between haves and have nots and the way each sector lives. Tourist Dehli is miles apart from everyday life for the locals.

One of Old Delhi’s most historic markets.

How can you enjoy the sights in New Delhi while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


Travel agents are very tricky in New Delhi especially those pretending "Ministry of Tourism office" or "Gov tourism office"; they are not, they are just using the name. Check their business card and email contact before accepting any deal! Compare prices with more than one agency, still they are a net! Compare final proposal with a new proposal from the hotel your are staying in and you will see the difference! Ask for a detailed bill describing the cost of each service separately;-)

Definitely - Lajpat Nagar, Haus Khaz, Dilli Haat and Janpath are great places to pick up all sorts of little trinkets, cheaper clothes and home accessories - just be prepared to bargain.  Haus Khaz is pricier but full of one-off shops and cafes, a nice place just to sit and drink coffee!

Transportation





New Delhi Transportation









Air - Indira Gandhi International Airport



When taking a taxi from Indira Gandhi Airport, choose a well-marked vehicle from an established company. The drive should cost INR 400–500 and take 30–40 minutes (more at rush hour). The metro also connects to the centre within 25 minutes for INR 100–120. Tickets are available in the station or from machines in Arrivals. Buses serve the airport every 15 minutes: fares range from INR 50–100 and journey time is around 45 minutes. Only red buses are air conditioned.




Indira Gandhi International Airport
www.newdelhiairport.in











Metro



Delhi’s fast, efficient metro system is the easiest way to get around the city. All metro stations have a ticket counter where you can choose from single journey tokens (valid for 2.5 hours) or smartcards (suitable for multiple journeys). Fares range from INR 8–42, depending on how far you’re going. You can also buy an unlimited 1-day pass for INR 150 or a 3-day pass for INR 300. All trains have a women-only carriage and reserved seats for ladies in each carriage.




Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd
www.delhimetrorail.com











Train



India’s well-organised rail network connects New Delhi with the whole of India, including Jaipur, Amritsar and a new bullet train to Agra. The city’s main stations are New Delhi, Old Delhi and Nizammudin, all 3 offering ticket sales, ATMs and food courts. Tickets can also be bought online: regular tickets are sold up to 90 days before departure, while last-minute sales start within 2 days of departure. Ticket classes run from unreserved up to first-class luxury.




Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation
irctc.co.in











Bus



New Delhi’s DTC bus network isn’t as efficient as the metro, but can still be useful to get around. Timetables vary, with most lines running from about 05:30–22:30. Bus stops are green and signs are usually in English and Hindi. Tickets are sold by on-board conductors – just tell the conductor where you want to get off. Prices range from around INR 5 to INR 15 each way, depending on journey length. Buses get very crowded, so keep a close eye on your belongings.




Delhi Transport Corporation
www.delhi.gov.in











Car



Car travel is a popular way to move around the city, though traffic congestion and less than optimal signage can prove challenging for visitors. If you do decide to drive, be aware that traffic is extremely heavy at peak hours (08:30–10:30 and 17:30–20:00). Private parking is available near key landmarks and in business districts: expect to pay around INR 20–50 per hour, depending on location. Shopping centres also offer private parking but it’s much more expensive.










Auto Rickshaw



Auto rickshaws, cycle rickshaws and e-rickshaws are a handy way to move around the city. These 3-wheeled vehicles can be hired privately or you can share the ride – and the cost – with other commuters. Auto rickshaws and e-rickshaws can carry 3 passengers, while cycle rickshaws can take just 2. Prices are metered and start at INR 25: make sure your driver uses the meter. Female travellers are advised to keep the women’s helpline number (1091) to hand at night.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
