Prague Travel Guide










Discover the Magic of Prague
The Czech capital is nothing short of magical, with Prague’s countless bridges, cathedrals, domes and castles reflected in the Vltava River. Thankfully, the city escaped most of WWII’s destruction, leaving the rich history and fairytale facade of this Bohemian city intact.
Prague Castle is the largest ancient castle complex in the world and the St. Vitus Cathedral is a stunning example of Gothic architecture. The Cathedral’s lookout tower rewards those willing to climb 300 steps with the best view of the city.
Walking through the cobblestone streets of the Mala Strana district will bring you to the Charles Bridge. Prague’s beautiful 14th-century monument buzzes with musicians and local crafts sales. The Astronomical Clock, Tyn Church, and Storch building of Old Town compete for popularity with the neoclassical Estate Theatre and the Czech National Museum.
The cafes and restaurants of Wenceslas Square are great for people watching and the Franz Kafka house, the Old New Synagogue and Frank Gehry’s Dancing House are perfect for soaking up history.
Flights arriving at Vaclav Havel International Airport will be in the city center after a short subway ride. For historic hotels, cheap hostels or charming apartments head to Booking.com for nearly 700 accommodations in Prague.

people not very service minded in Cafe or market， first arrival needs to change coins to buy bus ticket, obviously market counter not willing to give the change, we had to ask several stores to get coins and buy tickets. Cafe waitress is worst service I have ever seen, not serving hot water and only sparkling water which need us pay, yet another waiter not serving our table brought a glass of water...the city feels unfriendly.

Prague is a fantastic place to tap into the local way of life while perusing an old city that is rich in its history, food and architecture. We would recommend staying in the local neighborhoods versus busy/touristy Old Town and indulging in both local foodie picks and small or private tours given by the Czechs.

Our first visit to Prague and we focused entirely on the usual attractions. Old Town, Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, etc. We loved our stay but be prepared for crowds even in shoulder season. The three areas I mentioned above were packed in late October. The tram and the metro subway make it very easy to get around the area and to stay outside of the city center as we did. We booked a 2 hour group tour, at the tourist office, of the downtown area and we’re glad we did. Much more information, history and local insight than we would have had on our own. And Czech beer is excellent and so inexpensive. A pub stop became an early afternoon ritual for all of our days in Czech Republic.

Beautiful city.

Beautiful city.  Great food.  Walkable.  A lot if culture. What’s unfortunate is how many people smoke.  If you want to people watch and sit outside you are surrounded by smoke.  Also if you want to go in some of the bars at night dress nice.  They will turn you away or sit you in an uncomfortable area.








Hotels That Guests Love in Prague





Ventana Hotel Prague









“
The hotel was beautiful, and ideally located close to the Old Town Square.  Hotel staff were very friendly and attentive, even providing a bagged breakfast on our departure date since we had to leave for the airport so early.  On our arrival, they greeted us with sparkling wine and offers to arrange tours for us.  Buffet breakfast was delicious and featured different items on different days.
”






Liliova Apartments









“
This lovely apt is a short walk from everything for the old town and new town and close to tram and subway. Original woodwork and floors, high ceiling and airy, but with modern kitchen, baths and washer/dryer. A real single bed was in the large living room for our 3rd person, not a sofa bed. Great value.  Owner arranged airport transportation that was cheaper than taxi.  Our highest recommendation.
”






Meran









“
The Meran is very well-situated—it's a short seven-minute walk from the bus/train station, and it is a ten-minute walk (if you take your time admiring the beautiful buildings) to Old Town. The humble hotel is clean and has all the basic things you need. Do not expect five-star amenities because that's not what you pay for. I think the best part of my stay was speaking to the receptionist—she was very kind and attentive, and she gave me great tips on what to see and what route to take.
”






Grand Hotel Praha









“
One of the best hotels ive been to in Europe
Great breakfast buffet. 
Location is the best in Prague, in Old Town Square, walking distance to absolutely everything you have to see. 
Great experience with an amazing room, view, and facilities. 
If it fits your budget would absolutely recommend it.
”






Palac U Kocku









“
The hotel is literally a few steps from the Old Town Square which is the center for all activities in Prague. The staff is very kind but the best is the breakfast, we loved it!
