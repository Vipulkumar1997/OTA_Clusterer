Visit Edinburgh: Your Travel Guide


There’s something about Edinburgh and storytelling. After all, this is the city that inspired Barrie, Stevenson and Rowling. Let your imagination take flight in Old Town’s maze of streets, then write your own story in the home of haggis, single malt whisky and deep-fried Mars bars. Och Aye!

Things to Do in Edinburgh









St Giles' Cathedral

As mediaeval masterpieces go, this cathedral takes some beating. Gothic arches soar heavenward, borne atop thousand-year-old columns, inspiring awe in many a neck-craning visitor. The Thistle Chapel is every inch a modern-day Camelot, injecting intrigue with complex carvings in wood and stone. It wouldn’t be Scotland without bagpipe-playing cherubs on stained-glass windows!



St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh, EH1 1RE




Open Monday-Saturday 09.00-17.00, Sunday 13.00-17.00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Scottish National Museum

What do Dolly the Sheep and a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton have in common? They both “live” in the Scottish National Museum, of course! Behind its façade – half-sleek cladding, half-stained Victorian stone – lies a treasure trove of interactive exhibits, covering topics from Ancient Egypt to video games. If you’re a fan of Scottish history, then you’ve come to the right place.



Chambers Street, Edinburgh, EH1 1JF




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00









Edinburgh Castle

Hail the seat of Scottish power! This lofty castle’s perched atop an extinct volcano, a vaunted vantage point it’s held for over a millennium. Stare down the stony visages of Scottish heroes Robert the Bruce and William Wallace, whose statues guard the gate. Admire arcane accessories like the wonderfully named Stone of Destiny, used in coronations since the Middle Ages.



Castlehill, Edinburgh, EH1 2NG




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30-17:00. Changes seasonally.









Scott Monument

The Scott Monument’s a curious thing. Once described as a “vulgar” by Charles Dickens, it definitely catches the eye for better or worse. This freestanding Neo-Gothic tower looms over Princes Street in blackened sandstone, complete with fin-like protrusions and statues of characters from Sir Walter Scott’s writings. Huff and puff your way up its 287-steps for tip-top views.



East Princes Street Gardens, Edinburgh EH2 2EJ




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-16:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Princes Street Gardens

What a change! Once upon a time, there was a putrid moat called Nor Loch, which gave Edinburgh its nickname of “Auld Reekie” (Old Smelly). All that changed when it was transformed into charming gardens with rolling lawns, stately statues and fetching flowerbeds. Head there on Hogmanay (New Year’s Eve) for a full-on Scotch knees-up complete with fireworks and live music.



Princes Street, Edinburgh, EH2 2HG




Open Monday-Sunday 07:00-17:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Camera Obscura

Even in the age of “selfie sticks” and plasma TV, there’s a nostalgic pleasure to be taken from seeing an old camera obscura. At this museum, you can marvel at the same projected images of Edinburgh that have delighted curious visitors for the last 150 years. Since then, they’ve added a raft of other mind-bending illusions, including holograms, a hall of mirrors and a giant kaleidoscope.



Castlehill, The Royal Mile, Edinburgh, EH1 2ND




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-18:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Calton Hill

If Edinburgh’s known as the “Athens of the North”, it’s down to the National Monument on Calton Hill. But rather than fronting a hilltop temple complex, its giant Parthenon-style columns stand alone against the sky, frozen in an eerie state of undress. This unfinished monument’s a dramatic photo op. Romantics take note – the sunset over Edinburgh’s sure to set hearts ablaze.



Calton Hill, Edinburgh, EH7 5AA









Holyrood Park

Cluttered by cobwebs? Blow them away with a bracing walk around blustery Holyrood Park. Its tawny, windswept cliffs and icy lochs will give you a stirring taste of Scotland’s wild countryside. Scramble up the volcanic crag of Arthur’s Seat, stopping to shudder at the ghostly silhouette of crumbling St Anthony’s Chapel. You’ll be rewarded with stunning views over the city.



1 Queens Drive, Edinburgh, EH8 8HG









Royal Yacht Britannia

A seafaring palace. Britannia used to be Queen Elizabeth II’s floating royal residence, ruling the waves for 44 years and clocking up over a million miles. It’s now a moored-up museum, where mere mortals can imagine regal life on the high seas. Marvel at the engine room and admire her Majesty’s own Rolls Royce. High tea and scones in the tea room is the icing on the cake.



Ocean Terminal, Leith, Edinburgh EH6 6JJ




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-15:30. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Edinburgh Zoo

This is Edinburgh’s animal kingdom, where kings parade on a daily basis. King penguins, that is. Every day, these two-tone birds go for a regal waddle round a route lined with adoring fans. Birds not your bag? Monkey around in the impressive Budongo Trail, dedicated to the conservation of chimpanzees. Book ahead to catch a glimpse of Tian Tian and Yang Guang, the UK’s only pandas.



134 Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh, EH12 6TS




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00-16:30. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Craigmillar Castle

Mary, Queen of Scots took refuge in the confines of this 15th-century hideout that’s nestled into the hills outside Edinburgh. The views from the watchtower stretch far and wide, ready to warn of approaching enemies, and the great hall takes you right back to the times of Scotland’s last monarchs, the Stuarts.








Princes Street

A thoroughly famous thoroughfare. This mile-long street’s a hit with retail fiends, who flock to emporia like Jenners Department Store. It’s also foremost on the tourist trail, with the Scott Monument and sweeping views up to the castle. Sniffy about Scottish cuisine? Buck those hesitations at classy Contini’s, inside the National Gallery.








Carlton Hill

Calton Hill is home to some eclectic Edinburgh monuments. Originally set aside as an area for the townsfolk to practice sports and tournaments, it’s now a beautiful city park with endless vistas and historical impact. Head to the Nelson Monument and Dugald Stewart Monument to catch the iconic Scottish architecture.








Palace of Holyroodhouse & Holyrood Abbey

Still the official Scottish residence of the British monarch, Holyroodhouse has been a seat of royalty since the 16th century. Today, you can visit the former chambers of Mary, Queen of Scots and hear the tale of her doomed reign. And if you look out her oratory window, you can see the well-preserved ruins of the 12th-century Holyrood Abbey.








St. Giles Cathedral

During the 16th-century Protestant Reformation, the fiery sermons of John Knox echoed around this imposing Gothic church. As a result, it's seen as the center of Presbyterianism in Scotland. But you don't have to be religious to feel moved by the stained-glass Scottish Saints window or the Thistle Chapel's intricate heraldic carvings.








University of Edinburgh

This university first opened its doors way back in 1583. Since then, it has built up a massive historical archive. Walk around the campus and check out the diverse exhibits in its many museums. You'll find everything from 16th-century musical instruments to a 130,000 strong fossil and mineral collection.








Skye Island

Skye is enchantingly beautiful, not to mention mystical and magical. Its ‘lochans’ (small lakes) glimmer mirror-like atop sumptuous green hillsides, amongst a landscape that’s straight out of a Tolkien tome . Looming summits like the Quiraing and the Old Man of Storr make for hiking challenges against a dramatic backdrop, where the air swirls with Highland breezes, and boat trips pass seals basking on lichen-covered rocks.








Loch Ness

Known the world over for harbouring the elusive ‘Nessie’, this giant of a sea loch stretches gloriously through the heart of the Scottish Highlands. Take a boat tour from the ruins of the captivating Urquhart Castle and along the dramatic, mountain-lined depths. Some tours even feature sonar imaging so that you can see which creatures lurk beneath your vessel!








Edinburgh Old Town

Edinburgh’s old town is a mesh of cobbles, looming spires and crammed-in tenements, interlaced with a history that’s full of intrigue and gore. In the shadow of Edinburgh Castle, you can embark on walking tours which trace the steps of infamous body snatchers, Burke and Hare, or let yourself be spooked out  your skin by historical guides who bring the city’s dark side to life.








Cabaret Voltaire

In the heart of historic Edinburgh, this underground club spins tunes from the present day, alongside retro favourites. A nightlife icon, DJs make guest appearances on the decks, while a happening live venue sees gig-goers bop and rock to local acts and artists from further afield. Keep an eye out for quirky theme nights including life drawing, ‘deep house yoga’ and sewing classes.








George Street

In the swanky New Town, George Street bustles with city slickers on the hunt for a more sophisticated night out. Georgian façades line quiet streets dotted with boutiques, cocktail-brewing haunts, gin-guzzling spots and minimalist wine bars.  Behind the The Dome’s Corinthian columns lies a stunning dining room and bar, while the Christmas tree that bedecks the hallway has become an Edinburgh icon in its own right.








Rose Street

A lively stretch of watering holes, Rose Street is where locals and visitors flock to find a cosy Edinburgh pub for a fine wee dram of whisky, or a pre or post-rugby-match tipple. Sample some flavoursome ales in the Abbotsford, soak up the history of the Kenilworth, or watch the world go by from the Rose Street Brewery.








The Grassmarket and Old Town

The winding cobbles of the Grassmarket show a little snapshot of quintessentially quaint Edinburgh. Pubs pouring out locally sourced whisky blends and hearty ales sit alongside cosy restaurants, independent cafes and lively Irish bars. After last rounds are called and the evening lingers on, you’ll find a couple of nightspots that keep the tunes pumping until the wee hours.








Princes Street

Princes Street runs right through the heart of Edinburgh, and every New Year party-goers head to this boulevard to "ring in the bells." Artists play contemporary, classic, and Celtic tunes on different stages before fireworks kick off the "Midnight Moment" and illuminate the skies above Edinburgh Castle – all to the soundtrack of "Auld Lang Syne."








Torchlight Procession

The official kickoff of Edinburgh's world-famous Hogmanay extravaganza, this parade takes place on December 30th. Over 8,000 torchbearers walk through the old town – creating a glowing river of fire. Shetlanders dressed up as Vikings lead the way to Calton Hill, where the ceremony ends with a bonfire looking out over the city below.








Concert in the Gardens

Edinburgh is the home of Hogmanay. Every winter, Princes Street Gardens sees bundled-up partiers bustling to see bands and singers rock their way in to the new year. The gardens are set against the dramatic backdrop of Edinburgh Castle – where fireworks cascade down at midnight.

Popular Neighborhoods in Edinburgh












West End


304 properties

West End’s all about performance. This district’s chock-full of theatres, cinemas and concert venues. It really comes into its own during August’s Fringe Festival, when you can barely walk for grinning street comics or touts thrusting flyers into your hand. Need a break from the theatricality? Slip into Caley Sample Rooms for an off-stage brew.

Accommodations in West End













Old Town


177 properties

Edinburgh Old Town oozes mystery. Its cobbled “wynds” (narrow alleyways) entice and delight with unexpected nooks and crannies that urge you to explore. In the town that spawned Stevenson’s “Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde”, let Grassmarket’s cosy pubs bring out the bard in you. To unravel the ghostly tales behind Old Town’s hidden gems, join a guided tour.

Princes Street


163 properties

A thoroughly famous thoroughfare. This mile-long street’s a hit with retail fiends, who flock to emporia like Jenners Department Store. It’s also foremost on the tourist trail, with the Scott Monument and sweeping views up to the castle. Sniffy about Scottish cuisine? Buck those hesitations at classy Contini’s, inside the National Gallery.

Accommodations in Princes Street













Royal Mile


153 properties

This street’s a mile-long history lesson. As you stroll down from Edinburgh Castle towards Holyrood Palace, look out for St Giles Cathedral – it leaves onlookers agape with its Gothic flourishes and fifty shades of grey sandstone. During the Fringe Festival, the Royal Mile teems with street performers and enthralled tourists.

Accommodations in Royal Mile













Haymarket


116 properties

Hay ho, let’s go! Commuters zoom in and out of Edinburgh’s central business district in a whirl of brogues and briefcases. On match days, you’ll see (and hear) rugby fans bustle their way to iconic Murrayfield Stadium. There’s plenty to please foodies, too – from First Coast’s Scottish fare to Lovecrumbs’ exceedingly good cakes.

Accommodations in Haymarket













New Town


78 properties

Don’t be fooled by the name – New Town’s not that new. But its open spaces and elegant Georgian façades stand in stark contrast to the scrunched mediaeval maze of Old Town. Hidden behind neo-classical columns, New Town’s flats are among the city’s most sought after. If you fancy going the full Scottish, pick up a bespoke kilt from 21st Century Kilts.

Accommodations in New Town













Broughton


38 properties

Broughton’s an up-and-comer. This residential district’s flourishing into a nucleus of fine dining, funky bars and boutiques. Treacle serves up curious cocktails, Kitchin’s a hit for slap-up meals and the Pink Triangle flaunts fab nightlife for all persuasions. Intrigued by the local delicacy, deep-fried Mars bar? Tuck in at Café Piccante.

Accommodations in Broughton













Stockbridge


16 properties

Local cheesemongers, high-class delis, microbreweries, vintage clothes shops… no wonder Stockbridge is consistently voted among the UK’s coolest places to live. Adjust your horn-rimmed specs, fasten that top button and join the locals at Stockbridge Tap Pub or The Last Word cocktail saloon. To escape society’s trappings, go for a stroll along leafy Water of Leith.

Accommodations in Stockbridge













Bruntsfield


12 properties

Bruntsfield’s a leafy district where students eat, drink and sleep. On sunny days, grab a corner-shop beer and join the fresh-faced crowds in The Meadows Park, where you’ll find picnics, frisbees and sun cream galore. Head to funky gastro-pub Blackbird for Sunday brunch, before stopping off at Cameo Cinema’s cosy bar for a pre-film pint.

Accommodations in Bruntsfield













Morningside


10 properties

Morningside – lovely name, lovely place. This quiet area’s townhouses are home to Edinburgh’s best-lined pockets. Potter around like a leisurely local, stopping off for lunch at Nonna’s Kitchen (try the pumpkin ravioli). Then spend an evening of well-oiled repartee in legendary pub Canny Man’s, purveyor of countless single malt whiskies.

Accommodations in Morningside













Portobello


8 properties

“Oh I do love to be beside the seaside…”. Well, by the Firth of Forth, anyway. Portobello combines the faded charm of old-time beach resorts with an eco-conscious community spirit. You won’t find your standard superstores here – just friendly joints serving organic, locally sourced grub. Check out the Espy or The Tide to sample the “Porty” vibe.

Local Tips for Edinburgh







Water of Leith




by Sally

Sally moved to Edinburgh over 3 years ago and enjoys its sights as much as its friendly atmosphere.


The Water of Leith riverside trail is a lovely way to explore the city by foot or bike. The river flows from the Pentland Hills, through the city and onto the Firth of Forth inlet. The 19-kilometre-long path is home to a diverse number of plants and animals.

Edinburgh's hidden bars: Panda and Sons




by Brogan

Brogan is new to Edinburgh but already loves its vibe and that there is always something going on.


Disguised as a barber shop, I was lucky enough to stumble upon this wee gem. One of the city's many hidden bars, Panda and Sons is a modern-day speakeasy serving quirky cocktails. If you go on a Saturday night, there is the added bonus of free popcorn to nibble on.

Greyfriars Bobby




by Noemi

Noemi swapped sunny Spain for a rather chillier Edinburgh but still loves it 11 years later.


A dear icon of the city, wee Greyfriars Bobby was a Skye terrier who supposedly guarded the grave of his master for 14 years and has been commemorated in books and films. Stop to view the pooch’s famous statue next to Greyfriar’s Kirk Church, in the heart of the old town.

Candlemaker Row, Edinburgh, EH1








Arthur's Seat




by Dympna

Dympna was born and raised in Edinburgh and is still resident in the capital city.


For an invigorating adventure, a hike up Arthur’s Seat is a must. A mountain in the middle of the city, join its footpath starting across from Holyrood Palace, or head up towards Pollock Halls. The walk is certainly worth it and you’ll be rewarded with amazing views over Edinburgh!

The Shore




by Casey

No matter how many times she leaves, Casey always finds her way back to her beautiful hometown.


Once run-down and industrial, The Shore has evolved into a lively, vibrant area and one of my favourites in the city. It’s home to Edinburgh’s highest concentration of Michelin-starred restaurants, cocktail bars, pubs, a floating restaurant and one of the best cake shops in the city.

Accommodations nearby



The Shore, Edinburgh, EH6 6QW








Mary King's Close




by Troy

South African Troy came to the city 9 years ago for 2 months and liked it so much he never left.


Below Edinburgh’s lively streets lies an underground city which housed its ancient population. Mary King’s Close’s amazing actors bring 17th-century Edinburgh to life, taking you on a tour along the remains of these subterranean streets and recounting the city’s murky past.

City Ghost Tours




by Emma

Now living in London, Glaswegian Emma enjoys visiting Edinburgh whenever she’s north of the border.


A great way to bring Edinburgh’s “nooks and crannies” to life is with one of the city ghost tours. Beginning on the Royal Mile, they lead you down eerie alleyways and into spooky cellars. Hilarious tour guides will entertain you, mixing history with jokes and the odd blood-curdling scream.

Accommodations nearby



There are several providers in town.








The Elephant House




by Angel

Spaniard Ángel spent a year studying in Edinburgh and loves the magic that the city has.


You’ve probably heard the story of how J.K. Rowling began writing Harry Potter on a little paper napkin. What you might not know is that she did this in the Elephant House Café - a great spot to have a cup of tea in the midst of the atmospheric old town and overlooking Edinburgh Castle.

by Michael

Originally from the Western Isles, Michael loves Edinburgh’s charm, history and the lovely locals.

What is it in Edinburgh that makes history come to life?





Anonymous


Like anywhere in the UK, history is in your face - which is one reason I love going there.  Edinburgh is no exception.  What with the Castle in the middle of town and the Palace of Holyrood on the east end, along with all of the other history steeped into every square inch of this elegant city, I recommend it to all.  I first visited it as a mouthy 16 year old back in 1967 ... and yet I had enough maturity (buried somewhere deep inside me!) to fall in love with it even back then ... finally got to come back in 2007 and then again last week.  An elegant city ... and don't confuse it as being just "more of England" ... it is TOTALLY different from England!

Booking.com is part of The Priceline Group, the world leader in online travel & related services.



























Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
