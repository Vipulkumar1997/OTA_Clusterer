Melbourne Travel Guide










Buzzy Jewel of Aussie Rules
A thoroughly liveable city, Melbourne has a buzzy vibe and an Aussie sense of fun. There’s always something going on, and one of its many festivals is Moomba – Australia’s largest free arts festival. Well worth a visit are the National Gallery of Victoria and the Melbourne Aquarium,  where you can walk through a clear tunnel as sharks swim over your head.
The city’s most recognizable landmark is Flinders Street Station, whose yellow and green façade matches the color of the historic Melbourne trams that still run around the world’s longest tram network. Keep an eye out for the street art as you travel.
Shopping in Melbourne is fantastic. Queen Victoria Market is the largest open-air market south of the Equator, while the La Trobe Street shopping center has over 300 stores. For food, don’t miss Little Italy - the Carlton area.
South of the Yarra River is St Kilda, home to the best beach and Albert Park, where the F1 Australian Grand Prix is held. However, this isn't the city’s only sports heritage. It’s also the home of Aussie Rules soccer and the MCG, a must-see for cricket fans.
Booking.com has a range of Melbourne accommodations from hotels to hostels and motels, some near Melbourne Airport.

fell in love with the city 10years ago, ended up spending there 3months back then.Came back now for a short visit, will come back again in few weeks for a longer stay.Best city in Australia, one of my favourites in the world.You will find things to do there all the time, moving around with public transport is easy.The cbd is just a scratch of the city, spend more time outside and you will see what Melbourne really is.

I loved it!

I loved it! So much to see and do! While we were there, there was a pop-up Globe Theatre with fantastic performances of Shakespeare plays. We enjoyed the Australian art exhibit at the NGV, the Melbourne Gaol, the Queen Victoria market, the St. Kilda beach was a short tram ride away, and the many gardens were beautiful. There is any type of restaurant you can imagine. We liked the Chocolate Buddha and the Crafty Squire, a microbrewery with great beer. It was easy get around on all the free trams. I want to go back.

I live near Melbourne and it is a great place to eat, plenty of all kinds of entertainment and some very interesting architecture. Nice wide streets and footpaths. A very ccosmopolitan city it is no wonder it regularly rates among the most liveable cities in the world.

Hotels That Guests Love in Melbourne





Travelodge Hotel Melbourne Southbank









“
Location was awesome, walking distance to DFO, casino and Melbourne CBD. However, if you don't want to walk extremely close to trams that can get you to all sporting arenas and touristy spots. Staff at the front desk were friendly and happy to help with out queries.
”






BreakFree on Collins









“
It's located at the central of Melbourne CBD, we could walk everywhere. It's in the free tram zone and there are so many tram stops within 3 mins walking distance. (1 stop right in front the foyer)
”






Atlantis Hotel Melbourne









“
Service by Claire at Reception was brilliantWalking distance to every social activity we had planned in the CBD, Southbank and Docklands
”






ibis Melbourne - Little Bourke Street









“
Perfect location in order to catch the Sky Bus to the Melbourne Airport early in the morning. Also in easy walking distance to the CBD.
”






Mercure Welcome Melbourne









“
The staff were all exceptionally friendly, and the hotel is in a very central CBD location. Easy walks to most of the city attractions. The bar area was cosy and a good place to chill out with a drink. Good place for a short stay if you don't plan of spending lots of time in the room.
