Copenhagen is highly rated by travelers for sightseeing, architecture and culture.

Views of Copenhagen are hard to beat from Rundetårn, or Round Tower, and the spire of the Church of Our Saviour. For a bit of alternative culture a bit closer to the ground, nearby Freetown Christiania is the place to go to! It’s a self-proclaimed autonomous district, famous for its liberal lifestyle and creative arts. A definite must-see! 
Kastrup Airport, the largest one in the Scandinavia, is only a 15-minute train ride from the city center. Whether you choose to stay at a hip hostel, luxury hotel or a cozy apartment, Booking.com has the perfect Copenhagen accommodation.

Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.
