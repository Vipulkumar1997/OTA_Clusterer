Mecca Travel Guide










The Holy City
This holy city is located in western Saudi Arabia and is also known as Makkah. It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam to make a pilgrimage here, and therefore is a destination for millions of Muslims each year. Prophet Muhammad was born here and it is a sacred place for Muslims and the birthplace of Islam.
Non-muslims are not permitted into Mecca and the government of Saudi Arabia issues special visas for people making the pilgrimage. Most people coming to the Mecca will enter via the Hajj Terminal at King Abdulaziz International Airport and Jeddah is the gateway to the city.
The Hajj has a fairly set itinerary including a visit to the Sacred Mosque, al-Masjid al-Haram, built around the Kaaba. Mecca contains many restaurants with varied cuisine and tea shops are available for light refreshments such as traditional tea and cookies. There are also many juice stands for a little refreshment amid the heat. Ranging from luxury hotels to basic accommodations, Booking.com offers over 80 hotels for your time in Mecca.

Simply the holly city, and KSA authorities working so hard to make it always a better experience every year, they added a luggage lockers surrounding Al-Haram for a very reasonable prices, malls and markets are everywhere, with a good chance to bargain for better value, and a wide variety of food!

The people were unrespectful and unhelpful.

The people were unrespectful and unhelpful. The price is too high. The location was crowded and no parking. I had to stay more than two hours in the lobby before check in. My family and I were too ungry of the people behaviour. I was not satisfied at all. I do not recommend the hotel to anyone.

Makkah Al Mukaramah is the holiest place on earth as well Madinah Al Munawara. They are the only places which their lights can be seen from outer space for instance moon or mars.

”






Fakhamet Al Aseel Hotel

Actually I decided to live in this hotel every time I visit Mecca in future in shaa ALLAH. The place is very clean and comfortable with wifi in all places. I advise all people to give a try and Live there.
”






Hilton Suites Makkah









“
The luxurism of the hotel and the simplicity to get to your room unlike the clock tower and its surroundings; in addition, the free parking is not something easy to get on Makkah.
”






Elaf Bakkah Hotel









“
Shuttle service drops u very near to the gate which is equivalent to living in a hotel near Haram without paying more. The shuttle runs on the road dedicated for hotel shuttles and takes only 2 minutes. Rooms are spacious and comfy beds. I booked a 3 bed room and got 4 bed.
