Things to Do in Adelaide









Cleland Conservation Park

Ever wanted to hug a koala? At Cleland Conservation Park, you can do just that. One of only a few certified koala-cuddling places in the world, this park has plenty of friendly critters that are happy to be held. Aside from these cutest of animals, there’s a whole load of kangaroos, emus and wombats that you can feed yourself.








Kangaroo Island Day Trip

Just a short boat ride from Adelaide, this island does what it says on the tin – and more. Sure, there are fields full of Australia’s most famous marsupial, but you’ll also find tip-top spots for checking out sealions, koalas, birds of prey and even honey-making bees. If you’re into your Aussie wildlife, Kangaroo Island is unmissable.








Ayers House Museum

A grand colonial mansion named after its original owner and 19th century State Premier, Sir Henry Ayers, Ayers House Museum illustrates Victorian life as lived “below & above stairs”. A property of the National Trust of South Australia, the house contains beautiful, decorative painted finishes on walls and ceilings throughout. Of particular note are the sumptuous State Dining Room and the newly restored, rare underground Summer Sitting Room. The house is furnished with a superb collection of period furniture and decorative arts. Located in the thriving East End district of Adelaide, Ayers House is a historic mansion not to be missed.



288 North Terrace









Adelaide Oval

Dominating the parklands between Torrens lake and St Peter's Cathedral lies the Adelaide Oval, often mooted as the most picturesque test cricket ground in the world. The first test match played here was against England in 1884. Since that time the ground has been used for other sports such as rugby league and Australian rules football. The distinctive Victor Richardson and Clarrie Grimmett gates add special character to the ground, while the splendid old scoreboard dates back to Edwardian times. Public tours of the Oval and Museum are conducted every Tuesday and Thursday, and on Sundays during the cricket season.



War Memorial Drive









Adelaide Botanic Garden

Tranquility and relaxation are the bywords on any stroll through Adelaide's Botanic Garden. The garden provides a great opportunity to relax amidst subtropical plants or to wine and dine next to the lake. Two of the most impressive glasshouse structures in the garden are literally an age apart. The elegant Palm House, which opened in 1877, is recognized as the finest Victorian glasshouse in Australia and houses a fascinating display of Madagascan flora. Conversely, the space-age Bicentennial Conservatory encloses tropical rain forest plants from northern Australia, the Pacific islands and Asia.



North Terrace









Beachouse

Situated in Glenelg, Adelaide’s premiere beach side suburb, this exciting beach-front fun house promises a day of entertainment for the whole family. Features include: Soli Italian Formula One dodgem cars, a five story high play castle, a ferris wheel, bumper boats, mini golf, a fabulous carousel, various arcade games and three, fully enclosed and heated water slides that will have you reaching super speeds in no time at all. Its on-site café offers not only the best cappuccinos in town, but also amazing fairground treats including donuts, gelati and every kid’s favorite, fairy floss.



Colley Terrace









Adelaide Convention Centre

Judged to be one of the top 10 convention centres in the world, this is the first to be purpose-built in Australia. The spacious facility has two halls--the Plenary Hall, which accommodates up to 3,500 people, and the Exhibition Hall with a 186-booth capacity. The 11 meeting rooms hold between 10 and 200 people and there is a VIP room with bar and lounge. Having eight foyers and a main reception area, this non-smoking centre is equipped with video-conferencing, audio-visual, telecommunications performance lighting and sound. There are elevators, banquet facilities and two car parks.



North Terrace









Adelaide Central Market

Currently celebrating its 130th year of operation, the Adelaide Central Market is visited by over 150,000 people each week, who come to buy superb local fresh produce and gastronomic delights from around the world. The appealing old facade on Gouger Street fronts Adelaide's largest retail produce market--over 80 stallholders, bringing you everything from custard apples to camembert, bok choy to biscotti, saffron to salmon. Enjoy the fantastic atmosphere. Bargaining is not generally accepted, but the good-natured stallholders compete with each other to give you the best prices.



Gouger Street









Bicentennial Conservatory

Humidity-hungry plants thrive in the misty cocoon of the Bicentennial Conservatory--the largest glasshouse in the Southern Hemisphere. Rising in the east of the Botanic Garden like a glass crescent-moon, this unique hot-house is home to a wealth of rain-forest species native to tropical Queensland and the Pacific Islands. Take the upper walkway through lush rain-forest canopy or a lower walkway for forest-floor dwellers. With gentle rain falling into a forest pool it is almost possible to imagine the World Heritage Daintree Rainforest being right here in Adelaide!



Plane Tree Drive









Victoria Square

Sliced into grassy chunks by the paths of King William Street and Grote Street, busy Victoria Square lies at the very heart of Adelaide City. In the center of the square, Queen Victoria's statue casts an austere eye north towards the fountain, built to commemorate the 1963 visit of her great, great grand-daughter, Elizabeth. The fountain symbolizes the three rivers--Murray, Torrens and Onkaparinga--from which Adelaide draws its water. It is a pleasant place to wait for the Glenelg tram or simply to sit and watch the city chase its tail.



King William Street









Carrick Hill

This heritage-listed estate, featuring an imposing Elizabethan mansion and nearly 40 hectares of English gardens and native bush, is only about 25 minutes by bus from central Adelaide. Built in 1937-39, the place was originally the home of local businessman Sir Edward Hayward. It is now a big tourist attraction owned by the State Government. The interior is decked out in oak panelling and filled with antique art and furniture. Snacks and drinks, including Devonshire tea, are served in the local coffee shop.



46 Carrick Hill Drive









Art Gallery of South Australia

Established in 1881 this historic and attractive building on leafy North Terrace holds one of the most extensive art collections in Australia. Rare and valuable pieces on a worldwide scale abound--fine paintings by the masters, contemporary art and design, and sculpture. There are both regular and permanent exhibitions. Enjoy a coffee or light snack in the stylish cafe or peruse books of distinction highlighting all variety of artwork in the on-site book shop. Guided Tours are available.



North Terrace









Beehive Corner Building

An elaborate piece of work, this small building turns more heads than the nearby tower blocks. Built in 1895-96, it is a rare example of neo-Gothic architecture in Adelaide. The building's main features are its turret and beehive, and the busy trappings from cement moldings. Thanks to a big restoration effort in 1998, the place has regained much of its original charm. It stands at the entrance of the Rundle Mall retail hub and houses shops, including the famous Haigh's Chocolates store.



32 - 40 King William Street









Rundle Mall

Shoppers flock to the ever-festive Rundle Mall, historically the first traffic-free shopping mall in Australia. Many of the big retail players can be found here, as can a variety of street entertainers. The Mall leads eastwards onto Rundle Street, which throbs with a cultural mix of diners and thirsty pub-goers. It is also the primary venue of Adelaide's Fringe Festival.
