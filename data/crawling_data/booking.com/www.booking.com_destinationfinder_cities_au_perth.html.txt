Things to Do in Perth









Art Gallery of Western Australia

Think less state of the art, more art of the state. This museum brings together a smorgasbord of Western Australian artworks, from Frederick McCubbin’s “Down on His Luck” to the minimalist abstractions of Aborigine artist Rover Thomas. Add in a smattering of 20th-century British paintings and a revolving carousel of excellent exhibitions and you’ve got yourself one fine gallery!



Art Gallery of Western Australia Perth WA 6000




Open Wednesday-Monday 10:00-17:00









Perth Arena

If you build it, they will come. For years, Perth wasn’t a priority for touring bands due to its lack of proper venues. However, Perth Arena has changed all of that. This giant 3D puzzle of a building is the hottest ticket in town these days, pulling star names from Bon Jovi to Beyoncé. Check listings for head-banging gigs, stellar stand-up or nail-biting sporting events.



700 Wellington Street, Perth WA 6000




Check website for details.









Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre

Convene! Exhibit! PCEC is Perth’s prime hotspot for these activities and more. It hosts an ever-changing roster of congresses in fields as diverse as aluminium and Alzheimer’s. You never know what’ll be next, either. Storm Troopers queuing alongside zombies? Must be Comic-Con time! Aging rocksters standing in line, silver hair blowin’ in the wind? Maybe Bob Dylan’s in town!



21 Mounts Bay Road, Perth Western Australia 6000




Check website for details.









nib Stadium

Are you a homesick footy fan? Fear not – you’ll be able to get your fix at the nib Stadium. The purple-clad Perth Glory team play their home games here, and the “Socceroos” (the national team) roll into town now and again. Whether you’re into football or rugby union, this is the place to come. nib Stadium’s where Western Force battle it out against the southern hemisphere’s best.



310 Pier Street, Perth WA 6000




Check website for details.









WACA Ground

WACA – two short syllables that strike fear into visiting batsmen’s hearts! With its famously bouncy surface, this cricket ground is a fast bowler’s dream ticket. It’s certainly seen many a crushing Aussie victory through the years. Cricket nuts will go googly-eyed at the on-site museum. If you’re just confused by this strange old game, head down on matchday to try and work it out.



Nelson Crescent, East Perth Western Australia 6004




Check website for details.









Kings Park Botanical Gardens

Long live the Kings! This isn’t your average patch of inner-city parkland. It’s a prodigious expanse of gardens that showcases Perth’s funky flora – vivid banksias, fragrant acacias and even a majestically hoary boab tree. The Beedawong Cultural Space is worth a visit too, where you’ll learn the spiritual customs and practices of the Nyoongar of Western Australia.



Kings Park









Crown Casino Perth

Go big or go home! Crown Casino is a multi-faceted complex that offers myriad ways to blow your cash. Soaring out of the riverbank, its cascading roof also holds a couple of hotels, a theatre and a full house of great restaurants. Snaffle a burger at Merrywell’s or feast on fusion cuisine at Nobu. Feeling lucky? Pick up your chips, cross your fingers and take on the house!



Great Eastern Highway Burswood Western Australia 6100




Open every day 01:00-24:00









Swan River

Before Swan Lake came Swan River. This winding waterway dances down from the Darling Mountains to meet the warm Indian Ocean. Its clear waters are a tip-top water sports hotspot, where yachts and dinghies promise to float your boat. If you’re feeling adventurous, hop on the ferry at Barrack Street Jetty and scoot across to Rottnest Island, the city’s local island paradise.



Swan River









Cottesloe Beach

Once you visit Cottesloe, you’ll see why Aussies and beaches go together like sandals and Speedos. Fine sand, clear waters and a whole lot of sunshine is a winning combo on Perth’s most beloved beach! Fuel up on tea and scones from Indian Tea House or pick up a posh picnic from the Boatshed Market. Then plonk yourself on the sand and watch those endorphins go through the roof!



Cottesloe Beach









Fremantle Markets

Much more than a weekend market. Stalls flog organic coffee, women in flowing dresses sell artisan jewellery, and Australia’s First People hawk wondrous woodwork. You may come out with bags of things you didn’t realise you wanted! Fremantle Markets is a community focal point, where happy-go-lucky crowds enjoy top-notch buskers, puppeteers and petting zoos. Time to get involved!

Traveler's Reviews & Photos

Very Good


Similar to Melbourne & Sydney but smaller, easier to explore, clean & friendly. Excellent free bus service (CAT) around the city making it easy to get everywhere. In fact the transport systems are excellent including easy shuttle transfer from airport into the city.

A city with lots of surprises. Perth undersells itself. It has so much to offer with fabulous food, fantastic weather which allows balmy evenings eating out or walking along the river and the most beautiful riverside location.

Beautiful relaxed city right on the water. Elizabeth Quay is worth a visit, and spare a few hours to stroll  the magic of Kings Park overlooking the city.

Popular Neighborhoods in Perth












Perth Central Business District


49 properties

Money makes the world go round. And Perth’s “CBD” does its bit to keep the whole thing spinning. The city’s commercial capital is a whirl of taxi horns, suits and the “ker-ching” of cash registers. Splash your cash on King Street before sampling award-winning cakes at Jean Pierre Sancho. Cap it off with a cocktail at lofty rooftop bar The Aviary.

Accommodations in Perth Central Business District













Subiaco


27 properties

“Subi” is a classy place. Affluence is writ large here, with its well-heeled residents, the snazzy townhouses and a glut of gourmet restaurants. Start your day with a nutrient-rich brunch at Health Freak Café and pick out a shiny bauble in Rokeby Road’s jewellers. Then slum it with the Aussie Rules fans for a game at the Subiaco Oval!

Accommodations in Subiaco













Cottesloe


21 properties

Cottesloe’s all about fun in the sun. With bodyboarding, beach cricket and good old sunbathing, “Cott Beach” is Perth’s go-to spot for seaside frolics. Set your alarm early and grab breakfast at Vans Café (pancakes with honeycomb butter are their speciality!). Stay till dusk to catch picture-postcard sunsets over the Indian Ocean. You little ripper!

Accommodations in Cottesloe













West Perth


20 properties

The West isn’t that wild after all. Quiet West Perth is home to young professionals who commute into the city. You’ll see them pushing new-fangled prams or zooming towards Kings Park in a blur of logoed lycra. Tap into the contentment with a trip to Harbour Town Shopping Centre. Then head to Perth Observatory to contemplate the cosmos.

Accommodations in West Perth













Leederville


4 properties

Leederville’s a place to let your hair down. Its mix of cutesy cafés, quality restaurants and quirky knick-knackeries will keep you busy from 9 to 5. Grab a caffeinated cuppa from Foam Coffee Bar before nibbling on passion-fruit cheesecake at Greens & Co. Come sundown, “Leedy” keeps the party going at joints like HipE Club and Niche. Rock on!

Accommodations in Leederville













North Perth


4 properties

North Perth is distinctly Mediterranean. Decades ago, a fair few Greeks and Italians migrated south to set up shop here, as joints like Maurizio or Metrio & Co will attest. It’s a quiet, safe suburb where you’ll see uniformed schoolkids scampering down tree-lined streets. For a grade-A tipple, head to The Classroom Bar. School’s out!

Accommodations in North Perth











Local Tips for Perth







Rottnest Island




by Elif

Elif spends her weekends chasing her naughty puppy and boating on peaceful rivers.


Just a 30 minute ferry ride from Fremantle, Rottnest Island is all about the great outdoors. Get up close to tropical fish while you snorkel, or hire a bicycle to explore the island’s hidden gems. Keep your eyes peeled for the native quokka, these cute animals look like tiny kangaroos.

Perth City Shopping




by Sarah

When Sarah’s not Instagramming photos of food, she’s splurging on designer handbags.


Perth City is a shopper’s delight! Browse big brands in department stores like Myer and David Jones, and then check out quirky boutiques for cute gifts to take home to your friends. Finish your day with a visit to King Street, boasting designers including Gucci and Louis Vuitton.

Little Creatures Brewery




by Keti

Keti loves to spend her spare time reading or creating delicious dishes in the kitchen.


What do you get when you roll a brewery, restaurant and art gallery all in one? Little Creatures Brewery in Fremantle of course! You can take a tour of the brewery and see how Pale Ale is produced, or sit back and relax in the outdoor garden with a glass of beer and a tasty pizza.

Beaufort Street




by Luke

Luke is a keen surfer and has his hands full juggling his gorgeous twin baby girls.


Splashed with colourful street art and lined with foodie finds, Beaufort Street has a vibrant buzzing atmosphere. There are plenty of places to wind down in the evening – the Brisbane Hotel is one of my beloveds. For a fancy cocktail and nibbles check out the Malt Supper Club.

Accommodations nearby



Mount Lawley








The Northern Beaches




by Bernadette

Bernadette finds her daily Zen through yoga, and enjoys discovering a city’s foodie hot spots.


Perth is much-loved for its perfect weather and white sandy havens, and Trigg Beach would have to be my favourite. The patrolled beach makes it safe for swimmers, and is also popular with surfers. If you don’t mind an early start, the sunrise here is truly breath-taking.

Accommodations nearby



105/109 Flora Terrace, North Beach WA 6062








Harbour Town




by Natalie

Aside from working on her tan, Natalie’s passions include shopping and graphic design.


Put simply, Watertown is a shopping experience brimming with bargains. This brand outlet centre is home to an exciting range of stores. Lace up a new pair of runners at Nike, browse leather goods at Oroton or nab a pair of jeans from Levis. You credit card won’t thank you!

Fremantle Markets




by Martine

Born and bred Perth girl Martine enjoys keeping active with walks along the beach.


For the best in Western Australian produce and handy crafts, you can’t go past Fremantle Markets. Every weekend, crowds flock to the market looking for unique gifts and tasty treats. A top tip is to visit on Sunday afternoon, when the fruits and veggies are heavily discounted.

Transportation





Perth Transportation









Air – Perth Airport



The fastest connection between Perth Airport and the city centre is by taxi in 30 minutes for around $40. A cheaper option is the Connect Perth Airport Shuttle, which departs from T3 domestic terminal at 06:30 and then every hour from 09:00. The shuttle stops at 5 city locations; tickets are $15 one way. There is also a public bus service from T3 and T4, which is a 50 minute journey to 2 city stops for $4.40. Services operate every 15 minutes from 05:50.










Taxi



Taxis are not necessary for travel around the city due to the efficient bus system. However if required, they can be pre-booked, hailed from the street or found at a rank. They can be an expensive mode of transport, with a $1.50 call-out fee and per kilometre charges. Taxis are best used for travel to and from the airport.










Train



Perth Underground is the city’s main train station. Transperth train services are best used for connecting to tourist attractions further out of the CBD, such as Fremantle, Cottesloe Beach and The Esplanade. Trains operate from 05:00 until 23:30. The easiest way to ride all public transport is using a SmartRider card; this $10 top-up card can be purchased from news agencies or most stations.




Transperth
www.transperth.wa.gov.au











Bus



The easiest way to explore Perth city centre is by bus, with the CAT (Central Area Transit) operating free services to main tourist areas. The 4 coloured lines run on weekdays from 06:30 to 19:30 every 10-15 minutes, and on weekends from 08:30 to 19:00. Transperth also runs a ticketed bus service (green and silver in colour) which is useful for trips to outlying beaches and attractions. Fares range from $2-12, and tickets can be bought at news agencies.




Transperth
www.transperth.wa.gov.au











Car



Renting a car is most useful for traveling to attractions outside of the city. Otherwise, for travel within the city your best bet is to use the free CAT buses. If you do intend to drive, keep in mind rush hour traffic can be a hassle, occurring between 07:00-09:30 and 16:30-18:30. Additionally, parking in the CBD can be very expensive, and often entails hourly restrictions.










Ferry



The ferry service connects Mends Street Jetty in South Perth to Barrack Street Jetty in Perth CBD, and is a lovely 7 minute journey along the Swan River. Services run every 15 minutes, from 06:50-19:45 on weekdays and 07:50-19:45 on weekends. You can use a SmartRider card, or purchase tickets from the vending machine prior to boarding.
