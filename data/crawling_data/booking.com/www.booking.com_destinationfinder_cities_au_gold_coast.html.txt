Things to Do in Gold Coast









SkyPoint Observation Deck

See the Gold Coast in all its glory. This lofty observation deck has astounding views that stretch across the city and into the horizon. Limber up the stairs for the Skypoint Stair Climb, or better yet, zoom up in the lift. Wrapped around the top of the building, this gulp-inducing ascent is not for the fainthearted. The payoff is an uninterrupted panorama.



9 Hamilton Ave, Surfers Paradise Queensland 4217




Open Sunday-Thursday 07:30-21:00, Friday-Saturday 07:30-24:00.









Surfers Paradise Beach

Here’s a typical daytime scene in “paradise”. Surfers rise with the waves to cut a striking silhouette against the morning sun. As the day lingers on, bronzed figures jog along the shoreline, people come out to sunbathe, and their children build trenches and sandcastles in the sand. Partake in the activities, or visit in the early evening as the night markets kick off.



3/3003 Surfers Paradise Bulevard, QLD 4217, Australia









Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre

At first sight, this may seem like any other convention centre. Yet what makes this place special its support for local sports and arts. Basketball games are a regular occurrence, as are concerts by Brisbanian bands like Powderfinger, The Veronicas and Savage Garden. International acts like Stevie Nicks and 50 Cent have also swung by. Check online to see who’s coming next.



2684-2690 Gold Coast Highway, Broadbeach Queensland 4218




Check website for details.









Jupiters Casino

Some people love to gamble – just ask the punters who flock to Jupiter’s Casino. Everyone who visits is ready to part with his or her cash in the hope of securing a win. As the day goes on, the stakes get higher – the trick is to know when to fold. When you’re done, try Osteria Vivo’s authentic Italian cuisine. From here, there’s a view of the poker tables and slot machines.

Pacific Fair Shoping Centre

Chain stores galore. This mall has endless stores, a multiplex and oodles of chic salons. For proof, pamper yourself in “Lush”, try on comfy “Crocs”, buy some bling at “Swarovski”, or order a luscious wheatgrass smoothie from the plethora of juice bars. This shopping centre is entrenched in the local community, and offer regular group events and sustainable initiatives.



Hooker Boulevard, Broadbeach Queensland 4218




Open Monday-Wednesday 09:00-17:30, Thursday 09:00-21:00, Friday-Saturday 09:00-17:30, Sunday 10:00-16:00









Wet n Wild Water World

Don your “Billabong” thongs and hotfoot it over to this water park. This lazy river is the perfect place to seek solace from the scorching sun. Wannabe surfers can get in some practice on the “FlowRider”, where you can practice your surf without wiping out. Risk-takers should tackle the Black Hole, or experience zero gravity on the Kamikaze for one seriously rad ride.



Pacific Highway Oxenford, Gold Coast Queensland 4210




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-20:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.

Regular shows reveal how stunt drivers create action-packed car chases, which give a behind-the-scenes glimpse into how movie magic is made. One of the major highlights is the “Batwing Spaceshot”, where riders are rocketed 60-metres into the air, then returned safely to Earth.



Pacific Motorway, Oxenford Queensland 4210




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30-17:00









Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary

For an iconic Aussie experience, this place is a real “didgeri-do”. It offers a peek into the country’s unique birds, mammals and amphibians. Lorikeets flit through the trees, kangaroos hop about and koalas lazily cling to gum trees. Meanwhile, crocodiles keep a beady eye on the action as they bask in the sunshine. Keep your camera handy and see who takes the first snap!



28 Tomewin Street, Currumbin Queensland 4223




Open Monday-Sunday 08:00-17:00









DreamWorld

Dream World is Australia’s largest theme park and offers plenty of white-knuckle thrills. For proof, take the “Giant Drop” – the highest free-fall ride in the world. If that’s not terrifying enough, the “big nine” rollercoasters offer serious screams. The “Tower of Terror” rockets backwards into complete darkness and breaks the 100 mph barrier in seven-seconds flat.



Dreamworld Parkway, Coomera Queensland 4209




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00









Tamborine Rainforest Skywalk

“Above the jungle, the mighty jungle”. This canopy climb through untamed rainforest showcases the Gold Coast’s natural splendour. Cross a 30-metre high walkway above unspoiled creeks and pristine rock pools. The buzz and squawk of the rainforest’s resident critters gives the sense of being immersed in wild nature. At night, it’s also a stellar place to stargaze.



333 Geissmann Drive, North Tamborine Queensland 4272




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30-16:00









Broadbeach

Golden sands, palm trees and that glorious Queensland sunshine – Broadbeach has everything you’d expect from the Gold Coast and a whole lot more. When you’re not taking a dip or catching some rays, the markets, parks and shops that line the shore are a great place to grab a bite, score a bargain, or just chill out and enjoy the vibe.








Burleigh Heads

Attracting adrenaline-seeking surfers and leisure-loving families alike, Burleigh Heads might be small but it packs a whole lot of charm into one great package. Though we wouldn’t blame you if you wanted to spend all your time on the sun-kissed beach, the headlands of the nearby National Park offer some stunning views across the Gold Coast. Don’t forget to take a picnic!








Greenmount Beach

The views up the coast at Greenmount Beach are some of the best in Queensland, not to mention it's got the kinds of sandy shores beach-lovers dream of, and a picturesque town with a laid-back vibe. Plus, the nearby Point Danger (which is nowhere near as scary as its name suggests!) is a great place for whale watching.








Snapper Rocks

Jutting out into the Tasman Sea on the southern tip of Queensland, you can stand on the beach at Snapper Rocks and enjoy clear blue waters as far as the eye can see. And the ocean isn’t just beautiful to look at – Snapper Rocks is famous for surfing thanks to its man-made surf break, and the waves crashing in (as well as the surfers riding them!) put on a fantastic show.








Tallebudgera Creek

With the lush peaks of Springbrook National Park in the background, Tallebudgera Creek might not be on the coast, but beach-lovers won’t be disappointed by this wonderful little inlet. Camping is super popular, and the creek’s sandy shores invite visitors to enjoy tons of water sports, plus some serious sunbathing!








Sea World Gold Coast

Sea World Gold Coast has all the adrenaline-packed fun of a theme park but with sea creatures in the mix! In addition to the Jet Rescue rollercoaster and the Viking Revenge Flume, there’s a whole host of deep-sea beasts, seals, dolphins, sharks, and penguins just waiting to meet you. The hardest part is knowing where to start.








Warner Bros. Movie World

Do you see your name in lights? The secrets of the silver screen are revealed at Movie World. Regular shows explain how stunt drivers create action-packed car chases and give a behind-the-scenes glimpse into how movie magic is made. One of the major highlights is the “Batwing Spaceshot,” where riders are rocketed 195 feet into the air then returned safely to Earth.








Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast

Slip into your flip flops and hurry over to this water park. This lazy river is the perfect place to seek solace from the scorching sun. Wannabe surfers can get in some practice on the “FlowRider” – where you can practice your surfing without wiping out. Risk takers should tackle the Black Hole or experience zero gravity on the Kamikaze for one seriously rad ride.








Australian Outback Spectacular

The Australian Outback has so many stories to tell. At this show, you can immerse yourself in the story of a young girl sold to the circus told through song, horseback riding, and stunts. You won’t go hungry either – this show is accompanied by a full 3-course Aussie barbecue for the whole family.








Springbrook National Park

All beached out? Just a short drive inland from the Gold Coast’s sea and sand, Springbrook National Park is the perfect place to spend a sunny afternoon. This rain forest is filled with tumbling waterfalls, rushing creeks, and leafy trails – stay after sunset to spy glow worms lighting up the trees.








O'Reilly's Lost World Spa

There’s relaxation, and then there’s O’Reilly’s relaxation. Nestled in the lush hills of the Lamington National Park, this spa refreshes mind, body, and spirit in the perfect natural setting. The Pouch Lounge gives you the chance to curl up by the fireplace and look out at the forest before settling in for a massage from the expert on-site massage therapists.








Lamington National Park

When it comes to purifying the spirit, a trip into nature always seems to do the trick. And what better place to get in touch with the natural world than Lamington National Park? This huge, protected forest area is filled with chirping wildlife. It’s best seen from the tree-top walkway – a series of rope bridges suspended in the jungle canopy.








Walking Trails in Tamborine Mountain National Park

Wandering through the jungle can calm even the most fried nerves. Tamborine Mountain is crisscrossed by walking routes of different lengths and difficulties. Hike past palm groves, eucalyptus, red cedars, and feel your mind rejuvenating as you go.








Currumbin Beach

This curved slice of sand and sea is treasured by locals, and not only because the Swell Sculpture art festival takes place here every September. Sheltered by the rocky coastline, the calm water of Currumbin Beach is perfect for a salty swim. Just make sure to swim between the red-and-yellow flags posted at either end to stay out of trouble!








Currumbin Valley Rock Pools

When the sun beats down hard on the open beaches of the Gold Coast, you'll need a plan B to cool off. The rock pools of Currumbin Valley are just the ticket. Located in a wildlife sanctuary for koalas, these refreshing waters act like a natural temperature cleanser on hot and sticky days.








Budds Beach

Relaxing in the peace and quiet at Budds Beach, you'd think it was miles away from Surfer's Paradise. But actually, this local treasure is just a 5-minute walk from the downtown area. You'll find white sand, calm waters, and laughing kids here. With a shaded playground and clean facilities, this river beach is perfect for families looking to enjoy a long day in the sun.








Tugun Beach

Tugun Beach is so clean that many first-time visitors wonder if it's private. Thankfully it's not because this long, sandy beach is perfect for a day of peaceful walking, a lazy picnic, or building sandcastles with the little ones. You can grab lunch at one of the many local takeout joints – try some fresh-caught seafood or a massive Queensland-style burger!








Kurrawa Beach

On the waterfront in the vibrant Gold Coast neighborhood of Broadbeach, Kurrawa’s stretch of soft sand is a favorite with sunbathers, swimmers and surfers alike. In warm weather, act like a local and head to the Kurrawa Surf Life Saving Club. It's not just a great place for it's waves, it also has a beachfront bistro and lively bar with entertainment every night!








Snapper Rocks Beach

Jutting out from the end of Rainbow Bay, this rugged headland marks the border between Queensland and New South Wales. More than just a beautiful local spot, Snapper Rocks Beach attracts sun lovers and swimmers whenever the weather’s warm. Off shore, expert surfers tackle some of the Gold Coast’s best waves.

Tell us how you made the most of your time at the theme parks in Gold Coast.





Anonymous


Hire a car - the buses get filled up fast and will not stop for you if they are full. If you miss one bus due to it being full, expect to miss the next 3-4 for the same reason THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION - you will be waiting for transport for at least 1-2 hours if this happens.
Arrive early at the park and go on the popular rides first thing in the morning when the crowds are minimal. The real crowds start flocking in at approximately 11am.
Also recommend bringing sunblock, snacks (muesli bars, lollies & fruit) to keep you going throughout the day, $10 for all-day locker hire (worth it!) and a plan to see all the scheduled shows (if there are any) and the rides you've been eagerly waiting to try.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
