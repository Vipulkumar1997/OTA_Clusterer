Things to Do in Lisbon









Santa Justa Elevator

As you approach this curious construction – all wrought iron and spindly neo-Gothic tracery – it’s hard not to wonder how it doesn’t topple over. But it’s been working just fine for over a century. Reach the Bairro Alto in style, with flashes of the cityscape peeping through the elevator’s filigree windows as you climb. In the City of the Seven Hills, this is a real leg-saver.



Rua do Ouro, 1150-060 Lisbon




Open Monday-Sunday 08:30–20:30.









St. George's Castle

Bar the gate! As your tram rattles up impossibly narrow streets to St George’s Castle, picture the mediaeval mayhem in 1147 when Afonso I’s forces breached the ramparts. Nowadays, it’s an altogether more placid place where peacocks rule the roost, roaming through pine trees or perching on battlements. Like the kings of old, marvel at this bird’s-eye view of Lisbon.



Rua de Santa Cruz do Castelo, 1100-129 Lisbon




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00-18:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Commerce Square

The dignitary’s gateway to Lisbon. For centuries, visiting kings and ambassadors approached this prosperous city by boat, alighting on a set of stone steps in Praça do Comércio. While the palace that once stood here has been replaced by elegant arcades, the steps remain. As you stand on the jetty, picture the travellers of old and the unparalleled opulence that greeted them.



Praça do Comércio









25 de Abril Bridge

With its winding streets, creaking trams and laid-back vibe, Lisbon is often compared to San Francisco. Makes sense, right? Well this massive red suspension bridge seals the deal. Originally called Salazar Bridge after the Portuguese dictator of the time, it was renamed to commemorate the peaceful revolution that ousted his successors. Who knows what they’ll call it next…



Ponte 25 de Abril, Lisbon









Cristo Rei Statue

Nothing like a giant statue of Christ for keeping up with the Joneses (or the Silvas). In 1934, Lisbon’s Cardinal Patriarch visited Rio de Janeiro and came back determined that Portugal should have its own Christ the Redeemer. And 25 years later – voilà! Towering over the opposite bank of the Tagus, complete with outstretched arms, was Cristo Rei. Well done your eminence!



Alto do Pragal, Avenida Cristo Rei, 2800-058 Almada




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30-18:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Jeronimos Monastery

In 1497, Vasco da Gama spiced up Portugal forever. His voyage to India secured the spice trade routes, filling Manuel I’s royal coffers with untold riches. This spicy wealth bankrolled Jeronimos Monastery, the lavish paragon of Manueline architecture. Part Gothic and part Renaissance, it dazzles with stunning stonework whose seafaring scenes salute Portugal’s great explorers.



Praça do Império, 1400-206 Lisbon




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Monument of the Discoveries

Sail ho! This concrete caravel juts out from the banks of the Tagus, frozen in the act of casting off for uncharted waters. On board is a dream team of leading lights from the Age of Discovery, headed by Henry the Navigator. Ferdinand Magellan, captain of the first crew to circumnavigate the globe? Check. Vasco da Gama, who opened up sea routes to Asia? Check. Quite some crew!



Avenida Brasília, 1400-038 Lisbon




Open Tuesday-Sunday 10:00-18:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Lisbon Oceanarium

Splash! It’s fitting that a city once known as the Queen of the Sea should have such a top-notch aquarium. At Lisbon Oceanarium you are plunged (not literally) into a deep blue world of sunfish and sea otters. The main event is an enormous central tank that teems with gliding, shimmering creatures. Subtle sound effects and salty smells complete the full sensory immersion.



Esplanada Dom Carlos I, s/nº, 1990-005 Lisbon




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-18:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Gare do Oriente

One for architecture fans. Portugal’s busiest station is also its most spectacular. Santiago Calatrava’s trademark ice-white curves are in evidence, but to fully appreciate this building you have to look up. Gothic arches support a spellbinding roof – a crepe paper concertina that gives the impression of a glowing forest canopy when lit up at night. Those lucky commuters!



Avenida Dom João II, Lisbon









Belem Tower

Have you ever seen a military building with such an emphasis on beauty? Belem Tower was built as a defensive fortress, surrounded by the waters of the Tagus. But this is a real work of art. There are bulbous Moorish turrets on each corner, crenulations carefully carved with the Portuguese crest and a Venetian loggia that’s more Canaletto than cannonballs. An impressive hybrid.



Avenida Brasília, 1400-038 Lisbon




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Bairro Alto Neighborhood

High up the hill in Lisbon’s old town, bustling Bairro Alto buzzes with energy. Tables and chairs spill out along its narrow streets, where 20-somethings get together well into the early hours. You’ll step off the funicular tram and into a welcoming crowd of locals and tourists alike, happy to chat and make new friends over drinks and dancing.








Kubo

In the summer, Lisbon’s social scene culminates at Kubo. This beachside bar goes from daytime chill zone to romantic evening venue and—by the time the clock strikes midnight—buzzes with partygoers. Whether you're looking for a laid-back time or dancing ‘til dawn, this is the place to be to get to know like-minded locals.








Príncipe Real Neighborhood

Just north of Bairro Alto, quaint Principe Real overflows with village-like charm. A mostly residential neighborhood, there are pretty gardens and brightly colored buildings to wander around – with lots of antique shops and welcoming cafes scattered around its streets. Drop by one for some friendly conversation with the locals!

Popular Neighborhoods in Lisbon












Lisbon City Center


2315 properties

There’s so much going on in the city centre, it’s hard to know where to start. Baixa impresses with its architecture and Chiado enchants with its sophistication. Bairro Alto offers night owls a shindig with a view and Avenida Liberdade brims with designer shops. And for a taste of ordinary Lisboeta life, head to the residential streets of Saldanha.

Accommodations in Lisbon City Center













Baixa / Chiado


674 properties

Welcome to Old Lisbon. Baixa’s pedestrian streets exude a charm of yesteryear, with expansive Praça do Comércio embodying Lisbon’s 18th-century grandeur. From there, head uphill to Chiado for a coffee in poet Fernando Pessoa’s old haunt, A Brasileira. Or take the gloriously old-school Santa Justa Elevator up to the roofless beauty of Carmo Convent.

Accommodations in Baixa / Chiado













Bairro Alto


419 properties

Bairro Alto has something of the Jekyll and Hyde about it. Climb the quaint cobbles during the day and you’d never guess what night-time antics go on here. The narrow streets fill with revellers who spill out of overflowing bars, plastic cups in hand. Catch the sunset from Park Bar’s terrace before ducking into the maze of watering holes. “Saúde”!

Accommodations in Bairro Alto













Alfama


253 properties

The home of “fado”. Portugal’s national song finds its voice in Alfama’s taverns. As you wind through the sloping warren of casbah-like streets, snippets of sorrowful song float out of “fado” houses. Duck inside to enjoy the performances first hand. And what’s melancholy music without some fine Portuguese wine and “pastéis de bacalhau” (fishcakes)?

Accommodations in Alfama













Av. Liberdade


137 properties

Gucci, Prada, Yves Saint Laurent… you get the idea. Avenida da Liberdade is an elongated shopping shrine for Lisbon’s high-flyers and big spenders. As you join the catwalk or observe from the leafy central walkway, don’t forget to look down. This avenue gleams with some of the finest examples of Lisbon’s traditional “calçada” pavement mosaics.

Accommodations in Av. Liberdade













Parque das Nacoes


106 properties

A classic for a Sunday stroll. The steel curves and glistening glass of Parque das Nacoes are a far cry from central Lisbon’s old-world splendour. Follow the riverside boardwalk past the array of new-fangled buildings and sculptures. Give your taste buds a fishy treat at a waterfront eatery before feasting your eyes on marine life in the outstanding Oceanarium.

Accommodations in Parque das Nacoes













Belem


88 properties

Hail the Age of Discovery! Belém is jam-packed with opulent buildings from Portugal’s golden era, when her explorers ruled the waves. Stand agog at Jerónimos Monastery’s stunning stonework, replete with maritime motifs saluting Vasco da Gama and company. Then set a course for the unique Belém Tower, jutting out into the Tagus like a caravel of old.

Accommodations in Belem













Santiago


54 properties

History seeps out of every brick in Santiago. Wherever you look in these winding streets, you’ll spot a crumbling building or some endearingly cracked “azulejos” (painted tiles). For that romantic moment, head up to the Santa Luzia viewpoint, where sweeping views over Alfama and the Tagus are perfectly framed by hanging plants and faded tiling.

Accommodations in Santiago













Se


53 properties

Sé what? This little parish awakes to the cathedral bells calling devotees to matins. Sé Cathedral is a curious mix of forbidding battlements, Gothic cloisters and a Romanesque rose window. And it’s steeped in saintly pedigree. Check out the casket with St Vincent’s remains and the font where Sé resident, St Anthony of Padua, was baptised in 1195.

Accommodations in Se













Cais do Sodre


48 properties

What a difference a couple of decades make. Once a seedy dockland stalked by grog-swilling mariners, Cais do Sodré is now the hottest hipster ticket in town. But it hasn’t lost sight of its edgy heritage. Knock back some moonshine among fishing paraphernalia at Sol e Pesca before tipping your sailor’s cap to the raunchy roots of Pensão Amor.

Accommodations in Cais do Sodre











Local Tips for Lisbon







Feira da Ladra




by Pedro

Pedro manages to juggle being in a metal band, with a passion for travel and online gaming.


Just a 5-minute walk from the Santa Apolónia Train Station, Feira da Ladra market opens every Saturday and Tuesday morning, until early afternoon. A mishmash of old and new, this is the place to find that 80s vinyl that’s missing from your collection, or that furniture piece that will add flavour to your living room!

Campo de Santa Clara, 1100-472 Lisbon

Open Tuesday-Saturday 06:00–17:00








A Vida Portuguesa




by Filipe

Filipe is a Porto-born cooking enthusiast who likes spending time with his girlfriend and their dog.


Hidden in one of the side streets of Chiado is this quaint shop. It features old-school products which are a throwback to Portugal's past, such as hard-to-find toothpaste, shoe polish and hair tonic. It also has classically crafted children's toys, souvenirs and regional food products.

Pensão Amor




by Teresa

A fun-loving travel addict, Teresa finds happiness relaxing with friends and exploring the Algarve.


Pensão Amor is a burlesque spot unlike anything else in Lisbon. It’s on the site of an old brothel and is located near the river in the revamped and newly popular night haunt Cais do Sodré district. The dimly lit bar also has regular live entertainment and musical sets.

Bairro Alto Hotel's Terrace Bar




by Cláudia

A whirlwind of good-natured fun, Cláudia enjoys eating great food and drinking good wine.


After a wholesome lunch on Bairro Alto Hotel’s summer terrace, take time to window shop on Chiado and Rua Augusta streets. Later, you can return to the hotel and sit on the rooftop terrace to watch the sunset with a glass of red wine and enjoy one of the most spectacular views over Lisbon.

Pavilhão Chinês




by Manuella

Outgoing and fun-loving, Brazilian-born Manu fell in love with Portugal, namely her beloved Algoz.


Part museum, part bar, this old haberdashery (gentlemen’s clothing dealer) is the place to go for a great night out in the city. The cocktails are excellent and the decorative dolls and figurines give the place a lovely ambiance.

Hippotrip




by João

Always sporting a boyish smile, João is enthusiastic about sports and loves making people laugh.


A little-known sightseeing tour in Lisbon is the Hippotrip. You can tour the city's most emblematic landmarks in an amphibious vehicle, alternating between water and land, without ever leaving your seat! Even though I'm a local, it gave me a fresh view of my own city.

Open Monday-Sunday 09:00–19:00








Miradouro Nossa Senhora do Monte




by Rui

Food and wine lover Rui is an encyclopaedia on the best spots to visit in Portugal's major cities.


My favourite lookout point in Lisbon is still a bit of a hidden gem. Miradouro Nossa Senhora do Monte is quite unlike the more touristy places, but not far from Lisbon’s most visited attractions. Sit under the pine trees and witness the bustling city from one of its calmest places.

Accommodations nearby



Largo do Monte, 1170 Lisbon








Miradouro de Santa Catarina




by Lourenço

Outwardly serene, Lourenço is actually a very social person, who enjoys surfing and city nightlife.


Bairro Alto’s quiet and beautiful lookout point by day becomes a busy meeting point on warm weekend nights. Try the nearby Noobai terrace for drinks, snacks or a light lunch, or head to the Pharmácia restaurant for a hearty meal.

Accommodations nearby



Rua de Santa Catarina, 1200-403 Lisbon

Booking.com asked travelers...

Why do you recommend Lisbon for food?





Anonymous


I highly recommend not only Lisbon, but the whole country for food because it is a beautiful and wonderful full of flavors Mediterranean food.You must try the Cod (bacalhau), pork (carne de porco), steaks (carnes), desserts, especially the traditional Pastel de Nata ( pastry fill with Portuguese custard). They serve big portions for a very cheap price and they always comes with salads, breads and olives.The Portuguese is really healthy and the chefs cook with love.Let's not forget to mention here, the Portuguese wine that  is considered  one of the best wines in the world. They are produced according to the region and the most famous are Alentejo, Dão, Douro and  many others. In my opinion, I recommend the wines from the Dão region because it is really tasty, juicy and they have an wooden flavor in the end. The bouquet reminds me an old barrel. Enjoy Comida Portuguesa (Portuguese food)!

How can you enjoy the sights in Lisbon while avoiding the crowds?

Take a sightseeing trip to get your bearings and see the main sights - then go back to look at the ones you're really interested in. The 48 hour yellow bus ticket covers all routes for Euro 25 and for that you can also use the trams, funiculars, lifts, Carris buses and Airport Bus. Great value.

Transportation





Lisbon Transportation









Air



Located 7 km from the city centre, Portela International is the largest airport in Portugal. You can reach the city centre by metro via the red line in about 20 minutes (EUR 1.40 single), and there are also 5 bus lines leading into the city (EUR 1.80 single). Two shuttle bus options provide links between the city’s main points, as well as Sete Rios Bus Station and Entrecampos and Cais do Sodré Train Stations (EUR 3.50 single).




Portela International Airport
www.ana.pt











Metro



The metro system is the most convenient way to get around, as it covers most major parts of the city and is easy to navigate. You can purchase a one-way ticket at the booths inside the station for EUR 1.40. A daily pass for the metro costs EUR 6, while a Viva Viagem Card can be bought for EUR 0.50 – these top-up cards are accepted on the bus, metro, train and even river ferry. The metro runs every day from 06:30–01:00, and there are four different lines.




Metropolitano de Lisboa, E.P.E.
metro.transporteslisboa.pt











Train



Comboios de Portugal (CP) connects Lisbon with most of Portugal via local services and fast trains that link to Porto and Faro. Tickets can be bought either at the station, online or on the train after boarding. Prices vary according to seating class and destination. Another payment option is the Viva Viagem Card, which is accepted on the bus, metro, train and even river ferry. The card costs EUR 0.50 and can be purchased and topped up at selected stations.




CP - Comboios de Portugal
www.cp.pt











Tram



No visit to Lisbon would be complete without a ride on a vintage city tram. The most emblematic of the 5 routes is the 28 Yellow Tram, which runs through the traditional Alfama district. The popular Tram 15 connects to historic Belém, but this route is operated by modern vehicles, not classic trams. Tickets cost EUR 2.85 and are available from the driver or the on-board ticket machine (coins only). You can also pay with a Viva Viagem Card (see Train description).




Eléctricos de Lisboa
www.carris.pt











Bus



Buses are a great way to get to know Lisbon, and the city has a functional and widespread service. The flat fare for the city bus is EUR 1.80 for a one-way ticket. Daily passes can be purchased for EUR 6 and are accepted on the metro too. There are 12 night lines and 7 sightseeing circuits with varying price ranges. There are also airport shuttles serving some of the main hotels, Sete Rios Bus Station and Entrecampos and Cais do Sodré Railway Stations.




Carris
www.carris.pt











Taxi



When you have a fixed destination in mind, taking a taxi may be your best option. You can hail one on the street, but it’s safest to find one at a taxi rank or call for one. The average starting tariff for inner city rides is EUR 3.25 and the average tariff per kilometre is EUR 0.55. From 21:00–06:00 fares are a little higher. Taxis are usually pale yellow, or black with an aqua-coloured bonnet.




Táxis de Lisboa
taxislisboa.com











Car



Travelling by car in Lisbon can be tricky, especially in the older parts of the city. Parking is scarce and the streets may be confusing for non-locals. Always stick to public transport when possible. There are various car parks in the historic centre, but be warned: they are not cheap. Motorists tend to drive quickly and erratically, but they generally respect pedestrian crossings, stopping immediately to give pedestrians the right of way.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
