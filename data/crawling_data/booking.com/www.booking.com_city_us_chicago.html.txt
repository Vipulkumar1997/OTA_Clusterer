Chicago Travel Guide










Our Kind of Town
Standing proud beside Lake Michigan, Chicago is down-to-earth, friendly, and full of culture. It has outdoor art by famous artists including Chagall and Picasso, and there are some fascinating architectural works from the Art Institute of Chicago.
Home to blues and house music, Chicago has an eclectic music scene that reflects its spirit. The Windy City is also a pioneer in a variety of Americanized dishes from it's European immigrant roots like deep-dish pizza and the Chicago hot dog.
The world’s first skyscraper and Ferris wheel were erected in Chicago. The latter, on Navy Pier, is one of the Midwest’s most visited sights. Also famed is the ‘L’ transport system, whose raised trains circle The Loop, the main business district. Check out its skyline reflection in the shiny bean sculpture in huge Millennium Park.
Home of the Bulls and Bears, Chicago is a stronghold of sport and has teams playing baseball, basketball, American football and hockey, to name a few. If you get a chance, try to catch a game.
Chicago Midway and Chicago O’Hare Airport are both on the outskirts of this vast city, so make sure to leave enough time for travel from your Booking.com hotel, apartment or hostel. And all that jazz.

Beautiful Christmas lights of all colors on the trees around...

Beautiful Christmas lights of all colors on the trees around O’Hare airport.While in Bucktown, we ate at a great Korean taco place, En Hakkore. Then had a beer and played pool at Lemmings.Another night we ate at Naha, an upscale restaurant downtown. Food was good but not great for the price. Then walked down by the river. Chicago is a fun, vibrant city.

Nice city with impressive architecture.

Nice city with impressive architecture. We loved the Architecture River tour, and the deep pizza we had by the Navy Pier was a nice experience as well. The cloud gate at the millineum park is a must see as well. We climbed Willis tower but it was too crowded over there and took us a couple of hours to get to the top, I don't think it is worth the wait.

We love the KrisKindle mart.

We love the KrisKindle mart. It is a must see.  The Christmas caroling at the bean was great fun, the Chicago symphony was excellent, We did some Black Friday shopping at Old Orchard  that was good and topped it off with Church at Morton Grove community church.  We always enjoy our stay.








Hotels That Guests Love in Chicago





Wyndham Grand Chicago Riverfront









“
Beautiful hotel overlooking the Chicago River and just a couple of blocks from both the Magnificent Mile and the historic Chicago Theatre. The staff was very helpful and courteous. Very nice room - comfortable and spacious.  Overall, an exceptional stay.
”






Chicago Parthenon Hostel









“
It is 5 mins walk to supermarket, to the train to the airport; very close to downtown Chicago: we were able to visit Chicago on foot from the hotel without any other means of transport and walked 10 mins when we arrived at Union station. Could not have been better.  Also: there is the use of a very good kitchen and the lounge is very good: tv and conversation with other guests....could not have been better.
”






Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago-Downtown









“
Clean, updated rooms.  The free breakfast was awesome and the staff was very friendly and professional.  Close to Magnificent Mile.  One of the least expensive more decent-looking hotels that I could find available for that weekend in the city because the cheaper options that I saw pics of online did not appear to look presentable.  I wouldn't mind staying here again the next time that I come to Chicago.
”






Courtyard by Marriott Chicago Downtown/River North









“
I loved the location! I have never been to Chicago before and it was within walking distance of a bunch of restaurants, bars, the magnificent mile and the lake! The staff was extremely helpful in getting us a ride to the airport in the morning.
”






Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile









“
I stayed at this hotel for two nights for a girls weekend with ten people total. I was able to check in early when I arrived which was a pleasant surprise! The staff was so helpful getting all three rooms I booked on the same floor and in reasonable distance from each other! The rooms were updated and clean. It had great location to the Magnificent Mile and all the places we wanted to go in Chicago. I felt it was a great place to stay for the price I paid and I would definitely stay here again!
