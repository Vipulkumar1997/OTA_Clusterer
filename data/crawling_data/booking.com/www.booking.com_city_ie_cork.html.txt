Cork Travel Guide










Irish Spirit In A Nutshell
Situated on the banks of the River Lee, Cork’s city center was originally built on marshes and many of its popular streets are constructed on the former river channels. With a thriving nightlife and a vibrant cultural scene, the Irish Republic’s second biggest city is full of surprises.
Those interested in history should pay a visit to the Cork City Gaol, an old prison transformed into one of the city’s most fascinating attractions, or join the Cork Historic Walking Tours, which have a great opportunity to learn all the city’s secrets.
For those craving more lively entertainment, the city has the famous Cork City Pub Crawl or even more exciting, the Barrack Street Challenge, where participants drink pints of beer in all bars along Barrack Street.
The shopping area is concentrated around the most famous street - St. Patrick Street. For local food specialities like crubeens, tripe and drisheen, browse bars and restaurants around MacCurtain, Washington and Oliver Plunkett Streets.
When flying to Cork Airport, you’re just a short taxi or bus ride from the lively city centre. Don’t worry about accommodations; Booking.com has plenty from convenient hotels, to cozy guesthouses and bed & breakfasts.

It's a small and quiet town.

It's a small and quiet town. The locals are very friendly. There a few clubs and pubs that do fill up but not to be visited for partying. It's a good place to stop in for a day and tour if you're having a driving adventure around the island.

Great spot to make a base for seeing this part of Ireland.

Great spot to make a base for seeing this part of Ireland.  You can take day trips if you want, we did.  And also there is plenty of history.  We walked and took taxis.  Every taxi driver had a story, we enjoyed them very much. Pubs are grand.  So much to see and experience.  Highly recommend Cork.

Jameson Distillery your was incredible.

Jameson Distillery your was incredible.  Highly recommend the behind the scenes tour if you have the time.  Blarney castle and grounds are beautiful, could have spent a couple days just walking the grounds.  Great food and very friendly people in Cork! Go late afternoon or early morning to avoid lines for the Blarney Stone.

St Fin Barre Cathedral is amazing!

St Fin Barre Cathedral is amazing! All the stained glass is so beautiful as is the ceiling! Downtown and around town you'll see the river. Food at the River Lee was great! I had Dover Sole (fish) that was grilled to perfection! Blarney Castle is very cool as is hiking up the extremely, I mean extremely narrow spiral stone steps! I was pulling myself up the steps via an attached rope! It is not for the claustrophobic or someone with walking issues. The guys at the top help you to kiss the Blarney Stone & you can purchase photos of your venture - even digital ones. Costly, but hey once in a lifetime opportunity. There's also the English Market.

This was one of my favorite places we stayed in Ireland. The grounds were kept so beautifully and it was a nice change of pace then staying toward the city. The host were so sweet bringing us wine and treats since we were on our honeymoon. The room were very spacious and super comfortable.
