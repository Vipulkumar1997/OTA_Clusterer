Things to Do in Pattaya Central









Sanctuary of Truth

Majestic and mesmerising, the Sanctuary of Truth has a level of detail that will leave you speechless. With the cerulean-blue sea forming a dramatic backdrop, you can watch the woodcarvers at work on this magical structure. Made entirely of teak without a single metal nail, its beauty is something that has to be appreciated from both the outside and the inside.








Jomtien Beach

If you’re after some relaxation, spend the day at Jomtien. You’ll find that this family-friendly beach is a bit cleaner and less crowded than the rest of Pattaya. With beautiful water, delicious food stalls and cocktails made for sunset watching, you’ll make this beach your go-to hangout in no time.








Pattaya Floating Market

With over 100 food stalls covering 100,000 sq m, the Pattaya Floating Market is the place to be when your stomach rumbles. You can buy steaming noodle soups, pad thai, spicy curries and coconut pancakes. When you’re done stuffing your face, it’s time to do some shopping. You’ll find Thai handicrafts and ancient games, plus loads of postcards and souvenirs to bring back home.








Wang Sam Sien

Welcoming you into this fine example of feng shui is Guanyin, the Chinese Goddess of Compassion, Mercy and Kindness. Don’t miss the beautifully decorated wall, adorned with 24 paintings telling stories of gratitude. Braver visitors can access the hillside temple on foot, but you can also take a motorcycle taxi or songthaew truck.








Khao Phra Bat Temple

Perched on a hilltop overlooking Pattaya, this isn’t the biggest temple – but it makes up for this by housing what is supposedly Buddha’s footprint. A collection of charming statues sits within the temple, overseen by an 18-metre tall Buddha. The lookout point behind the temple area offers all-encompassing views over the city.








Wat Yansangwararam Temple Complex

There are temples and then are temples – this complex shimmers in the sunlight. See Thai architecture in all its finery at this ‘wat’ dedicated to the country’s previous monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Spot Chinese pavilions and edifices taking their influence from India and Switzerland. Spot a golden-hued Buddha amongst the grounds before scaling the 299 steps up to the temple's gleaming doors.








Mini Siam Theme Park

No time to do a tour of Thailand? Take this whistle-stop tour and see famous temples like Wat Arun and Bangkok’s Victory Temple in small but detailed scale. Venture further to see sights like the Sydney Opera House, the Statue of Liberty and Tower Bridge. The place is popular so make sure you book tickets at least a day in advance.

Exceptional


Central Pattaya is fun but in three years of visits I have never seen so many Traffic Cops ripping off Tourists as on this trip! Beware and have your documents in order and wear a crash helment if you ride a scooter/motorbike.

The views from the bay were great, they had great restaurants around the shopping centre on soi 3. Transport around was easy to find and better to get a scooter taxi to get about quicker as lots of one way streets.Definately a place for older mem as ladies everywhere.

Pattaya is changing , it’s moving towards a family resort whilst retaining the great excitement that single travellers enjoy so much , it’s great value , give it a try you won’t be disappointed

Recommended in Pattaya Central







Booking.com asked travelers...

Which spa or what treatment is worth pampering yourself with in Pattaya Central?





Anonymous


I tried several spa when I was in Pattaya.  Most were recommended by friends or magazine.   Since the shopping mall was yet to open, I decided to try the spa at Hilton
before heading to the airport. The spa is the best I' ve ever had.

Tell us about your most relaxing moments in Pattaya Central.





Anonymous


For a modest sum , you can hire your own beach umbrella and chairs with table. You can order food without leaving your chairs and just generally relax. A lot of vendors will try to sell you things but they didnt bother you too much .
