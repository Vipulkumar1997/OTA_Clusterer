Singapore Travel Guide












Asia in a Compact Package
Clean, compact and compelling, Singapore seamlessly combines the best of Asia. Different cultures and cuisines live side by side, while maintaining their own identity.
Behind the bright lights of Chinatown is cheap and delicious dim sum, while Little India is a sensation for the senses. Wander past the pastel-painted facades of Malay-dominated Geylang Seari for a taste of days gone by, then stop off at the Colonial-style Raffles Hotel, birthplace of the Singapore Sling cocktail.
For a retreat from the hustle and bustle, take the cable car to the sandy beaches of Sentosa, an island just south of the city center. Also here is Universal Studios Singapore, a theme park brimming with the magic of the movies.
As you’d expect from the host of the world’s only Formula 1 night race, once night falls, Singapore is still very much alive. Its Night Safari is a zoo providing the rare chance to see nocturnal animals going about their business.
Although small enough to see on foot, Singapore has an efficient public transport system which extends as far as Singapore Changi Airport. With a choice of Singapore accommodations ranging from budget hostels to luxury hotels, Booking.com is bound to have the right choice for your holiday.

All was great.

All was great. A lot of sightseeing spots. Nice weather when we were there. Although it was during the rainy season, less sun and occasional shower. Good weather to walk around. The attractions at Sentosa. Suitable for adults and children. Want to go back again!Clear sign for Halal restaurants.Managed to use the MRT although most of the time we used taxi.

Still agreat place to visit but no longer a place for great deals. I used to travel here a lot on business and loved the sights (night safari is a must do) low cost, great food, friendly people, ease of getting around.  Still great except for the prices- much more expensive now - - no bargains.

Beautiful City planning, wonderful parks and gardens everywhere. Infrastucture perfectly maintained....spotlessly clean. Great food and dining options, The Sands group run the casino, very upscale, although there is a cover charge of $100 per 24 hours to enter and play. Very exclusive surroundings...

Singapore is a great city- clean, modern, efficient, visually stimulating. Lots of free things to enjoy like the Garden of the Bay light show and the Marina Bay fountain show every night.  Food courts provide good inexpensive food to try. Alcohol very expensive even for a beer.

Hotels That Guests Love in Singapore





Furama City Centre









“
The staff were exceptional. Friendly and helpful. Great bathroom/shower. Like most Singapore hotels, the mattress was very hard. Great location, steps from shopping and food courts. Short walk to Chinatown or MRT. Pool was lovely. Birthday cake surprise and personalised card was very much appreciated
”






The Fullerton Hotel Singapore









“
Heritage room had a great view of the marina.  Hotel is minutes away from all tourist areas in the Marina and Business district.  The building itself is the original Post Office.  They don't build them like this any more.
”






Holiday Inn Express Singapore Clarke Quay









“
Location is great, close to Clarke Quay and the MRT. The hotel is good value for money compared with other hotels I've stayed in Singapore. Room sizes are ok, staff are friendly, facilities are good, I definitely stay here again
”






Royal Plaza on Scotts









“
Near Orchad street, easy take taxi or MRT nearby hotel. Room white big Vs other Singapore hotels.
”

This hostel has been my fave stay since I put my 1st step in Singapore. the cleanliness, comfort and location are top of my lists of hotels/hostels. my fave 5footway.inn was located in Bugis because it nears to Haji Lane, Arab Street, Sultan Mosque, and many more.
