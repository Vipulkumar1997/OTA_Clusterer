It’s an amazingly walkable city.

It’s an amazingly walkable city. It feels bigger than it actually is. We could walk from our hotel to the center of town in just ten minutes or so. Amazing food and drinks, had the best cocktail of my life.

Reykjavík is a small but quaint town.

Reykjavík is a small but quaint town. Very easy to get around to all the shops, bakeries , restaurants and bus stop for tour pick ups. Hard Rock Cafe is always a must stop for my family however, we love to eat local. We tri d the Icelandic hotdogs at the Baejarins Betzu Pylsur stand, which were delish, we had fish and chips at Icelandic Fish and Chips , lobster bisque at Seabarin to name a few . There are lots of great restaurants for different budgets. Stay close to the city center and most things will be at walking distance to include the Hallgrímskirkja church. We took several tours that were fabulous and even saw the northern lights, the Midatlantic ridge at Thingvellir National Park , hot springs and more.  We didn’t get to see the glaciers on the south coast because trip was canceled due to bad weather. Overall, it was a wonderful trip!!! I highly recommend visiting Reykjavík 😊

Very charming city, superb restaurants and food.

Very charming city, superb restaurants and food...but be warned, food is extremely expensive, even at the supermarket ($10 for dozen eggs, $7 loaf of bread). However iceland itself more than makes up for it. Lastly, pay no attention to stuck-up travel sites... the blue lagoon is amazing, yes it can be crowded, but it has no comparison!!

Small city without any historical centre.

Small city without any historical centre. Yet I liked it really much, it's clean, there's a lot of street art, view at the ocean and moutains. Go off the beaten path, go at a local band concert, in case of bad weather hide in one of many musseums.

Forréttabarinn, Slippbarinn, Sægriffin, Icelandic Fish and Chips (same building as Volcano house), Matarkjallarinn-Food Cellar, Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur (great hotdogs!), Messinn, Tjornin, Saga Museum, Landnámssýningin/The Settlement Exhibition, Vesturbæjarlaug, and much more that is great for the winter. But take trips out of Reykjavík with Arctic Adventures. We had really pleasant/outstanding 1-night and 2-night trips with them.

Very walkable city and easy to visit highlights within 2 days. We signed up for a citywalk tour and learned a great deal from a university history student.  Lots of restaurant choices. We ate at Glo (healthy buffet) and Sushi Social (fun atmosphere). Our children are 16 and 19 and we felt safe allowing them to explore a bit on their own.








Hotels That Guests Love in Reykjavík





Icelandair Hotel Reykjavik Marina









“
The location was fabulous -- and much better than the Icelandair Natura hotel.  The Marina hotel is very walkable to all of central Reykjavik.  Close to a great coffee cafe and a great restaurant.  Interesting (though overpriced) drinks at the bar.  Great little restaurant/deli for breakfast or a light lunch.  Very friendly staff there and very well set up.
”






Atlantic Apartments & Rooms









“
They left a key for us which made it convenient for late check in.  That was about it.  Not much else positive to say about this hotel.  It's in Reykjavik, but not downtown.  There was free parking, I guess.  The price was cheap (but not nearly low enough to convince me to stay here again).
”






Alda Hotel Reykjavík









“
The hotel is in a great location and walking distance to the center of Reykjavík. The staff is super courteous and helpful! The room was bigger than expected and very clean. Would definitely go back again!
”






I Sleep Reykjavik Guesthouse









“
For the price (relative to other hotels/hostels in Reykjavik).  This was a nice, comfortable place to stay.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  It is located 4 to 5 blocks off the main drag.
”






Hotel Ódinsvé









“
Cute hotel in a perfect location. On a quiet street just off from the main shopping area, short walk to shops, restaurants, and downtown reykjavik. Staff was VERY accomodating and friendly. Room was clean and comfortable, very nice bedding...sleep like a baby, hallways were quiet, bathroom was a little tiny but that's iceland. Lol. It served it's purpose. I'd stay there again, hands down.
