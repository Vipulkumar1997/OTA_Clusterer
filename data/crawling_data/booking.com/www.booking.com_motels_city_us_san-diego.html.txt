Hotels That Guests Love in San Diego




EZ 8 Motel Old Town









“
The affordable rates for the location. Such a low nightly rate is unheard of in this area in San Diego.Additionally, the fact that the motel did not require a deposit from its guests was added bonus,
”






Hotel Aqua Mar









“
Great location close to San Diego Airport, but not a generic "airport hotel". The price was right so it's hard to complain about things that would be issues at a nicer, more expensive property - at the price, it was just fine. A motel with some age showing, but certainly nicer than many roadside motels.
”






Hotel Iris - Mission Valley-San Diego Zoo-SeaWorld









“
We came to San Diego for a family reunion.  We had 5 rooms at this hotel for family.  A very basic, no frills motel.  The 2 women at the front desk were very accommodating to try to group the rooms as close as possible.
”






Super 8 Sea World Zoo Area









“
For a motel, its really nice inside. You can find parking but the spaces are really tight. The staff was really nice.  I stayed here bc I can't afford the hotel price and I just moved here.  So it was a temporary stay.  Maybe in the future they will allow us to do monthly stays.  Considering cost of living is so high in San Diego.
”






EZ 8 Motel Old Town









“
Considering this motel is right in the center of San Diego, it's a great value for the money. I liked getting the free upgrade to a larger room and the courtesy and friendliness of the staff.
”
