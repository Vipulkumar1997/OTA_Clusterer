Great room for a motel and very clean.

Park Cienega Motel









“
We stayed at this motel on the first and last night of our trip in the US and it was the perfect place to relax before and after a flight. The rooms are spacious, have a full sink, microwave and fridge. Everything was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The owners were friendly and accommodating and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for affordable and conveniently​ located accommodation in Los Angeles
”






Coral Sands Motel









“
We visited New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Among these three cities, this was the best accomodation. Personel was fully professional, room was absolutely clean and comfortable. There was a cofee/tea machine in the room, and was refilled every day! Laundry was easy to use, and one could easily get coins for it at the reception desk. There are lots of stores in the neighbourhood!Good job, everyone!  If we came back to LA, we would certainly stay in this motel again!
”






Hyde Park Motel









“
The motel is a short distance from the airport and close to interesting locations in Los Angeles. Staff is very friendly and readily responds to requests. Comfortable beds, cofee maker, fridge and a microwave oven available in the room. Shops and restaurants are within a short driving distance.  Excellent value for money.
”






La Quinta Inn & Suites LAX









“
Loved the location, staff were great and so helpful. Great value for money, facilities awesome and breakfast included in price was fantastic - great range of foods and plenty of it. If people not happy with this motel, they must be hard to please. We will definitely not hesitate to recommend this motel and will definitely stay there when next in Los Angeles 😀

Verified reviews from real guests.

How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
