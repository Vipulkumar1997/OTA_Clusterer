Milan Travel Guide










A Capital of Design & Style
Renowned as the world’s fashion and design capital, Milan is never short on places to see and things to experience. The stunning architecture of the Duomo di Milano and the famous La Scala theatre are just a few of the city’s breath-taking attractions. For a more intimate adventure, the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie with Leonardo da Vinci's “Last Supper” lets you view a masterpiece from Italy’s past.
Visit the FieraMilano and Salone del Mobile, among the world’s largest and most prestigious furniture and design fairs or have a stroll in the Quadrilatero Della Moda district to admire unique creations from the most famous Italian fashion brands: Gucci, Versace, Armani, Prada or Dolce & Gabbana.
The Navigli and Porta Romana districts are famed for restaurants and bars serving delicious Lombard cuisine and the very popular aperitivo. Make sure you try sweet delicacies at the chic Caffé Cova, founded in 1817, or another historical café, Zucca, in the Galleria.
Arriving at Malpensa or Linate Airports, you’re only a short trip from the city centre, where you can watch a game at the San Siro or enjoy Milan Fashion Week. Whether you’re staying in a chic apartment, design hotel or budget hostel, Booking.com has a perfect place to stay for your travels in Milan.

We loved Milan.

We loved Milan. Unfortunately we only had one day there, and the Christmas Markrts started the day after we left. Get your tickets early for The Last Supper. Tickets to the Duomo and Museum were only $3 and kids under 6 are free! There are other packages that go up in price.

Too busy, rude people hard to get into places and average food, if you love shopping there is plenty to do otherwise it’s rether boring, on my second day I took a train to Lake Como to get out of the city.

The best part of visiting in Milan is that it’s NOT touristy; you get a sense that real people live here.  There are several attractions, besides shopping, but not for more than 3-4 nights. Nice & relaxing for a big city.

Surprised at the immensity and cleanliness of this city. There is plenty to do and see. For some reason I was under the impression Milan would be “run-down” but I was quite mistaken! Beautiful vibrant city

Unfortunately we were not able to visit the inside of the Duomo as there was a mass going on until noon. We had only a few hours to see Milan as we were on a short overnight stay. It was still wonderful to walk around the Duomo and also through the mall. We really enjoyed The Last Supper by Da Vinchy. The train to the airport was on strike but we were able to take a bus instead.

The city itself have no specific uniqueness.

The city itself have no specific uniqueness. But Milan is a city that I always have to go back to because of the football atmosphere. Must visit Duomo and watch a football match at Giuseppe Meazza. Shopping heaven..








Hotels That Guests Love in Milan





Atmos Luxe Navigli









“
Sonia and Douglas are very welcoming and friendly people. The hostel is very welcoming and cozy. 
Navigli is good area. Very nice ristorantes and happy hour places to try. You can have daily metro tickets to come and go throughout Milano. The closest metro is 10 minutes walking. 
We stayed (me and my wife) our 2 first days in Italy at Atmos and it worth it. 
We recommend it, and will stay there again in a near future.
Victor and Gisele

Excelsior Hotel Gallia - Luxury Collection Hotel









“
Very clean hotel, professional and polite staff and very comfortable bed.. everythings works digitaly by touch features.. Amazing hotel.. must try. Also there is a car that takes you to the shopping center free of charge compliment of the hotel
”






Hotel Berna









“
My stay at Hotel Berna was excellent. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and professional. What surprised me was the front desk person that checked me in, remembered my name and called me by my name every time he saw me during my 9 day stay. The breakfast have plenty to choose from and was very good. The main train station is approximately a five-minute walk from the hotel. That was very convenient when traveling to different cities within Italy from Milan.
”






The Square Milano Duomo









“
I loved everything about this hotel. It's in a perfect location to see all the sights, quite close to the Duomo. The staff gave excellent service, helping with directions and suggestions for food options. The room was very spacious which is not often found in Italy. We had free wifi and a delicious free breakfast. I would definitely recommend this this hotel.
”






Hotel Mercure Milano Centro









“
Fantastic location - 15 minutes by tram (above  ground right outside the front door of the hotel) to the Central Train Station.  There is also a Metro Stop right outside the front door!  A Fantastic Italian restaurant close by (1 block - same street), and a great Coffee Bar just outside the front door to the left.  We used the hotel twice -- once when flying to Italy from Seattle and once before our flight to Barcelona.  Very good both times.  You will like it!
