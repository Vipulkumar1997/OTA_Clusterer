Things to Do in Chester









Chester Roman Amphitheatre

Examine some of Britain’s most notable Roman ruins in the country’s largest amphitheatre. An entertainment hotspot up until 300 AD, it later fell to ruin and was built over - before archaeologists brought the excavated ruins to life in the 1950s. Plays often take place here during the summer months, so keep an eye out for some show stoppers.








Eastgate Clock

Marking the passage of time in the middle of Chester’s Tudor-bedecked old town, the Eastgate Clock adds some Victorian finery to the top of a Georgian gate – all on the site of a Roman passing point. Admire the details that include Roman numerals, frosted glass, a wrought-iron structure and dedication to Queen Victoria for her diamond jubilee.








Chester Cathedral

Towering in all its Benedictine splendour, this Saxon church is dedicated to St Werburgh and dates from the 12th century, having survived the English Reformation. Scale the panoramic bell tower, or keep your feet on the elaborately tiled floors with a guided tour through the cathedral’s naves and chapels.








Chester Racecourse

Racing at Chester's historic Roodee course dates back to the early 16th century, making it the country's oldest racecourse. It is also one of the most appealing with views of the city walls, River Dee and the Welsh Hills. At 239 yards it also provides the shortest straight in the country



Watergate Sq









Grosvenor Museum

Easy  city  to  get  around.  Plenty  of  transport  good  rail services to  other  destinations  also  a good  bus route  to  places.  Christmas  is a  fantastic  time  to  visit lots  going  on.  Best  place  to  eat  is the  playhouse.

Christmas market and decorations are not to be missed. Also a must is to visit the cathedral. Don't miss Sergio's for a meal you must book.

We love everything about the city, staying there regularly. Good bars and restaurants with plenty of historic walks/things of interest. Try Fiesta Havana, great food and atmosphere.
