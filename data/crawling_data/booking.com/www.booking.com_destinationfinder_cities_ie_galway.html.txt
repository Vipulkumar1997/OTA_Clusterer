Things to Do in Galway









Eyre Square

The flags of the fourteen Tribes of Galway fly over grassy Eyre Square. The Brownes were one such merchant family – see the original doorway of their early 17th-century mansion on the northern edge. Surrounded by pubs and cafés, the green’s a classic meeting spot. Families, friends and flocks of students gather here on sun-kissed afternoons – yes, they happen occasionally!



Eyre Square, Galway, Ireland









Lynch’s Castle

More a medieval mansion than a “castle”. This limestone building was home to the Lynches, a merchant family that gave Galway over eighty mayors. Look for the intricate, original stonework that adorns its Gothic-style façade: from decorative window frames to gargoyles and coats of arms. Now a bank, you can enter its foyer to see a well-kept, 17th-century fireplace.



Shop Street, Galway, Ireland




Open Monday–Friday 10:00–16:00









Galway Market

Galwegians cherish this weekend market. Local farmers and craftspeople have traded here for generations, selling everything from hearty Irish soda bread and homemade jams, to artisanal cheeses and handmade chocolates. Chat with cheery vendors over a tasty “Big Mick” crêpe, or browse the stalls for that one-off ceramic jug – you just know it’ll tie the kitchen together.



1-3 Church Lane, Galway, Ireland




Open Saturday 08:00–18:00, Sunday 12:00–18:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Shop Street

This cobbled street lives up to its name. Its specialist shops sell gourmet food hampers and classic tweed or woollen garments. For unique Celtic jewellery, visit Dillon’s, Ireland’s oldest jewellers and the original makers of the Claddagh ring. Then, join the pub crowds that spill outside into an impromptu street party. Lively buskers provide the soundtrack to your night.



Shop Street, Galway, Ireland









St Nicholas' Collegiate Church

Ireland’s largest medieval church dates back to 1320. It’s named after the patron saint of seafarers. Legend has it that Christopher Columbus prayed here during his voyage to the New World. Less vaunted visitors were Oliver Cromwell’s New Model Army during the Siege of Galway in 1652 – view their unwelcome handiwork in the headless and handless carved figures inside the church.



Market Street, Junction of Mainguard Street and Lombard Street, Galway, Ireland




Open Sunday–Saturday 09:00–19:00









Spanish Arch

Under the oligarchy of its merchant Tribes, Galway prospered as a result of trade with Europe. In 1584, the city walls were extended to guard against looting – this arch is all that remains of the fortifications. Today, you’ll still hear foreign accents by the banks of the Corrib. Here, English-language students, tourists and natives mingle over an ice cream on sunny days.



Quay Street, Galway, Ireland









The Salmon Weir Bridge

In 1818, this bridge was built to bring convicts from the courthouse to jail. Nowadays, crowds gather here freely to witness shoals of salmon swim and leap upstream during spawning season. Avid anglers book a precious spot of river months before they actually wade in. You don’t need a reservation to catch a romantic sunset – but bring an umbrella, just in case!



University Road, Galway, Ireland









Galway Cathedral

The Cathedral of Our Lady Assumed into Heaven and St Nicholas. The official name is a mouthful, but the interior may leave you speechless. Built in 1965, its design mixes Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque features using local limestone and Connemara marble. There’s no guided tour per se but friendly choristers sometimes show visitors around after Sunday mass.



Galway Cathedral, Galway, Ireland




Open Sunday-Saturday 09:30–18:30









Galway City Museum

This humble museum serves bite-sized chunks of local history and folklore. Spot the Galway hooker, a traditional fishing boat that hangs from the ceiling. See the gleaming silverwork of the Civic Sword and Great Mace, important city artefacts that date back over 300 years. Learn about Pádraic Ó Conaire, a giant of Irish-language literature whose tiny statue resides here.



Spanish Parade, Galway, Ireland




Open Tuesday–Saturday 10:00–17:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









The Claddagh

This area thrived as an Irish-speaking fishing village even as Galway succumbed to Norman rule in 1230. Ask a local pub owner to teach you “cúpla focal” (a few words) and make a friend for life – the area lends its name to the famous Claddagh friendship ring. Across the River Corrib, the Long Walk quay’s colourful collage of cottages makes a perfect picture postcard.



Claddagh Quay, Galway, Ireland









Latin Quarter

This charming little area is jam-packed with pubs to hop between. Start off in The Town House on Spanish Parade, then wind your way along Quay Street, finishing off with a pint in Taffes. The jaunty atmosphere and live music make this locale a perfect place to round off an evening’s pub-hopping.








Tigh Neachtain

Tigh Neachtain (pronounced ‘the Naughtons’) is a true Galway classic. With its offering of fine Guinness, live music and a whole load of ‘craic’, it’s no wonder that many make it their first stop on any pub-hopping evening. Order up a pint, sit yourself down in one of the many nooks and crannies and see where the night takes you.








The Quays

If you’re into people watching, make sure you stop off at The Quays. Located right on busy Quay Street, its outdoor seating is a window onto all manner of Galway shenanigans. Add big screens for sports games, regular live music nights and friendly staff into the bargain and you’ve got yourself a sure-fire winner.








Monroe's

Anyone in Galway in search of a true taste of Ireland needs to put Monroe’s on their itinerary. This traditional pub’s cosy, rustic vibe is boosted by the live Irish music every night of the week. On Tuesday evenings they put on Irish set-dancing nights – put your sense of rhythm to the test and join in with the locals.

Galway is a vibrant city with something for everyone. I like to stay in Salthill near to the sea front and cafes. It's a comfortable walk into town, lots to see on the way and with a great bus service back to Salthill.

Galway is a wonderful place, very friendly people, excellent variety of bars and entertainment venues. Shop Street has a great buzz at any time of day or night, the city has a warm chilled out vibe! Carlsberg don't do cities but if they did.... it would be Galway

Local Tips for Galway







Cycle the Galway Bay coastline




by Edward

Edward lived abroad for years, but the lure of proper pints and good conversation brought him home.


Despite the weather, Irish people are very outdoorsy – we love to surf, cycle, walk and climb. Get on your bike and visit the Irish-speaking villages along Galway Bay. Head west along the coast of South Connemara, and stop off for some seafood and a pint in Barna.

Accommodations nearby



Barna, Galway, Ireland








Róisín Dubh Pub




by Shane

Shane's family tree has roots in Galway. He enjoyed many a night out there in his misspent youth.


Hands down the best music venue in town. It's hosted dozens of top Irish and international acts, as well as comedians. Sunday is open-mic night, while silent discos are on Tuesdays. Thursdays pull in indie kids for the long-running alternative music night.

Open Monday–Sunday 17:00–02:00








Craft Beer by the Sea




by Nikos

Nikos loves the Emerald Isle and visited Galway during a trip to the beautiful Connemara Peninsula.


Take a trip out to laid-back Salthill for a tour of the Galway Bay Brewery. Wander among the bubbling vats of beer, then pop over to Oslo bar, the brewery's own promenade pub. Grab some lunch and a pint of "Buried At Sea", a smooth, chocolatey stout.
