Things to Do in Doha









Souq Waqif

“Which way to the camel parking?” This market stays true to its roots as a centuries-old livestock market, right down to the stables for horses and camels. If its buildings seem to exude an ersatz sheen, it’s because the alleyways and stalls have all been recently rebuilt. But the old-time spirit remains – this is the place to haggle for spices and Arabian perfumes.



Bounded by Al-Souq St & Grand Hamad St, Al Jasra, Doha




Open Saturday-Friday 10:00-12:00 and 16:00-22:00









Falcon Souq

“Quite some bird you’ve got there”. This “souq” (market) is Doha’s one-stop-shop for all your falconry needs. Hoods, perches, gloves and – of course – the mighty birds of prey themselves. Falconry is a pretty big deal in Qatar, and top-of-the-range falcons can burn a serious hole in your wallet. So keep those “riyals” handy! At Falcon Souq, bird really is the word.



Al Souq Street, Doha




Open Saturday-Thursday 09:00-13:00 and 16:00-20:00, Friday 16:00-20:00









Museum of Islamic Arts

Breath-taking from start to finish. This museum is straight out of an MC Escher painting. It’s a windowless citadel in a Rubik’s-cube twist, and inside you’ll find beauty to match the stunning exterior. Wander its four floors and marvel at the intricacy of artwork from across the Islamic world, from prodigious calligraphy to fascinating fabrics. This is unmissable.



Corniche, Doha




Open Saturday-Monday 10:30-17:30, Wednesday-Thursday 10:30-17:30, Friday 14:00-20:00









Doha Fort

In a city defined by soaring skyscrapers, a little history won’t go amiss. Doha Fort, enter stage left. This thick-walled fortress was built in 1880, when Doha was still a dusty desert village. Today, it’s a museum of Qatari and Bedouin traditions, including funky handicrafts and old-time fishing nets. Standing proud amid Souq Waqif, it offers a double-whammy of Doha history.



Near Souq waqif, Jassim bin Mohammed St, Al Bidda, Doha




Open Sunday-Monday 10:30-17:30, Wednesday 10:30-17:30, Thursday 12:00-20:00, Friday 14:00-20:00, Saturday 12:00-20:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









MIA Park

Mamma MIA! This waterside park is a welcome splash of green on Doha’s metal-and-glass canvas. A sweep of lawns curves into the sea and forms its own semi-circular bay. Across the water lies Corniche’s shimmering cluster of skyscrapers, which wobble like a mirage in the Gulf heat. Waltz down for an open-air concert, hire a kayak or even sign up to a fitness bootcamp.



Adjacent to the Museum of Islamic Arts, Corniche, Doha




Open Saturday-Friday 10:30-23:00









City Centre Shopping Mall

In Doha, bigger is definitely better. Which makes the City Centre the best shopping centre in town. This colossal cathedral of commerce has a tent-like roof that acknowledges Doha’s Bedouin roots. An overwhelming array of shops, restaurants, bowling lanes, an ice rink and a water park lies beneath these pointy canopies. The only problem is knowing where to begin!



Arabian Gulf Street, Diplomatic Area, Doha




Open Saturday-Thursday 10:00-22:00, Friday 14:00-22:00









Katara Cultural Village

Are you a vulture for culture? Sharpen your talons and wing it down to Katara. This complex is a hodgepodge of buildings that reflect Qatar’s architectural heritage. A sleek amphitheatre stands at its core. Inside, a busy programme of concerts, exhibitions and workshops sates visitors’ hunger for all things arts-related. Speaking of hunger, check out Katara’s array of eateries.



Lusail St., Doha









Landmark Shopping Centre

Roll up, roll up! Landmark’s “Circusland” children’s area makes a family outing far more than just a shopping trip. Two grinning elephants welcome nippers to a world of fun that bursts with vibrant primary colours. A carousel, soft play area and arcades keep them busy and burn off any excess energy. Meanwhile, wardrobe-fillers such as H&M; and Mango line the shopping concourse.



Al Shamal Road, Gharaffa, Doha




Open Saturday-Wednesday 09:00-22:00, Thursday 09:00-23:00, Friday 13:00-23:00









Villagio Shopping Mall

Excellently excessive. This mini-Venice in shopping centre form takes themed shopping to the next level. As you wander the mock-piazzas paved with mock-marble, you’ll pass mock-façades with light glowing behind mock-windows, with painted clouds in a mock-sky overhead. And how about a trip on a mock-gondola, on a gurgling mock-canal? You got it! All in a day’s work at Villaggio.



Al-Waab, Doha




Check website for details.









Mathaf Museum

Do you know your Wanlys from your Shawkys? Head to Mathaf to get the low-down on these contemporary artists. This modern art museum is an Aladdin’s Cave of work from across the Arabic world. It ties the threads of past and present, marrying middle-eastern traditions with edgy progressivity. Leave your prejudices at the door – this is a place to learn, think and enjoy.



Education City, Al Huqoul St, Doha




Open Tuesday-Thursday 11:00-18:00, Friday 15:00-20:00, Saturday-Sunday 11:00-18:00

Lovely modern city with lots of culture. Amazing skyline of West Bay and the beautiful Pearl area of Doha. The Aspire Mall is great and an experience is to dine in the rotating restaurant on the 48th floor of the Aspire.

A safe city but not pretty much to see. Hope there will be a reliable public transport to get around more easily. Now we only could rely on taxis but the traffic jam could be terrible.I like the atmosphere of the souq waqif especially at nite.

Doha is a good transit point for a day.  Nice enough in places but not really a lot to do.  Food can be difficult until you have your bearings.  Absolutely no tourist informau

Popular Neighborhoods in Doha












Corniche


29 properties

“Oh, I do like to be beside the seaside”. The Corniche is a horseshoe-shaped bay that overlooks the Persian Gulf. The Museum of Islamic Art juts into the bay – four floors of stunning artistry, with the building to match. Grab dinner at the Orient Pearl before an evening stroll on the promenade, where the city lights form a romantic backdrop.

Accommodations in Corniche













West Bay


29 properties

West Bay’s all about the high life – and not just because of its many skyscrapers. This is where high fliers splash their considerable “riyals”, in five-star hotels and luxury shops. Break the bank with dinner at Market Restaurant or New York Steakhouse. Cap off the day in style with a front-row seat at Katara Cultural Village’s theatres.

Accommodations in West Bay













Diplomatic Area


16 properties

“You’re spoiling us, Mr Ambassador”. Dignitaries, aristocrats and bigwigs pass through this area as embassy guests. In the streets outside, sharp-suited civil servants and bankers scurry to and fro, as they dab perspiration from their brows. Comb back your hair, straighten your tie and head to Al Shaheen Restaurant for a real taste of prestige.

Accommodations in Diplomatic Area













The Pearl


3 properties

Pearls – shiny and expensive caprices. Much like this Doha district. This artificial peninsula is made from earth from the seabed, pumped up and poured into a neat series of bays. The result is Doha’s most exclusive address, where swanky villas come with jetties for million-dollar yachts. Tap into the life of Reilly with a sushi feast at Midori.

Accommodations in The Pearl













Musherib


1 property

The real Doha. Musherib is a blue-collar district that salt-of-the-earth locals call home. Its run-down apartment blocks house a thriving local community. At any time of day you’ll see people going about their business, running errands or chatting in doorways. If you’ve had your fill of skyscrapers and mega-malls, this might be for you.

Accommodations in Musherib











Local Tips for Doha







L’Wzaar Seafood Market Restaurant




by Mouhannad

Mouhannad is passionate about cooking, travelling and trying new dishes from around the world.


Feeling like splurging on amazing seafood? Then L’Wzaar can’t be missed! You’ll get to choose your fish and also decide how you want it cooked; the Safi Saloona is highly recommended. Finish your meal with some spiced karak tea. Note: the wide variety might be a tad overwhelming at first.

Corniche




by Nadeen

Adventurous Nadeen loves to go horse riding. She also enjoys singing her heart out.


The beautiful horseshoe-shaped corniche comes to life at dusk. As the sun sets and the city begins to light up, the palm-fringed waterfront promenade becomes the perfect place for taking a romantic stroll – especially between October and April, when the weather is mild.

Corniche, Doha








Doha Dhow Cruise




by Jihan

Jihan loves to explore new cultures, visit museums and partake in various activities with her kids.


If taking a sunset cruise on the turquoise waters is on your to-do list, then don’t miss this old Bedouin tradition! Stunning views of the corniche and Arabian Gulf await aboard these traditional wooden fishing boats known as dhows. Head to Dhow Harbour to set sail.

The government-regulated Karwa taxis are metered, clean and safe; fares usually range from QAR 25–30. Alternatively, you could take the bus – just follow the signs to the Bus Pavilion. You must pay using a Karwa Smartcard 24-hour Limited/Unlimited; purchase one from the driver for QAR 10/20.

Note: travellers without a Smartcard will be charged a fee of QAR 10 per trip.
