The O2 Arena

Like an alien ship that’s plonked itself on the banks of the Thames, the striking form of the O2 is unique. A giant marquee, it’s seen Coldplay, Pink Floyd, Madonna and many others take to the stage, while the IMAX’s giant cinema screen roars over audiences. Braver visitors can don a harness and scale the dome’s heights – the views over East London are well worth the climb.

Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
