Tenerife Highlights









Garachico

Once buried under lava, this picturesque village now features natural salt-water pools, a castle, traditional buildings and tranquil squares.








Whale and dolphin spotting

The clear Atlantic waters that separate Tenerife from La Gomera are a paradise for whale-watching and dolphin-spotting.








El Teide

Enjoy the hiking, sunsets, and starlit nights in this Nature Reserve with a beautiful lunar-like landscape.








Los Gigantes

These seemingly endless cliffs lined with deserted coves provide a breathtaking backdrop for sailing and scuba diving.








Sunset from Punta de Teno lighthouse

In the northernmost part of Tenerife lies this hidden cove with its charming lighthouse. The sunsets from here are stunning.








San Cristóbal De La Laguna Old Town

Churches, convents and historic buildings fill the pedestrianised streets of this colonial town - a UNESCO World Heritage Site.








A Taste of the island in the 'Guachinche' tapas bars

Discover the local wines and traditional cuisine in the bars and cafés that populate the northern towns of the island.








Martiánez Lake

Home to 7 salt-water lakes, this perfect alternative to the beach comes complete with bars, restaurants and night-time light shows.

It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
