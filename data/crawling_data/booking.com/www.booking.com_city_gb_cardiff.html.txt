Cardiff Travel Guide










The Pride of Wales
Capital of Wales, Cardiff is a wonderfully green city steeped in national pride. At its heart is enormous Bute Park, divided by the River Taff and named after the marquis that once lived in Cardiff Castle overlooking it. In fact, this is just one of 5 castles within the surrounding area.
Over the road is Cathays Park, a beautiful square flanked by Edwardian architectural masterpieces including Cardiff City Hall and the excellent National Museum of Wales. Another must-see is St Fagan’s National History Museum, one of Britain’s top attractions.
From Victorian arcades to the fabulous St David’s Center, shopping in Cardiff is fantastic. And there’s no shortage of pubs and restaurants for a short rest or meal. Those by Cardiff Bay have particularly pleasant views.
Also by the bay are the futuristic National Assembly for Wales and the Wales Millennium Center. Another year 2,000 landmark is the Millennium Stadium, a state-of-the-art venue for international rugby and soccer matches, as well as concerts. Next door is Cardiff Arms Park, home to the city’s rugby union team, while Cardiff City FC’s new stadium is in the west.
Cardiff Airport is further west near Barry and Booking.com have an excellent range of hotels, B&Bs; and apartments both near there and in the city center.

We enjoyed walking to the bay.

We enjoyed walking to the bay.  We wanted to see the dr who experience but it closed down....so sad.  Then we walked thru the city and to the castle. It was a great time seeing the castle and nearby shops.  A great walking city.

Plenty of places to eat and drink, the restaurant called the chapel is excellent. A lot of live music in bars. Good for shopping, plenty of Xmas stalls there at the moment, Cardiff has a good atmosphere, I look forward to staying another night soon.

Brilliant shops and restaurants and it’s all closely packed together. Love the indoor shopping arcades. Friendly people everywhere you go too. I’d recommend Cafe Rouge, Zizzi and Yo Sushi as they are always consistent. I’d also recommend Welsh cakes from the Welsh cake shop in Cardiff Bay. Cardiff Castle is also a great day out once you’ve done all the shopping you want. Recommend using Google Maps to plan the quickest walking routes to and from the town centre to the Bay. It’s a 15-20 minute walk in a straight line down the main road, but an hour if you try to cut through side streets!

We went specially to see the Castle so didn't do much there otherwise. We only had an overnight and the Castle tour in Cardiff, but know there could have been a lot more to do and see. I wish I had gotten my Love spoons across the street from the Castle entrance. There were so many more choices than at the Castle gift shop.

We only stayed for one night but did venture into the city centre and went into st davids shopping precinct which is very good! Had something to eat in there at the shake shack which was nice and then a look round the shops, really impressed with Cardiff and can't wait to return to sample the night life!








Hotels That Guests Love in Cardiff





The Royal Hotel Cardiff









“
The hotel is situated right on the Main Street of Cardiff giving you great access to all the main arcades and shops , this is the second time we have stayed here and we will definitely be back. The staff always have a smile and it's a great little spot 
Many thanks to the Staff at the hotel :)
”






Future Inn Cardiff Bay









“
Large rooms. Great breakfast buffet.Comfortable beds. Close by the Red Dragon for eateries, bowling, Cinema and Casino. Restaurant in hotel along with a great range of others nearby and more within a leisurely stroll down to the Bay itself. Short walk to Cardiff Bay station or a 25min walk to Cardiff Centre. Some staff more friendly than others. Overall a great place to stay.
”






YHA Cardiff Central









“
Staff were friendly. We booked a Premium double room and were given a family room which had 2 double beds and an en suite bathroom. Both were spacious and very clean. Although maybe not the most scenic location it was great for us as we were able to leave our car at the hostel and walk to the city centre and to Cardiff Bay from the hostel.
”






Innkeeper's Lodge Cardiff









“
The hotel is situated within walking distance of Cardiff, with a pleasant walk through the park. There is a continental breakfast but you can get more and if you ate out, such as at the Castle, you can get a light meal or there is a reasonable pub menu
”






Elgano Hotel









“
The rooms were clean.  Staff was very nice.  Free wifi was strong and fast. Secure parking was a bonus.  We were near the main park and a 15 minute walk to Cardiff's main market/high street.  Breakfast at hotel was good, but service was a bit slow.  Overall a nice experience.  Would stay again.
