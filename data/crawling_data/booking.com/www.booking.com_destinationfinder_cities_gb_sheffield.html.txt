Things to Do in Sheffield









Kelham Island

What now gives this historic quarter its industrial charm, once was the molten-hot hub of the city’s prestigious steel industry. Visit the Kelham Island Museum to be transported back to the steelworks of Sheffield gone by, or head to the local brewery and surrounding pubs for a taste of a different local product – CAMRA-endorsed real ale.








Leopold Square

Hidden behind the grand frontage of the Leopold Hotel, this central plaza plays host to some of Sheffield’s best bars and restaurants. From Bamboo Door’s tiki-themed cocktails to the fiery flavour of Cubanas and the decadently floral surroundings of The Botanist, you’d be forgiven for not knowing where to begin.








Sheffield Botanical Gardens

Sheffield’s Botanical Gardens are tucked away behind the comings-and-goings of busy Ecclesall Road. A Grade II English Heritage site, the park’s historic gatehouse and charming glass pavilions are every bit as beautiful as the horticultural varieties that flourish here. See if you can find the bear pit to snap a picture with the statue prowling beneath the lawns.

Exceptional


The actual hotel car park was full and we had to use the football stadium car park and there was a match on the next day so we had to vacate early

Plenty of shops to look around. There was a football match in Sheffield so it was hard to find somewhere to eat as the fans were drinking in the pubs.

Verified reviews from real guests.

How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
