Booking.com Guest Review Guidelines

To keep the rating score and review content relevant for your upcoming trip, we archive reviews older than 24 months.

Only a customer who has booked through Booking.com and stayed at the property in question can write a review. This allows us to verify that our reviews come from real guests like you. Who better to tell others about the free breakfast, friendly staff, or their comfortable room than someone who’s stayed at the property?

We want you to share your story, with both the good and the not-so-good. All we ask is that you follow a few simple guidelines.

Reviews Vision

We believe review contributions and property responses will highlight a wide range of opinions and experiences, which is critical in helping guests make informed decisions about where to stay.

Reviews Principles

Contributions to Booking.com are a reflection of the dedication of our guests and properties, so we treat them with the utmost respect.

Whether negative or positive, we'll post every comment in full and as quickly as possible, provided the guidelines are met. We'll also provide transparency over the status of submitted content.

We'll use the same guidelines and standards for all user-generated content, and for the property responses to that content.

We'll allow the contributions to speak for themselves, and we won’t be the judge of reality. Booking.com’s role is to be a feedback distributor for both guests and properties.

Guidelines and Standards for Reviews

These guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly, without limiting expression or strong opinions. They're also applicable regardless of the comment's tone.

Contributions should be travel related.
The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don’t include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com’s services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams.

Contributions should be appropriate for a global audience.
Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, or the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted.

All content should be genuine and unique to the guest.
Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated.

Respect the privacy of others.
Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and other similar details.

The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties, and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.

The lighting in our room was appalling (one spotlight in a corner and an up-lighter a few feet from it) and the radiator did not heat up, only the thin water pipe leading into it. When we were brought 2 bedside lights it was found that the socket to one side did not work. An extension lead was very quickly found so the lighting problem was then solved. By the time we realised the radiator didn't work we were going out for the evening so did not accept the change of room offered. We had previously been offered a change of room when we complained about the lighting. Summing up, this room in its current state should not be offered to guests.
눇
The 2 members of staff we met were exceptionally efficient, helpful and pleasant. The bed was comfortable.

The room was dated and very stale smelling, a smell that lingered on my clothes long after I left the hotel.The bed was very old and worn, and uncomfortable to sleep in. The location of the hotel was very central which meant loud music till early hours.On waking up, I discovered the shower did not work and had to complain to get use another room for use of a shower, which I was grateful for but I would not recommend this hotel or use again.

On arrival in the room, we discovered several empty cider cans and someones left deodorant, went to reception with them, and not so much as an apology from the receptionist.The initial impression was good, but that went downhill the further up the floors we went.It is in desparate need of redecoration, and also double glazing, as the noise from the street kept us awake until way after midnight
눇
The room was a good size , no fancy amenities, you get what you pay for.

Normally, within Western countries, and even Eastern there is usually a King James Bible in the hotel room. My room did not contain a bible of any kind. Also, one of the plug sockets didn't work, and the phone to contact reception had a dodgy lead connecting the phone to the handset.
눇
The hotel room was clean, tidy and comfortable. I had free wifi which helped me with my work. There was also a good quality fan, which was a good bonus. The room had everything I needed for my stay. I also enjoyed the books and magazines that were provided in the room which was informative about the location I was in (Wales). I wish there was a bible in the room. I did look for one, but there was no bible. Apart from that, everything was great.

The hotel is very dated and needs to be decorated through out but I was expecting that anyway from the price and the hotel was more of a convenience of somewhere to sleep as I was in Merthyr visiting bike park Wales. There is off site parking however I was not happy leaving my car there as it was out of site but thankfully it was ok when I returned the next day - Top Tip if you are staying there on a saturday night then dont park in the multi storey as it is closed on Sundays! I had friends staying in another hotel so I left my bike with them as the storage for bikes at the hotel was an unlocked room just off reception.
눇
This hotel was cheap and served the purpose of somewhere to stay over night. The staff were all very nice and the breakfast was nice too. The location to the centre of Merthyr is very good and if like me and a lot of people you are visiting bike park wales then it is only a 5 minute drive from there

I extended my stay because I liked this hotel and Merthyr Tydfil. My room on the top floor was bright and sunny and the view very pleasant. For my extended stay they put me on the first floor in a room that was heavily over-decorated with dark red oppressive felt-like wallpaper of the type you find in an Indian restaurant; and the view had disappeared. It was depressing. Note to reviewers and review readers: one's impression of a hotel can be formed much more by the room than the whole rest of the hotel.

Parking was a walk away and with bags not easy! Plus had to put a ticket on my car at 8am each morning and then walk back to my hotel so a lay in is out of the question! The night manager was very rude! I had lights in my room and discovered approx 10pm my plug sockets didn't work. He didn't see the issue as it was night time and wanted me to come back at 8pm . I asked for a refund so I could stay in one of the other local hotels and he refused! I ended up having to change rooms. ( which he acted as if he had moved a mountain and I should be grateful) but then had the hassle of packing up my room and moving , when all I wanted was to be in bed watching tv

I didn't like the excecution of the whole old fashioned look. The room doors were worn and beat up. The whole atmosphere in the rooms was lacking. Also walking into the bathroom to see a 3 quater used toilet paper expressed a lack of hygiene. Unless you're broke avoid. Any cheap "deals" on this hotel isn't a deal.

I didn't like that there was a nightclub banging until 1am and then screaming and shouting from the people leaving the nightclub and we were on the top floor. On top of that the walls in the hotel are paper thin and you can hear people's conversations like they are in the room with you. I think this hotel is suitable for students and that's it.

I would never stay here again and would never recommend it to anyone.Missing ceiling tiles in bathrooms on both rooms, to boil kettle in family room you had to put the kettle on the floor as no plug near cupboard it was on and the other 2 plugs are above a hot water pipe so if you domanage to get the plug in the bottom of it and the cable are sitting on the pipe, H&S would not allow thisif it was checked. No hanging space at all in the family room even though it sleeps 4 people.Safe Big safe left in room so put top on it to make into a shelf, Shower in double room wall hook broken and even if you held it up no pressure to use the shower so had to sit in bath to use it, Family room no shelves in bathoom, broken lights in both rooms and family room still has the old office celiing light fittings.Very strong smell of canabis in the family room which made the 3 females ill with one of them being sick more than once.Hotel Supervisor and Hotel Manager refusing to come to the room about any of this but said went when we were havng breakfast and could not see drug issues, how they expect to see the very over powering smell of canabis is beyond me.Hotel Manager rude, not helpful and walked away from us 3 times.They refused to give us the details of the owner as we wished to complain to them bout the Manager.We ended up reporting our concerns to the local police as the hotel were not interested.

Hotel is very dated. Hasn't been updated since 70s. Beds uncomfortable. Most of the plug sockets were broken or inaccessible.  Had to boil kettle on floor, or move table. Downside of location was that it is horrifically loud all night as surrounded by pubs and nightclubs, and far too hot to sleep with window closed.

Good location for us, as seconds from Penderyn Square. professional staff, allowed early check in. Large family room with double and 2 single beds.

Room still smelt of smoke so must have been very, very heavily smoked in in the past.  Could not pinpoint where smell was coming from - wasn't carpet or curtains.Hotel is close to the busiest, loudest nightclub in Merthyr.  You can hear music up until it closes and then you can hear everyone going home.Bathroom has been refitted and was very clean but is also very dark.  Show pressure not good either.

It was old fashioned, it doesnt appear to have been decorated in many years. It is right next to local night clubs so it was noisy on Friday and Saturday evening (we were on the second floor). The noise level was not helped by the fact that the window did not close properly and was held together by a wire coat hanger! We weren't in control of the heating and it came on each morning at 6am, waking me, my partner and 2 year old by the banging - like someone was kicking the metal pipes for a good ten minutes. Not a great wake up call when you're on holiday!!!!! Also, booking.com states there are sofa beds in the suites, this is not true and we had to request a cot from reception.(This wasn't a problem with the staff but it's something to bear in mind when booking).
눇
The hotel was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The food was nice and staff were polite.

Wifi was passworded, wasn't given the code on check-in. The mattress was like sleeping on bricks, pillows weren't much better. Shower took forever to heat up. Noisy exterior that lasted till 2am; lots of random drunken shouting and arguing.

Central location, however, no onsite parking, which on the hotel's own website it states it has.

Shower temperature appeared to be affected by taps being turned on elsewhere in the building.  Lighting in our bedroom was only partially working and the landing was quite dark.
눇
Room was spacious. Staff were good.  Dealt well with a particular issue we had. Booking.Com descriptions are a little inaccurate so ref to the hotels own site for description.  No parking at the hotel but adequate council parking three minutes walk at reasonable charge - also, the time you pay for is the time you get e.g. charges apply from 08:00 to 18:00.  We paid for three hours at 16:30 and the parking slip registered us to 09:30 the next day.  £3.50 for 24 hours.  Moments walk to town and bus station and JD Weatherspoons.  Train station also close by. Edge of town shopping centre less than a mile away with KFC and McDonalds - another close to that has Subway, McDonalds (opening April 2017), Harvester, Vue etc.

1) That the hotel restaurant is closed on Sunday evenings;2) That there is no parking space and you have to pay to park in public car park across the road. The hotel should provide parking vouchers and not expect guests to pay.

Had to ring the bell in the reception 3 times on arrival as it wasn't manned.Decoration extremely outdated and the noise from the outside was horrendous.Dirt behind the bathroom door and the bottom of the shower curtain was orange. The shower was powerful,but took a while to get the temperature right as it was either too cold or too hot. Waste of money! 😣😣

The bed could certainly do with being replaced.The shower was unusable due to the water flow and the hot water was scalding.The room smelt of old cooking oil - so bad that I went out and bought air freshener. The smell was so bad it put me off having breakfast.The cups were so stained I didn't want to make a cup of tea in the room.
