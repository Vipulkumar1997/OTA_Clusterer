Visit Reykjavík: Your Travel Guide


Iceland rumbles with volcanoes and geysers. In Reykjavík, the urban and natural worlds meld together. See how Hallgrímskirkja Church rises like a wave of lava. Plunge into the geothermal waters of Nauthólsvík Beach or any city pool, and warm up faster than you can say “Eyjafjallajökull”!

Things to Do in Reykjavík









Reykjavík City Hall

The 2008-11 financial crisis cast a cloud over Iceland. Yet, “Reykvíkingar” made comic Jón Gnarr their mayor! Famous for his attention-grabbing antics, he managed to put Reykjavík City Hall on the map. Visit the grey, modernist building to view its giant 3D relief map of Iceland. Then grab a cuppa in cosy Café Öndin – it overlooks the duck-laden Lake Tjörnin.



Tjarnargata, 101 Reykjavík




Open Monday–Friday 08:00–19:00, Saturday–Sunday 12:00–18:00









Harpa Concert Hall

This sleek music hall shimmers with the seasons. Its glass façade reflects the ever-changing light of Europe’s northernmost capital. Roam inside and out for fresh perspectives on how art and nature can fuse seamlessly. Music-wise anything goes, from Bachian strings to Björk-like bleeps – Harpa’s a hub for the national orchestra and the Iceland Airwaves festival.



Austurbakki 2, 101 Reykjavík




Open Monday–Friday 09:00–18:00, Saturday–Sunday 10:00–18:00. Check website for details.









Reykjavík Old Harbour

Got your sea legs? Good, anchor’s aweigh! The Old Harbour is your gateway to the wondrous world of whales. Here, board a ship to witness a splash-fest of humpbacks and minkes in Faxaflói Bay. When you’re back ashore, warm up with a bite at Bæjarins Beztu – it’s a classic local hot dog stand. True land crabs can hang in the fishermen’s “hut cafés” that dot “Grandi” quayside.



Geirsgata, 101 Reykjavik









National Museum of Iceland

Don’t leave your plans in the lap of the gods. At this museum, chart the history of Iceland and its people: from the Irish monks that first inhabited the island to Ingólfur Arnarson, the first Norse settler. A trail of artefacts like tools, weapons and decorative drinking horns tell their tales. Then, admire the thousand-year-old bronze figure of… is it Thor or Christ?



Suðurgata 41, 101 Reykjavík




Open Monday–Sunday 10:00–17:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Hallgrímskirkja Church

This iconic church overlooks the city from Skólavörðuholtið Hill. Inspired by Svartifoss Waterfall’s basalt columns, its tower ascends like a series of slim stepping stones. Grab the lift to the top and snap pretty vistas of Reykjavík’s rainbow-coloured rooftops and Mount Esja’s snowy tip. Nippy up there? Pop into nearby Café Babalú to sip lamb soup in shabby-chic surroundings.



Skólavörðuholti, 101 Reykjavík




Open Monday–Sunday 09:00–21:00









Sólfar Monument

This stainless steel ode-to-the-sun points to a bright future. Mount Esja forms a dramatic backdrop to this monument. Translated as “Sun Voyager”, it’s sculptor Jón Árnason’s vision of a vessel that embodies man’s hopes and dreams. Pull your own “dreamboat” close for a romantic moment while the sun sets over Faxaflói Bay.



Sculpture & Shore Walk, 101 Reykjavík

Laugavegur literally means “hot springs road”. In olden times, locals used it to reach Laugardalur Valley’s washing pools. Nowadays, the street itself needs a post-weekend scrub – it’s Reykjavík’s main party strip! Start at rustic Café Rosenberg to sample luscious lobster and live folk music. Then, kick off your pub crawl with a White Russian at Lebowski Bar, dude.



Laugavegur Street, Reykjavík









The Pearl

This gem of a building glistens like a disco ball up on Öskjuhlíð Hill. “Perlan” is a glass-domed curio built atop six water tanks. Its restaurant dishes up the finest local cuisine, from Arctic char to fluffy “skyr” desserts. Circle the viewing deck around the dome and capture ice-cool city panoramas. Or, order a cocktail at the bar and let the revolving floor do the rest.



Öskjuhlíð, 105 Reykjavík




Open Monday–Sunday 10:00–21:00









Laugardalslaug Swimming Pool

Hot springs eternal here! The geothermal waters of the city’s largest swim centre revive and refresh year round. Visitors of all ages can blow off a little steam. Kids splash about in paddling pools and slink down water slides. Serious swimmers lap up and down two Olympic-sized pools (indoor and outdoor). Then there’s bubbling hot tubs that unknot even the stiffest of necks!



v/ Sundlaugarveg, 104 Reykjavík




Open Monday–Friday 06:30–22:00, Saturday–Sunday 08:00–22:00









Viðey Island

Imagine a great light beam linking the ground and sky. On Viðey, it’s easy if you try. This sparse island hosts the Imagine Peace Tower, artist Yoko Ono’s memorial to John Lennon. Witness its fifteen searchlights merge to enliven the night sky. Then, seek out sculptor Richard Serra’s “Milestones” – nine pairs of pillars that naturally frame the likes of Snæfellsjökull Volcano.



Viðey Island, Reykjavík









Golden Circle

A tour of Reykjavik’s Golden Circle is a great way to experience everything that makes Iceland unique. There’s the stunning Strokkur geyser, the Gullfoss Waterfall, and even the point where the American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet in Thingvellir National Park. A bus will take in all the sights, but why not make it a real adventure by touring the Circle by snowmobile?








Árbæjarsafn

The Árbæjarsafn open air museum was built in the 1950s to keep the traditions of an older Reykjavik alive, and as the city grew up around it so did the museum’s fascinating exhibitions and displays. Showcasing long-lost skills such as blacksmithing and hay making, this peek into the past will show you how Icelanders used to live in a truly breathtaking natural setting.








Viðey

The largest island in Kollafjörður Bay, Viðey might not be inhabited but ferries regularly drop off visitors to enjoy the beauty and wildlife of the fjords. The friendly horses living there can give you a ride if you don’t feel like walking, and the island’s many trails will lead you from stunning ancient ruins to contemporary artwork by famous artists including Yoko Ono.








Elliðavatn

Just south of Reykjavik you’ll find Elliðavatn, a lake where the Icelandic landscape rolls into the distance to reveal forests, mountains and dramatic rock formations created by ancient lava flows. Fishing is one of the most popular pursuits at Elliðavatn for locals and visitors alike, and the nearby Heiðmörk nature reserve is full of enchanting trails and woodland.








Elliðaár

Running down from the Bláfjöll mountain range, the Elliðaár river is arguably the most picturesque in Iceland. Walking along its banks you’ll discover small scenic waterfalls and an abundance of bird life. At the right time of year you can even get a chance to see salmon jumping from the water! The Elliðaárdalur valley is also home to a folk museum, a ski lift and a swimming pool – plenty for nature lovers to enjoy.








Northern Lights Viewing Cruise

Want to boost your chances of catching the Northern Lights? One way is to leave the artificial glow of the city behind you and escape to the sea. Down by the Old Harbor, you’ll find cruise companies to whisk you across Faxaflói Bay in search of that fleeting glimmer of green light. Check their websites before for updates on the weather and all aurora activity.








Blue Lagoon

Far from the big-city sparkle of Reykjavík, the night sky above the Blue Lagoon is perfect for spotting the Northern Lights. You’ll need patience and some luck, but there’s no better place to while the time away than Iceland’s most famous geothermal bath. Its rejuvenating waters and silica mud masks alone are worth making the visit.








Aurora Reykjavík Northern Lights Center

You don’t need clear skies to experience the wonder of the Northern Lights at this museum. Thanks to its HD movie theater and interactive exhibits, visitors can view amazing images while learning about the science behind this natural phenomenon. You’ll also hear the cultural history of how humans have interpreted this otherworldly apparition over time.








Northern Lights Mystery Tour

The science behind the Northern Lights may not be a mystery, but the aurora’s elusive nature makes it hard to predict. Cold weather, clear skies, and an in-the-know guide go a long way towards capturing that dance of electrons in the night sky. Hop on this bus tour to chase the ethereal wisps of light around the moon-like landscape of southwest Iceland.








Thingvellir National Park

Thingvellir National Park is a microcosm of Iceland: a rugged paradise full of nature’s quirks. As you drive through, you’ll pass volcanic crags, steaming geysers, moss-covered boulders and sputtering waterfalls. As far as road-trip terrains go, this one's definitely worth the drive. Just make sure you have your camera with you!








The Golden Circle Tour

The Golden Circle Tour is a favorite road-trip plan for those who don’t have the luxury of a whole week in Iceland. It’s just under 200 miles long, but it definitely packs in a whole lot – from Haukadalur Valley’s crazy geysers to the magnificent Kerid Crater Lake.








Haukadalur Valleys

This geothermal area is a must on any Icelandic road trip. In fact, it’s home to Geysir, the original geyser that gives its name to the rest of its kind. Even though it isn't active anymore, you'll find Strokkur right next to it, which shoots out jets of piping-hot water every ten minutes.








Gullfoss Waterfall

Gullfoss Waterfall is a picture-perfect example of the power of raw nature. It’s here that the River Hvítá turns a corner and suddenly drops into the depths of the earth in a roaring, frothy haze. There’s a path along the edge of the cliff face on the other side, so you can peer over at the cascade as it falls and crashes into the water below.

Popular Neighborhoods in Reykjavík












Reykjavík 101


208 properties

“101” is Iceland’s hippest postcode. It’s peopled by artsy, woollen-capped clans and Macbook-toting media tribes. Cruise the Skólavörðustígur–Klapparstígur–Laugavegur triangle of streets for everything from saké bars to second-hand shops. Sip a latte in retro art-café Mokka, or sink craft brews in casual Kaldi Bar. Congrats, you’re officially cool!

Accommodations in Reykjavík 101













Reykjavík East


93 properties

The city’s first suburbs slowly popped up here in the 1940s. Today, the area fizzles with life. At Reykjavík Zoo, giddy kids line up to see cute Icelandic horses and reindeers up close. In Kringlan Mall, check out trendy weather-proof threads at 66°North. Then saunter down Laugalækur Street to peruse artisan food shops like the Sausage Company.

Accommodations in Reykjavík East













Vesturbær


51 properties

Well-heeled Vesturbær is made for lazy afternoons. Once home to fishermen’s cottages, its quiet streets now house families and students. Join locals for a dip and some friendly gossip at Vesturbæjarlaug swimming pool. At Eiðsgrandi, take a seafront stroll and suck in fresh salty air. Then, sweeten things up with homemade ice cream at Valdís.

Accommodations in Vesturbær













Reykjavík South-East


8 properties

When Reykjavík rapidly grew after WWII, modern flats replaced this area’s old farm houses. Today, some buildings carry murals by Icelandic artists Erró and Sara Riel. At Árbær Museum, quaint grass-roof cottages and actors in folk dress recreate the old world. In Elliðaárdalur Park, you can pick wild berries to the sound of gushing waterfalls.

Local Tips for Reykjavík







Nauthólsvík Geothermal Beach




by Anna

Anna resides in Denmark these days. She misses Iceland’s wondrous nature and tries to visit often.


It’s never too cold to take a dip at Nauthólsvík! The beach consists of imported Moroccan sand and a man-made lagoon with an artificial hot spring. Hop in the beachfront hot tub at any time of year – it’s maintained at 38 degrees by utilising heat from nearby hot water reservoirs.

MicroBar




by Herdís

Herdís lives in Copenhagen, but Reykjavík is “home”. She loves her hometown’s kooky nightlife.


When I’m visiting the motherland, this is where I catch up with friends and family – usually during Happy Hour (17:00–19:00)! MicroBar is Reykjavík’s original microbrewery bar, opened long before it was hip to do so. The staff are really cool and always happy to share their expertise.

Grandi Quay




by Grétar

Grétar’s lived in 7 countries and 3 continents. He still thinks Reykjavík’s the hippest city around.


The Old Harbour quay known as “Grandi” is rather happenin'. Its former fishermen’s huts now house trendy cafés and artist’s studios. Coocoo’s Nest is great for a family brunch or a post-work aperitivo. Next door is Valdís ice cream parlour – believe me, it’s worth the 20-minute queue!

Mount Esja




by Hófí

Reykjavík native Hófí is proud of her city’s lively mix of culture, nightlife and nature.


You can’t miss the imposing presence of Mount Esja when you stand by the Sólfar Monument and look across Faxaflói Bay. For a closer look, hop on bus 57 from Mjódd Station to Mógilsá, and take the 90-minute hike uphill. The views of the city and surroundings are worth every bead of sweat!

Accommodations nearby



Mógilsá








Álftanes Peninsula




by Inga

Out-of-towner Inga is from Hafnarfjörður. For her, nothing says “home” a like fresh mountain breeze.


If driving south of Reykjavík, veer off to Álftanes. Its swimming centre has hot tubs, steam baths and indoor and outdoor pools – all geothermally heated, of course! Then, amble around Bessastaðir – it’s home to Iceland’s president and a great viewing point for sunsets over Reykjavík.

KRÁS Street Food Market




by Ingunn

East Icelander Ingunn took a while to warm to Reykjavík, but she can’t resist its energy and charm.


If you’re a foodie like me, head down town to KRÁS and indulge yourself with all sorts of yummy treats! Every Saturday from 13:00 until 18:00, Fógetagarðurinn Square buzzes with vibrant colours and live music, not to mention fabulous food from all corners of the world.

Dillon Whiskey Bar




by Kristín

Kristín grew up on the Westman Islands but was drawn to Reykjavík’s bright lights and rockin' music.


Moving to Reykjavík was a big adjustment for me. When I first visited this rock bar, I felt right at home – I even met my husband here! Watch local bands tear it up on stage, or chill like a VIP on the second-floor lounge – there’s over 100 whiskies to try. “Skál!”

Bríetartorg Square




by Ragnheiður

Ragnheiður knows Reykjavík like the back of her hand. Her passions include history and hot dogs!


This tiny square is dedicated to Bríet Bjarnhéðinsdóttir, an important advocate for women's liberation in Iceland. It’s very quiet, even though it’s close to Laugarvegur Street. It’s a nice spot to just sit and reflect – although come summer, some people practice their tango moves here!

Amtmannsstígur 11, 101 Reykjavík








12 Tónar Record Store




by Shane

Irishman Shane's been to Reykjavík three times. He digs its laid-back vibes and cool bars.


This is the friendliest music shop in town, with a cosy listening corner where you can grab a coffee. They’ve even got their own label: 12 Tónar has released titles by Icelandic artists Apparat Organ Quartet and Ólöf Arnalds, as well as cult U.S. retro-rockers The Brian Jonestown Massacre.

Einar Jónsson Museum




by Hallur

After a decade abroad, Hallur’s back in Reykjavík. He enjoys the arts and craft beer scenes there.


This sculpture museum explores the work of one of Iceland’s most important artists. It’s set at Einar Jónsson’s former home and studio on Skólavörðuholt. The garden is inspirational – a fantastical meeting point between the natural world and Nordic mythology.

Transportation





Reykjavík Transportation









Air – Keflavík International Airport



Keflavík International Airport is 50 km from Reykjavík. The Flybus service connects to BSÍ Bus Terminal in approx. 45 minutes, and single fares start at ISK 1950. For your return journey, a hotel pick-up option is available for ISK 2500. A taxi to or from Reykjavík city centre costs approx. ISK 12000 on weekdays and ISK 15000 or more during nights and weekends.




Keflavík International Airport
www.kefairport.is











Air - Reykjavík Airport



Reykjavík Airport is the main hub for domestic flights in Iceland. Destinations include the ruggedly beautiful Westfjords as well as the northern city of Akureyri. The airport is on the outskirts of the city centre and is easily reached via pubic bus (numbers 15 and 19) or taxi.




Reykjavík Airport
www.isavia.is











Bus



The Strætó bus network spans the city, from Seltjarnarnes and Vesturbær in the west to Grafarvogur and Mosfellsbær in the north-east. Routes operate daily, from 06:30–00:00. A single fare costs ISK 400 and is valid for one hour. One-day passes are ISK 1000 and 3-day passes cost ISK 2500. Tickets can be purchased at the main terminals: Hlemmur, Mjódd, Lækjartorg and Ártún. Alternatively, you can download the Strætó app or buy tickets at public swimming pools.




Strætó
s.is











Taxi



When the buses stop running, taxis are the best way to get home from a night of partying. Taxis are regulated in Iceland – all companies use official mileage meters and standard rates. During the busiest hours, taxis line up at designated areas marked by blue-and-white signs. At other times, you can just hail them on the street if the “Taxi” sign is lit. Alternatively, you can phone for a cab or download an app. Some companies even offer tours to sites like the Blue Lagoon.




Hreyfill-Bæjarleiðir
www.hreyfill.is











Bicycle



Cycling has become quite fashionable in Iceland. Everyone seems to have purchased a bike, and the city council has responded with improved facilities for cyclists. Dedicated paths now run across the city and beyond, and traffic lights have been adjusted with cyclists in mind. Still, Icelandic motorists are only adjusting to this new phenomenon, so it’s important to stay alert. Daily rates for bike rentals start at ISK 4200, with guided tours starting from ISK 7400.




Bike Company
bikecompany.is











Car



Iceland and Reykjavík are made for car travel. Roads are well kept and signage is clear, but like anywhere, patience is needed during rush hours. There are many parking options – the closer you park to the city centre, the more expensive it is. Car rental prices are competitive, if not cheap. Make sure you choose a car that suits your needs – if you're planning a trip to the Highlands, you’ll need a 4x4. In fact, off-roading in any other car is a criminal offence.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
