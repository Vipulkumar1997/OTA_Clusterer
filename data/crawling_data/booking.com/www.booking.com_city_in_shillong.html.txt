What Guests Said About Shillong:

Very beautiful place with cheerapunji and dawki close-by.

Very beautiful place with cheerapunji and dawki close-by. Availability of taxi is good, though you may have to haggle for trip price during holiday season. Average per-day trip cost by alto will be around 2200 & by swift dzire will be around 3000. Except for tea, everything is overpriced at local markets (at sightseeing areas) including handicrafts . Better to pack your snacks/drinks during journey & buy handicrafts at shillong police bazaar.If you are skeptical about non-veg food choices, better to stick to vegetarian food.Children would love to see the beautiful waterfalls and cloud-tipped mountains.

Beautiful hill station town with all the amenities of a city.

Beautiful hill station town with all the amenities of a city. All cuisines available in restaurants. Drives to Cherrapunji and other parts of Meghalaya are scenic. Barapani (Umiam) lake is outstanding. Traffic can be congested during school hours, so avoid those.

Nice place to visit the locations nearby, there are plenty...

Nice place to visit the locations nearby, there are plenty of places to visit (Shillong view point, Elephant falls, Air force museum, Cherrapunji). A must visit for nature lovers. Need to have plenty of time and plan in advance as the traffic is too heavy.

Shillong city is extremely congested and unplanned.

Shillong city is extremely congested and unplanned.  Only reason for travelling was to visit Cheerapunje and Living Root Bridge.  Cheerapunje too can be a disappointment if not visited in the right season.  Umiam lake beautiful, but surrounding hills unfortunately littered.

“
The location...As it is pretty central and close to police bazaar. As it's close to Lady Hydari park it was very easy to get hold of taxis...In a matter of minutes. The food is quite good...Far better than the other hotels in Shillong (we ordered vegetarian fare so I cannot comment on the non vegetarian).

TRANQUIL INN Guesthouse









“
The guest house location is really tranquil. The staff was good and so the facilities. Mostly we loved the peacefulness of the place. Located at 5 minutes distance from Golf links, this place is a serene destination for travellers who will travel to Shillong for a leisurely break.
”






The Shillong Hills Guest House









“
George and Grace coudln't have been more welcoming and helpful.  Good clean room and bathroom. Food choice was also good and tasty. Great views over Shillong as the hotel is up on the hill which meant it was also quieter than being in town. Still easy and quick to get about by auto rickshaw. We got our laundry done and sorted out various other things for our trip here.
”






Sha Ri Loum









“
1. location : very far from Police bazar, and hence it was quaint and peaceful.2. we stayed at the 'Bamboo' room, which had a bed made of bamboo 🙂. Quite literally. Nice touch.3. Good food : Dinner was great, especially the chicken curry.
