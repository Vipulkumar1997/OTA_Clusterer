Visit Leeds: Your Travel Guide


Award-winning eateries and luxury boutiques rub shoulders with grungy student bars and quirky vintage shops along the cobbled streets of Leeds. The city isn’t just about fun and games though, with the largest legal and financial sectors outside of London proving it’s more than just a pretty face.

Things to Do in Leeds









Trinity Leeds

This complex is pure entertainment from the top down. Start with a slap up meal at the rooftop terrace and spend your afternoon perusing the 120 shops, before catching a matinée at the four-screen art house cinema. When evening falls, the cool crowd go underground to explore the basement bars or get their geek on at The Alchemist, where mixers serve up cocktail concoctions with a scientific twist.



Albion Street, Leeds, Yorkshire, LS1 5AT




Open Monday–Saturday 09:00–20:00, Sunday 11:00–17:00.









Leeds Art Gallery

Household names and emerging artists alike line the walls of this gallery. First opened in 1888, the current collection is as eclectic as they come. Rembrandt prints are billed equally with graffiti pieces referencing gaming culture. The café has remained true to its Victorian roots though. With the original tiles and stately feel, it’s an ideal place to enjoy a ‘brew’ – Yorkshire slang for a good cup of tea.



The Headrow, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS1 3AA




Open Tuesday–Saturday 10:00–17:00, Sunday 12:00–16:00









Henry Moore Institute

This institute has carved out a niche in the world of sculpture. Far from sneering at those who don’t know their J. Koons from their A. Calder, their aim is to make it accessible to all. A programme of lectures, guided tours and film screenings helps budding aficionados to appreciate the intricacies of the art. Their curated collection of British sculptures is also regularly loaned out to neighbouring galleries.



Henry Moore Institute, 74 The Headrow, Leeds, LS1 3AH




Open Tuesday–Sunday 11:00–17:30









Victoria Quarter

Old world meets new in this shopping hub. The marble lined arcades are a nod to the original development in the early 1900s, while the designer togs couldn’t be more contemporary. You can spend hours playing amongst the high-end brands, exploring Louis Vuitton and Harvey Nichols or sauntering around Radley and Whistles. When you need a pick-me-up, sip espresso at the Opposite Café’s boutique coffee bar.



4 Cross Arcade, Victoria Quarter, Leeds, LS1 6AZ




Open Monday–Saturday 09:00–18:00, Sunday 11:00–17:00.









Leeds Corn Exchange

If Harvey Nichols is a little out of your price range, the Corn Exchange may be more your style. This building has a long history of trade, ever since its origins as a farmer’s market in the 1800s. Nowadays you’re more likely to find quirky clothing than ears of corn. Bonus factoid: the 75 foot domed roof wasn’t just built for show, it allowed the room to be flooded with light without discolouring the precious corn.



Leeds Corn Exchange, Call Lane, Leeds, LS1 7BR




Open Monday–Wednesday 10:00–18:00, Thursday 10:00–21:00, Friday–Saturday 10:00–18:00, Sunday 10:30–16:30









Royal Armouries Museum

Prepare to do battle! Twinned with the Tower of London, this museum houses over 5000 objects showing the advances in armoury through the ages. The collection demonstrates how hunting, tournaments and war have inspired our ancestors to come up with some extremely creative weaponry. Displays range from the regal to the obscure, with knights’ jousting attire standing alongside a full set of elephant armour.



Armouries Drive, Leeds, LS10 1LT




Open Monday–Sunday 10:00–17:00.









Thackray Medical Museum

Now one of the city’s top attractions, this grand building wasn’t always so popular. Built in the 19th century as a workhouse for the poor, it became a hospital in the early 1900s and was transformed into a museum some 70 years later. Using interactive displays, the museum highlights how scientific breakthroughs have shaped modern medicine and gives visitors a gruesome look at the life of a Victorian surgeon.



Beckett Street, Leeds, LS9 7LN




Open Monday–Sunday 10:00–17:00.









Roundhay Park

It might be quicker to tell you what Roundhay Park doesn’t offer… For those looking to work up a sweat there are tennis courts, rowing clubs and the chance to hit a wicket on the cricket field. At the park’s Tropical World, visitors can mingle with meerkats and frolic amongst the fauna, while the monthly farmer’s market is the place to try burgers prepared with prime Yorkshire Angus.



Princes Avenue, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS8 1DF




Open Monday–Sunday 10:00–18:00









Kirkstall Abbey

Founded in 1152 by Cistercian monks, Kirkstall Abbey was once a place of reflection and solitude. The monks moved on long ago, leaving a much noisier crowd in their wake. Locals and tourists have taken to picnicking amid the surrounding greenery. If you’re heading that way, make time to visit the Abbey itself to stroll through the chapel ruins and the remains of the old refectory.



Kirkstall, Leeds, LS5 3EH




Open Tuesday–Sunday 10:00–16:00.









Harewood House

Always wanted to live a life of splendour? A stroll through this 18th century country house will help you live the dream. The kid’s adventure playground might not fit in perfectly with your genteel fantasies, but a boating trip around the lake will soon have you feeling all Pride and Prejudice. Just don’t be surprised if you see a few famous faces – part of the estate is used for filming the popular British soap, Emmerdale.



Harewood, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS17 9LG




Open Monday–Sunday 10:00–17:30.









Belgrave Music Hall

This quirky venue earns its place as one of Leeds’ coolest bars. Inside the Belgrave, there’s a shabby-chic vibe. It's a versatile space where you’re just as likely to find a yoga class as a club night, or maybe even some burlesque. When you’re here, why not grab a freshly baked pizza or handmade burger as fuel for the night ahead?








North Bar

The North Bar might be tiny, but after sampling some of the 150 beers available, you won’t mind at all. This place’s casual and friendly atmosphere makes it a great first stop for the night. Intimidated by the selection behind the bar? Don’t be – the expert staff is more than happy to recommend something!








The Maven

Promising "Prohibition with a modern twist," The Maven’s expert bartenders deliver cocktail after masterful cocktail in speakeasy surroundings. Think teapots and classy-looking glasses with colorful concoctions and a botanical flourish. See if you can resist a turn on the dance floor before you head to the next bar on the list!

Your typical large city, plenty to see & do, some great places to eat & drink. Went for a gig at the first direct arena, get seated seats a far front as you can for a fantastic view.

Went for a gig at the First Direct Arena. It’s an excellent venue. Been before and love going back. Big but intimate at the same time. One of our group had a bit of a nightmare and the security staff were excellent on every level.

Transportation





Leeds Transportation









Air - Leeds Bradford International Airport



Leeds Bradford Airport is located around 10 miles from the city. The Flying Tiger bus service connects you to Leeds in about 30 minutes and costs GBP 3.60 for a single ticket. Buses run on a 24-hour timetable with services every 20 minutes. This can vary throughout the year, however, so check their website. Official airport taxis have an arrow logo, or you can pre-book a Mercedes E-Class. They leave from outside Arrivals and fares cost around GBP 22.




Leeds Bradford Airport
www.leedsbradfordairport.co.uk











Train



The train is used mainly for getting to surrounding towns and cities, rather than within the city itself. You may use it to travel to Headingly Stadium for sporting events, or to go to Carlisle, Huddersfield or York. You can buy tickets at stations such as Leeds Central, or online, where you can also consult train times. Services run 7 days a week but timings vary depending on the service and provider.




Network Rail
www.nationalrail.co.uk











Bus



Leeds CityBus runs the network within the centre of the city, linking rail and bus stations, central districts and points of interest. Buses tend to run around every 8 minutes, from around 06.30 until 19.10, with single fares costing 0.50 GBP. Other bus companies start from around 05.00 and end services at 23.00, while fares range from GBP 1.30 to GBP 2.80, depending on the route. A MetroDay ticket costs GBP 5.50 and is useful for trips of 4 stops or more.




First West
www.firstgroup.com











Car



Most of Leeds city centre is fairly walkable, so there is not much need to drive. There is also a one-way system which can be confusing for first-time visitors. Metered parking is available in some areas but it may only be available during certain times. Some areas are for residents only. Multi-storey car parks are dotted around the centre and cost around GBP 11 for 6 hours’ parking.
