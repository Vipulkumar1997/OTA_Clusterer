Things to Do in Cape Town









Company Gardens

Take the oldest cultivated pear tree in South Africa. Add rose gardens and an aviary next to it, sprinkle in some tea-rooms, an independent art cinema, museums, and an art avenue, and you’ve got Company Gardens! This expansive area evolved from humble beginnings as a vegetable garden for Dutch East India trading ships. Today, it’s a dynamic hub for all things creative.



19 Queen Victoria Street, Cape Town




Open Monday-Sunday 07:00-19:00









Greenmarket Square

Support your local artists. Greenmarket Square was a hub for apartheid protests and civil actions. Today, politics are only a memory in this traditional flea market. These stalls provide a one-stop shop for African crafts and curios, from hand-painted fabrics to beaded jewellery to glassware. On Saturday mornings, mime-artists, buskers, and jugglers vie for your attention – and your spare change.



Corner Shortmarket/Longmarket Streets and Burg Street, City Bowl, Cape Town




Open Monday-Saturday 09:00-16:00









Long Street

Long Street is the C-Town’s hippest bo-ho hangout. It’s lined with bookstores, art galleries, boutiques, craft coffee, and ethnic eateries. The slew of youth hostels brings an international presence to the street and and adds to its electric, 24-hour buzz. To imbibe with true blue locals, head to Sgt. Pepper or the Neighbourhood after working hours. This is what it’s called the party capital.



Long Street, Cape Town









Castle of Good Hope

300 years and still standing. This brick-walled fort turned museum clocks in as South Africa’s oldest building. Architected by Jan van Riebeeck and the Dutch East India Company – it’s now a museum beholden to showcase the likes, loves and trinkets of the Western folk who settled this sea-thrashed terrain. Put your eye to this keyhole and peer into the past.



Darling St and Buitenkant St, Cape Town




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30-16:00









The Victoria & Alfred Waterfront

V&A;’s the place to be. Cape Town’s working harbour transformed from up-and-coming to chic in a matter of decades. There’s a litany of activities to enjoy that begins with free live entertainment, taking in the views on the Giant Ferris wheel, fine dining and visiting the Nelson Mandela museum. The magnificent mountains as a backdrop give this area a romantic air at night.



Victoria & Alfred Waterfront, Breakwater Boulevard, Cape Town




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00-21:00









Lion's Head

Scale Lion’s Head and you’ll literally feel on top of the world. Cape Town’s dramatic peaks are part of the city’s most rocking scenery. The punishing one-hour hike to the summit rewards with astounding views, which reach out over the city and unwind across the Atlantic Ocean. The lunar light draws hikers here like moths to a flame – dress warmly and be prepared to pant!



Lion's Head, Table Mountain National Park, Cape Town




Open Monday-Sunday 07:00-19:00









Table Mountain

Cape Town sprung up in the foothills of Table Mountain. Known in local parlance as “The Mountain”, this flat-topped massif recently became one of the 7 Wonders of the World. Give in to temptation and explore its vast terrain. Marathon runners and cyclists spend days along the tangle of trails, but cables can also zip you to the top for sweeping, sweat-free views.



Table Mountain National Park, Cape Town




Open Monday-Sunday 08:00-19:00. Changes seasonally.









Camps Bay Beach

Picture a postcard-perfect beach vista. Spread out your blanket, unscrew some fine South African brew, and let the surfers dazzle you as they “hang ten”. The turquoise Atlantic packs a cold punch in this cove, which is flanked by imposing cliffs. The cosmopolitan beach vibe, white sand, suntans, sea-kissed air – it’s quite a quartet. This is just the spot you’ve dreamt about.



Victoria Road, Camps Bay, Cape Town









Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens

Get your camera ready. Nestled in the slopes of Table Mountain, you’ll be dumbfounded by the range of flowers, fields, animals, and rugged, rocky views. Brush up on your native Cape fauna, as fynbos, karoo, and proteas bloom near and far. Or channel your inner hiker and ramble up the ravine through Skeleton Gorge, a popular trail to the mountain summit. Your thighs are destined to double.



Rhodes Drive, Newlands, Cape Town, 7735, South Africa




Open Monday-Sunday 08:00-19:00









Robben Island

Apartheid lives in the country’s collective memory, and Africa’s most infamous prison is but a short boat ride from the city. This UNESCO World Heritage places a poignant spotlight onto the city’s fight for liberty. Step into cell 5, where Nelson Mandela slept and lived for eighteen years. Explore the sombre rock quarry – the ting of shovels from political prisoners working the grounds is almost palpable.



Robben Island Museum, Robben Island 7400, South Africa




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00-15:00









Shark Alley

As the name suggests, this narrow channel is one of the world’s top shark diving hotspots. A short sail out from Gansbaai, secure steel cages allow even first-timers to float just beneath the surface, face-to-face with great white sharks. Not keen on the cage? More advanced divers can rent scuba gear to spot rare sevengill cow sharks around the reef.








Gansbaai

Just a two-hour drive from Cape Town, Gansbaai has transformed from sleepy fishing village to South Africa’s shark diving capital. Its well-stocked waters are a key hunting ground for great whites, making year-round encounters possible. A host of tour companies lead boat trips to Shark Alley, where even first-time divers can get up close with the creatures from the safety of a steel cage.








Walker Bay Nature Reserve

Situated right next to the cage-diving hotspot of Gansbaai, this unspoilt stretch of coastline attracts nature lovers galore. Its lush green mountains and craggy cliffs make for spectacular hikes – perfect for winding down after a heart-pumping shark encounter. Keen to get back in the water? Kayaking tours showcase the incredible wildlife found in Walker Bay.

I love CT. Its such a vibrant city and there is so much to do here. We’ve used a local guiding company to do some walking and there are many local attractions as well. You can get wonderful and varied food with cafes and restraurants satisfying all needs. The people are so friendly and chatty.

It's a beautiful place to visit with many tourists attractions. Robben island is one of them but the level of organisation is disappointing. Just book in advance and leave a space for disappointment.

Accommodations in Camps Bay













Green Point


147 properties

Locals know Green Point as the city’s “Rainbow Capital”. Hip cafes and colourful bars line the streets, where liberal attitudes are de rigueur. Parade in and out of the funky bars, boutiques, and cafes along Somerset Road, then head to the coast to gawk at South Africa’s oldest lighthouse. Trinkets from all over Africa are yours for the taking at the Sunday flea market.

Where’d you get those muscles? Sea Point’s outdoor gym, of course! Perched on a promenade that’s prime for exercising, socialising and people-spotting, this area is wholly devoted to the body beautiful. Sea Point’s views also rival the best in the world, with the wind-whipped Atlantic on one side and handsome Lion’s Head on the other.

Accommodations in Sea Point













Gardens

This quiet, suburban district is made special by its diverse soundscape. Children play tag in De Waal Park while their parents natter, and drum circles beat a uniform rhythm that’s distinctly South African. Mums and Dads take to Mill Street’s cafes to buy posh nosh – pop into Cassis Paris to bite into the dreamiest macaroon of your life!

Accommodations in Gardens













Century City


56 properties

Welcome to “Little Europe”. Blend Tuscan palazzo’s with Amsterdam’s canals, and the result is eclectic and totally charming. Join the gaggles of bag-totting families at Canal Walk Mall, a smorgasbord of high-street retailers, art galleries, arcades, and restaurants. Or ferry you through the Main canal and circle the Intake (Bird) Island.

Accommodations in Century City













V&A; Waterfront

C-Town’s luxury zone is a beehive that keeps on buzzing. Shop in brand-name stores at the V&A; Waterfront Mall, or buy designer knick-knacks at the Watershed Markets. Don’t miss Sevruga’s mouth-wateringly-fresh sushi, or an evening of hilarity spent at Cape Town Comedy Club. For the real deal, ferry to Robben Island or see the Cape by helicopter.

Why do you recommend Cape Town for food?





Anonymous


The restaurants are so reliable and give excellent value for money.  There is such a variety of cuisine and the quality of food and service is brilliant whether it be a simple take away or a luxury seafood dinner.
My favourite special occasion restaurant is definitely Pigalle.  Wonderful lobster and seafood, excellent service, beautiful surroundings, a band and you can dance if you wish to.

Transportation





Cape Town Transportation









Air – Cape Town International Airport



A single bus transfer from the airport to the city will cost R85, while taxis cost between R300 and R400. Leaving every 20 minutes, the A01 bus stops outside the Arrivals Hall, running between 05.30 and 21.30 during the week. On weekends, it runs between 06.30 and 21.30, leaving every 30 minutes. The bus runs to the Civic Centre in the city’s Central Business District.










Taxi



Taxis vary in colour and design, and can charge either flat rates, or by the kilometre, so it’s best to agree up front what the fee may be. Rush hour in the city is generally between 06.00 and 09.00, and 16.00 and 18.00. Official cabs have a logo and it’s advisable to stick to those with company logos on them.










Bus



MyCiTi runs bus links across the city and to major landmarks, as well as the seafront. It’s generally a punctual service and you need to use your topped-up myconnect card to travel, as buses don’t accept cash. Single-trip cards cost R 35 and can be bought at kiosks and vending machines. Buses run from around 06.00 until 21.00.




MyCiTi Bus - Transport for Cape Town
www.myciti.org.za











Train



Main train stations include Adderly Street, Salt River, Wynberg and Retreat. Single fares start at R7 (1-10 km) or R7.50 (11-20 km), while weekly tickets cost R45 or R48, and it’s advisable to pay a little more and use the Metro+ carriages. Trains run from 05.00 but it’s best to avoid using them after 19.30. The Southern Line Rail Route runs from Central Station and stops at coastal towns including Muizenburg, Simonstown and Kalk Bay.




Metrorail
www.metrorail.co.za











Car



Hiring a car is a good option to consider, as public transport isn’t established in all areas and isn’t recommended for use at night. Plenty of rental agencies can be found at the airport. Parking is hard to find in the city centre, apart from at shopping malls. When parking on the street, you pay a warden for meter parking but remember to get a receipt as proof of payment - and to lock the car. Driving is on the left-hand side in South Africa.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
