"The staff couldn't do enough for us. They were lovely and kind. The room itself was spotless and had everything we needed plus a few extras that made our trip easier like an extra usb lead for our phones. The breakfast was lovely, freshly cooked. Once again the staff and breakfast couldn't do enough for us. I would recommend this hotel to anyone."
