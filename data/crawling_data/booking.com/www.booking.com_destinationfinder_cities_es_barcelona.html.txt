Things to Do in Barcelona









Passeig de Gracia

Whoever said that money can’t buy happiness didn’t know where to shop. The strip between Gràcia to Plaça Catalunya is a shopper’s paradise. The avenue is also home to some of the city’s most stunning architecture. Casa Batlló and its iconic snakeskin roof have a visceral quality that's typical of Gaudi. It’s also worth wandering among the modernist chimneys of La Pedrera.



Passeig de Gràcia, 08007 Barcelona




Open every day 9 am – 9 pm









Palau de la Musica Catalana

Architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner infused the Art Nouveau style into this ornate theater. Built in the early 20th century, it features playful accents reflecting the symphonies played here. The focal point is the auditorium itself, where Antoni Rigalt’s stained glass skylight hangs from the ceiling. The Palau regularly hosts concerts featuring chamber music to jazz.



Carrer Palau de la Música, 4-6, 08003 Barcelona




Open daily from 10 am – 3:30 pm, changes seasonally (later summer hours); Check website for details









Las Ramblas

The atmosphere around Las Ramblas is a never-ending carnival. Pick up some roasted nuts from a street vendor, shop at local and brand-name stores around Plaça de Catalunya, or just wander and soak up the unique Catalan flavor. If there’s an FC Barcelona victory, crowds of soccer fans celebrate around the Canaletes Fountain. Watch out, there are plenty of pickpockets.



La Rambla, 08002 Barcelona









Sagrada Familia

Don’t throw stones anywhere near the enormous stained glass windows of Sagrada Família, the church that dominates the Barcelona skyline. Gothic and Art-Nouveau influences collide in this spectacular monument to Christendom, with beautiful interior spaces. Still actively under construction, its completion is expected by 2030 when Gaudi’s grand design will be realized.



Carrer de Mallorca, 401, 08013 Barcelona




Open 9 am to 6 pm (October to March), 9 am to 8 pm (April to September)









Barceloneta Beach

While the rest of Europe is starting to shiver, you’ll be sunbathing well into November. Laid back and friendly, spend a lazy day sipping cocktails at the beachfront bars, or just go soak up the sun. The seafood restaurants along the pier feature outdoor dining with a gentle sea breeze. Leave your inhibitions at home – there's also a nudist section of the beach.



Passeig Marítim Barceloneta, 08003 Barcelona









Magic Fountain of Montjuïc

This is one fountain that you don't need to throw pennies into. Join the masses every 15 minutes after dark to watch water shoot upwards to the sound of contemporary pop, the Lord of the Rings theme, or "Barcelona" from the 1992 Olympics. The color, light and sound spectacle is so dramatic that you almost expect fireworks and fanfare to erupt from the fountain.



Pl. Carles Buïgas, 1, 08038 Barcelona









Joan Miró Foundation

Joan Miró was a visionary artist ahead of his time. Take a journey into Miró’s mind with paintings, sculptures and tapestries that stand as a testament to his life’s work. Works of modern art from his contemporaries are also on display, as well as from up-and-coming artists. This magnificent space is one of the most popular museums in Barcelona, so expect lines.



Parc de Montjuïc, s/n, 08038 Barcelona




Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 am – 7 pm, Sunday 10 am – 2:30 pm, Thursdays until 9:30 pm









Park Güell

If you'd like a "dalliance" with the surreal, journey into Gaudi’s imagination at Park Güell. Starting in the Gràcia district, this 42-acre garden showcases Catalan modernism at its greatest. Fairy-tale cottages and mosaics fill the park, where you can discover glorious views of the city. Just be ready for a steep walk from the metro stations, Lesseps and Vallcarca.



Carrer d'Olot, 5, 08024 Barcelona




Open daily 8 am – 8 pm, changes seasonally (later hours in spring & summer); Check website for details









Camp Nou

Even when it’s empty, you can still sense the electric atmosphere in this iconic soccer stadium. With a capacity of 100,000, the stadium is home to Football Club Barcelona. During the soccer season, fans clog the metro stations and the city comes to a stop, so plan accordingly. For tickets, visit FCBotiga (the FC Barcelona branded stores around the city) or book online.



Carrer d'Aristides Maillol, 12, 08028 Barcelona




Open Monday to Saturday 10 am – 6:30 pm, Sunday 9:30 am – 2:30 pm, can change per event









Tibidabo

Sending your children on a rocket to the moon is not advisable, but at least they’ll be a bit closer at the theme park atop Tibidabo Mountain. Take your miniature humans on the funicular to the fairground and spend an afternoon in the clouds. Stargazers shouldn’t miss the beguiling Fabra Observatory – built in 1904, it’s one of the world’s oldest functioning observatories.



Plaça Tibidabo, 3-4, 08035 Barcelona




Check website for details.









Sitges

This pretty little town is just down the coast from Barcelona. Take the 45-minute train from Passeig de Gràcia or Estació de França, which winds through the coastal cliffs and offers beautiful views onto the glistening Med. There, 17 fine-sand beaches await sun seekers. And there’s plenty to do for gourmands – from the upscale La Fragata restaurant to the “pintxos” of La Donostiarra.








Nova Icària Beach

If you’re looking to skip the crowds at Barceloneta Beach, all you have to do is go one stop further on the metro to Ciutadella-Vila Olímpica. Though it’s only a couple of minutes further, this beach gets way less visitors than its always-popular neighbor – which is a total plus if you’re looking for a little bit of peace and quiet while you lie in the sun.








Parc Güell

Parc Güell is one of Barcelona’s best-known landmarks – and with good reason. Created as a hillside wonderland by iconic architect Antoni Gaudí, it’s a unique space in the city. There are winding pathways, optical-illusion colonnades, fairy-tale cottages, and an undulating mosaic-coated bench where you capture your Barcelona panoramic picture.








Montjuïc Mountain Cable Car

Get a different view of Barcelona – this cable car runs from the city up to Montjuïc, the hill that dominates the city skyline. The trip gives you unrivaled panoramas right across the city skyline all the way up to Mount Tibidabo. There’s plenty to keep you entertained when you get to the top, from the National Art Museum of Catalonia and Montjuïc Castle, to the amazing Miró Foundation.








Tibidabo Theme Park

This theme park feels like it sits on top of the city. On Mount Tibidabo, it's filled with old-school charm. Among its attractions is a cutesy ferris wheel, and an old airplane ride that chugs around in a circle while dangling you above the city skyline. Pick up some cotton candy and prepare for some retro fun!








Water World Water Park

There's no better way to spend a scorching day than in a water park where you can cool down splash after splash. Just an hour’s drive outside Barcelona, whether you want to wallow in the Wave Pool, whizz down Rafting River, or hurtle down the chute of Kamikazes – there’s something for the whole family here.








Sagrada Familia Basilica

Think of Barcelona and you think of the Sagrada Família. Gaudí’s masterpiece has been under construction for over 130 years and won’t be completely finished until 2026. Its interior is a palatial hall of soaring columns and heavenly stained glass, with awe-inspiring views from the top of the spire making the hundreds of steps well worth it.








Montjuic

This seaside hill is Barcelona’s natural lookout spot. A cable car runs up to the castle on the top for bird’s-eye views, with the Miró Foundation, Poble Espanyol and MNAC Art Museum adding a touch of culture. At the foot of Montjuïc, water, light and music combine in the spectacular Magic Fountain show.








Casa Batlló

The jewel in Barcelona’s architectural crown, Casa Batlló is Gaudí at his finest. Even sandwiched between stunning Modernista buildings on Passeig de Gràcia’s most famous block, this fairy-tale house stands out. A camera is a must to capture its kaleidoscopic colors, dragon-scale roof and cave-like interiors, lit up by the glittering stained glass.








La Pedrera

Give us a wave! Officially called Casa Milà, La Pedrera—the Quarry—got its nickname thanks to its rippling stone facade. Gaudí's signature style can be seen in the undulating interiors and spiral staircases that coil their way up to a rooftop terrace lined with colorful chimney pots and spires.








Gothic Quarter

Colorful Gaudí buildings usually take the spotlight, but Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter proves that shadowy ambiance can be just as beautiful. Ancient alleyways lined with shops and bars lead from La Rambla towards hidden churches and secluded squares, before opening out to the Town Hall Square and Barcelona Cathedral.








Palau de la Musica

Concerts at Palau de la Música are a real treat for the eyes, not just for the ears. This hall’s intricate architecture and multicolored mosaics earned it UNESCO World Heritage status, and the enviable acoustics make it one of Barcelona’s finest music venues. Daily tours are available, but try to catch a show to take in the building’s full effect.








La Rambla Area

No trip to Barcelona would be complete without a stroll down La Rambla. Cutting through the center and down to the sea, this tree-lined avenue is bustling with shoppers, street performers and streetside cafés – perfect for people-watching. If you’re feeling a little hungry, why not grab a snack from La Boqueria Market on the way?








Mini Estadi

This 15,000-seater stadium is right across the road from FC Barcelona’s main base, Camp Nou. It fills up with loyal fans every weekend when the lower-league Barça B team takes on its soccer rivals. The Mini Estadi is also home to the FC Barcelona women’s side and the club’s main youth team, Juvenil A.








La Taverna de Barcelona

You can’t get much more central than La Taverna de Barcelona. Right on one corner of Plaça Catalunya, this cozy bar is a top spot to catch a game or two. Its ridiculous number of large screens make sure you’ll never miss a goal. Plus, the wide selection of beers, traditional tapas, and good old-fashioned bar snacks will keep you going even into extra time.








The Black Lion

A little slice of England in the heart of Barcelona, this authentic local bar attracts an international crowd. Its Les Corts location makes the Black Lion a popular pit stop for soccer fans on their way to Camp Nou Stadium, even though you might end up staying to catch the game on TV instead over a craft beer (or three)!








Park Guell

If you fancy a dance with the surreal, journey into Gaudi’s imagination at Park Güell. This sprawling 17-hectare garden showcases Catalan modernism at its finest. Fairytale cottages, mosaic dragons and intimate enclaves fill the park, which has glorious views over the city. Be ready for quite a steep walk from the nearest metro stations at Lesseps and Vallcarca.








Sagrada Família

A towering palace of twisted spires and kaleidoscopic stained glass, the Sagrada Família is a Barcelona must-see. After checking out Gaudí’s unfinished masterpiece up close, wander around the square to get some picture-perfect views from every angle. Want to explore more? It’s also an easy stroll from Passeig de Gràcia, a boulevard lined with designer shops and dreamy architectural styles.








Montjuïc

Montjuïc Hill is a natural lookout point in the heart of Barcelona. The steep climb up is more than worth it for the fresh air and stunning views of the city and sea once you get to the top. If you don’t want to walk the whole way, combine your trek with a ride on the cable car or funicular railway.








Santa Maria del Mar Church

The 14th-century Santa Maria del Mar is one of the finest examples of Catalan Gothic architecture around. The must-see highlight is actually the interior. There isn't that much iconography due to a fire in 1936, but the resulting simplicity just accents the soaring columns and beams of light that melt through the windows. Beautiful!








Palau de la Música Catalana

This unusual concert building was part of a Catalan cultural revolution. It was built in 1905 for the Orfeo Català, a choral society that was one of the leading lights of the “Renaixença” – or Renaissance. The architecture is impressive, especially the auditorium, but it really pays to see a concert and experience the building in its true context.








Hospital de la Santa Creu i de Sant Pau

Definitely not your average hospital – this impressive Modernist complex is one of Barcelona’s lesser-known architectural jewels. Even though most of its medical offices have been taken elsewhere, it still stands as a monument in its own right. It’s also just up the road from the Sagrada Família, so you can see two architectural gems one right after the other.








Casa Amatller

The camera-toting crowds might focus on Casa Batlló’s flashy curves, but architecture buffs are equally intrigued by its neighbor, Casa Amatller. The facade’s checkerboard right angles contrast perfectly with next door’s colorful nooks and crannies. Inside, there’s a pleasant harmony between traditional Catalan residential architecture and German-style elements.








Torre Agbar

This is the newest addition to Barcelona’s architectural icons. Opened in 2005, this tower—mostly made up of offices—stands proudly above the Glòries neighborhood. It’s made up of 4,400 windows and 56,619 translucent glass plates, all of which create a mosaic effect. It's maybe best appreciated at night though, when the tower's illuminated by thousands of blue and pink lights.








Mercat de Santa Caterina

Wavy roofs and technicolor palettes are synonymous with Barcelona’s architectural landscape, and this place is no different. Inside, it’s a market just like any other, with stalls selling fresh fruit, cured meat and the rest. It stands out because of its dazzling roof – a huge, undulating mosaic made up of multicolored ceramic tiles.








Poble-sec

Pretty squares and narrow streets give this central Barcelona neighborhood a small-town vibe. Day and night, Poble sec’s terraces and tapas bars fill up with both locals and visitors. Today, traditional eateries like Quimet & Quimet compete with trendy brewpubs and organic cafes, but bar-hopping down bustling Carrer Blai will never go out of style.








Gràcia Neighborhood

Once a separate town, Gràcia is fiercely proud of its independent spirit and village-like feel. Narrow streets lead into sleepy squares lined with bars and cafes that make for perfect people-watching territory. In mid-August, the annual Gràcia Festival sees the area come to life in a whirl of colorful homemade decorations and rowdy street parties.








Port Olímpic Area

Follow the sea breeze to Barcelona’s Port Olímpic. Jam-packed with restaurants, bars and clubs, this trendy harbor district is always popular. Long summer days see visitors competing for space on Vila Olímpica Beach, before dancing the night away in Opium or Shôko. In winter, the waterfront is a favorite hang-out for locals to stroll, skate, or just watch the world go by.








Picasso Museum

Picasso’s iconic paintings might grace galleries around the world, but this is where it all started. The artist spent his formative years in Barcelona, and this compact museum houses a world-class collection of his early works. As you wander the Picasso Museum’s medieval halls and stone staircases, you’ll see his shifting style unfold through line drawings, Blue Period oils, and the entire Las Meninas series.








National Art Museum of Catalonia

This museum’s comprehensive collection spans a thousand years of Catalan art. Known locally as MNAC, the National Art Museum of Catalunya brings together everything from 11th-century Romanesque murals to modernist paintings and sculptures. Even better, its elevated location on Montjuïc Hill means the views are every bit as stunning as the artwork inside.

Local Tips for Barcelona







Carretera de les Aigües




by Javi

Javi was born and raised in Barcelona and is crazy about sports, especially FC Barcelona.


Carretera de les Aigües is a flat mountain path in the Collserola Hills that spans the width of the city. It's a great place to go for a run, cycle or walk – it's a joy to exercise in the fresh mountain air, with amazing views over the city.

Carrer de Blai




by Alba

Travel-crazy Alba loves to return home to Barcelona, which always welcomes her with open arms.


I really recommend visiting Carrer de Blai for the tapas route. One of the central streets in the Poble Sec district, beer or wine plus tapas or pintxo are two euros on Thursdays. The quality far outstrips the price, which is much cheaper than the regular tourist spots!

Torre Rosa




by Noemi

Noemi is crazy about reading and jigsaw puzzles, especially of cities she has visited.


Torre Rosa is a unique bar set in an old colonial house with a peaceful terrace outside, isolated from the hustle and bustle of the city. I used to go out with my friends to places around Marina or in the Old Town, but nowadays I prefer to go to quieter places with a bit of background music where my friends and I can sit and chat.

Teatre Grec




by Virginia

French-born Virginia loves green spaces and has called Barcelona home for 25 years.

Granja Viader




by Jordi

Music and sports lover Jordi has lived most of his life in Barcelona.


Granjas are cafés that serve breakfasts and brunches. The experience of eating in one of these traditional cafes has hardly changed in 140 years. It's also special to me because the family who run it are from Cardedeu, a town where my family is originally from. I recommend the suizo (hot chocolate with cream on top).

Why do you recommend Barcelona for food?





Anonymous


Food, as with the whole of Spain, is a way of life. Whether enjoying sangria and olives outside a quiet cafe on ramble del poblenou or eating tapas at one of the many bars in La boquieria, you're pretty much surrounded by excellent fresh food. If you're a sea food lover, then you're in for a real treat. La boquieria market just off las ramblas is the place to be. You can't help but be inspired by the wonderful ingredients. You can either buy from the market and take away to cook yourself or as previously mentioned, eat from one of the many tapas bars, such as El quim or Barcentral, they're all amazing. Good food is everywhere in Barcelona. I recommend also you try Bar Mut. I could go on forever. Just go and eat!

What's the best way to make the most of Barcelona by foot?





Anonymous


The best way to explore Barcelona is to buy ticket for double-decker (bus with 2 floors). You can see them everywhere in the city. One day ticket is 27 euro, 2 days ticket 38 euro. They have 2 routs (1 route for 1 day, but if you wish and have energy, you can make 2 routs on 1 day). So, you can drop off on every stop, walk as long as you want there, and then get on the bus again. This bus goes to every attraction place in Barcelona, so by this way you can see ALL Barcelona. It is very convenient.

How can you enjoy the sights in Barcelona while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


Taking the open top bus tours is best way to see so much.  They were frequent and had running documentary to listen to. Hop on hop off stops but feel going whole way round on first bus then stay on and get off where you like. Probably 2 day pass best value as so much to see and visit
Trains efficient but miss sights from under ground and beware as had purse taken while on train from castle to Ramblas

How can you get the most authentic cultural experience in Barcelona?





Anonymous


Do eat anywhere that isn't a mom and pop shop or where tourists go. Eat fancy one day or so but visit all the little restaurants and ask them to give you some authentically Spain. Get different tapas, bocadillas, eat patatas bravas but don't order food that "your used to" otherwise why go on vacation. You will love what the Spainards eat, its healthy, portioned right and different.

Cleanest city beach ever seen, impressed with maintenance. Rare that a major metropolitan modern city has such nice beaches and a very clean sea with good underwater visibility. Yes, there are crowds, but there is mostly a respectful and peaceful atmosphere. Also a choice of beachwear, topless is optional and beaches to the north are optionally nudist.

A fantastic choice of shops to suit all ages and so reasonable.

El Prat is Barcelona’s main airport. A 7-mile train ride gets you to Passeig de Gràcia and takes approximately 26 minutes (operating from 6 am to 11:30 pm every day). Taxis take approx. 20 minutes and it’s not necessary to book in advance. Another convenient option is the Aerobus, running every 15 minutes from 5:30 am to 1 am, 7 days a week. The Aerobus stops at Carrer Sepúlveda and Plaça Catalunya.

Air – Girona



Budget airlines usually fly to Girona Airport near the Costa Brava, about 54 miles from central Barcelona. Rental cars and taxis are available. The bus to Estació del Nord takes 70 minutes – departure times depend on incoming flights, but they usually run every 3 hours. Advance bookings are not essential. If you want to catch the train, you’ll need a taxi to Riudellots station 2.5 miles away.

Metro



Barcelona's relatively modest size and reliable Metro network make it an easy place to travel around. You can buy single, monthly or ten-journey tickets for the Metro. The ten-journey option costs around EUR 10 and can be used by several people, so you don't necessarily have to buy one each. These tickets can also be used on the bus. There are plenty of well-marked stations scattered throughout the city.




TMB

Train



There are two main stations for train travel within Barcelona – Barcelona Sants (the main transportation hub) and Passeig de Gràcia (the most central). Both stations have shops and restaurants nearby and offer easy and quick connections to local trains and the metro. If you’re traveling to destinations outside of Barcelona, you’ll probably depart from Barcelona Sants; tickets can be booked online in advance or purchased from a service desk.

Taxi



Taxis are well marked and readily available throughout the city. Official taxis are black with yellow stripes. Simply go to a taxi stand or hail one from the street – taxis that are available will have a green light on top. If you have special requirements (for instance, facilities for wheelchairs, larger vehicles) it’s best to book in advance.

Car



If you rent a car at El Prat Airport, getting to the city is simple. Follow the signs to Centre Ciutat on the C-31 highway. There are very few turns involved. If you’re looking for a rental, there are plenty of options available at the airport and most international chains (Hertz, Budget, etc.) are represented. On-street parking can be difficult, but there are plenty of "Saba" brand garages around the city.




Saba

Bus



Bus travel within the city is not recommended – the metro is extremely efficient and easier to understand for non-locals. If you do need to catch a bus, bus numbers are listed on the signs and stops are clearly marked throughout the city. Unfortunately, there are no maps displayed at the bus stops, so you might need to ask a local for help. Single-journey tickets are available on board.




TMB

Bike



Barcelona’s relatively compact size and growing number of bike lanes make it a great place to explore on two wheels. There are many bike rental places in the center of town, such as Green Bikes in the Gothic Quarter and Bornbike in Born. Both of these operators offer bike tours of the city where you can take in some of the most popular sites.
