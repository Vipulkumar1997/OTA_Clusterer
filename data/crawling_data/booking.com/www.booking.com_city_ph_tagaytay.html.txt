It was not hard to travel by public transportation.

It was not hard to travel by public transportation. Some places you can just walk to because of close proximity with other good places. For a solo traveller, it's not hard to look for places to go to or where to eat because the locals are willing to give you tips.

Breathtaking view but traffic is horrendous on weekends!

Breathtaking view but traffic is horrendous on weekends! I miss the ‘old Tagaytay’ of my youth! It’s just become too commercialized & crowded! People go up for the cool weather but you’d have to go further out of the city to get away from the traffic to really relax & enjoy the clean air.

Tagaytay is our go-to place whenever you have 2 days off.

Tagaytay is our go-to place whenever you have 2 days off. Cool climate is a welcome respite from the humid weather of Manila. Once in Tagaytay, it’s a must to have some bulalo or have coffee and blueberry cheesecake at Bag of beans.

1. Yes, there will be traffic getting in and out.

1. Yes, there will be traffic getting in and out. 2. Yes, the weather is still great! 3. No, there really isn’t much to do there so hope you get a good hotel and a good place to get good food without waiting for 30mins for it to be served.

Tagaytay will always be my favorite place to find peace and...

Tagaytay will always be my favorite place to find peace and serenity and it is a couple of hours from Manila. Great restaurants, and amazing view if you choose a very good accommodation place. Crosswinds Leisure Resort so far is one of the accommodation I recommended but much better if you will just cook and have your food deliver and just stay there to relax and unwind. Cafe Voila and Bag of Beans are great choices for restaurants. Getting around is so easy especially if you have a car.

The perfect hideaway.

The perfect hideaway. We went to Ridge Park, where you can eat and stay in one of their nipa huts, with the perfect view of the Taal volcano infront of you. Going from one place to another is easy because they have jeepneys for just a minimal fare of 8 pesos. If you have kids, you can visit the Skyranch where they have rides and games and food, which the kids will truly enjoy. Their staff is also friendly.

What I liked the most about the property is the ambiance. We were so relaxed when we arrived. The unit made us feel at home away from home. I love the place and will definitely rebook when we hit the road for Tagaytay again.

Tagaytay Modern Minimalistic Condo

The place is great just in the center of every beautiful area in Tagaytay and Batangas. But most of all the staff monica and rochelle was very accomodating even in the middle of the night i really appreciated your help thanks a lot guys.
”






Cool Breeze Hotel









“
It was conveniently situated within major thoroughfares and tourist sites. There is  Ample parking space and the new building/rooms are clean. I most like the "pay at hotel" feature. Also, it is very near convenient stores and eating places as well.
