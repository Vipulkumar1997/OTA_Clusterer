Breathtaking view but traffic is horrendous on weekends! I miss the ‘old Tagaytay’ of my youth! It’s just become too commercialized & crowded! People go up for the cool weather but you’d have to go further out of the city to get away from the traffic to really relax & enjoy the clean air.

It was not hard to travel by public transportation. Some places you can just walk to because of close proximity with other good places. For a solo traveller, it's not hard to look for places to go to or where to eat because the locals are willing to give you tips.

Booking.com asked travelers...

What's the best way to get close to the volcanoes in Tagaytay?





Anonymous


Make sure you get all the costs upfront.  We had some folks take us across the lake to the vocano, and then wanted to charge us all kinds of extras, like tips for guides, drinks for guides, and then wanted to feed us and give us massages.  This trip would best be described as a nightmare.  I would say to get all details and costs in writing








Booking.com asked travelers...

Anonymous


Take a bus front of the main street (5 mins walk from the hotel) and get off at Evercrest green golf club (try google it). And then take tricycle to drop-off point and try 2 hours hike to Mt.Batulao peak. It was nice ! but bring some piece of clothes. It was so windy and since the mountain itself was sandy...

It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
