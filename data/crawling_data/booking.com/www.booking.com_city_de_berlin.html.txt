Berlin Travel Guide










A Symbol of Modern Europe
Home to the iconic Brandenburg Gate and the famous Fernsehturm at Alexanderplatz, Berlin is a renowned global city of culture, commerce and politics. Its eclectic architecture is visual and exciting proof of its fascinating history.
In "Mitte", the city’s historical center, you can find the famous Museum Island with the exquisite Pergamon Museum, as well as popular cafés, restaurants and clubs. The nearby Potsdamer Platz, once divided in two by the Berlin Wall, features great examples of ultramodern architecture and stunning night illumination.
Berlin is the best place to try the famous Currywurst or jelly doughnuts, the Pfannkuchen. Explore the city’s busy nightlife, famous festivals and parades, or simply walk through charming neighborhoods like Prenzlauer Berg. Berlin is always full of things to do and see!
Combining a vibrant culture and art scene, sites of historic interest like the Reichstag, and great shopping opportunities, the German capital truly is a symbol of a modern and unified Europe.
Traveling to the city center from Tegel International and Schönefeld Airports is a piece of cake using the S-Bahn, Berlin’s reliable public transit system. Whether you are looking for a cheap hostel, alternative apartment or a chic hotel, Booking.com has a perfect room for your trip to Berlin.

Well the weather wasn't great but late November it is...

Well the weather wasn't great but late November it is cold.  Berlin was a mixture of contrasts.  We went for the opera and the museums both ancient as found on Museum Island and WWII and Cold War related.  Obviously some of this was depressing and some uplifting.  A boat trip is a must.  Transport around the city was plentiful though underground signage a bit if a nightmare.  Taxis easy to hail and reasonably priced.  The Christmas markets were great especially the one by Alex with a big wheel.  The zoo was comprehensive for a city zoo and happy looking pandas.  Restaurants were a mixed bag but the L'Osteria not far from our hotel had the most massive pizzas ... combined with German beer we all put on pounds!

I’ve visited Berlin a few times-for work and on vacation.

I’ve visited Berlin a few times-for work and on vacation. The art scene & National museums are fantastic! The foodie scene is just so-so compared with other capital cities in Europe. Getting around on public transit is easy & a great value.

Lovely place a little overwhelming to start with but everyone seems friendly. Public transport is good makes getting around easy. Christmas markets are lovely shame we don’t have more like that in the uk, atmosphere food etc is spot on gets you in the Christmas mood.

Absolutely loved the Christmas markets and visiting other tourist attractions. Berlin Cathedral should definitely be on the to do list. I wish we had more time as there is so much to discover in this beautiful city that is steeped in so much history.

Berlin was such an easy city to walk!

Berlin was such an easy city to walk! There is so much history and culture. Wilhelmstraße was amazing to stroll along and read all of the plaques along the way giving information on various buildings.

U Bahn is close about 15 min to city center.

U Bahn is close about 15 min to city center. A beautiful city with much to do for  all ages. Near hotel is a good Italian Restaurant.  There are also Turkish, Greek, and German Restaurants within walking distance. Also many coffee shops. Also a nice department store, Karstadt, within walking distance or just one U Bahn stop away.








Hotels That Guests Love in Berlin





RIU Plaza Berlin am Kurfürstendamm









“
The hotel was situated close to shopping, some very nice restaurants and the UBahn stations. The room was extremely comfortable and quiet, except when Germany won the quarter final of EUFA.😀 The quality of the hotel and the room was what I would expect to find in a more expensive establishment, so it was definitely great value for money.
”






Hotel M68









“
The location is good. The hotel is not far from Checkpoint Charlie (~10 minutes walking), it's about 2 km from both Berlin main station and Alexanderplatz. Near the hotel (5 minutes walking) there are subway stations Mohrenstr and Stadtmitte. Also there is a bicycle sharing station (Call a bike) nearby.The hotel provides free Wi-Fi Internet access both in rooms and in the lobby.Rooms are clean, spacious (at least my room), staff is polite and friendly.
”






Berlinappart Mitte









“
The apartment was clean, very nice bathroom with good shower and good wifi. It was in a good neighborhood, close to walk and close to two different subway stops. The living area was the largest we had in Germany, with a cute seperate kitchen.
”






relexa hotel Stuttgarter Hof









“
It was my first time in Germany with my 20 year old daughter. The staff was very friendly and helped us with directions, suggestions on things to do, even let us borrow an umbrella. The breakfast was fresh and had good choices. The wait staff was very attentive.Thank you very much for a great stay!
