Booking.com Guest Review Guidelines

To keep the rating score and review content relevant for your upcoming trip, we archive reviews older than 24 months.

Only a customer who has booked through Booking.com and stayed at the property in question can write a review. This allows us to verify that our reviews come from real guests like you. Who better to tell others about the free breakfast, friendly staff, or their comfortable room than someone who’s stayed at the property?

We want you to share your story, with both the good and the not-so-good. All we ask is that you follow a few simple guidelines.

Reviews Vision

We believe review contributions and property responses will highlight a wide range of opinions and experiences, which is critical in helping guests make informed decisions about where to stay.

Reviews Principles

Contributions to Booking.com are a reflection of the dedication of our guests and properties, so we treat them with the utmost respect.

Whether negative or positive, we'll post every comment in full and as quickly as possible, provided the guidelines are met. We'll also provide transparency over the status of submitted content.

We'll use the same guidelines and standards for all user-generated content, and for the property responses to that content.

We'll allow the contributions to speak for themselves, and we won’t be the judge of reality. Booking.com’s role is to be a feedback distributor for both guests and properties.

Guidelines and Standards for Reviews

These guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly, without limiting expression or strong opinions. They're also applicable regardless of the comment's tone.

Contributions should be travel related.
The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don’t include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com’s services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams.

Contributions should be appropriate for a global audience.
Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, or the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted.

All content should be genuine and unique to the guest.
Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated.

Respect the privacy of others.
Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and other similar details.

The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties, and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.

We were told that we would have adjoining rooms on booking. We didn't, we had two rooms next to each other which means that one room was vacant as I could not leave my children in a room alone

it is a very good hotel for such a price. Personal is very welcome and ready to help. The cleans of the room 5/5 - towels were changed every day. Location is very close  - we were walking to all main sightseeings - Eiffel Tower(4 km), Montmart (3 km), Louvre (3 km), although Metro Station/ Bus stops - 5 min by walk. Highly recommend!

I didn't think that having to pay another €12 per person for breakfast was very good at all, given the very basic hotel was already in the upper price range.I would put the hotel in the category of "hostel."

There was no kettle in the room  but the staff allowed us to use a kettle and teapot from the restaurant.  It would be great if the hotel could introduce the system that many have where you only put the towels you want changing in the bath.
눇
All the staff were very helpful and  friendly and any teething troubles (e.g. wifi password and access to the safe) were dealt with promptly.  The location of the hotel is in a multicultural are of Paris which meant that there was an excellent selection of modestly priced ethnic style restaurants.

Room was small, bathroom was basic with no soap or shampoo provided despite having a hair dryer. After a few motorcycles went past I asked about a quieter room (which I had specified) but was rudely told that there was no noise outside at that moment. The street outside was fairly quiet but the area felt a bit run down.
눇
Room was recently decorated in a simple style, good bed and shower. Also air conditioner as opening windows is often a mistake if on the road.

A kettle in the room would have been good, luckily brought my own. Road side of hotel a bit noisy early morning with the window open with the bustle of daily life, motor bikes, bin lorry, chatting etc but the road otherwise not a busy street, just keep window shut if you don't want to be woken early!
눇
Friendly & helpful staff who were all fluent at English. Lift to all floors. Comfortable clean rooms, all a little worn but for the price no complaints from me. Bath and shower ensuite fridge, hair dryer & a safe all included in the room. Lovely new park nearby (Parc Martin Luther king) and a smaller but equally lovely park/square (Square des Batignolles). I would stay there again.

눉
The room looks quite old (bathroom, furniture). Very little, which is though normal for this kind of hotel in Paris. Bathroom size and style are OK, but shower is leaking, towels dryer is not working, almost no place to put your toiletries. Very noisy, you can hear every single sound from the street, I woke up every morning very early when they were taking away the garbage from the litter bins in the street. Breakfast is so-so, on Sunday at 8:30 am I could not even have a French baguette (which was normally there on other days), as they did not have it anymore.. The area is not nice, and the closest metro line (13) is just awful, especially in the rush hours. Never try to take it at 6-7 pm, too many people.
눇
Overall it is maybe not that bad in terms of value for money, as the price was quite good. Personnel was nice and helpful.

It is well served with a variety of restaurants including, Italian, Colombian & Brazilian along with traditional French cuisine, which gives the area a lively bohemian feel. It has easy access to the metro. (Brochant)

Although each room has a refrigerator, a shame that tea/coffee making facility is not the standard in France. While the hotel was furbished to a high standard, the maintenance isn't there. For example, the shower door isn't correct and other little things seem to be not well maintained which is a shame. Didn't take the breakfast as is quite expensive.
눇
The staff are very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are clean and the hotel has been renovated and furnished with style. The bed is comfortable and while the bathroom is compact, the shower is spacious.

The wifi doesn't always work. The hotel is very small and you can hardly walk through the tiny corridors when the staff is trying to clean one of the rooms. Not all of the rooms have bath tubs, we have contacted the staff earlier for extra requests but there was no response. On my arrival the staff claimed I did not ask for additional requests therefore I cannot get a room with a bath tub instead of a shower. Eventually she checked again and in fact they have received my request, and for that I eventually got a room with bath. The room is incredibly small and was not tidied thoroughly because someone's tshirt was left on the chair.

There was no remote for the television and the desk lamp was out of order. They were very kind and compassionate, made lots of promises, but never did anything. Since the TV was unplugged when I arrived, it seems that the situation was not new.

Cost-effective bad, recommend paying more and getting a little closer to the center. The desk attendant was bad, besides the mess on his desk, which causes a bad impression. Very small room for 411 euros for 4 nights.

The hotel is in a less busy area on a quiet street, with a metro station nearby. There are several restaurants cheaper than the tourist area.
