Weather was amazing (late november).

Weather was amazing (late november). There are two large malls in the city as well as a ton of supermarkets and restaurants for your every need. The transit system is super easy to use and prices quite reasonable - just don’t forget to buy a transit card because they will check for fares!Unfortunately, we went during “schoolies” week which meant that the a lot of the tourist areas were flooded with rowdy teenagers.

The best thing I can say here is that I live on the Gold Coast & choose to holiday here also.The Gold Coast has everything and now the tram makes it easy to get to the main spots without traffic worries.

Sun. Beach.

Sun. Beach. Relaxation. What else could anyone ask for?Check out the Bavarian Bier Cafe for happy hour and the Broadbeach Tavern for cheap drinks. Public transportation is frequent and will get you up and down the coast.

The Gold Coast is beautiful and has a range of options depending on what sort of holiday you want.  The food choices are amazing and I now have to eat like a model for a couple of weeks to get back to normal.

It's quite expensive here from the fuel to food etc.

It's quite expensive here from the fuel to food etc. Be prepared to spend over $200+ for popular attractions for a family of 4 with 2 teens. We cooked at the apartment most of the time to keep the cost down. The tap water doesn't leather well with the soap and taste a bit weird compare to where we come from - Victoria. So we bought bottled water. People are friendly. The drivers are slower and slow in reaction. The bus lane is on the extreme left so be careful not to accidently break the law by driving in it.  Australian Outback Spectacular was the best! Worth every penny! The Movie world was over- rated! The stunt show was boring! Not worth it. Overpriced for such a boring place. Best to eat at the Bowling club pub which offers $10 meal for lunch. Overall our trip was quite expensive and pretty ordinary.

Great location.

Great location.  Consider going to the Gold Coast before Sydney.  Great Beach’s, warmer temps, Meriton Broadbeach was a superior accommodation.  Transportation and traffic was far easier to negotiate.








Hotels That Guests Love in Gold Coast





Mantra on View Hotel









“
We love this hotel and will always stay at Mantra On View when we holiday at the Gold Coast. Love the 3 pools - The big 2 being different temperatures. Lovely spa and the huge kiddie pool. Location also fantastic. See you again soon!
”






Kirra Beach Apartments









“
This is place is just what a family needs for a fantastic holiday. Perfect location, awesome view, close to the airport. We had a fantastic time here! Kirra Beach Apartments staff were the best!
”






Mantra Towers of Chevron









“
They were amazing!! We got in to the Gold Coast at 6:30am on a red eye flight from Perth with our 18month old. They gave us early check in which saved us from a very stressful situation. Our daughter hadn't slept more than 4 hrs and was so ready for bed. We did have a issue with our first room and with just one phone call to reception we were upgraded to an awesome room. The facilities in the room were great. Hotel offers so much to do and the location was perfect for everything you could want to see in surfers. 10/10 for sure!!
”






Vibe Hotel Gold Coast









“
The location is great, central to all Surfers Paradise has to offer however, this hotel is on a lower end to what is available in this area.
”






San Mateo On Broadbeach









“
Position great, a reasonable distance to walk to both Broadbeach and Surfers Paradise. Bed  comfortable. Good views.
