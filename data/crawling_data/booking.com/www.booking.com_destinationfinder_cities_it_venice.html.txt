Things to Do in Venice









St Mark's Square

The colonnades, the bell tower, the column topped by a winged lion… it doesn’t get much more iconic than St Mark’s Square. This is the heart of Old Venice. Get there early to soak up the magic in total peace – just you and the square’s most famous residents, the pigeons. Then grab a quick macchiato from a nearby café and scale the Campanile bell tower for prime panoramas.



Piazza San Marco, 30135 Venezia









Doge’s Palace

Every doge has his day. Just ask ordinary Venetians, who were ruled by the Doges of Venice for eleven centuries. This picture-postcard palace is the fruit of Venice’s staggering wealth during the Renaissance. It’s a Venetian Gothic masterpiece stuffed with stunning stonework and handsome halls, leaving visiting dignitaries agog since the 14th century. Not to be missed.



San Marco 1, 30135 Venezia




Open Monday-Sunday 08:30-17:30. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









The Bridge of Sighs

Whoever said that Sighs doesn’t matter had clearly never been to Venice. This bridge is one of the city’s most iconic landmarks – a covered passageway wrought in gleaming Istrian limestone, hovering over the canal below. For one of Venice’s top romantic experiences, drift underneath on a gondola. Legend has it that a kiss with your beau at sunset will bring everlasting love.



San Marco 1, 30135 Venezia




Open Monday-Sunday 08:30-17:30. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









La Fenice

You’re guaranteed a gold-standard evening in this extravagant auditorium. All manner of symphonies, dance and opera take place in a space of pure, unadulterated ostentation. As the red curtains part for a matinee performance, watch the light emanating from the gilded chandeliers dims and hear the bustle as the actors taking centre stage. Let the show begin!



Campo San Fantin 1965, 30124 Venezia




Open Monday-Sunday 09:30-18:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Rialto Bridge

“Will you marry me?” This legendary bridge has seen its fair share of marriage proposals over the years. It makes sense – once the daytime crowds have dissipated, there aren’t many more romantic spots. The stone steps, slanted colonnade and central portico are dreamily lit up after dark, providing the perfect stage for hearts to flutter and soar. Love is in the air!



Rialto Bridge, 30125 Venezia









Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute

Dome sweet dome. This soaring basilica stands on Grand Canal’s banks, casting a vast, pearly-white reflection onto the water. It’s a beguiling sight that’s ignited artistic imaginations from Canaletto to Turner. The interior’s not too shabby either– the cavernous cupola brings heaven indoors, with celestial rays streaming down to cast pools of light on the lustrous mosaic floor.



Fondamenta Salute, 30123 Venezia




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00-12:00 and 15.00-17:30.









Grand Canal

Grand Canal – the clue’s in the name. This grandest of waterways is the prime place to soak up the majesty of Venice. Hop on a gondola and meander past magnificent mansions and lavish loggias that flaunt the city’s erstwhile riches. Keep your eyes peeled for the fabulous façades of Fondaco dei Turchi and Ca’ d’Oro, reflected in the ripples. The ultimate Venice experience.



Grand Canal, Venezia

Art from the heart. This museum houses the prized collection of the prolific Peggy Guggenheim, who was big on the avant-garde art scene last century. She amassed Pollocks, Picassos and much more, and it’s all on display in her own home. And what a home it is. Facing onto the Grand Canal itself, this stunning 18th-century palace’s garden is one of Venice’s loveliest.



Dorsoduro 704, 30123 Venezia




Open Monday 10:00-18.00, Wednesday-Sunday 10:00-18:00









Gallerie dell'Accademia

Venice and art. Art and Venice. It’s a match made in Elysium. This museum is home to an embarrassment of artistic riches from the top table of Venetian painters. Bellini, Titian, Tintoretto, Canaletto… It’s all here. Does the Vitruvian Man ring any bells? Da Vinci’s splayed figure of perfect proportions? Yes, that one. Also here. Now that’s some serious star quality!



Campo della Carità 1050, 30123 Venezia




Open Monday 08:15-14:00, Tuesday-Sunday 08:15-19:15









Ca' d'Oro

You little beauty! In a city known for dazzling architecture, Ca’ d’Oro is up there with the prettiest. This 15th-century palace is a Gothic gem, as stunning outside as in. Its stunning façade appears to rise out of the canal – three stacked rows of matchstick-slim columns crowned with ornate crenellations. Inside, its mosaic-tiled halls hold a number of Renaissance artworks.



Cannaregio 3932, 30121 Venezia




Open Monday 08:15-14;00, Tuesday-Sunday 08:15-19:15. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Grand Canal Views

The best way to experience Venice’s beautiful Grand Canal is from the water. Lined by hundreds of historic buildings that date as far back as the 13th century, you’ll glide along getting lost in the sights. Hop on a water taxi or take the more romantic route with a gondola for two.








Piazza San Marco

Stroll hand-in-hand around Venice’s main square. Surrounded on both sides by elaborate carvings, Romanesque columns and decorative arches, this is the perfect setting for a romantic dinner or an afternoon spent shopping in the arcade. Snap pictures in front of the basilica, or wander along the Piazzetta for views out over the lagoon.








A Gondola Ride

What could be lovelier than gliding along the historic Venetian canals in a classic wooden gondola? Your gondolier—dressed in the traditional striped shirt—will expertly guide you through the winding waterways with the sounds of a beautiful serenade. Some packages also include a cozy candlelit dinner for the ultimate romantic evening.








A Trip to the Opera

For a really unique evening out, disappear down Venice’s cobblestone alleyways in search of "Musica a Palazzo." Way smaller than the famous "La Fenice," you’ll find yourself mesmerized by an intimate opera performance. Every act takes place in a different room of this grand residence, all lit by flickering candlelight.








Volo dell’Angelo

Carnival swoops into Venice on angel wings with the traditional Volo dell’Angelo. Every year, the Flight of the Angel kicks off the city’s celebrations with a costumed beauty queen. She flies above St. Mark’s Square on a rope, showering the crowd below with confetti.








The Arsenale

Venice’s historic shipyard takes center stage during the Carnival season. The Arsenale hosts a packed program of events, from sound-and-light shows and reenactments on the water to live music and fireworks. Plus, the little ones will love the family-friendly activities at the Kids’ Carnival!








Valentine's Grand Masquerade Ball

Extravagant is the name of the game at the Valentine's Grand Masquerade Ball. Held in a private palace overlooking the Grand Canal, this eye-catching event is a Carnival highlight for many Venetians. Masked strangers mingle over a luxury candlelight dinner, before hitting the dance floor until the early hours.








La Festa Veneziana

Fantastical creatures and colorful boats filled with costumed celebrators are the essence of La Festa Veneziana. Held on the opening weekend of Carnival, this floating parade leads locals and visitors along the Grand Canal to Cannareggio, where live music and traditional Venetian food stalls welcome everyone.








The Best Masked Costume Contest

Once worn to give rowdy partygoers anonymity, masks are a crucial part of Venetian Carnival costume. The Best Masked Costume Contest selects the year’s most impressive masks from several rounds, before fierce competitors battle it out in the finale, with one crowned the ultimate winner. Held in St. Mark’s Square, it’s open to anyone who applies through the official Carnival website.








Volo dell'Aquila

The second Sunday of Carnival is focused around a costumed figure who ziplines once again from the top of the St. Mark’s bell tower. The Volo dell'Aquila (Flight of the Eagle) follows in the footsteps of the long-established Flight of the Angel. The eagle in question is a famous athlete, with gymnasts, figure skaters, and Paralympian runners all taking the leap.








Venice Free Walking Tour

A walking tour is one of the best ways to discover the secrets of Venice’s historic streets, landmarks and famous canals. And with so many free ones to pick from, there’s no need to spend your hard-earned cash. Book at any time convenient for you and get ready to be impressed by your incredibly knowledgeable guide.








Bacaro Tours

There’s no faster way to a city’s heart than through its food, and Venice is no exception. Scattered around the oldest part of town, traditional "bacaro" bars serve authentic Italian snacks washed down with local wine. The fastest way to find them is by foot – join a group tour or grab a map and create your very own Venetian bar crawl.








Rialto Area Walk

Strolling around Venice’s central Rialto neighborhood, you’ll get a real feel for city life. Grab some fresh produce from the endless fruit and fish markets, treat yourself to Giacomo Rizzo’s gondola-shaped pasta, or pick up your very own gondolier’s hat from Emilio Ceccato. You can also wander along the city’s oldest bridge, Ponte di Rialto, and find yourself surrounded by perfect examples of Venetian Gothic architecture.








Accademia Bridge

When mapping out your walking route, make sure you include a stop at Accademia Bridge for some of the best views in all of Venice. An unusual wooden structure that was originally a temporary fix, these days it’s a landmark well worth seeing. Located in the San Marco area, it’s also an easy stroll from the city’s other impressive bridges and famous sights.








Murano Island

A quick vaporetto ride whisks you from central Venice to laid-back Murano, the glass-blowing capital of the world. An archipelago of seven tiny islands connected by bridges, Murano is just a mile across and best explored on foot. Its maze of narrow streets and canals inspire dreamy wandering, with ancient churches and medieval glassworks hidden around every corner.








Dinner Cruise

Let the sights of the Floating City glide by as you take an alternative sightseeing route down the Grand Canal. Onboard a candle-lit galleon, you’ll see the sun set as you enjoy a feast fit for Venetian royalty. Depart from Piazza San Marco, one of Venice’s most iconic sights and glide past St. Mark’s Cathedral, Le Vignole Island and San Francesco Church.








The Grand Canal

Venice’s Grand Canal is a bustling avenue full of ferries and gliding gondoliers. See this boating capital in all its glory during the Regata Storica. The first weekend in September sees Venice’s main waterway host its own version of The Boat Race, with even more colorful vessels and boaters decked out in period costume.








Correr Museum

In the very center of Venice, Correr Museum beats with the heart of this city’s rich history. Walking room by room, you’ll experience Venetian life through art, with works from medieval times to the Renaissance. The huge collection of paintings, prints, coins, weapons, military regalia, and sculptures is totally worth a visit.








Palazzo Grassi

If you get a kick out of contrasts, you really can’t miss the Palazzo Grassi. A Classical Venetian building curating contemporary art exhibits, this museum smashes old and new together in a beautiful way. With past shows ranging from paintings by Sigmar Polke to Irving Penn’s fashion photography, come here with an open mind and be prepared to enjoy the venue’s surreal effect.








Accademia Art Gallery

If you’re into Renaissance art, you can’t miss a trip to the Gallerie dell’Accademia. Specializing in pre-18th century Venetian paintings, this gallery is a magical trip through five centuries’ worth of masterpieces. Spend a quiet morning here contemplating works by Titian, Bellini, Veronese, and other greats. You’ll soon find out why Tintoretto was known as "Il Furiosa!"








Doge's Palace

From regal residence to majestic museum, the 12th-century Doge’s Palace is absolutely spectacular. Its walls are adorned with showpiece paintings by the Italian masters, including Tintoretto’s jaw-dropping Paradise in the Great Council Hall. Don't forget to look up, either – it'll be hard to take your eyes off the heavenly gilded frescoes on the ceiling above.








Ca'Rezzonico Palace

Home to one of Venice’s most popular museums, this iconic waterfront palazzo contains an astonishing collection of artwork. Behind its famous white marble facade, the Ca'Rezzonico Palace's frescoed walls are the perfect backdrop for its treasure trove of 18th-century paintings, ornate antique furniture, and delicate Venetian glass.








Saint Mark's Basilica

Built to house the remains of Saint Mark, this 9th-century basilica is a Byzantine-inspired masterpiece. Five humongous domes crown its exterior, while inside, its soaring ceilings are lined with intricate mosaics and marble sculptures. San Marco’s hallowed halls are a magnet for art lovers, with treasures ranging from Crusade-era bronze horses to a spectacular jewel-encrusted gold altar screen.








Frari Basilica

The Venetian Renaissance lives on in the stunning surroundings of this 14th-century church. The Frari Basilica houses some of the city’s greatest artistic treasures, from Bellini’s Virgin and Child to Titian’s early masterpiece, The Assumption. Don’t forget to venture into the adjacent Fiorentini Chapel to find the magnificent statue of St. John the Baptist – Donatello’s only work in Venice.








House of Gold

Facing onto the Grand Canal, the House of Gold got its name from the gold paint which formerly adorned its exterior. What the Ca’ d’Oro now lacks in elegance, it makes up for in historic beauty, with a fabulous 15th-century Gothic facade and a mosaic-covered courtyard. The museum within houses a collection of Venetian and Tuscan paintings, sculpture, and ceramics.








San Marco Square

From harsh light to strangers wandering into your shot, bustling Piazza San Marco isn't always the easiest place to photograph. At sunrise, though, it’s a totally different place – basically deserted and bathed in a golden morning glow. If an early start isn’t an option, you can also try heading up the Campanile for a satisfying bird’s-eye view.








Santa Maria della Salute Basilica

The imposing Saint Mary of Health church is a dramatic focal point for any photograph. Standing proudly on the bank of the Grand Canal, you can take an awesome shot from any angle. From the canal’s edge you can get up close to explore the detail of the basilica’s baroque exterior, or head further away for some iconic skyline shots of its dome.








Rialto Market

Take a walk through history, over the world-famous Rialto Bridge through history and into this 16th-century market. Amongst You’ll find a mesh of ancient porticos, scattered stalls and specialist food shops. Market vendors offer their wares of fish, meat, vegetables and fruit from Tuesday to Sunday, all sourced from in and around Venice. Once you’ve finished browsing the delicacies on offer, hope on a ‘traghetto’ ferry along the Grand Canal.

Best time ever. Traveled in November and it was chill, 1 to 18 degrees Celsius. Everything was easy to find and most of the places we wanted to visit were at walking distance.

A city which invites adventure and instills within one an almost irresistible desire to explore and become 'lost' in its maze of Calle. Steeped in history, it's architecture has endured for centuries, virtually unchanged; it's like stepping back in time.

Popular Neighborhoods in Venice












Venice City Center


603 properties

The colour of street signs matches the city centre’s interiors – pure gold. Modern-day Medici’s live in luxury in Venice’s most elite district. Before the stream of tourists becomes a river, watch the morning sun strike St. Marco Square – it’s magnificent. Afterwards, slip into Pasticceria Tonolo for a standing espresso and Venice’s best pastries.

Accommodations in Venice City Center













Castello


525 properties

Old-school Castello is decidedly laid-back. Neighbours chatter, shirts drip-dry from washing lines strewn above alleys, and mornings start with cappuccinos and newspaper-rustle at the cafes around Giardini Pubblici (the public gardens). It’s also home to the Venetian Arsenal, shipyards that are anchored to the city’s history.

Accommodations in Castello













Cannaregio


464 properties

This one-time ghetto is a cache of offbeat treasure. Start the day with breakfast from a café in Campo di Ghetto, then get inspired at Bragorà, a funky handicrafts workshop. On sunny days, you can’t beat Al Timon, a small canalside bar with a moored-up gondola. It’s a tip-top spot to sit and tuck into spritz and “cicchetti” (snack dishes).

Accommodations in Cannaregio













San Marco


393 properties

The beating heart of Venice. From dawn till dusk, stunning San Marco buzzes with footfall and camera-shutter clicks. Start the day with fresh pastry from Pasticceria Tonolo before getting your fill of selfies at Piazza San Marco and the Bridge of Sighs. Cap it off with a cocktail at Harry’s, the legendary bar loved by Ernest Hemingway. “Salute!”

Accommodations in San Marco













Dorsoduro


211 properties

Keep it real in Dorsoduro. Away from the tourist swarms, this quiet district is home to bona-fide Venetians. Behind artistic treasure troves like Galleria dell’Accademia, you’ll find a whimsical labyrinth of picturesque squares and canals. Stroll down Zattere promenade to bask in the setting sun, then dine by candlelight at atmospheric La Bifora.

Accommodations in Dorsoduro













Santa Croce


187 properties

Far from the madding crowds, where the real Venetians live. Friends have a tête-à-tête over biscotti and cappuccino, children chatter and play, and young couples idly stride across the square hand-in-hand. The humble (yet elegant) buildings contrast with the baroque and byzantine monuments that lord above the canal at every turn.

Accommodations in Santa Croce













San Polo


185 properties

History is writ large in San Polo. Ditch the map and follow the slender alleyways like Calle dei Botteri, winding past crumbling façades and impossibly small cafés. Head to Calle del Tintoretto, where Scuola Grande di San Rocco boasts a slew of paintings from the great man himself. Sip a riverside spritz in Ancorà, before a fresh fish supper at Muro Frari.

Accommodations in San Polo













Giudecca


61 properties

Most visitors head to the Redentore Church. However, if you only go there you’d be missing half the fun. This humble, car-free district is only accessible by waterbus. It was once the city’s industrial centre, where fabrics were woven and rolled, flour ground and turned into artisanal breads and tourists came in droves; now it’s as quiet as it gets.

Accommodations in Giudecca

Booking.com asked travelers...

Why is the atmosphere in Venice something people rave about?





Anonymous


Venice has no roads, it is a huge pedestrian precinct. This means there is no traffic noise and things move at walking pace. 
Venice has no city centre, no business district, no theatre area no shopping centre. Wherever you wander you will find a restaurant, a grocery store, a cafe or a cultural attraction.
There is charm and character throughout the city. It is a place where you have to take your time over things and only fools try to rush around.
Venice is a place you can keep revisiting because even if you try to visit the same places you saw on your last trip you will end up going down a different alleyway and discovering something new. I like that you get to a corner and the sign says left to Rialto Bridge and next to it is a sign that says right to Rialto Bridge. You can't get lost in Venice, or is it that you will get lost but it really doesn't matter- you'll get there in the end.
Go visit.

What's the best way to make the most of Venice by foot?





Anonymous


Step 1: Forget map at accommodation on purpose.
Step 2: Go for a walk.
Step 3: Deliberately get lost in the tiny alleyways (you will come across choices, i.e., go left or right or keep going - just pick one) 
This is the best way to see Venice!!
You will eventually find something you recognize, and find your way back to your accommodation.
If in doubt, ask a local for help - Venetians are lovely people.

The station also has a range of cafes, fast food outlets, money exchange and ATM services.




Italo Treno
www.italotreno.it











Gondola



A trip to Venice wouldn’t be complete without a ride on a gondola! These long, narrow vessels are rowed by a standing gondolier dressed in stripes, who may sing or even give you a history of the city. Just keep in mind, gondolas are best used for a scenic cruise around the city, as opposed to an efficient mode of transport. Gondola rides last for about 30 minutes and cost EUR 80 for a day time tour for up to 6 people, and EUR 100 for tours after 19:00.










Bus



Buses are a handy way to travel to the city from the airport or nearby destinations. Buses terminate in Piazzale Roma, from here you can catch the water bus or water taxi into the heart of the city. Services run every 10-15 minutes and every 30 minutes at night. Some bus stops have automated screens and others are simple poles. You can purchase tickets from newsstands in the square or at the nearby train station, prices vary depending on your destination.




ACTV
www.actv.it











Vaporetto



The vaporetto (water bus) public transport services run along the main waterways of the city; the outer islands, Murano and Lido; and along the lagoon. Whilst the boats can be crowded, they are a cheap way to explore the city. Purchase a single fare (valid for 75 minutes) for EUR 8, or a 24-hour travel card for EUR 20; EUR 10 can be added for each additional day you require. Services run 24/7, with a night route from 00:00–05:00.

Car



There is no driving in Venice, however you can access the Piazzale Roma by car. Parking is quite expensive (up to EUR 30 per day), so it’d be smart to return your rental car upon arrival. The best way to explore Venice’s maze of canals and alleyways is by foot! Getting lost is all part of the romance – however, a map is certainly handy. You’ll want a good pair of walking shoes, and gumboots in the winter months when flooding can occur.










Taxi



Water taxis are the way to travel Venice in style, although fares can be pricey. Licensed taxis are brown wooden boats with a yellow stripe, and usually have leather interiors and open-air seating. Fares between your hotel and the airport can cost up to EUR 110, and a trip around the city can be EUR 40 –70. However, taxis can hold up to 10 people, so splitting the cost can make it cheaper! Hire a service from a water taxi station or call to pre-book.
