As lively or relaxed as you want

A firm favorite among sun-seekers, Majorca (or Mallorca) is the largest Balearic Island.

Palma, the enchanting capital, has a grand cathedral overlooking the harbor, a 14th-century castle and Arab baths, to name just a few highlights.

Nearby is Palma Nova, home to lots of Majorca hotels on the beach within easy reach of the fantastic nightlife in Magaluf.

Further along are calmer Santa Ponsa and Port d’Andratx.

In the opposite direction, S’Arenal has a fantastic, palm-lined beach and quick airport shuttle rides.

On the north side of the island, the UNESCO World Heritage-listed Serra de Tramuntana range features amazing mountain lakes.

A trip to its highest peak, Puig Major, will provide breathtaking views.

Down below is Port de Soller, a lovely town with some excellent Majorca hotels for families.

Other popular family resorts include Alcudia with its long sandy beach, and neighboring Port de Pollenca.

Ruins of the Roman town of Pollentia are nearby.

In the east, Cala Ratjada benefits from 2 beautiful coastlines, while the beaches at Cala Bona and Cala Millor certainly live up to their names – Good and Best.

Cala d’Or (Golden Cove) is another aptly named resort: its golden, sandy beach is nestled between rocks lapped by turquoise waters.

Whether you’re looking for hotels, B&Bs; or apartments in Majorca, Booking.com is sure to have something to suit.
