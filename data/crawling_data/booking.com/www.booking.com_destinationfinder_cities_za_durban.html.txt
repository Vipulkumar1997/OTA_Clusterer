Things to Do in Durban









Golden Mile

Durban’s hippest stretch of sand, Golden Mile is a hub for both shopping and sun-kissed activities. Get your bearings with a peek at Mini Town, a replica model of the city, then browse the Rivertown district for cutting-edge fashions or traditional Zulu trinkets. If you prefer to be outdoors, take a surf lesson at New Pier.








Indian Quarter

This thriving district is home to the world’s largest Indian expat population. Newer arrivals from China and Somalia have also set up shop here, so amongst numerous markets and arcades, you'll pick up nicely priced leather goods and jewellery, as well as Indian spices like cumin or saffron. If you get peckish, a curry-filled “bunny chow” bread will plug the gap.








Valley of a Thousand Hills

In this captivating valley rolling hills cascade into gorges, up to viewing points and around diminutive villages, all as far as the eye can see.  Skirt along the southern edge, on the old road between Durban and Pietermaritzburg, for some unrivalled vistas. Don your hiking boots and trek to a viewing point, or take the easier option on a steam train.








Durban Botanical Gardens

Dazzling flower fans for more than 160 years, these are Africa’s oldest botanical gardens. Amongst the ferns, palms and orchids, you’ll spot the vivid hues of hopping reed frogs and fluttering butterflies. Wander to the deck area for a panorama over the gardens.








Phezulu Safari Park

Capture the best of Africa in this beautiful blend of wildlife, landscapes and South African culture. The hills of the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands roll into the dramatic, captivating outline of the Valley of a Thousand Hills. Jump on a game drive to see crocodiles, wildebeest, zebra and giraffe in their natural habitat, or explore the villages scattered across the park.








Durban Country Club

Durban Country Club was established in 1922, It lies 1 kilometre north of Durban's golden mile beachfront and opposite the Moses Mabhida and ABSA Stadiums. The Club has two magnificent clubhouses and highly rated courses. Beachwood Golf Course was taken over by Durban Country Club in the early 1990's and improved to championship standard. Both courses are a good challenge to the discerning golfer and well worth a visit. (Dec 2011).








Kings Park Athletics Stadium

Kings Park Athletics and Soccer (Football) Stadium:it is built for the 2010 football world cup.

Exceptional


Umhlanga area was lovely nice restaurents and lovely promenade to stroll along. Close to nature reserve with beautiful walks.  Visited cheetah sanctuary and umflozi nature reserve. Also did trip to Sani Pass. People were so friendly and exceeded my expectations.

My home town. Very balanced city, morden but with truly authentic African and Asian influences. Beautiful beaches. Many shopping and eatting spots. Friendly people and welcoming accommodation available.

Although I lived in Durban for almost two decades a lot has changed and were it not for the cellphone service  we would have gotten lost in the city.  Driving was also a challenge especially in routes dominated by taxis

We weren't actually staying in Durban but La Lucia near Umhlanga Rocks which was fantastic.  Maybe the wild monkeys who visit various parts.

2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
