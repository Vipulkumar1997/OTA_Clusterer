Hyde Park

Take a turn around the primrose paths of London's largest Royal Garden. There are plenty of breathlessly romantic covered areas, rose gardens and fountains to discover over its 350 acres, not to mention the Serpentine Lake and the famous Speaker's Corner. Hyde Park is particularly fine for lazing about with a book on a humid summer’s day.

What Guests Said About Hyde Park:





Martine

Norway










Hyde park is for example great, with a lake in the middle called the Serpentine

The parks in London are great for escaping the crowds. Hyde park is for example great, with a lake in the middle called the Serpentine. There are obviousley quite a few people there, but it is not crowded. There are monuments and somethimed museums in the parks, which is great to see. A park which is not at all crowded and which is nearly like wilderness is Wimbledon Common.

“
Have stayed at this hotel before and have always found the staff polite, kind and helpful.  The rooms are of a good size and has everything I need for my stays.  The hotel has wonderful character about it (the Americans will lap it up) and is in a great location if you want to visit Hyde Park, The V&A, Natural History Museum, the Science Museum and the Royal Albert Hall.   Plus there is great shopping in nearby Knightsbridge... including Harrods!
