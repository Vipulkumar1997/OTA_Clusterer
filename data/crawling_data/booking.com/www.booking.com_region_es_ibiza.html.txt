Ibiza Highlights









Sunsets at Torre del Pirata

This free-standing medieval tower is the perfect setting to enjoy Mediterranean sunsets over the rocky outcrop of Es Vedrà Island.








Es Vedrà and Es Vedranell Islands

Es Vedrà and Es Vedranell Islands are a great spot for diving and snorkelling, with an abundance of colourful wildlife.








Atlantis

This trail winds between natural pools, impressive rock formations and by an enormous rock painting of the Hindu goddess Shiva.








Benirras Beach

Enjoy beautiful sunsets on Benirrás Beach, accompanied by the group percussion of alternative-style beach parties every Sunday during summer.








Punta Galera

This rocky promontory is made up of flat strata of stone, ideal to stretch out and take in the sun.








Beach Club Chirincana

Located near Punta Arabi's hippy market, this inviting beach bar offers live music, juggling and good vibes.








Las Dalias Hippy Market

This bustling hippy market is an explosion of colour, with clothes, jewellery and leather products all on offer.








Aquarium Cap Blanc

This unique aquarium is set in a natural cave, and during summer its terrace hosts a weekly sardine grill.








Can Marça Caves

This ancient cave, used by smugglers in the 18th Century, features impressive rock formations and 2 coastal viewing platforms.








Sant Carles Church

See groups of locals connecting with their roots by donning traditional dress and folk dancing at Sant Carles Church.








An island of surprises

Even though it's famous for fantastic clubbing, Ibiza is so much more and makes a surprisingly good family destination.

Booking.com’s range of apartments, B&Bs; and hotels in Ibiza cover all types of vacation.
The main nightlife is centered around San Antonio, where superclubs Es Paradis and Eden only kick off after midnight.

Playa d’en Bossa also has amazing clubs including Space, which attracts big-name DJs year after year.

Nearby Ibiza Town (or Eivissa) is the island’s capital, and although it has its fair share of bars and restaurants, the feel is more laid back.

The cobbled streets in its walled Old Town, overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, provide some shade from the Spanish sun.
Along the coast is Santa Eulalia del Rio, a much more exclusive resort where the marina is lined with expensive yachts.

However, the best family hotels in Ibiza are in northern resorts like Portinatx and Port de San Miguel.

Here, crystal-clear waters lap sandy beaches hidden in rocky coves.

The scenery is simply stunning and the vibe couldn’t be more different from down south.

Inland, Ibiza still retains much of its original character.

Renting a bike is a great way to explore sleepy villages like Santa Agnès and San Rafael, though be warned: some of the terrain can be tricky!.
