Booking.com Guest Review Guidelines

To keep the rating score and review content relevant for your upcoming trip, we archive reviews older than 24 months.

Only a customer who has booked through Booking.com and stayed at the property in question can write a review. This allows us to verify that our reviews come from real guests like you. Who better to tell others about the free breakfast, friendly staff, or their comfortable room than someone who’s stayed at the property?

We want you to share your story, with both the good and the not-so-good. All we ask is that you follow a few simple guidelines.

Reviews Vision

We believe review contributions and property responses will highlight a wide range of opinions and experiences, which is critical in helping guests make informed decisions about where to stay.

Reviews Principles

Contributions to Booking.com are a reflection of the dedication of our guests and properties, so we treat them with the utmost respect.

Whether negative or positive, we'll post every comment in full and as quickly as possible, provided the guidelines are met. We'll also provide transparency over the status of submitted content.

We'll use the same guidelines and standards for all user-generated content, and for the property responses to that content.

We'll allow the contributions to speak for themselves, and we won’t be the judge of reality. Booking.com’s role is to be a feedback distributor for both guests and properties.

Guidelines and Standards for Reviews

These guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly, without limiting expression or strong opinions. They're also applicable regardless of the comment's tone.

Contributions should be travel related.
The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don’t include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com’s services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams.

Contributions should be appropriate for a global audience.
Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, or the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted.

All content should be genuine and unique to the guest.
Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated.

Respect the privacy of others.
Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and other similar details.

The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties, and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.

The instructions weren't clear enough to get into the main door of complex. In fact they were incorrect but was rectified later. No hairdryer despite several requests. This is a basic requirement and each apartment should have one. For short city stays it would have been nice to have tea / coffee in the apartment even though we got everything in the supermarket across the road. In addition I also stipulated that we would need the sleeper couch and yet it wasn't made into a bed. Small touches make a big difference.

Communication before check-in was a bit strange. I'd been receiving messages in Spanish requesting my credit card details which i wasn't very comfortble providing. Eventually I got another e-mail in English that explained that I had to pay for the room and I would then get instructions on how to check-in etc. Once i did that, I got the instructions but never any confirmation that my credit card had been charged. Also although I got instructions on how to get to the building, i was not actually given the room number. Anyway, that was resolved with just a phonecall. Overall, this is a great place and i would definitely recommend it.
눇
Location was excellent, the neighborhood is very safe and full of shops, bars, restaurants etc. Also metro station is just 5 minutes away, though you can also walk to the very centre. The room was very bright, warm and comfortable.

눉
I was so suprised with how amazing both rooms were however we had someone in the apartment underneath the penthouse who came up and banged our door down 3 to 4 times screaming and threatening us in Spanish saying we were making too much noise by walking around too loudly. I would like to point out no one was walking around too loudly by any means - we were all sitting down chatting & catching up, so we decided to leave the apartment and go out which we didn't want to do. This put a dampener on the night as we felt pressured to leave by this one guest.On the last day we slept it by an hour! The cleaner rang the door bell about 10 -12 times when we were trying to get dressed and run to get the door. When we answered he barged into the apartment with toilet rolls and towels when there were girls in bed still which was very rude and unprofessional. We tried to tell them we just needed 20-30 mins to get ourselves ready and clean the room and they wouldn't leave, started cleaning the apartment and telling us to take sheets of the bed while we we still in the room.Then a lady came to the door, obviously the owner or something and demanded we gave her the key - she was extremely rude and was very impatient. I do realise they had to clean the apartment but there was no lee way even with the next check in not being until 3pm it was 12:30pm at this time.I loved the rooms and the location - but the staff we met on our last day were so so impolite and rude! We did ask for a late check out originally and they wouldn't give it to us - we would have happily paid for this!

HORRIBLE COMMUNICATION EXPERIENCE!!

눉
The communication with the hotel was horrible!! A mediocre experience that I have never encountered.First the payment was weird, you should clic a link to pay them. I have never known it so I had to call the hotel to check. The receptionist was hurried at the phone and told me to call later, etc. Bad experience.Then I had to reply to send them my ID, but they didn't say I should not reply to the email address with which they sent me mails. Actually I had to send mails to another email address that I have discovered in the end of their email with tiny mini front.I told them the communication with them was super hard and I was not satisfied, NO apologies at all. It seemed that was my fault.Anyway, AN HORRIBLE COMMUNICATION EXPERIENCE! THE WORST I HAVE HAD!!!There were NO receptionist at all!!!!!Plus, the room was not that clean, I found hair on the bed, and a glass of cigarette butt in the balcony. INCREDIBLE!
눇
The quality-price ratio is quite good.It was well located, in the center of Madrid, quite easy to get to touristic places, etc. There were supermarkets and restaurants/bars near by.

The neighbourhood is quite noisy, due to numerous bars and clubs. However, windows are soundproof, so if you don't mind to sleep with closed windows you won't have any problems.One more cleaning during our six-days stay would be nice. Some dishes were left unwashed when we arrived. Still, dishwasher is available, so it wasn't a problem.

Excellent location, in a chaming part of the city, at the walking distance to the very heart of Madrid. Very nice market in vicinity and numerous caffes and restaurants for local people, giving a visitor an oportunity to feel more of local life.

눉
We never saw a receptionist/host in the 6 days we were staying. They only left one set of keys. Only one roll of toilet paper, therefore we had to purchase a pack for our stay. We arrived very late, a welcome pack of coffee/milk would have been appreciated. No tourist information/map of local area. There was no kettle so had to use a pan to boil water.Although the sheets were clean they were very old and not very white and didn't fit the bed properly. There were no more sheets to enable us to change the bed linen. No mattress cover! Only three pillows supplied, we had to use a cushion from the sofa.No bed cover only a top sheet. We were confirmed a Deluxe Loft Apartment, which we noted had a terrace, we didn't get this.One curtain was turn and quite a few stains on the rugs and sofa.We didn't sleep for three nights Friday, Saturday and Sunday due to external noises.There is a club across the road and youngsters congrigated outside until the early hours screaming, talking and urinating against the walls!
눇
The apartment was spacious. The kitchen was mostly well equipped. It was walking distance to two metro's. Once inside the apartment it felt secure and we didn't hear other residents.

Everything was OK but it was difficult to pay for my stay in advance as the host could not process the payment from my debit card. I had to make lots of calls to booking.com who were not particularly helpful and also my bank. In the end I made a bank transfer but that took over a week to go through, meanwhile there was lots of e-mail correspondence with the hosts who did provide confirmation of the booking. Also there is a nightclub opposite which is noisy until 6am on the Friday night. This was not a problem for me but it may disturb some guests

The only issue was an air conditioning unit right by the bed that, if I am a tourist coming in for the first time and from another country I would never know what to do with it.
눇
Straight forward from the moment the property was booked.  Instructions how to do a 'solo' check-in also straight forward with no problems but also no need to deal with anyone else.  The apartment has everything you need for a short or long stay, is clean, has an excellent bed and all you need in case you want to prepare a quick breakfast.  The property is located in the emblematic barrio 'La Latina' so the minute you come out you have a large selection of coffee shops and restaurants, the choices are so many that you will never have enough time to try them all!

There was a portable air condition unit with an exhaust pipe that you yourself  have to physically let out through the window, which did not make sense, as opening the window does not keep the room cool (wasting energy) and also letting the mosquitoes in during the hot season in Madrid.There was no clothes rack for you to hang the laundry after the washing.

The communication with the property management was difficult. Receiving the codes for the apartment it took hours after the arrival. The main office and the apartment are at different locations.While the apartment is close to some attractions it is also located very close to a night club and you won't be able to sleep from the noise. There is a lot of noise as well from people going in and out the building during the night.

No air conditioning and the electric  cooling unit was ineffective for the size of the apartment. Also it did not have the usual tube at the back to  direct the hot air out of the  window, as a result it heated the room. Not much of a solution as it was 40 degrees  outside! We never got any hot water in the shower or sink. Not sure what was happening with that.

It was very scary to have your bags packed by the cleaner and to be told your booking was for 2 nights when we had clearly got evidence of a 3 night booking. Badly handled by Urban La Latina. This nearly resulted in our bags being left totally unattended outside an unmanned property. If we had bee 5 minutes later returning that afternoon we would have been stranded with no where to stay. Very unprofessional and scary!

눉
When we arrived (at 4pm) the apartment hadn't been cleaned. They did come out and clean after we called them. The apartment is above a bar which was noisy Friday, Saturday and Sunday. On the Saturday and Sunday nights we were kept awake by drunken revellers in the street outside until 4am. I can't blame the apartment owners for how other people behave, but with a nightclub across the street this is something to be aware of when thinking about booking. On the Friday before we left, an all female group arrived - they were running around the building, drunk, shouting and singing until 3am. It's all very well having a rule that you don't make noise after 11pm, but as there is no resident staff there's no way to manage that. On the Sunday we reported that the microwave wasn't working. In fairness, we did tell them that it wasn't a big deal as we didn't expect to use it, but they told us someone would come out to fix it the next day. It still wasn't working when we left. We were there with our five year old daughter, and overall, I don't think the place is at all suitable for families with children. A word on location. We didn't feel threatened or at risk at all, but the immediate area is fairly grim. There were a lot of rough sleepers in most of the public spaces near the apartment.

The house is at an apartment building  in the La Latina part of the city. There is an open bedroom with a livingroom. The kitchen has a microwave, big refregirator and enough utensils for preparation of basic food. The bathroom is clean and modern, always having hot water. The house was spacious enough for a couple. Didn't have any noise issues and the apartment is 10 minutes of pleasant walking distance from Plaza Mayor. I will not hesitate to make another reservation, if I ever decide to go back to Madrid. The check in process proceeded very smooth because of the pre-notification of the owners. I haven't seen any staff members, but always got quick answers to all of my questions through direct messaging.

The taps were loose in the bathroom which made it hard to turn on and off however not a big deal. The building really smelt like fish not sure if it was the restaurant next door but an really band smell.

The bed was really comfortable and it was a great location. The staff were really helpful as we had to move the dates originally and it was no trouble. We unfortunately couldn't stay the full 4 days as we had an emergency and had to head home after one night which was a shame but the apartment was great and everything we needed.

We stayed in the penthouse apartment which is very comfortable for a family of five persons.  The furniture and especially the beds were fine. We enjoyed the terrace and the wonderful view from there. It was nice having two bathrooms. We didn´t have any problems finding the apartment. From the airport, it is easy to go by the Metro (even though you have to change line two times). We can really recommend the apartment and we would like to be back some other time. Madrid is a great city to visit.

In the reservation, it mentioned the apartment had air conditioning. I wouldn't have booked the place without it. When we arrived, we realized the apartment doesn't have air conditioning but they have portable ones upon request. Unfortunately, they were all broken and needed to be sent back to manufacturer. I asked for a rebate to compensate, the lady said she needed to check with the Manager and she would get back to me but never did.To make matters worse, it was getting colder at night but you cannot open the windows as the noise in the street from the nearby bars is unbelievable and goes on until 7am. We didn't sleep well all nights we were there.In my view, you really get to know a business until something doesn't go as plan. Don't go there, they are not reliable and not trustworthy.

No reception/personell to welcome you on arrival. Since info.on Booking.com clearly stated that check in time was between 15.00 -17.00 to avoid extra fee, we hurried from the airport and managed to be there at 16.30.Totally unnecessary! Had to call the number provided to get any info. or try to fix minor problems like broken showerhead etc.  Only cleaning lady to talk to in person at the building when she arrives around 11.00. No huge problem for us, but might be for someone else. Very noisy and dusty renovation work on the ground floor in the neighbouring building. Should have been mentioned since it especially affected the whole ground floor of this apartment building as well! The whole resting area with chairs etc. on ground flor was closed off! We stayed on 3.floor and could live with it. Better information would have been a lot more professional.

A place to be avoided from June to September unless you are on a extreme diet and want to benefit from a long night sweating. There is no air conditioning at the apartment in a city where temperatures can raise up to 40 degrees during the summer. Only a ridiculous fan is provided (my niece can blow stronger) and if you open the balcony the situation only deteriorates as the apartment is on a noisy quarter with a well known disco only steps away. We called them to complain and ask for another fan and found out that the people who manage the apartments are based in another city, far away from Madrid. They said they were going to talk to their local representative to sort the problem out but we never heard back from them. Really disappointing stay...

The apartment was advertised as one bedroom apartment, but it was in fact a very ugly and unomfotable open plan studio. There was no privacy whatsoever, no proper dining area, no table, no proper chairs, and the curtains had stay closed all the time as otherwise there would be no privacy from outside. Further, the basic equipment, including for cleaning, was missing. When we contacted the staff they just answered in a very defensive way and refused to help us find another accommodation, so we ended up spending a week there. In addition, the noise from the street is unbearable and at night we were drunk people on the square making a lot of noise. Note we had requested a quiet apartment. For nearly 140 euro you can find plenty of better accommodation in Madrid. This place doesn't deserve to be advertised on booking.com.

Just be careful that in many spots, parking is not allowed during "festivos" (and to my surprise the Thursday before Easter is a "festivo" in spain, so I got a 90 euros fine and my car almost towed ...).Great system of password and key box to get the keys.Very modern and clean, even an oven in the kitchen!Elevator in the building.

The only downsides here are that our wifi was extremely unreliable. It didn't work the majority of our stay, but that wouldn't stop us from staying here again. Parking is a hassle but staying in Madrid that was a given. There are parking meters everywhere and parking garages that start at 25 euros, so here walking or the metro area your friends. When we come again we will definitely use a different means of transport.

Our room was perfect. Bed was a good size with a comfortable mattress. The pullout couch was a huge plus especially for the kids. We didn't use the dishwasher or washer but we appreciated having them there just in case. We would definitely stay here for an extended trip.

The Kitchen fullequiped but I missed simple things such as individuals tablecloth or a wringer. In the shower I missed some support where to put the gel and shampoo and a better system for towels.The wi fi connection doesn´t work well, very low signal that made imposible to use it.The worst in my case was that because of the bus stop that is infront, the main part of the night the noise didn,t let me sleep well, even if i am a person who has never had sleeping problems( I had to use earsplugs)

Fashion decoration and great space.  The bed is really confortable. The heating is high so even in Winter is imposible to be cold. The location is excellent, very well comunicated by the underground. It is an old renovated building full of charm with the facilities of a new one( e.g. elevator). I found very useful the code system for the front door.Hosters are very friendly and answer you any question fastly and always looking for the best solution .

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
