Bath Travel Guide










Roman Ruins and Georgian Grandeur
Wonderful, World Heritage site Bath is an impressive mix of Georgian architecture and Roman legacy. Its most famous landmark is the fantastic, natural hot spring Roman Baths. Although everything above the pillar bases is from a later period, you still get an idea of its appearance in Roman times. Sadly you can’t bathe here, but across the street the rooftop pool at Thermae Bath Spa offers views of Bath Abbey and the surrounding hills.
Check out the stained-glass windows in the abbey, England’s last remaining Gothic church. Its square houses Pump Rooms dispensing hot spring water from the Roman baths.
Just behind, the Parade Gardens by the Avon River overlook Bath Rugby Club, the multi-level Pulteney Weir and registered historic Pulteney Bridge, lined with shops. Other Bath shopping options include Southgate Shopping Centre, the bohemian Walcot Street market, and brand-name stores on Milsom and George streets.
North is The Circus, a circular square lined with Georgian townhouses, only marginally less impressive than the Royal Crescent down the road. You can now visit number 1 Royal Crescent, restored to its 18th-century glory.
Before heading to Bristol Airport from your Bath hotel, take time to try the famous Sally Lunn Bun and stop at the pleasant pubs along the Kennet and Avon Canal.

Loved the Roman Baths and the Pump Room.

Loved the Roman Baths and the Pump Room. The abbey was nice as well, specially if you catch an evensong. The town is very charming with very nice people. The Christmas market was very cute and really brought in the holiday charm. A must see when in Britain.

Great looking city, good atmosphere, lots of places to go and places to eat.Moving around in the central area is so easy, and the locals are definitely happy to help. Walk around the Bath, you will find lovely "hidden" corners all around.

Mayor’s Walking Tour - free and very informative.

Mayor’s Walking Tour - free and very informative. The Roman Baths, Bath Abbey and the architecture of Bath are amazing. Ate at the Raven - a great pub for pies and ales. Had a snack at Sally Lunn’s.








Hotels That Guests Love in Bath





Parade Park









“
Great location, comfortable and clean.  Friendly staff.  
After reading reviews I was a bit worried about the facilities, noise levels etc but apart from noise you would expect from a central city hotel I heard nothing from the club next door.  We had an en-suite, but even if we didn't the shared bathroom facilities were clean and adequate!  Comfortable bed, great size TV, tea coffee facilities and a wonderful view of the Abbey from my side of the bed 😀. 
Location was brilliant!!
”






Macdonald Bath Spa Hotel









“
Beautiful hotel and surroundings and very quiet yet only 10 minutes walk from Bath.
”






Royal Hotel









“
Staff were friendly and very helpful. Good breakfasts . Convenient for town centre and station. Good size bedrooms/ bathrooms. Comfortable beds. Service provided by the staff was far more personal than you usually get at larger hotels.

Fantastic hotel in the heart of Bath.  Outstanding service, well appointed rooms with all the touches of The Savoy in London.
”
