The gateway to southern Bali, Denpasar Airport is right on the edge of the town, so it won’t be long before you can stretch out and soak up the sun.

Grand Inna Kuta is right on the iconic Kuta Beach. It features an outdoor pool, dining options and free buffet breakfast.

“The hotel was beautiful, just what you would want in a Balanese style.  Staff was superb everyone went out of their way to be so helpful.  The breakfast buffet was fantastic, we don't usually eat big breakfasts but this was so special we went everyday.  The pools are gorgeous and the food at restaurants was excellent.  We especially enjoyed the Keckat show on Friday night with dinner, the story print out was very helpful in understanding the play, and the dinner was excellent.  We would stay there again.  For first time visitors this is in a location near to dozens of fantastic restaurants, Couples, Dumonts, Jamies and many more.  Every meal we had there was awesome, some of the best food we have ever had anywhere.”
