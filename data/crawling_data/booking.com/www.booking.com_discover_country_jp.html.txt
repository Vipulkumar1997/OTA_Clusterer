Top Cities








harbors, sightseeing and chinatown are just a few reasons why you’ll love Yokohama.







Yokohama


84 hotels
52,161 hotel reviews









Tokyo is a great choice for travelers interested in shopping, food and convenient public transportation.

For more traditional Japanese culture, head to Asakusa whose Sensō-ji Buddhist temple is Tokyo’s oldest temple. Outdoor markets sell a variety of wares, though shopping in Tokyo is, of course, fantastic wherever you go.
Whether you stay in a Japanese ryokan, luxury Tokyo hotel or a hostel, don’t fly out of Tokyo Narita Airport or Haneda Airport without having tried sushi. Another Japanese institution is the sento (public bath) and onsen (hot springs bath) – a must try. Also incredibly popular are Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, Asia’s 2 most visited theme parks.
