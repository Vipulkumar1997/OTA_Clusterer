Hotels That Guests Love in Chicago




Holiday Jones









“
Location is very convenient when you arrive to Chicago O'Hare - the place is about 45 min away from the airport using CTA. However, the greatest asset of this place is very friendly and helpful personnel. The property on its own is alright, nothing (maybe besides one or two things ;-) ) to dislike, but do not expect it be on an average hotel level, because it is a hostel. The surrounding of this place seems friendly and safe, plus there's plenty of pubs and coffee shops around to enjoy your trip.
”






Freehand Chicago









“
I stayed in a shared room which was cozy and clean. It was pretty cold in Chicago and the hostel provided extra blankets. The bathroom was great. the breakfast spectacular for a hostel. And the staff very friendly. I could visit all the tourist spots by foot and public transport is at the corner of the hostel which was great. I loved the experience.
”






FieldHouse Jones









“
This is not a hostel, it's a hotel with strangers living in your room. I mean, they provide four... FOUR towels for your convenience! Each room has its own shower and toilet, personal locker in the room. The kitchen is unbelievable, great furniture, great fridge and freezer, huge TV, laundry 6$, air hockey, ping-pong, table football. They also have a great café at the entrance! The hostel is very close to Chicago station (3 min walk). Totally awesome!
”






Chicago Getaway Hostel









“
It was a cheap solution to stay in the Chicago area. Location was ok for public transportation to Downtown and there were some bars, restaurants and shops around the hostel.
”






Chicago Parthenon Hostel









“
Most of the people working there were incredibly nice and helpful. The location was close to perfect. When I was in Chicago it was the cheapest hostel with n okay rating. 10/10 recommendation for people who don't need a lot to get comfortable.
”

It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
