Hotels That Guests Love in San Francisco




Handlery Union Square Hotel









“
The Handlery hotel is an excellent choice for a comfortable stay in Union Square San Francisco. The location is in a great location for local bars/restaurants and MUNI services eg local buses, cable car, BART etc. Our King size room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. The hotel staff were very helpful and having internal access to the "Daily Grill" was great for breakfast and evening drinks/dinner.
”






Handlery Union Square Hotel









“
The hotel was really nice, staff friendly and the location was perfect for Union Square and exploring San Francisco. The rooms were great and we got offered an upgrade because it was my husbands 40th. There is a lovely small pool to relax around also and small gym. The breakfast and dinner in the adjoining restaurant "the grill" was brilliant, good menu and food, the atmosphere was really good too.
”






Coventry Inn









“
Coventry Inn was a good choice for us as we had a car, and it is difficult to find something with parking in San Francisco. The area was also good, with plenty of choice for breakfast and dinner locations. The location was good for visiting Golden Gate Bridge (we did it by renting bikes, one bike rental shop is just outside the hotel).The room was spacious and had all necessary amenities.
”






Hotel Zephyr San Francisco









“
The location very close to the piers of San Francisco, particularly the pier 39. All the nearby attractions. Very close to public transport including the F and E lines of the team. Many dinning options nearby.
”






Chancellor Hotel on Union Square









“
Friendly, helpful staff. Little extra touches made our stay more enjoyable. Coffee available in lobby at all times,, together with cookies and apples. Complimentary bottle of wine in our room. Had breakfast in the hotel dining room which was very good, and early dinner one night st Happy Hour. And the hotel is right on the San Francisco cable car route,Highly recommend this hotel.

It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
