San Diego Travel Guide










The Art of Easy Living
Sweeping along the coast against a mountain backdrop, San Diego has easy living down to a fine art. Its wonderful beaches and mild climate make it a favorite spring break destination, and with over 40 city breweries, there are plenty of ice cold beers to set the mood.
The city’s most recognizable landmark is the Hotel del Coronado, a wooden Victorian beach resort, now a National Historic Landmark. As original Spanish mission and first in California, it's has been relocated to the Mission Valley area, and Old Town San Diego still has many Colonial buildings and quirky shops. Also great for shopping are Horton Plaza and the boutiques in the beachfront neighborhoods.
The city’s most famous attraction is its zoo in Balboa Park, a few blocks from San Diego International Airport. One of the world’s largest zoos, it is well worth a visit, as is the fantastic SeaWorld, home to several killer whales. To see wildlife in its natural habitat head to La Jolla beach where harbor seals rest, or watch whales in season from Point Loma Lighthouse.
Just over the border from Mexico’s Tijuana, San Diego has a distinctly Latin American vibe and a variety of accommodations encompassing apartments, motels, B&Bs; and hotels. See Booking.com for the best deals.

Best time to visit San Diego is the week right after Thanksgiving. Most of the attractions are slow, a lot less people and crowds to deal with. This is ideal when trying to keep track of smaller children.

San Diego is a beautiful city with lots to see and do.

San Diego is a beautiful city with lots to see and do. Touring the USS Midway was a highlight!Parking is a problem in the downtown area so I understand why all hotels charge for parking, but at $32 per day (not including tips) for the mandatory valet parking at The Bristol was very expensive and seems excessive.  We stayed in one of the king refurbished rooms at The Bristol hotel and it was very nice. The new bed was amazing. Everything was very clean. The staff was friendly, professional, very attentive. All of our needs we're met. Highly recommend The Bristol!

“
Convenient walking distance to Seaport Village, Gaslamp Quarter and many fine dining options. The hotel staff were wonderful and answered all my questions. Very elegant and clean hotel with awesome views of the San Diego Bay and Downtown area.
”






Hilton Garden Inn San Diego Downtown/Bayside, CA









“
Clean hotel located by the San Diego Airport and close to SD's Little Italy, which has a nice dining, coffee. It's immediate surrounding area is a bit industrial, however, fronted by a 6 or 8 lane high speed road in front, and the city metro in back. It's a 20-30 minute walk to Gaslamp area. Half of it is a Hilton, other half is a Homewood Suites, shared lobby.
”






California Suites Hotel









“
This hotel is definitely not pretentious. I grew up in San Diego and grew up on the beach.  Have stayed in many great hotels but I find this hotel a great value for my family I am a single mother and my children loved this hotel it is close to all close enough but not too close. It's safe and quiet and very comfortable my children are adults now and they still love this hotel and staff good memories
”

Tower 23 Hotel









“
The entire stay was wonderful! The bed and pillows were so so so soft and comfy. The staff was very attentive with our requests. The location is great, right on the beach but also in a lively part of town. The breakfast we ordered in the morning was so yummy and the staff was really quick about making it and bringing it to the room. Staying in this hotel was the best decision we've ever made, my friend and I loved staying here. We will definitely be coming back.
