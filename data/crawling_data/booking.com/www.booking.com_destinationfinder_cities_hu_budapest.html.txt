Things to Do in Budapest









Chain Bridge

A marvel from any angle. This bridge is a vital piece of Budapest’s cityscape that links Buda with Pest. But it was born of tragedy. In 1820, a Hungarian aristocrat missed his father’s funeral due to freezing weather, then vowed to build a bridge across the Danube. This is it. See the bridge that unified a city in its full glory from the top of Castle Hill.



Széchenyi Lánchíd, Hungary









Buda Castle

It wasn’t that long ago that Buda Castle virtually lay in ruins. Oh, how times have changed. Built and rebuilt countless times over nine centuries, this massive medieval complex holds a legacy of archives, museums, galleries and governmental buildings. A major highlight is the Hungarian National Gallery – start there, then traverse the well-kept grounds.



Szent György tér 2, 1014 Hungary




Open Tuesday–Sunday 10:00–18:00. Check website for details.









Matthias Church & Fisherman's Bastion

“Wish you were here”. Fisherman’s Bastion is a large-scale observation deck, with views that could never be replicated on a postcard – the sublime sweep of Pest, framed by the Danube. Wander in a veritable open-air museum of stately statues, winding stairs, grand domes and rooftop turrets – one of which belongs to Matthias Church, renowned for its museum of religious artefacts.



Szentháromság tér 2, 1014 Hungary




Open Monday–Friday 09:00–17:00, Saturday 09:00–13:00, Sunday 13:00–17:00









Hungarian Parliament Building

The “House of the Nation”. Designed by architect Imre Steindl, Hungary’s hulking Neo-Gothic parliament was inaugurated on the country’s 1000th anniversary in 1896. To this day, it’s still the nation’s largest building. Trundle through its 691 rooms and 29 staircases to witness treasures like the glimmering Holy Crown and the gilded cornices of the Assembly Hall. You’re golden!



Kossuth Lajos tér 1-3, 1055 Hungary




Open Monday-Sunday 08:00–16:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









St. Stephen's Basilica

Hungary’s most grandiose church is impossible to miss. Its steeples soar in the skyline and it’s visible from virtually every point in the centre. While many visitors while away the hours staring at its vast, resplendent gold interior, there’s one unique claim-to-fame. It holds the mummified right hand of King Stephen, Hungary’s first monarch – which is said to perform miracles.



Szent István tér 1, 1051 Hungary




Open Monday–Friday 09:00–17:00, Saturday 09:00–13:00, Sunday 13:00–17:00









State Opera House

Well-versed in the art of opera? Even if you don’t know your “Rigoletto” from your rigatoni, this building never fails to mesmerise. Inside, it’s an exercise in excess: towering marble columns, vibrant frescoes of mythological creatures and chandeliers that drip with crystals. Regular tours allow you to take in the full experience, otherwise book a ticket to an upcoming show.



Andrássy út 22, 1061 Hungary




Open Monday-Sunday 11:00–22:00. Check website for details.









Dohány Street Synagogue

This twin-turreted synagogue is an icon of Jewish resilience. It’s dimly lit day and night, where slivers of light reveal its arabesque arches, Stars of David and gusts of incense. It was built in the mid 19th-century, and fell into disrepair during communist rule. Estee Lauder and actor Tony Curtis famously bandied the funds to restore the synagogue to its former glory.



Dohány utca 2, 1074 Hungary




Open Sunday–Thursday 10:00–16:00, Friday 10:00–14:00. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Great Market Hall

Around the world in 180 cuisines. This three-level marketplace is a go-to for gourmet food, as well as basic staples. You’ll spot pensioners buying bananas, students breaking bread, and busy mums buying kitchenalia. Beat the masses to a pitch-perfect pot of piquant paprika, or walk around and graze on street-style food. We guarantee that you’ll be busy all morning.



Vámház körút 1-3, 1093 Hungary




Open Monday 06:00–17:00, Tuesday–Friday 06:00–18:00, Saturday 06:00–15:00









Heroes' Square

The threads of past and present are tied in Heroes’ Square. Its stern statues of chieftains, kings and lionhearts once presided over political demonstrations and displays of Communist might. These days, those same bronze figures look down on pop concerts, street fairs and celebrations. For an art history lesson, duck into the Hall of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts.



Hősök tere, 1146 Hungary









Széchenyi Thermal Baths

Who said the Fountain of Youth was a myth? Introducing Europe’s largest public baths. To say nothing of the butterscotch-coloured belvederes that form the backdrop, some 18 baths attract a steady stream of ages and body types. Come here to simmer in mineral-rich geothermal waters and play a game of chess with the local Bobby Fischers. Most importantly, don’t be shy (nobody else is!).



Állatkerti körút 9-11, 1146 Hungary




Open Monday-Sunday 06:00–22:00. Check website for details.









Lukács Thermal Bath

Though this bathhouse sprang up in the 1880s, folks have been dipping their toes in hot springs here since the 12th century. Smaller than Budapest’s best known spas, this quiet retreat is frequented by locals looking for a quick pick-me-up in pools that range from 70 to 105 degrees. Things speed up on Saturday nights when the place transforms into a laser-lit nightclub.








Széchenyi Thermal Bath

This sprawling spa complex is Europe’s largest medicinal bath. What it lacks in quiet coziness, it makes up for in sheer grandeur. Set in the greenery of City Park, the spa’s palatial Neo-Baroque building offers up the royal treatment – with 15 indoor baths and three outdoor pools to choose from. You’ll feel like a new person after all those jets, bubbles, and whirls work their magic.








Gellert Thermal Bath

When the Ottomans found earthy minerals in the thermal waters here, they named the area Muddy Bath. Those magic ingredients still remain, even though the bathhouse has been cleaned up since. The entrance hall’s Art Nouveau domed ceiling and stained-glass windows will amaze you before you even get near the saunas, hot tubs, and plunge pools.








Matthias Church

Over 700 years old, this ancient place of worship has seen Budapest’s history develop all around it. Its lofty spire shoots up from a cobblestone square on Castle Hill – where frescoes embellish interiors and the sun shines down on a roof covered with a mosaic of Zsolnay ceramic tiles. When you wander around, keep an eye out for King Matthias’ coat of arms depicting a black raven.








Roman Ruins of Aquincum

Now an excavated location bringing Roman Budapest to life, this collection of ruins includes the site of a military camp, the crumbling remains of an amphitheater, and a section of aqueduct. Take a walk around—almost all of it is accessible to visitors—and you might see some archaeological work under way.








Széchenyi Baths

Budapest’s baths are second to none, but this grand spa emporium deserves a visit just for the building alone. This Neo-Baroque, yellow palace stands in all its pillared glory overlooking sprawling azure pools. Designed by Gyozo Czigler, the turrets, balconies, archways, and glass-paneled ceilings will thrill architecture buffs.








Hotel Gellért Building

Art Nouveau splendor awaits you at this landmark hotel on the banks of the Danube. Home to an elaborately designed bathhouse, its ceilings soar and its pillars and archways run the length of seemingly never-ending hallways. Masterminded by Ármin Hegedűs in 1912, it’s survived two world wars.








Király Baths

The oldest bathhouse in Budapest, Király, with its cupola-crowned design is unique in the city. High above the octagonal pool sits a dome with glass-covered openings that are just big enough to let shafts of sunlight flood the chamber. Locals go here to find peace in its leafy inner courtyard.








Museum of Applied Arts

The Museum of Applied Arts combines Eastern and Western architectural influences – the result is a building that exemplifies Art Nouveau. Its green and yellow-tiled turrets make it an iconic piece of Hungarian design, and its lavish interior is home to an art collection that started in the late 19th century.








Lindenbaum House

An embellished green, gold, and red front makes this 19th-century apartment building stand out on an otherwise normal-looking Budapest street. Full of character, this Frigyes Spiegel-designed treasure is a great example of Budapest’s celebrated Art Nouveau architecture. Every level of the building features a different motif.








Geological Museum

Home to Hungary’s largest collection of geological artifacts, this museum covers 450 million years of history. The building hasn’t been around for that long, but it's definitely established in the surrounding area. Its distinctive blue-tiled roof covers a turreted palace that’s set around a courtyard. Inside, cornice ceilings and carved archways flood with light.








Heroes Square

With its huge 118-foot-tall column, it’s not hard to find Heroes Square. Take photos of this iconic monument or wander around the Vidam Park, where you might stumble into a free outdoor event. In the park, you’ll also see the impressive Vajdahunyad Castle – home to the agricultural museum, an inexpensive attraction if you want to go inside.








Marvel at Parliament

It’s not free anymore to go inside Budapest’s Parliament building, but its awe-inspiring architecture makes an impressive photo to remember your vacation. If you can fit the whole thing in the photo, that is! Traveling with children under 6? If you can’t resist a look inside, they’ll get in for free.








Fishermans’s Bastion

City views don’t get more beautiful than the one from Fisherman’s Bastion. Located on top of Castle Hill, all of Budapest is visible in front of you. Its free to walk the walls all year, and from November to March the fee for the fairy-tale tower is waived, too.

Beautiful city. A lot of things to do and see.Budget: comparing to London, Madrid or Copenhagen, consumption (food, drinks) is non-expensive.Must: bring your swimsuit and enjoy a nice bath at the Széchenyi Medicinal Bath.Also, take the hike at the top of the hill where the Citadel is located.

Popular Neighborhoods in Budapest












Budapest City Center


2457 properties

The grand sweep, the history, the breeze across the Danube! Start your day in a daze of delight with a stroll along Danube Promenade (Dunakorzó) to take it all in. Afterwards, marvel at the spiky Hungarian Parliament building and see the opulent Central Dome. Afterwards, enhance your all-seasons wardrobe at the shops along Váci utca.

Accommodations in Budapest City Center













05. Belváros - Lipótváros


809 properties

Here’s the recipe for Lipótváros - take a genteel neighbourhood; add a litany of uniform neo-classical buildings, a splash of art deco and voilà! You’ve got the historic heart of Budapest. It’s the centre of the finance industry and government. St. Stephen’s Basilica and Freedom Square are all a stone’s throw from each other.

Accommodations in 05. Belváros - Lipótváros













07. Erzsébetváros


798 properties

An up-and-coming residential area. The Great Synagogue (Nagy Zsinagóga) attracts crowds by the droves. Yet youth culture is slowly colonising Erzsébetváros, as “ruin bars” – dining areas built between abandoned buildings – increase in popularity. Unless you’re in the mood for crowds, skip the exceedingly hip Szimpla restaurant and dine at low-key Ankert.

Accommodations in 07. Erzsébetváros













06. Terézváros


743 properties

Learn the “Hungarian Dances”. The WestEnd City Centre is a mad shuffle to rival Brahms’ famous ditties - pram-wielding dads push through the crowds, friends converse loudly in the food hall and fashion fiends dart from shop-to-shop. It’s an upbeat introduction to an area famed for commerce, as well as the green grounds of City Park.

Accommodations in 06. Terézváros













08. Józsefváros


299 properties

Józsefváros is a canvas for the city’s artistic community. This petit neighbourhood of urban parks and charming squares is dotted with cultural institutes like the National Museum and the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest. At nightfall, it’s the best place to cut a rug – the Art-Nouveau inspired nightclubs here rank among the best in town.

Accommodations in 08. Józsefváros













13. Angyalföld


200 properties

There’s a palatable sense of change in the air in Angyalföld (“Land of Angels”). Time has been kind to this district, once known for its low living conditions and threadbare housing. Today it’s evolved into a modest residential area for young families, with friendly local cafes and charming parks.

Accommodations in 13. Angyalföld













09. Ferencváros


184 properties

Ferencváros’ Palace of Arts is worth a deep-dive. An amalgam of modern and classical design elements, it’s a venue where Hungarian culture is celebrated in play, opera and theatre. See the Palace’s famed pipe organ, or venture to the Great Market Hall for 1001 cuisines – it’s where you’ll see the area’s students and young profs on any given afternoon.

Accommodations in 09. Ferencváros













01. Budavár


147 properties

Not so little Buda. This district is dominated by Budavári Palota, a mammoth medieval palace complex. Zip up Castle Hill on the old-time funicular, and stand atop the castle walls to capture sweeping vistas of the Danube River and Pest beyond it. In the high-class Vár area, hop from upscale bar to classy restaurant like you’re modern-day royalty.

Accommodations in 01. Budavár













02. Rózsadomb


106 properties

Buda’s “Hill of Roses” is highly affluent. During the Turkish occupation, roses were planted all over these hills. Now it’s home to filmmakers, celebrities, and a new generation of Hungarian movers-and-shakers. Renowned for its open meadows, dense forests and sweeping views of the Danube, it’s also a prime spot for romantic evening walks.

Accommodations in 02. Rózsadomb













Margaret Island


3 properties

Welcome to leisure island. Linked to the main lands by two bridges, this teardrop-shaped island is a recreation hot-spot. Lace up and run with the city’s health nuts (a double-loop of the island is roughly a quarter marathon), or laze about on the grass. Health spas, outdoor theatres, zoos and scenic walks – this wholesome respite has it all.

Local Tips for Budapest







Kerepesi Cemetery




by Agnes

Agnes has been slowly discovering Budapest's secrets ever since she moved there to study.


A cemetery might not sound like a tourist attraction, but Kerepesi is definitely worth a visit. It’s like a cross between a park and an open-air museum, filled with statues and monuments to famous Hungarian politicians, scientists and artists. Absolutely beautiful all year round!

Chill out on Liberty Bridge




by Robert

Robert was never a fan of city life until he fell in love with Budapest 1.5 years ago.


Probably the most beautiful bridge in Budapest, but that’s not the best part. Get there before sunset with a nice wine or beer and just watch the sun go down and the city lights go on. Meanwhile, trams pass by on the bridge and boats underneath it. A true Budapest experience!

City Park Állatkerti Körút




by Darinka

Darinka moved to Budapest from a small town 10 years ago and fell in love with the city’s diversity.


This little promenade in the City Park is a magical place if you feel like travelling back in time or just being close to nature within the city. A zoo, a circus and little kiosks selling typical carnival food like langos and kolbász  line the promenade, creating a 19th century feel.

Római Riverbank




by Zsuzsanna

How can you get the most authentic cultural experience in Budapest?





Anonymous


Get off the beaten track. Head to Gul Baba utca to understand the ottoman influence in Budapest. Visit smaller spas like veli bej where the locals head, not the tourists. Check out market places for delicious food and fresh produce such as mushrooms foraged from the forest. Get up early to see the castle district and main monuments before all the other tourists arrive. Check out the cafe at Lotz Terem above the bookshop, it's absolutely beautiful with a wide range of drinks. Try Mensa restaurant, Alibi cafe and cafe pio for modern and Hungarian fare at reasonable prices.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
