Things to Do in Singapore









Esplanade: Theaters on the Bay

Introducing the humble durian fruit – a bit spiky and smelly, but quite delicious. It was Singaporean’s love for this curious fruit that provided the architectural inspiration for this ginormous performing arts center. It’s the best place in town to be surrounded by Shakespeare, listen to the strum of exotic instruments or take in a range of melodies on a moonlit night.



1 Esplanade Drive, 038981




Check website for details









Singapore Riverside: Clarke Quay, Robertson Quay and Boat Quay

Charter a tugboat and chug your way down Singapore’s most famous river! This 2-mile-long body of water flows from the Kim Seng Bridge into the Marina Channel and out to the Singapore Strait. If you’re not taking an afternoon boat tour, step into one of the glistening skyscrapers that line the banks for fine dining, drinks and entertainment.



River cruises depart from Raffles Landing Site, 049213




Open every day 9 am – 10 pm









National Museum of Singapore

What do you know about visual arts? Don't worry, it's not a test. This museum can teach you all you need to know and more about Singaporean art old and new – with photography, fashion, traveling exhibitions, and even a cinema... Walk through the glorious Glass Passage, plan an evening at an avant-garde art film or gaze up at the glorious rotunda.



93 Stamford Road, 178897




Open every day 10 am – 6 pm









Sands SkyPark

Ding – Welcome to Level 57 of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Leave the elevator and you’ll be confronted with the world’s highest swimming pool. Stretch out on a poolside lounge chair, order a cocktail and look out over the buildings that appear like elaborate sandcastles at your feet. The pool is for guests only, but the observation deck is accessible for a nominal fee.



10 Bayfront Avenue, 018956

Singapore Flyer

Join the revolution! This epically large observation Ferris wheel makes a full turn once every 32 minutes, giving you plenty of time to devour the scenery – you can even see some parts of Malaysia and Indonesia on a clear day. The 550-foot-high wheel was opened in 2008, and has capsules that hold about 28 people at a time.



30 Raffles Avenue, 039803




Open every day 8:30 am – 10:30 pm









Gardens by the Bay

Experience four seasons in one day at this award-winning horticultural park. The gardens consist of different ecosystems, where plants from around the world thrive. It’s eternally spring in the Flower Dome, a cool mist from a waterfall billows in the tropical Cloud Forest, and the 16-story Super Tree Grove transforms into a spectacular light and sound show at night.



18 Marina Gardens Drive, 018953




Check website for details









Singapore Botanical Gardens

Verdant landscaped gardens, trickling waterfalls and a clam-shaped stage…is this a dream? Wake up and come to your senses inside this 74-acre botanical garden. Tiptoe through the Japanese Forest, take a healing garden tour, or just laze around on the edge of the stage and listen to jazz. Entry to the park is free, except for the National Orchid Garden.



1 Cluny Road, 259569




Open every day 5 am – 12 am

Was that…no, it can’t be…OMG it’s her! Spot larger-than-life celebrity look-alikes and more inside this theme park dedicated to moviemaking. The 24 attractions take you on a roller-coaster ride through Ancient Egypt to Hollywood and from the Lost World to Madagascar and back again. There are also 30 odd restaurants and snack bars to satisfy any occasional hunger pangs.



8 Sentosa Gateway, Sentosa Island, 098269




Open every day 10 am – 7 pm









Singapore Zoo

Channel your inner Doctor Doolittle and walk and talk with the animals. Each year, some 1.6 million visitors wander around the carefully crafted environments, designed to resemble natural habitats. Go ape on the Wild Discoveries tour, meet your polar opposite at the Frozen Tundra exhibit, or pander to the pandas. Enjoy exploring, and remember – feeding the animals is prohibited!



80 Mandai Lake Road, 729826

80 Mandai Lake Road, 729826




Open every day 9 am – 6 pm









Singapore Botanic Gardens

The only tropical garden to be granted UNESCO World Heritage Status, Singapore’s lush Botanic Gardens are the result of more than 150 years of expert cultivation. This giant green space is split into three cores—Tanglin, Central and Bukit Timah—each focused on a different aspect of Singapore’s horticulture, history and education.








Go on a Walking Trail of the Gardens

One of the best ways to discover Singapore’s historic Botanic Gardens is to follow one of the specially designed walking trails available. Download the guide from the garden’s website to find routes that range from 40 to 90 minutes, taking you on a journey through the thousands of species flourishing in every section.








National Orchid Garden

Singapore’s National Orchid Garden stretches across seven acres, and is home to more than 3,000 orchid species. Split into four color-coded zones—one for each season of the year—the gardens dazzle with bright blossoms, beautifully arranged bushes, trees, and other plant life.








Central Business District

When it's time to eat, you have tons of options in Singapore’s Central Business District. Head to MEATLiquor to chow down on American-style burgers or join the line at Ginza Tendon Itsuki for some amazing Japanese fare. If Italian’s more your style, look no further than Latteria Mozzarella Bar. And for local specialties, it’s Ding Dong all the way!








Maxwell Road Hawker Centre

Where to start? That's the question you’ll be asking yourself when you see all the rows of stalls in Maxwell Road Hawker Centre. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is a local favorite (the line should clue you in on its popularity). Or try out fresh fish soup and oyster "tum paeh," then finish it off with some sweet peanut soup. Yum!








Tiong Bahru Market

Tiong Bahru Market is a foodie’s heaven. Nearly one-hundred stalls stand side by side, each serving up delicious local morsels. Steaming stir-fry noodles, creamy curry, sticky glazed chicken breast, spicy prawn soup – it’s all here. When you make your pick, you can set up shop at one of the tables in the middle before planning your next move.








Chinatown Complex Food Centre

If you’re a fan of Asian food in all shapes and sizes, this is the place to be. The delicious smells of Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, and Thai dishes all compete for your attention here. And with some stalls proudly owning Michelin stars, you can be sure of the awesome quality.








Makansutra Gluttons Bay

This outdoor food court serves all kinds of yummy grub right on the waterfront. At night, the city skyscrapers light up reflecting their urban glow in the bay's waters. As for the food, you can munch on Singapore-style oysters, banana fritters, chicken satay, and much more.








Buddha Tooth Relic Temple

It looks like a Tang Dynasty-era temple but Chinatown’s Buddhist house of worship was only consecrated in 2008. Part working temple, part museum, it’s named after the relic that resides inside its sacred chambers – the left-canine tooth of Buddha. Head to the 4th-floor viewing area to see monks gather and chant around the large, extravagant golden shrine that houses the enamel antiquity.








Sri Mariamman Temple

You literally can’t miss Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple. Sri Mariamman’s "gopuram" is a bold and bright beacon of Chinatown. This Dravidian-style tapered tower sits above the main entrance and intricately depicts Hindu deities and demons across six tiers of vibrant sculptures. Inside, look up at the amazing decorated dome roofs that celebrate Durga, Ganesh and Shiva.








Pinnacle Duxton Skybridge

At 50 stories high, this rooftop garden really is the most epic spot for picturesque panoramas of Chinatown and beyond. At the top of Singapore’s tallest residential building, the Pinnacle Duxton Skybridge is accessible with a regular public transportation card. Once you’re up there, take your pick from lounge chairs, playgrounds and running tracks – all with unbelievable city views!








Chinatown Complex Food Center

Singapore’s biggest hawker market is packed with 260 food stalls selling classic street food dishes. With all that competition, the standards are high and the prices low. Swing by this Chinatown institution to sample everything from barbecued stingray and satay chicken, to shrimp noodles and frog porridge. Or, just sip on an icy "cendol" treat if you need to escape the sticky Singapore heat.

How can you enjoy the sights in Singapore while avoiding the crowds?

learn the MRT lines (NS, NE, EW, circle, etc.) and the local people flow in the morning and the afternoon.  then you can escape the throng of people going to work in the morning and returning home in the afternoon, by choosing your route/line.  it might take a longer route but the trains won't be jampacked and you won't have to rush.

Is there more to shopping in Singapore than just brand-name stores?

Perhaps, but one needs to gather local information on locations and kind of merchandise one is looking for which is hard to collect due to poor communication with local persons one generally comes across, who themselves are not knowledgeable and bother to think out of the box to help out.

Transportation





Singapore Transportation









Air – Changi International Airport



Metro, bus and taxi connect you to the center. Follow the signs for "Underground," then buy a ticket for the MRT from a machine. Catch a train to Tanah Merah (every 6 minutes from 5:31 am – 11:18 pm Monday to Saturday; 5:59 am – 11:18 pm on Sunday) then transfer to the west-bound Joo Koon line. The number 36 SBS Transit Bus runs every 10-15 minutes from 6 am – 12 am and takes around an hour. Taxis take half an hour and cost around SGD 18 to 38 plus fees.




Changi International Airport
www.changiairport.com











MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) System



Singapore’s MRT (aka metro) stations are spotless and trains run like clockwork from 5:30 am – 12 am daily. City Hall and Raffles Place are the two central stations. Identify stations by their wavy yellow logos and buy tickets at GTM machines inside. Ticket prices are fixed by distance traveled. Alternately, buy a Singapore Tourist Pass for 1, 2 or 3 days (costing approx. SGD 10,16 or 20). You risk a fine for consuming food or drinks inside the stations and MRT trains.




SMRT
www.smrt.com.sg











Bus



Singapore has an extensive web of bus routes – and all signs are in English. Go to a stop in the direction you want to travel and signal the driver. Enter by the front door and drop exact change into the coin box. The driver will give you a receipt that doubles as a ticket. Most buses come every 5-30 minutes from 5:30 am – 12 am, daily. At some train stations you can buy a Singapore Tourist Pass for 1, 2 or 3 days (approx. SGD 10, 16, or 20, also valid for trains) to easily swipe in and out.




SMRT
www.smrt.com.sg











Taxi



Singapore has an abundant supply of taxis, and they are the easiest way to get around (outside of rush hour). Just hail one from the street or stop by a taxi stand. The industry is heavily monitored and regulated, so virtually all taxis are official and the risk of being ripped off is low. Prices vary according to your destination, and cash payment is preferred – add 10% for credit card payments. Traveling on select expressways costs extra.










Car



Singapore has an ultra-modern road and expressway system. On-street parking and garages are usually operated by the government, and parking coupons need to be purchased ahead of time from post offices and major convenience stores. Traffic congestion can be an issue, especially on weekends and during peak hours. Singaporeans drive on the left, and you risk a large fine if you don't wear your seat belt.

Golden Shoe Nasi Lemak

It can be a little hard to get your hands on cheap food (that is good!) in the central business district, but this fits the bill! Grab a plate of Nasi Lemak for under $4 and don't be scared away by the green rice, which is flavoured with Pandan (Screwpine) Leaves. Psst! This stall is located at #02-14 in Golden Shoe Food Centre, which also houses other cheap_eats!

Tamoya

Casual Japanese dining, with a self-service approach. You first order your style of udon (hot/cold), pick a few tempura sides, settle the bill and pick your condiments. My personal favorite is the cold udon, and the tempura prawns (limited to 30 a day so come early!) Remember to clear your tray before you leave as normal etiquette in Japan.
