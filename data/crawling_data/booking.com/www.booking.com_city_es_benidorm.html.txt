Benidorm has something for everyone.

Benidorm has something for everyone. We love the walks along the mountainous cliffs to the north and south of the 2 long sandy beaches. The promenades are very pleasant outside of the main summer season. There are restaurants to suit all tastes.

Lots to do or choose to do nothing at all and simply relax and enjoy the surroundings. Fab place. Something for everyone. Every kind of entertainment from theme parks, water parks, tribute bands shows, ballroom tea dances, casino, kiddies shows, water skiing, paragliding, banana boats and much more. Lovely choice of meals in many cafes and restaurants. Gorgeous weather. Levante beach is clean and beautiful. Old town and market a must. Downside..we found strip/square really rowdy so we avoided it. But each to their own! Summer months very busy but we've just had a week end of October and weather was beautiful every day.

If you're a fan of Blackpool you'll enjoy it.

If you're a fan of Blackpool you'll enjoy it. Great beaches but ram packed lots of cheap bars and English food...not a Spanish feel. Unless you go to old town back streets!Recommend Benidorm Palace great food great staff great variety show.

If you like lots of bars, eating places, shops, hustle and bustle you'll love it here. The streets are full of busy outside eating areas, giving the feel of a huge, ongoing street party atmosphere. Very laid back. I loved it!!

Never been before and I was pleasantly surprised.

Never been before and I was pleasantly surprised.The old town is absolutely fantastic. The beach was amazing.Don't think I would like it peak season it was very busy and we went in October.The new town I wouldn't really take my children.

Benidorm is truly a place for everyone!

Benidorm is truly a place for everyone!  If you want peace and quiet, then head for the poiniente beach side, tradition, go to the old town and fun and frolics, head to Levante.  If you want a bit of everything, then the buses and taxis are cheap and plentiful.  We ate on Tapas Alley in the old town and these were excellent.
