Newcastle upon Tyne Travel Guide










The Spirit of the North
A former Industrial Revolution hub, Newcastle has reinvented itself into a vibrant, forward-thinking city. Although no longer brewed here, Newcastle Brown Ale, or Newkie Brown, is synonymous with the city, so it’s no surprise that the nightlife is fantastic.
From the O2 Academy to the Sage Music Center, the Newcastle music venues are among the best in England. The city also has a thriving arts scene, including The Biscuit Factory – Britain’s largest original art store.
Equally as good is the Newcastle shopping. The Central Arcade is in an attractive Victorian building, and across the River Tyne in Gateshead is the Metro Center, Europe’s largest shopping and leisure complex. Indeed, these 2 cities have a healthy rivalry that plays out in sports, architecture and, sometimes, the bizarre.
Gateshead boasts the Angel of The North, a huge statue that is already its most recognized (and controversial) symbol. While in Newcastle the Vampire Rabbit sits above a door near St Nicholas’ Cathedral. Newcastle United Football Club has the most prestigious record, but Gateshead Stadium has seen many a star compete at its international athletics meets.
To the west of the city are some remains of Hadrian’s Wall and further north is Newcastle Airport. See Booking.com for a range of accommodations all over this happening city.

We came specifically to see an act at Arena but, enjoyed wandering around Newcastle and the quayside, visiting the large mwtro centre shopping mall and retail park and taking the metro to tynemouth for the massive  station market held at weekends. Recommend the Skiff Inn near where we stayed. Excellent food at a reasonable price and lovely staff.

Newcastle has great shopping (Fenwicks is amazing), beautiful Georgian city center (Monument and Grey St in particular), the quayside with bars and restaurants overlooking the water and all easily walking distance as it's a compact city although if you can't be bothered to walk there's always the metro too!

A very lively and vibrant city.

A very lively and vibrant city. The riverside walks are excellent and the historical buildings are impressive. There's a good nightlife and an evening walk along the seven bridges is a must. The millennium bridge is very impressive and beautiful at night .Newcastle boasts an impressive theatre and a huge variety of shops and bars. It makes an excellent venue for all.The Sunday market is also a must!

It's a beautiful city with amazing restaurants.

It's a beautiful city with amazing restaurants. I prefer the smaller, seaside, beauty of Newcastle to London. Lola Jeans and The Boranist are two amazing food stops. Tynemouth is a must see.The alchemist is a cool spot for drinks.
