Things to Do in Benidorm









Benidorm Municipal Market

Glorious groceries. This indoor market is where locals stock up on fresh foodstuffs. The fruit and veg stalls dazzle in greens and reds, and the delicatessens entice passers-by with their hammy scent. Pick up some Spanish classics like “jamón ibérico” (cured ham), “churros” (fried dough sticks) and some of the region’s famous oranges. Yummy!



Calle Mercado, 1, 03501 Benidorm




Open Monday-Friday 08:00-14:00 and 17:00-21:00, Saturday 08:00-14:30.









Plaza Mayor Square

For a main square, Benidorm’s Plaza Mayor is decidedly dinky. But then, it’s only in recent decades that the city’s been a byword for soaring skyscrapers. Sip sangria in Mesón de la Plaza restaurant as the afternoon sun dips behind the rooftops, and the earthy scent of leather wafts across from the bag and belt shop opposite. This is the life!



Plaza Mayor, 03501 Benidorm









Church of San Jaime and Santa Ana

In this city of shiny skyscrapers and neon-lit bars, this church brings a bit of peace and quiet to proceedings. Built in the eighteenth century, it also adds a sense of history to the Benidorm vibe. The blue-tiled domes, whitewashed walls and magnificent altarpiece are a charming throwback to when Benidorm was a humble fishing village. Duck inside for a moment of tranquillity.



Placa Castelar, 1, 03501 Benidorm




Open Monday-Friday 10:00-13:00 and 18:00, Saturday 17:30, Sunday 08:30-18.30.









Balcón del Mediterráneo Viewpoint

Avast there, landlubbers! This cliff-side viewpoint was once part of an old fortress that protected the coast from marauding pirates. Since then, it’s swapped cannons for cameras, and blunderbusses for binoculars – anything to maximise the peerless panoramas! If you’re looking for a romantic moment, swing by at dusk and drink in the stunning sunset.



Plaça de Sant Jaume, 03501 Benidorm









Aigüera Park

Have you always harboured a secret desire to give Julio Iglesias a kiss? In this park, there’s a bust of the great Spanish crooner himself, ripe for cheeky smackers. It sits next to the Julio Iglesias Auditorium, an amphitheatre where Benidorm’s yearly song festival is held. If sing-song’s not your bag, grab a bench in the shade or bring a ball for a kick-about.



l'Aigüera, 1, 03501 Benidorm









Casino Mediterráneo Benidorm

Can’t get enough of that winning feeling? Grab a fistful of euros and try your luck at this casino! Whether you crank one-armed bandits, spin roulette wheels or call sports results, there are plenty of opportunities to double your money – you just have to know where to look! Order up a martini from the bar and see if today’s your lucky day.



Mediterraneo, 55, 03503 Benidorm




Open Sunday-Thursday 10:00-04:00, Friday-Saturday 10:00-05:00. Check website for details.









Villaitana Golf Club

Calling all big drivers, delicate chippers and dead-eyed putters! Test your skills at Villaitana’s expanse of pristine greens and fairways. Its two courses were designed by golfing guru, Jack Nicklaus, and you can see the hand of a master in every mound, incline and bunker. The best part? You’ve got the Mediterranean on one side, and the craggy Finestrat Mountains on the other.



Alcalde Eduardo Zaplana, 7, 03502 Benidorm




Open Monday-Sunday 07:30-19:45









Aqualandia

Splash! This waterpark serves up umpteen ways of plunging into a pool of water. For adrenaline junkies, there’s the aptly named Verti-Go and the discombobulating Zig-Zag. For lazy bobbers, there’s bubbly Grand Jacuzzi Iguazu. And for those with a competitive streak, there’s the multi-laned Splash. Into other kinds of refreshment? Kick back with a cool drink at the bar.



Sierra Helada, 03503 Benidorm




Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Terra Mítica

Ancient thrills and classical spills. This theme park combines the seemingly irreconcilable worlds of rollercoasters and the great empires of antiquity. Zoom high above the Colosseum on Inferno and splash down on Falls of the Nile. At Labyrinth of the Minotaur, go in search of history’s most famous bull-headed beast armed with a laser gun. Mythical and legendary!



Partida del Moralet, 03502 Benidorm




Changes seasonally. Check website for details









Terra Natura

Ever had a mighty hawk perch on your head? How about meeting a scaly, venomous gila monster? If these animal encounters are on your bucket list, look no further than Terra Natura! This zoo lays on a steady schedule of shows, meet-and-greets and feeding sessions with some of its 1500 creatures. Over fifty of the species here are endangered, too. Catch them while you can!



Partida Foia del Verdader, 1, 03502 Benidorm




Changes seasonally. Check website for details









The Square

Popular with locals, The Square is the center of Benidorm’s active nightlife scene. This bar keeps its customers out late – with bachelor and bachelorette parties coming in to let their hair down on the dance floor until the sun comes up. Slip on your dancing shoes and join the party!








Zona 9

This area on Calle Esperanto is where young local partiers meet for their first drinks of the night. If you're looking for a tip from the people who know Benidorm best, this is the place to go for an evening. Take your pick from Black&White;, Tico Tico, Racha Rock, and Sambori – you’re sure to make some new friends.








Benidorm Promenade

The sun, sea, and sangria – that’s what Benidorm’s all about. On the promenade by Levante Beach, you can enjoy all three at the same time. Start the evening with a drink in Ku Lounge, then work your way along, stopping by Daytona Bar and Tiki Beach for a cocktail and a dance.








Zona Guiri

Tourists on the prowl! "Guiris"—a Spanish slang term for foreigners—is what this area of Rincón de Loix is named after. If you’re looking for a wild night Zona Guiri won’t disappoint, with outlandish dress, feather boas, and a ton of other fun-time party accessories. Check out Hippodrome or Lennon’s to start your night with a bang.








Old Town

Fun and fabulous – Benidorm’s Old Town is where you’ll find its gay bars packed all in a few tight-knit streets. They range from the stylish Bar Code to the laugh-a-minute Caspers Bar, from cozy R que R to the luxurious Lovers. Whatever place you end up, you’re guaranteed an enjoyable night.








Malpas Beach

While the neighboring beaches stretch for miles, Malpas Beach is relatively small. It’s a cute little sunken strip of sand, sheltered by the curve of the cliff face. Sit for a while in the sunshine, work on your tan, then head up the stone steps to the Balcón del Mediterráneo Viewpoint.








Mundomar

If you’re an animal lover, what better way to enjoy the sunshine than by watching a dolphin show? Mundomar has a spectacular show two times a day that wows audiences all year round. If you book ahead, you can even swim with them! Besides these amazing beasts, there are meerkats, lemurs, parrots and penguins, ready to entertain the whole family!








Levante Beach

Levante Beach is all about fun in the sun. On two kilometres of pristine sand, rows of parasols shade snoozing holidaymakers. In the crystal-clear waters, sunbathers cool off and speed merchants whizz past on jet-skis. Top up your tan, then grab a bite in the lively beachfront eateries. For night-time frolics, boogie on down at Penelope club.








Poniente Beach

Easy like a Sunday morning. Poniente Beach is an altogether more chilled affair than its fun-loving neighbour, Levante Beach. It’s here that beach bums soak up the Mediterranean rays in peace. Grab a fried brekkie at Jarrow Lad café, then stretch out on a sunbed and let the sound of lapping water drift into your dreams. And… relax!








Aqua Natura

Those sunny summer vacations wouldn't be the same without a little water. Not only do Spain's wide blue seas provide a great way to cool off, they're fantastic for some family fun too. Nobody says no to the beach, but if you really want to have a wild, water fun-filled day then Benidorm's Aqua Natura park has you covered with tons of slides, a wave pool with some serious swells, and even the chance to see a sea lion show. It's a definite hit for all ages!








Benidorm Island Excursion

Legend has it that Benidorm Island is the missing chunk from the top of Puig Campana mountain. Even though we can't confirm the story, we can definitely recommend heading out to visit this charming little spot – the perfect way to spend a day. Take a boat trip in the sun and then enjoy exploring the island's winding paths and abundance of local animals and plants. There's spectacular views to enjoy from the rocky summit, and even a restaurant if you're feeling hungry.








Poniente Beach and Waterfront

More peaceful than your average Benidorm beach, Poniente is the perfect spot to spend a sizzling afternoon. It won’t cost you a cent to enjoy the fine, white sand and crystal-clear waters, as well as the playground and volleyball court – just bring your own ball. There are lots of budget-friendly restaurants nearby, so you can head for dinner after working on your tan.








Cala Tio Ximo

They say the best things in life are free. Compared to the crowded beaches of Benidorm, Cala Tio Ximo feels like a godsend. The rocky terrain and pebbly shore tends to keep the masses away – leaving the secluded cove free for snorkelers, swimmers, and cliff divers to enjoy. If nothing else, the breathtaking backdrop of the Sierra Helada is worth the trip!








Historic Old Town

Benidorm’s hilly Old Town divides the beaches of Poniente and Levante. If you feel like shaking the sand from your shoes, go for a walk around this maze of cobblestone streets. You’ll wander past cute churches, bargain-priced shopping stalls, and affordable pincho restaurants. At the Balcón del Mediterráneo, it costs nothing to capture the sweeping sea scenery!








Mal Pas Beach

Tucked away beneath the port and castle cliffs you’ll find peaceful Mal Pas. It doesn’t draw the same crowds as the other beaches, so it's a perfect retreat from Benidorm’s lively hustle and bustle. Stretch out with a good book or your favorite playlist and enjoy some uninterrupted time in the sun.








Algar Natural Fountains

Tired of the beach? This inland escape is a refreshing change from sea and sand. Located just nine miles from Benidorm, Algar Natural Fountains is an unspoiled wonderland of flowing waterfalls, springs and pools. After a soaking up the sun on smooth riverside rocks, beat the heat with a dip in its cool, crystal-clear waters.








Terra Mítica Amusement Park

Calling all geeks! The Nakano neighborhood flies the flag for nerd culture, with an crazy selection of stores catering to gamers, comic-book lovers and collectors of every fandom imaginable. Cosplayers can pick up finishing touches for their looks in the Nagano Broadway Mall, before strutting their stuff in the local streets and bars.








Benidorm Palace

At the legendary Benidorm Palace you’ll be treated to a delicious three-course menu, complete with wine and a generous helping of cabaret. Think bright lights, big musical numbers and glamorous artists in spectacular costumes. Take your appetite for excitement and find your seat from 21.00, Tuesday to Saturday.








Sinatra's Venue

Found in the heart of the New Town, Sinatra’s will send you twirling through an evening of cabaret acts and live music. You’ll spot tributes to all the greats including Tom Jones, Rod Stewart and The Drifters, as well enjoying Motown and Reggae segments, and performances from Neil St. John – ‘The Voice of Benidorm’.








Cafe Benidorm

With its 70s and 80s soundtrack, ‘2-for-1’ drinks deals and vibrant cabaret calendar, Café Benidorm has earned its reputation as a buzzing nightlife hotspot. A range of singers and tribute acts wow the crowds until 2:30, when the floor opens up for disco-dancing until breakfast time.

Benidorm Old Town


75 properties

Once upon a time, Benidorm was a sleepy fishing village. In the Old Town, you can get a taster of the way things were before the city got its skyline. Enjoy a moment’s peace in the Church of San Jaime and Santa Ana, then gasp at timeless vistas at Balcón del Mediterráneo viewpoint. To feast on tasty and traditional tapas, head to La Taperia.

Accommodations in Benidorm Old Town













Rincon de Loix


73 properties

A little piece of England on the Med. This residential district is a pretty network of quiet bungalows and glistening pools, where sun-seeking Brits have set up shop. Mingle with cheery ex-pats in the aptly named Home from Home, then cop a curry at the Curry Mile. If you don’t want to miss out on the footy back home, head to Stretford End.

Calle de los Gatos




by Daniel

Valencian Daniel loves going for a run along the seafront and finding new and exciting bike routes.


Meaning ‘Cat Street’, this whitewashed, pedestrianised street with archways resembles those normally found in Andalusia. It packs with locals at night, who flock to its many bars.

What did you enjoy most about bar hopping in Benidorm?





Anonymous


A type of bar is available in every street to suit every age group from teenagers to recycled teenagers and visitors looking for some good old fashioned sing along piano bars or Karaoke. (Even Bingo if you like that!) Sports bars where you can have a flutter can be either small and friendly or big, casino type and modern.

Where should people go if they don't want to eat in a tourist trap?





Anonymous


A visit to Finnestrat takes you out of the Benidorm buzz into a quiet little sun trap of a bay with a few restaurants, bars and very few shops. Also a quieter little town with beautiful scenery but a more expensive day out can be found in Altea.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
