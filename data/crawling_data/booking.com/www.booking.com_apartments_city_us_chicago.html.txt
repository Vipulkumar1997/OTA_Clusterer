Hotels That Guests Love in Chicago




Bridgestreet at State and Grand









“
Very convenient location, close to the Chicago River and Magnificent Mile. The apartment was large with a fully equipped kitchen and a very nice city view on the 26th floor. The Wi-Fi connection was very good.
”






Raffaello Hotel









“
Cute old building. Our king suit felt like a little 1 bedroom apartment. Very cozy, although our view was of the fire escape of the building behind us but Chicago is a tight city so I didnt mind.
”






Ohio House Motel









“
Really helpful and friendly staff, who went above and beyond when I booked the wrong room, providing an (extremely comfortable) inflatable mattress. Wifi (traditionally not great in the US) was brilliant, and next time I visit Chicago, I'll be looking here before think about booking elsewhere.
”






Embassy Suites Chicago Downtown Magnificent Mile









“
Our stay here was more than we expected! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was huge and comfortable; like a little apartment. I guess we missed the part about the complimentary bar. You get 4 free drinks each! The breakfast was excellent and what you hope for when you see a free breakfast is offered. Great location and close to everything. We definitely hope we get to visit Chicago again and will definitely be staying here when we go!
”






Premier Luxury at the Coast









“
It's a 1b1b apartment actually. So the space is big enough, which is absolutely larger than any other hotel you can find at downtown Chicago. The view at the balcony is also awesome, with a glimpse of Navy Pier and Hudson River right in front of you. Cooking is also allowed and there're even bowls plates and glasses on the table already.
”

It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
