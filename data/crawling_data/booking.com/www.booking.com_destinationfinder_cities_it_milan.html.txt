Things to Do in Milan









Duomo Milan

Cathedrals this size don’t come cheap, or fast – it took more than 500 years to build Duomo Cathedral, which is jaw-dropping in both its scale and beauty. La Madonnina (Milan’s legendary protector) stands at the highest point of this 351-foot-high structure. The interior is magnificently decorated and lit by sunlight from the stained glass windows above. Heavenly!



Via Arcivescovado, 1




Open every day 7 am – 7 pm









Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II

You’ll always be welcome in Milan’s "il salotto di Milano" (living room), even if you have nobody to visit. Opened in 1867, it’s one of the world's oldest shopping malls and is a luxurious shopping experience like no other. The building is a marvel in itself, with glass ceilings and a steel structure that is decorated with mosaics representing the four corners of the world.



Piazza Castello









Museo del Novecento (Museum of the Twentieth Century)

Modern art is the cat’s pajamas, which you might see hanging in this wonderfully spacious modern art museum. Museo del Novecento’s collection covers many stylistic periods from the 20th century on, with everything from surrealism to futurism. The museum has free entry and a collection of works by high profile modern artists like De Chirico, Morandi, Fontana, and Manzoni.



Palazzo dell'Arengario, Via Marconi, 1, 20100




Open Sunday to Monday 2:30 pm – 7:30 pm, Tuesday and Wednesday 9:30 am – 7:30 pm, Thursday 9:30 am – 10:30 pm, Friday 9:30 am – 7:30 pm, Saturday 9:30 am – 10:30 pm









La Scala Theater and Museum

Turn up the drama factor and grand pirouettes in Italy’s premiere ballet and opera house. Music from La Scala’s 135-piece orchestra regularly fills the halls of this extravagant theater, which has been in regular use since 1778. When they’re not performing, there are operas and ballets here written by history’s musical greats. Check their website for details.



Theatre: Via Filodrammatici 2, Museum: Largo Ghiringhelli 1




Open every day 9 am – 12:30 pm and 1:30 pm – 5:30 pm









L'Ultima Cena (The Last Supper)

Hidden away in the refectory of a retired convent, you'll find one of the greatest paintings ever created. Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper" in Santa Maria delle Grazie depicts Jesus announcing to his disciples that one of them would betray him. After a painstaking restoration, the figures appear as bright as if they were painted yesterday. Reservations in advance are essential.



Piazza Santa Maria delle Grazie, 2




Open Monday to Saturday 7 am – 12 pm and 3 pm – 7 pm; Sunday 7:30 am – 12:30 pm and 3:30 pm – 9 pm









Pinacoteca di Brera (Brera Picture Gallery)

You never know what you're going to find in your neighbor's attic – trunks, clothes, or a work of art. Housed inside a former monastery, the Brera collection started when nearby convents and monasteries were suppressed during Austrian and Napoleonic rule. Nowadays, their collection is one of the best in Lombardy, displaying great works of art in inspirational surroundings.



Via Brera, 28




Open Tuesday to Sunday 8:30 am – 7:15 pm









Quadrilatero della moda (Fashion District)

Big spenders will want to take a little time to explore this illustrious fashion district. Follow Via Manzoni a few blocks north of Piazza della Scala and you'll arrive at Milan's world-famous "quadrilateral of fashion." With designer labels that read like the advertising in a fashion magazine, shop here for haute couture at the flagship stores of major luxury brands.



Streets include Via Montenapoleone, Via Manzoni, Corso Venezia and Via della Spiga in Piazza San Babila.




Open every day 9 am – 7 pm









Sforzesco Castle and Parco Sempione

Delve deep into Renaissance-era intrigue with a day exploring this elaborate 14th-century castle. Taking its name from Milan's Sforza family, who governed by power-mongering and deception akin to the Medici's, this castle contains a complex of secret tunnels and smaller museums, including an Egyptian Museum. Parco Sempione in front is an elaborate 17th-century garden.



Piazza Castello




Open every day 7 am – 6 pm. Changes seasonally – check website for details.









Navigli

The residents of Navigli were bohemian long before "boho-chic" floated into fashion. Originally a working-class neighborhood, it's now a stylish urban area, particularly popular for pre-dinner “aperitivos” that usually start around 7:30 pm. The friendly restaurants, pizzerias, cafes and cocktail bars along the majestic Naviglio Grande canal are some of Milan’s best.



Navigli









San Siro

Get sidelined with a case of soccer fever at this incredible stadium that's home to A.C. Milan and F.C. Internazionale Milano. When supporters aren't screaming wildly from the stands during one of the matches, you can take a tour of the stadium, as well as the memorabilia museum under the South Curve that details the history of A.C. Milan and Inter F.C.



Piazzale Angelo Moratti




Open every day 9:30 am – 5 pm









Via Montenapoleone

In this city of fashion, Via Montenapoleone stands head and shoulders above all other shopping streets. Along a grand avenue, swanky store fronts shine with golden letters, spelling out names like Gucci, Versace, Dior and Hermès. If you have style and cash to spend, head on down to Via Montenapoleone and join the flocks of fashionistas.








Corso Venezia

Can’t get enough high-end fashion? Put on your oversized sunglasses and strut down to Corso Venezia for a full immersion. Among Renaissance façades and portico entrances, bustling shoppers dart from Armani to Prada, from Miu Miu to Dolce & Gabbana. If you need a break after your splurge, the Giardini Pubblici park is just next door.








Quadrilatero d’Oro

Quadrilatero d’Oro, the Golden Rectangle, is the essence of Milan distilled into a small cluster of streets. This epicenter of haute couture is full of high-class boutiques selling pieces fresh off the catwalk. In fact, the fashionista vibe isn’t confined to the inside of the shops here. Walk down any of the streets in this area and you could be forgiven for thinking you’d stumbled into a fashion shoot for a glossy magazine. Yes, people really do dress like that!








Brera District

Milan is known for its statement, cutting-edge fashion, but Brera mixes things up. In addition to your haute couture staples, this Bohemian artisans’ district has independent workshops and cute little stores that ooze handmade charm – providing a welcome contrast to the catwalk pizzazz that abounds elsewhere.








La Rinascente

La Rinascente is the queen of Italy’s department stores. Spanning 8 floors, this is a place for stylish shopaholics to get lost in. From clothes to glassware, this building is packed full of fine goods that could suit any home or wardrobe. Footwear fanatics should head to the third floor, where an 800-square-foot space dedicated just to shoes awaits.








Milan Fashion Week

Milan Fashion Week is what much of the city lives for. This sensational event takes place twice a year, in January/February and again in September/October. With a packed schedule of dazzling fashion shows, it’s a chance for designers to show off their upcoming collections, and for patrons to “ooh” and “ah” at the hottest trends of the moment. If you’re into fashion, you can’t miss it.








Corso Buenos Aires

This shopping street offers an antidote to the flash-bulbs and haute couture of Via Montenapoleone. You’ll find chain stores and mid-range wardrobe fillers – names like H&M;, United Colours of Benetton, Zara and Foot Locker reside here. On a shopping trip to Milan, your wallet will thank you for a stop-off at Corso Buenos Aires.








Via Manzoni

The northwest quarter of Milan’s fashion district has it all, from ready-to-wear threads to runway-chic garments. Via Manzoni is practically Armani HQ, with a clothing superstore and Armani Casa, a specialist homeware store. So, you can deck yourself and your humble abode with the sleekest designs around.








Via Sant'Andrea

A bona fide who’s who of world-class design, Via Sant'Andrea draws a mob of shoppers seeking the latest fashion accessories as soon as they’re released. The street’s star-studded roll call boasts Michael Kors, Chanel, Hermès, Prada, and Versace among its patrons, so you’ll be looking fabulous in no time.








Corso di Porta Ticinese

Milan’s not all about high-end fashion, pouting models and shiny brands. Corso di Porta Ticinese proves it. This street caters to the alternative shopper, with a host of vintage boutiques, skate shops, tattoo parlors and record stores. If the flashy fashionista scene isn’t for you, go for a walk down this street.








Duomo di Milano

Sometimes you have to take your time to get things done just right – this gigantic cathedral is a perfect example. Started originally in 1386, it spent nearly six centuries as a work in progress until completion as recently as 1965. The result is a breathtaking jumble of architectural styles – as unique as it is enormous. From the outside, countless spires and pinnacles jut skywards, while the interior is overwhelmed with columns, arches, and paintings.








Corso Vittorio Emanuele II

Shopping at the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II isn't just an exercise in high-end spending – it's a historical one, too. Built in the mid to late 19th century, this covered shopping center offers Prada and Louis Vuitton for some seriously swanky shopping. A few purchases will make you as well-dressed as anyone in Milan, but the fact you get to shop in such luxurious surroundings will really make you feel like a fashionista.

With only €4.5 you have a 24-h access ticket to all public transports which is quite good for vising almost everywhere. Don’t feed the pigeons or they will get multiplied by hundreds and keep following you!

How can you enjoy the sights in Milan while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


Try to head out very early if you want to see the sights (Italians don't really get up until 11!) and late in the evening if you want to shop with a little more peace. Honestly, Milan is really only for shoppers, all other Italian towns are better for sightseeing and culture :)

Milan Malpensa Airport

Air – Linate Airport



Linate is Milan's second major airport and is approximately 5 miles from the center of the city. The quickest way to the city is on the Air Bus, which takes approximately 25 minutes (from 6:30 am to 11:30 pm, 7 days a week). An even cheaper option is the Urban Line #73 bus to Piazza San Babila (from 6 am to 1:07 am, departing every 10 minutes, 7 days a week). Taxis are always available outside the arrivals hall; they take 15-20 minutes and cost around 25 EUR.




Milan Linate Airport
www.milanolinate-airport.com











Train



Milan's main train station, "Stazione Centrale," is considered one of Europe's most beautiful and connects Milan with domestic and international locations. If you're arriving from an airport, connections can easily be made to metro and bus services. Given Milan's compact size, trains are not ideal for travel within the city. If you'd like to take a day trip, buy a special return day-trip ticket to the lake regions of Lago Maggiore and Lago di Como.










Bus



Most parts of Milan can be reached by bus. Buy tickets at machines, ATM point service centers and newsstands inside most stations. Make sure you validate your ticket as you get on board. When you want to get off, press the button before getting to your stop to alert the driver. Bus 94 circles the center and includes many tourist sites. Night buses are also available from 2 am to 6 am on Fridays and Saturdays.




ATM
www.atm.it











Taxi



While convenient, Milan's taxis are not very affordable. The efficient public transportation is usually faster and cheaper. If you do need a taxi, they're available at all main train stations, or just by hailing one from the street. There's a fixed minimum price plus charges for time and distance traveled. There are also fees for travel late at night, on Sundays and public holidays. Reservations are also possible.




Radiotaxi
www.028585.it











Metro



Milan's efficient metro system is the fastest and most convenient way to get around the city. Look for the red and white "M" lampposts. Purchase tickets at machines inside stations, newsstands and tobacco shops – choose one-day, 24-hour, weekly or monthly tickets. The Metro usually runs from 6 am to 1 am, with some variation depending on the line. Clear maps are displayed at stations or available online.




ATM

Bike



City bikes are an easy way to see this compact city – look for the yellow and white bicycles at stands throughout the city. Buy a temporary subscription (daily or weekly) on the BikeMi website, or tickets from machines and ATM point service centers. There are separate bike lanes in most parts of Milan. For the adventurous, gather in Piazza Mercanti to bike the city with hundreds of cyclists.
