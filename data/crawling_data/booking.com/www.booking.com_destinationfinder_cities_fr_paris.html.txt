Things to Do in Paris









The Pompidou Centre (National Museum of Modern Art)

This space-age building is definitely a pomp-a-do, not a pomp-a-don't. Former French President, Georges Pompidou, had this controversial building built in the 1960s. Love it or hate it, it's France's premier modern art gallery. Dali, Munch, Lucian Freud and Roy Lichtenstein have all adorned the walls (and spaces) in the past five years alone.



Centre Pompidou, Place Georges-Pompidou, 75004 Paris




Open Monday 11 am – 9 pm; closed Tuesdays









Notre Dame de Paris

Victor Hugo's Quasimodo might not be lurking in the shadows, but that doesn't mean you can't! Explore every nook of this enormous cathedral, including the 13th-century organ. Head up the north tower to fully appreciate the impressive masonry, or admire it from outside – the stone gargoyles look like they're about to swoop down and grab your sandwich, so watch out!



6 Parvis Notre-Dame, Place Jean-Paul II, 75004 Paris




Open weekdays 8 am – 6:45 pm, weekends 8 am – 7:15 pm









Louvre (Musée du Louvre)

During World War II, the Louvre’s treasures were hidden in remote corners of France. Most of the work has been faithfully returned, so you can gaze into Mona Lisa’s eyes through bulletproof glass, salute the mysterious Venus de Milo or bask in the preternatural glow of the Marie de Medici cycle. Fun fact: it would take you 100 days to visit every work of art for 30 seconds.



Musée du Louvre, 75058 Paris




Open Monday 9 am – 6 pm, Wednesday 9 am – 9:45 pm, Thursday 9 am – 6 pm, Friday 9 am – 9:45 pm, weekends 9 am – 6 pm









Musée d'Orsay

In the halcyon days of the early 19th century, the Impressionists painted moments of beauty that were forever frozen in time. Get swept away by the romantic beauty of Impressionism at this museum, one of the world’s greatest odes to modern art. Van Gogh's "Starry Night Over the Rhone" is part of the dazzling collection on display in this former train station.



1 Rue de la Légion d'Honneur, 75007 Paris




Open Tuesday to Sunday 9:30 am – 6 pm, Thursdays until 9:45 pm









Palais Garnier Opera House

"Of all the noises known to man, opera is the most expensive," quipped Molière. In this case, it's the lavish interior of the theater itself that cost a pretty penny. On a quiet day, you can almost hear Christine and Erik running through Garnier’s secret passageways – the theater was the legendary inspiration for “Phantom of the Opera.”



8 Rue Scribe, 75009 Paris




Check website for details









Galeries Lafayette

With a bit of work and some basic sewing skills, a small shard of fabric can one day become a quilt. In 1893, two cousins expanded their small tailor shop into what is today Europe's largest department store. The fashion collections here span three buildings and over 750,000 square feet of retail space, enough to justify a guided tour or a personal shopper for a fashion splurge.



40 Boulevard Haussmann, 75009 Paris




Open Monday to Wednesday 9:30 am – 8 pm, Thursday 9:30 am – 9 pm, Friday and Saturday 9:30 am – 8 pm.









Grand Palais

As any event manager knows, any exhibition is immediately enhanced by placing a 775,000-square-foot metal structure above it. This was the idea in turn-of-the-century Paris, when the Grand Palais was constructed for the Universal Exhibition in 1900, a kind of world fair for European capitals. Every year, 2 million visitors stroll through more than 40 huge events.



Avenue du Général Eisenhower 3, 75008 Paris




Open Monday 10 am – 8 pm, Wednesday to Sunday 10 am – 8 pm









Sacré-Cœur Basilica

Ascend Montmartre’s stairway to heaven. Built between 1875 and 1914 on the "Hill of Martyrs," this church survived two world wars without a scratch. Step inside to view the bright ceiling mosaic of Jesus Christ, or ascend the stairs to the dome. The hilltop views of Paris are popular with starry-eyed romantics and baguette-loving tourists alike.



35 Rue du Chevalier de la Barre




Open every day 6 am – 10:30 pm









Champs-Élysées

Some hunt the wilds of Africa for the "Big 5," others use their credit card. If you’re game, buy jewelry fit for a king at Bvlgari, Cartier, Swarovski, Louis Pion and Tissot (or more moderately priced fashion) on this exclusive shopping street. Once the shopping buzz wears off, spoil your appetite with Ladurée’s delicious macaroons, with flavors that would make Marie-Antoinette blush.



Avenue des Champs Elysées




Open every day









Eiffel Tower

Some say tower, others say upside-down ice-cream cone: there’s no denying the fact that the Eiffel Tower is one of the world’s most iconic buildings. Built for the 1889 World Fair, this iron-framed structure was the world's tallest until the 1930s. Brave the lines to enjoy windswept views of Paris, or a (costly) meal at the Jules Verne Restaurant.



Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris




Open every day 9:30 am – 11 pm









Journey to the Temple of Love

To get to the Temple of Love, rent a pretty little rowboat and swish your way gracefully—or not so gracefully—across the waters of Lac Daumesnil. Dock your boat and explore the romantic Rococo-style structure and gorgeous, leaf-shrouded grotto beneath. Perfect for hazy summer afternoons, you’ll get bonus points from your partner for packing a deliciously Parisian picnic!








Cruise on the Seine

Gliding serenely along the Seine as Paris' shining lights sparkle on the water, it’s easy to understand why the city has a reputation for romance. Hold hands across a candlelit table as you sip a glass of wine and soak up the atmosphere between courses of delicious French cuisine. Even though there are so many sights to see, you’ll be forgiven if you only have eyes for each other.








Montmartre Quarter

Get lost together in the steep cobblestone streets of artsy Montmartre. Home to some of the city’s most famous free-thinkers and creatives, this quirky quarter has sweet brasseries and awe-inspiring views out over Paris. The best and easiest way to explore is to wind your way to the top, disappearing down side streets as you head back up to the Sacré Coeur.








Pont des Arts

Paris’ famous "Love Lock Bridge" is now lockless after 45 tons of true love left its structure almost buckling under the pressure. Visitors hoping to toss the keys to their heart into the Seine will be disappointed to discover that plexiglass panels have now been fitted to the railings. Linking the Institut de France and Palais du Louvre, but the bridge is still a beautiful stretch to stroll along on your trip.








Jardins du Trocadéro

In these lush green gardens, fountains burst high into the air as couples lounge lazily on the grass. With the Eiffel Tower on the opposite bank, it’s the perfect place to take some cute snapshots together. Head there after dark to share a romantic kiss as the tower’s lights twinkle magically in the background.








Lapérouse Restaurant

The historic Lapérouse restaurant has dark, candlelit corners and gorgeous private rooms for a romantic evening of indulgence. Its luxurious decor tells a tale of old Paris with silver candelabras, elaborately painted panels and sumptuous red-velvet seating. Literary greats loved the place, including Victor Hugo and Émile Zola, and now it's just as popular with today’s rich and famous.








Arc de Triomphe

Standing proud at the end of the Champs-Élysées, this instantly recognizable arch honors those who died in WWII. Every evening at 6:30 pm, a flame is relit to keep the memorial alive. Scale 40 steps to reach the top and you'll be rewarded with views over the City of Lights.








Champs-Elysees

Give your feet and your credit card a workout as you make your way down this 1-mile stretch of boulevard, boutiques and bistros. Bulgari, Swarovski and Cartier’s jewels dazzle both window-shoppers and serious shoppers. Head north to sip on a cafe au lait in the shadow of the Arc de Triomphe, or make your way south towards the historic and grand Place de la Concorde.








Sacre-Coeur & Montmartre District

Wind through the cobblestone streets of Montmartre, where Moulin Rouge and Amelie are brought to life. The real pièce de résistance of the area has to be the Sacre Coeur Basilica – with spires looming over this unique district and the rest of Paris beyond. The views from the dome make the 300-step climb more than worth it.








Jardin du Luxembourg

A little bit of Luxembourg in the heart of France. Parisians love to come and visit this patch of orchard-lined lawns. Kids set miniature sailboats out to float on the Grand Bassin pond, while wanderers meander past the Palais du Luxembourg. The gardens have seen historic figures come and go, starting life as a royal residence before transforming into a senate and library.








The City Island (L'ile de la Cité)

Home to a Paris icon, Notre-Dame Cathedral, this island-within-the-city sits quietly and serenely on the River Seine. Connected to the city by the Pont Neuf bridge, after you're done gargoyle-spotting, head to the Palais de la Justice and the old Concergerie, where Marie-Antoinette was held captive.








Notre Dame

Nooks and crannies galore, Paris’ most beloved cathedral sits in all its Gothic splendor on the Île de la Cité. The North Tower is adorned with intricate masonry which you can observe up close by heading up the tower, or just admire from the ground. The 13th-century organ found inside is so ginormous, it has to be one of the most famous in the world.








Latin Quarter

This bohemian quarter is thriving with the lively community of students from around La Sorbonne, which is right at the heart of this neighborhood. Cafes and bars line the cute corners and are nestled down side streets off the busy squares. Galleries, independent cinemas, and cultural hubs are all around this eclectic area.








The Louvre Museum & Area

Away from the adoring crowds that gather in front of the glass-encased and untouchable vision of the Mona Lisa, the Louvre is a rich treasure trove of artistic gems. Corridors run above and below ground for such a distance that it would take you over 100 years to spend just 30 seconds in front of every masterpiece here.








Montmartre District

In the exciting days of the late 19th century, Montmartre was the bohemian heart of Paris. Artists like Toulouse-Lautrec were drawn to and inspired by its liberal nightlife. Today, you can still catch a cancan at the famous Moulin Rouge cabaret. Or if you're looking for more artsy vibes, watch the portrait artists on the cobblestone Place du Tertre and browse Saint-Pierre Market's fabric stalls.

It is unfair for me to properly review a city that I only had twelve hours to enjoy...some of which was spent sleeping.That being said...I loved the motorcycle ride to my hotel. The hotel was wonderful...and the meal at Le Richer was amazing...beyond description.

Which fine art museums should a first-time visitor to Paris start with?





Anonymous


The Louvre is way too large for one visit. At the Louvre I choose only the period I am interested in, like Middle Ages, and only spend about 3 hrs at a time - afterwards I do something else.  I recommend the Musee D'Orsay if you love impressionisms and fine sculptures and the Musee de LÓrangerie is a most if you like Monet.  The museum of the Middle Ages (Cluny) is a most if you are interested in that period. Make time to just walk around, it is a beautiful city. Shopping is too expensive, but I found some lovely items while walking around while nothing affordable at the main shopping malls and streets.

What's the best way to make the most of Paris by foot?





Anonymous


We walked everywhere, only using the metro to get to and from our hotel with luggage. Just wander and let yourself literally get lost, particularly in the little streets of Montmartre, the Latin Quarter and Saint Germain. You could have a small map on you just in case but you'll hardly need it, as there are so many landmarks to help you work out where you are and which direction to go in. Mornings are the quietest time in my experience to just walk around.

How can you enjoy the sights in Paris while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


Fodor's travel guide for France said to get to Versailles by 9am to avoid crowds. I think most people have heard that advice and there was a huge line at 9:15! I recommend going a bit later to avoid that first crush. Go to the Louvre on Wednesday or Friday mid afternoon.  The Louvre is open until 9:30pm those two days. The crowds significantly diminish by 5pm.

We took my granddaughter to Paris for her first time.  We took her mainly to the normal tourist attractions and felt it was a good experience for her.  In the future we will take her to more mountain areas, but this time we just wanted her to experience Paris.  Her favorite area was Montmartre due to all of the small shops.  She also loved the parks.

There is no "central station" as such, but Gare du Nord to the north of Paris has many connections to the airports, RER lines (a high-speed suburban rail), Metro lines 4 and 5, and Eurostar and Thalys trains to international cities. Gare Montparnasse in the south of Paris and Gare de Lyon in the east have high-speed national train services to west, south and east of France.

Metro



The Paris Metro is the fastest and most reliable way to move around – once you get the hang of it. Services run from 5:30 am – 1:30 am Sunday to Thursday (until 2:15 am on Fridays, Saturdays and the day before public holidays). One-way tickets cost approximately EUR 1.70, ask for a "carnet" of 10 for 13.70, or pay EUR 6.80 for a one-day ticket, which includes unlimited travel in central Paris (zones 1 and 2). Tickets are available at multilingual machines in the station. Watch out for pickpockets!

Bus



Although there are many bus routes, traffic jams often make journeys slow. Where possible, stick to the Metro. If you do travel by bus, there are 64 routes that run between 5:45 am and 12:30 am weekdays and from 7 am – 8:30 pm Sundays. The 73 route goes up the Champs-Elysées and past the Arc de Triomphe, and the 69 goes past the Eiffel Tower. Tickets are available on board and cost around EUR 2 for a single journey, but it’s best to buy a "carnet" of 10 at the nearest Metro station.




RATP (bus information)

Taxi



Taxis are readily available in central Paris – just hail one on the street or stop at one of the many taxi stands, usually located near the Metro stations. Taxis are reasonably priced by European standards and a ten-minute ride in moderate city traffic will cost around EUR 15. There's usually a minimum charge of EUR 6.40. Some drivers may sometimes ask where you’re traveling to before you get in, even though it's technically forbidden.

Car



Driving in Paris is not for the faint of heart. Traffic congestion is a continuous problem, especially between 8 – 11 am and 5 – 8 pm. Finding on-street parking (free after 7 pm) is difficult and you must have a "carte de stationnement" for pay-and-display machines (available at tabacs for EUR 15 or EUR 40). Road conditions are good and the highways easily connect you to other French and international cities.




Rental Cars

Bike



One of the most pleasant ways to see the City of Lights is with pedal power. Pick up a bike from one of hundreds of "Velib"-branded stations throughout the city – most are within 300 yards of each other in the most populated parts of the city. You don’t need to subscribe – just bring a credit card, buy a ticket from the meter and you’re ready to go. Journeys of less than 30 minutes are free; anything longer then tickets cost around EUR 1.70 per day, and EUR 8.00 for seven days.
