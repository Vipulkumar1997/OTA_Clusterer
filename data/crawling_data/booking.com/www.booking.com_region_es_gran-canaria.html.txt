Gran Canaria Highlights









Maspalomas Dunes

The proximity to the African continent is palpable in this spectacular dune complex in the south of Gran Canaria.








Las Canteras beach and beachfront promenade

This long sandy beach, popular among locals and tourists alike, offers plenty of dining and entertainment options along the promenade.








Cave restaurants in Barranco de Guayadeque

Tucked inside the caves of the Guayadeque Canyon, a number of traditional Canarian restaurants offer curious specialities like 'wrinkly potatoes'.








Vegueta neighbourhood

Stroll down the historic centre of Las Palmas, discovering its colourful façades, charming squares, and hidden courtyards of historic buildings.








Güigüi Beach

Savour the silence of this secluded beach, accessible only by taxi boat or a two-hour hike from the main road.








Cueva Pintada Archaeological Site

These painted caves tell the tale of the indigenous islanders, who inhabited Gran Canaria long before the Spanish conquistadors arrived.








Trekking in the Tejeda Region

The routes through this area allow you to explore deep canyons, volcanic craters, and rocky mountains, offering splendid views along the way.








Golfing

The majority of Gran Canaria’s world-renowned golf courses are nestled along the southern coast of the island.








Bufadero de la Garita

When the sea is feeling playful, it treats you to this spectacular sight of water blasting skywards through the rocky shoreline.








Tamadaba pine forest

Overlooking the ocean and neighbouring Tenerife, this oasis of greenery provides an escape from Gran Canaria’s busy beach life.

Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
