Hotels That Guests Love in San Francisco




Amsterdam Hostel









“
The room was ok. They give you a towel. Coust x benefit it is the best hostel in San Francisco for sure. Well located served by public transport.
”






USA Hostels San Francisco









“
This young and modern hostel is a great opportunity in San Francisco. We enjoyed our stay, young guests, nice staff and good atmosphere. The queensize-bed-room was very clean and offered a fridge and microwave, breakfast in the basement is included. The location in the city is good, close to Bart and Cable-Cars starting point.
”






Haveli Hotel San Francisco









“
Excellent value for San Francisco. Convenient for transport around the city and to the airport. More like a hostel than a hotel but good for the price. Clean and comfortable.
”






Adelaide Hostel









“
Nice hostel in San Francisco. Closed to everywhere. Breakfast is also good.
”






Hotel Carlton, a Joie de Vivre Hotel









“
I was very excited to spend the last two days of my trip in this hotel but it sadly did not live up to expectations - considering how much I paid it felt more like a youth hostel. Only positive thing I can say was that the second night I finally slept better than the terrible experience the night before.
