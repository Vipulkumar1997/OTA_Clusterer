Budapest Travel Guide










A City of Two Halves
With a dome reminiscent of Brunelleschi’s "The Duomo" in Florence, the Hungarian parliament building is undoubtedly the icon of Budapest. It sits majestically by the Danube, the river that both divides and unifies the 2 parts of this capital city: Buda and Pest.
Overseeing Budapest from its vantage point on Castle Hill is Buda Castle. Spectacularly lit at night, it has the best views across this attractive city steeped in World Heritage. Some unique points of interest are Heroes Square and the Museum of Terror, reminders of the city’s more turbulent past.
Much like in Vienna further up the Danube, coffee and cake is practically an institution in Budapest. And there’s nowhere better to try them than Gerbeaud - the elaborate décor alone makes this café well worth a visit.
To really feel like a local, make a trip to the thermal baths. The relaxed Gellért Baths are a triumph of Art Nouveau grandeur and, based on their sheer size, you can't miss the outdoor Széchenyi Baths. If unusual nightlife is your thing, the club nights at these baths are great fun.
With an impressive range of Budapest hotels, apartments and hostels available in this city of 2 halves, Booking.com makes it an easy choice.

Budapest leaves me a very good impression: a good...

Budapest leaves me a very good impression: a good combination of traditional and mordern elements, beautiful views of Danube river and the Gallert hill, hard-working people, splendid parliament and royal palace.I like the fisherman’s bastion, museum of history and Gallert hill most. When I visit the fisherman’s bastion, it snowed suddenly, the white snow just matches the white building, forming an amazing picture. The Gallert hill gives a bird’s view of the whole city, really attractive.Since the attractions are relatively concentrated, basically arround the Chain Bridge and the Elisabeth Bridge, it’s easy to get to most of the spots in one day.Taking a boat tour on the Danube river at night is a so pleasant experience for me. The only regret is that I do not have time to enjoy the famous Budapest thermal bath .

The city offers so much to do and explore.

The city offers so much to do and explore.  Price are very reasonable compared to other European capitals.  The Budapest card is an excellent value because you have unlimited use of public transportation which is very convenient.  I have visited three different thermal bath houses in Budapest now, and the one thing they all have in common is that they are very confusing to get around and to understand the process for each one.  All were great experiences, but you must be willing to go with the flow and temporarily be that tourist who obviously doesn't know what he's doing.  The food and service in Budapest is great and affordable as long as you don't eat on a major tourist thoroughfare (Vaci Ut, for example).  If you have time to make it out to Memento Park, it is very interesting and worth the trip.

Generally a little shady in the centrum where it is badly lit n no sense security. Service ppl in restaurants n supermarkets were rude and rough. Not sure if its because we are Asians. Random drunk came up to our family and shouted at us in Hungarian b4 being shooed away by a restaurants waitress.

Compared to other cities, the Hop On/Hop Off bus tours...

Compared to other cities, the Hop On/Hop Off bus tours were very disappointing.  The busses were very dirty and really worn out.  The suspension was terrible and you felt like you were being tossed around in your seat.  They were never on time and just poorly operated.  They’re going to lose out to the other tour bus companies if they don’t replace the fleet.  I will not recommend them to friends going to Budapest.  No fault of the city but it seemed like everyone was smoking everywhere we went.  Surprising.  Cigarette butts were everywhere and made the city look dirty.

Don't use public toilets!

Don't use public toilets! They can be nightmarish. Don't change money at the railway station as you'll be conned. ATMs are everywhere so use those instead. Definitely do the Danube boat tour from dock 8a, get the sunset one and have champagne, it's magical. Do the funicular and Budapest castle too. Rosé restaurant was beautiful and did the best strawberry daiquiri ever. Christmas markets are great but be wary of people in costumes, you don't know what you're getting into! It's very easy to get around but note that there are a lot of homeless people around the metro, expect to see them if you're passing through.








Hotels That Guests Love in Budapest





The Hive Party Hostel Budapest









“
It is located near Deák Ferenc square which has good transportation connections to Budapest and its surroundings. Within the building and very near to the hotel are clubs and joints for hanging out. 
Within walking distance, there are supermarkets, restaurants, coffee shops, cheap eats and a park. The Jewish Quarter is nearby as well. 
The room and sheets are clean. There is housekeeping every day. 
The ladies at the reception are very helpful as well. Ask them any question, they will lend you their assistance.

It has a Mystic feeling of ancient Budapest for sure. And this is how you should look at this hotel, but I wouldn't give it 4*. 3* and definitely not more.

“
i  have stayed at  this  hotel  many  times, it  is close to  the  metro line  into  the  city  also  the bus  station to travel  on  the  200E  bus to  the  airport.  I  would  recommend  this  hotel to anybody  travelling  to  Budapest.
”






Villa Hotel Kristal









“
The hotel is at a convenient location- 7 min walk to Budapest Congress center. 5 min walk to 4 bus lines that go across bridges to Pest side. The hotel is also 20 mins walk to the Buda castle. Hotel staff are extremely helpful and friendly, and communicate well in English with international guests. I highly recommend this hotel to business travelers attending conference in Budapest.
