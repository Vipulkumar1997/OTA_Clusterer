Shichahai Shadow Art Performance Hotel

“Cute boutique style hotel based in a hutong. Reviews were accurate about the location - limited street lighting and tight alleys when arriving by taxi!

It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
