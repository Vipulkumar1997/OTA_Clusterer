Nottingham Travel Guide










Legendary City of Robin Hood
Famous for its association with Robin Hood, Nottingham is in the very heart of England. The outlaw’s legend lives on, with many city streets and buildings named after him and his Merry Men. A Robin Hood statue sits at the foot of Nottingham Castle, on a small hill with historic pubs built into it. Also cut into the rock are visitable caves extending under the city.
The Old Market Square is the largest in the UK and becomes a city beach in the summer, with rides and a small pool. Permanent fixtures are the impressive Council House with its Exchange Arcade shops, and the several Nottingham hotels with parking in the surrounding area.
During the 19th century, Nottingham was an important lace-making center and many Victorian warehouses and buildings remain in the Lace Market area. Neighboring Hockley is home to the National Ice Center and independent shops, while the biggest shopping centers are Broadmarsh and the Victoria Center.
In the western suburbs, by Nottingham University, Wollaton Park surrounds an Elizabethan stately home, while east of Trent Bridge cricket ground is the National Water Sports Center in Holme Pierrepont. Sherwood Forest, Robin’s stomping ground, is near Mansfield, while East Midlands Airport is southwest of Long Eaton.
Wherever you decide to stay, check Booking.com for the best Nottingham hotel deals.

Nottingham has a great selection of shops and restaurants, you can barely turn a corner without bumping into a coffee shop! Has a bustling no also!  There are historic locations and beautiful buildings for those looking for a more cultural experience.Whenever we have been there has usually been something going on in the city centre.

So much to see but was only there for one  night, so off to "The Trip"  it is a must for any visitor!  If you enjoy only one attraction go to The Trip.  Play the age old game of Ring the Horn, see if you can earn your badge I did!  Enjoy!

It isn't a 'wow' city like some other British cities but once you get to know Nottingham it isn't a real gem. Great for both high street and independent shopping and Hockley is the place to be for food, pubs, bars and places like the Broadway cinema. 
The city centre has everything you need whilst being compact and manageable and the bus and tram networks are excellent.

We stayed just one day and night en route from Liverpool back to London so we could absorb the Robin Hood history and see another part of England. The restaurants and Castle were enjoyable, as were the local pubs.
