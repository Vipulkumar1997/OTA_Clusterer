Brighton & Hove Travel Guide










Colorful by Day and Night
Known for colorful nightlife and traditional English seaside pursuits, Brighton and nearby Hove are the closest beach resorts to London, making them popular end points for classic car runs from the capital. Many end at the racetrack, a few streets from Brighton Marina, Europe’s largest, housing several shops and eateries. Many Brighton guesthouses on Booking.com are also nearby.
Running along the beachfront is the world’s oldest operating electric train, ending by Brighton Pier. Lit up at night and also known as Palace Pier, this city icon houses amusements and rides, and is one place to pick up some famous Brighton Rock, the confectionery sharing its name with an edgy Graham Greene novel set here.
A new addition, the Brighton Wheel is right by the pier, while one of its most famous attractions is the Royal Pavilion, a former royal retreat built in Indian style.
Just west are 2 of the most popular Brighton shopping spots – Churchill Square shopping center and The Lanes with its narrow streets and unusual shops. This area also has several Brighton hotels with parking, and the Artists Quarter, a series of ex-fishing huts that are now galleries. Arts + culture are big in Brighton, and Brighton Festival is the UK’s 2nd largest arts festival, while Brighton Pride is also a big event on the annual calendar.

Such variety from the old lanes and restaurants to the modern 360i sky view. There is so much to see and do. The council really need to sort out having to walk through the car park when walking from the pier to the harbour restaurants

Great interior shops and as vegans we were spoilt for dining choices: Terre a Terre and Purezza were our favourites. Brighton Museum is well worth a visit; small but really thought provoking exhibits.

The famous lanes for shopping,was a maze of small alleys with hundreds of jewelry stores. I love jewelry but this was just too much. We did eat at an italian restaurant in the lanes, Donatello which served the most delicious tortellini funghi i have ever had. I am from Chicago where we pride ourselves on italian food so i know my pasta!!  Overall one of the best meals my mother and i had while in england!

A bohemian seaside city with lots of hidden gems - restaurants,  bars and great shops in Kemp town, the Lanes and the North Laine. Had a fantastic meal at Bus Stop in the North Laines and enjoyed a fun play at the Old Market in Hove.

Loved being by the Sea.

Loved being by the Sea. Seemed to be plenty of buses but walking was an option as our accommodation was central. Lots of shops and seaside stalls. Do not take car if possible. Parking is impossible and very expensive. Would make me think twice about visiting again.








Hotels That Guests Love in Brighton & Hove





The Queensbury Hotel









“
This hotel was in a great location. Friendly staff and a great bed and breakfast.
”






The Imperial Hotel









“
Pleasant helpful staff. Right next to the beach.  Limted number of off-street parking spaces. Has the potential to be a great hotel if they can sort out problems caused by lack of proper maintenance.
”






The Grand Brighton









“
This is the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Staff were exceptional.We had a sea view room.The view and facilities were first class .  I desperately want to go back!
”






The Oriental - Guest House









“
We stayed 3 nights, loved the hotel and our room was gorgeous! Really cool decor with so many personal touches, sweets, aroma light, info about the surrounding area and a small bio on each member of staff . As the hotel is away from the high street it was pretty peaceful at night and close to the beach. The breakfast was delicious!! I am looking forward to returning again! Staff were so friendly, we loved it here!! Can't recommend enough! Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable!!
”






Brightonwave









“
A perfect stay at Brightonwave.  Richard and Simon were the perfect hosts.  A lovely welcome and the most comfortable room, which was clean and spacious as well.  They have clearly paid attention to detail as every aspect of the accommodation was excellent.  The full English breakfast was one of the best I've had.  Nicely, the room was very quiet even though it is situated in a lively part of town.  Indeed the location near the bars, beach and pier could not have been better.  I hope to return soon.  Very highly recommended!!
