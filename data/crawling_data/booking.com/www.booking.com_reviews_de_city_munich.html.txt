“Quite OK quality for price and location.”








ibis Styles München Ost - Messe


Review Score: 8.4




“We stayed at the property with our 2 Kids - 4 years and 1 year old in the Family room which was cleverley cut and the 4 year old loved is high bed... After they fell asleep we could enjoy the living part to watch tv and work.For breakfast our Kids got a Snack box which gave them an extra smile for the day.”








Motel One München City Süd


Review Score: 8.8




“Second stay at this hotel and it was as good as the first time. Maybe even better. Had a room on the 12th floor with great views over snowy Munich, absolutely quiet, clean and comfy. Quite a big flat screen TV. Wifi was free and fast. Staff was very nice and friendly, had a late check-in after 11 p.m. and was greeted in a very welcoming way.
Breakfast is worth the € 10, with a huge choice of organic food and excellent coffee. 
Next underground is only 5 min away and takes around 10 min to central station. Love this hotel and will be back again. ”

Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
