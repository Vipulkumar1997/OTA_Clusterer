Tokyo Travel Guide










See It to Believe It!
The capital of Japan, Tokyo is a vast, teeming metropolis nestled between mountains and Tokyo Bay. It’s so huge that you’ll have to come to grips with public transport and maybe even experience being pushed onto a train. Yes, it does actually happen!
Get your bearings by ascending the Tokyo World Trade Center near the waterfront, and savor the fantastic views taking in the red-and-white Tokyo Tower and Shinkuju’s skyscrapers. North is Ueno, home to the best museums (including the Tokyo National Museum) and a large park bursting with cherry blossom in spring.
Equally tranquil are the Chiyoda Imperial Palace and Gardens, surrounded by water. Also in gardens is the Meiji Jingu Shinto shrine in Shibuya, a youthful district where neon abounds.
For more traditional Japanese culture, head to Asakusa whose Sensō-ji Buddhist temple is Tokyo’s oldest temple. Outdoor markets sell a variety of wares, though shopping in Tokyo is, of course, fantastic wherever you go.
Whether you stay in a Japanese ryokan, luxury Tokyo hotel or a hostel, don’t fly out of Tokyo Narita Airport or Haneda Airport without having tried sushi. Another Japanese institution is the sento (public bath) and onsen (hot springs bath) – a must try. Also incredibly popular are Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, Asia’s 2 most visited theme parks.

What Guests Said About Tokyo:





Sandra K

United States of America

Tokyo Station is daunting.

Tokyo Station is daunting...several floors with many different train lines.  Fortunately, people were helpful. We stayed next to Tokyo Station thinking it would be easier...I would pick a different station!  People were friendly, autumn leaves added extra beauty to Imperial Palace East Gardens (worth visiting).  Tokyo has everything:  traditional, modern, serene, frenzied!

Foodies paradise.

Foodies paradise. First stop should be the local bakery. Make sure to pick up a Suica or Pasco pass which will allow you to swipe and go instead of dealing with cash and tickets (for train fare). Food ranges from gourmet to simple fare. Remember to dispose of trash in proper bins and to respect property like your mother raised you to respect others property because Japan is full of nice things that everyone has access too but is expected to not be vandalized or destroyed. (I.e. The amazing public bidet bathrooms and gardens). Walking distance to all sights you can imagine. A shoppers paradise.(check Akibahara) A musician's paradise (a quick hop to Ochanomizu) there is a bakery there to die for called pan francais A shoppers paradise. Pretty much in Japan if you wish for it, they have it. Make sure to carry as many 100¥ coins as Gatcha Gatcha machines (toy capsule) are for everyone. Don't forget to take a deep bath in the hotel to take the weary out of your traveling bones. And it doesn't hurt to brush up on some basic Japanese phrases to help you get around.

The parks and Shrines are wonderfully awesome.

The parks and Shrines are wonderfully awesome.  Food is not only Sushi, there is a lot of variety for people that does not eat raw fish.  Getting around is so easy.  I will go to Japan ten time more taking a direct flight!
Japan is a very delightful country, safe for women, clean, where people is very civilized compared to other Western countries,  dream parks specially in Autumn and Spring, you can find fun, modern atmosphere and peaceful parks, customer service is excellent everywhere!!

Hotels That Guests Love in Tokyo





Tokyu Stay Nishi Shinjuku









“
The hotel itself is located with a 10 minute walk from the JR Shinjinku station and easy to find. Reception staff were extremely helpful with arranging tickets and answered any questions we had. The room itself was excellent. As we stayed for 4 nights, the rooms were bigger compared to other places in Japan and the washer/dryer in room was extremely convenient. Second visit to Tokyo, much preferred this hotel over high end hotel in Shibuya that was double the price! Recommend highly.
”






Keikyu EX Inn Shinagawa









“
Right outside the West Exit of Shinagawa station. Great price for a good sized room in Tokyo. Shinagawa station is on the JR Yamanote Loop Line for easy access to Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ginza and Tokyo. On the Shinkansen line to Kyoto, Osaka and Fukuoka. Convenience store onsite and coin laundry on every second floor. Plenty of eating options in hotel and close by.
”






Marunouchi Hotel









“
The beds were very comfortable. Extra long for my 6'2" husband. The breakfast buffet was included and was very delicious. Staff was extremely gracious and courteous. Interior of the hotel is beautiful. Very close to Tokyo Station with an underground passage directly from hotel.
”






Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel









“
The short walk to Shibuya crossing and the Shibuya station. The hotel has a 7-Eleven store on property. The room was very nice and the view of Tokyo from our 32nd floor was amazing.
”






Sotetsu Fresa Inn Tokyo Tamachi









“
The hotel is close to Tamachi Station, on the Yamanote Line, so it's super easy to get into Shibuya or Shinjuku from there. The neighbourhood itself is quiet, but it's nice to return to that after a hectic day out. Excellent value for money considering the price of other hotels in Tokyo.
