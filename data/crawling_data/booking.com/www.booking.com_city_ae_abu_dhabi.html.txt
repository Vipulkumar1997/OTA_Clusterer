Abu Dhabi Travel Guide










A Modern Arabian Dream
As you fly into Abu Dhabi International Airport, it‚Äôs probably good to know that the vast array of streets with multiple names is best negotiated by landmarks rather than exact addresses. And you won‚Äôt be short of landmarks since this fast-growing metropolis is packed with tourist attractions.
The Sheikh Zayed Mosque is the 6th largest mosque in the world and is already open, nearing completion. Most buildings and public areas are on this grand scale, such as the 400 ft tall flagpole on Marina Island or the extensive Khalifa Park which, among other attractions, has its own train.
Along the aquamarine waters of the Persian Gulf lies the remarkable waterfront of Corniche, which offers a walkway along its entire 6 km. From here the modern Arabian skyline can be taken in and by night the scene is illuminated, creating an even more glorious spectacle.
However, shopping is really where it‚Äôs at in Abu Dhabi. Malls such as the Marina, Abu Dhabi and Al Wahda Malls provide a multitude of goods, endless boutique options and plentiful food halls. Stay at some of the finest 5-star hotels in buildings that literally scrape the sky or find a budget property in this luxury city, with over 90 places to stay to choose from on Booking.com.

I have lived in the Arabian Gulf States and find both Abu Dhabi and Dubai to be a bit sterile. There isn‚Äôt much to do besides shop, eat, and relax. There are a couple of museums. I understand that a visit to Liwa Oasis is wonderful, but I didn't get there.

Visit to sheikh zayed mosque ,Ferrari world , yas waterworld are must to do things once in abu dhabi .Go for a 2 day 2 park pass that saves the hassle of running around and missing on the rides if one tries to do everything in a day.Yas mall is good too , nice shops , good food court with almost every cuisine on board.

TRYP by Wyndham Abu Dhabi City Center









‚Äú
Perfect location central to Abu Dhabi City. Minimalistic hotel with few amenities however clean and newly refurbished hotel. I would like to mention Mary Lee highly expert receptionnist who upgraded our room to sea view and offered us the breakfast option & Amir the DM who intervened to solve the smoke smell issue. Definitely worth the money. Although hotel product is a bit lacking. Staff go miles to please the guest!
