Things to Do in Liverpool









World Museum Liverpool

This grand Victorian venue promises the Earth and delivers even more. Start your voyage of discovery in the age of the dinosaurs. Examine everything from fossilised amphibians to a full-size Megalosaurus skeleton. In the Space Gallery, view real Martian meteorites and moon rocks. For a “big bang” finish, see how our Universe began with a show at the planetarium.



William Brown Street, Liverpool, L3 8EN




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00.









Bold Street

Frankie says relax: head here the morning after the night before! This café quarter cures what “ales” you. Choose from a greasy fry-up, continental coffee or classic English “cuppa” at trendy café Leaf. Feeling refreshed? Skip up to St Luke’s bombed-out ruins for an arty afternoon. It’s an intimate venue that hosts acoustic concerts, craft fairs and an outdoor cinema.



Ropewalks Area, Liverpool, Merseyside, L1 4HR




Check website for details.









Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral

Eyesore or eye-catching? Sure, the concrete cone façade of the “Mersey Funnel” divides local opinion, but everything comes together inside. It has a circular design, which affords a 2,000-strong Catholic congregation optimal eye lines to the central altar. The crown of stained glass above it acts as a kaleidoscopic filter that bathes worshippers in warm, embracing light.



Cathedral House, Mount Pleasant, Liverpool L3 5TQ




Open Monday-Sunday 07:30-18:00.









Albert Dock

These docks were once Liverpool’s global gateway. From 1846, it stocked exotic cargo in the world’s first fireproof warehouse. Today, it’s a museum half-mile charting the city’s seafaring past. Scour the Maritime Museum for Titanic artefacts or take a contraband quiz at its “Seized!” exhibition. The Slavery Museum traces a most sordid history – and Liverpool’s part in it.



Liverpool Waterfront, Liverpool, L3 4AA




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-18:00. Check website for details.









Anglican Cathedral

Great Scott! What’s a red phone box doing inside the UK’s largest cathedral? It’s actually a nod to Giles Gilbert Scott, who designed both of these British icons. Although not a direct line to God, the neo-Gothic cathedral’s calling card is its giant bell tower. Take the two lifts and 108 stairs for a little slice of heaven: unrivalled panoramic views of Liverpool.



St James’ Mount, Liverpool, L1 7AZ




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00–17:00.









Museum of Liverpool

Scousers love a good story. Learn more about theirs via this treasure trove of urban artefacts. Meander down the spiral staircase to explore the city’s socio-cultural history: from the 19th-century mercantile boom to the birth of Beatlemania. Nail your colours to the mast – Red or Blue – after watching a film about football rivals, Liverpool FC and Everton FC.



Pier Head,  Liverpool, L3 1DG




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00–17:00.









Beatles Story

Buy a ticket to ride on the Fab Four’s journey from mop-tops to rock gurus. Relive their sweaty first gig in the mock Cavern Club. Imagine a day in the life of John and Paul at work in Abbey Road.

Calling all Beatles fans! Whether you’re visiting the Beatles Story museum or just passing through, it’s hard to resist shopping for souvenirs at the Fab4 Store. This gift shop is packed with authentic Beatles goodies and collectibles, from limited-edition vinyls and rare Yellow Submarine merchandise, to exclusive magnets, mugs and T-shirts.








Peter's Lane

Peter’s Lane is a brand-name beacon in the Liverpool One shopping area. Its streets and squares are lined with designer fashion brands and trendy coffee shops, with the Keys Court shopping pavilion connecting cutting edge Peter’s Lane and Church Street – Liverpool’s traditional retail center.








South John Street

Framed by flagship department stores, South John Street is the pulsing heart of the Liverpool One complex. Two floors of the biggest brand names are accompanied by an array of international restaurants, along with an indoor mini-golf course and Liverpool’s largest movie theater.








Paradise Street

Paradise by name and paradise by nature – this centrally located street is a shopaholic’s Shangri-la. A Liverpool One essential, Paradise Street is a sweeping pedestrianized avenue flanked by flagship fashion, sportswear and shoe stores. Big-name brands to look out for include Superdry, Urban Outfitters and H&M.;








Hanover Street

Hanover Street’s restored buildings blend brand names with independent retailers. A highlight is Gostins Arcade, an alternative shopping center stuffed with second-hand stores and quirky boutiques run by local designers. Inside, you can pick up vintage clothes and handmade accessories, browse used books and records or dig into homemade cake and coffee.








Liverpool Fashion Week

Move over Milan, New York and London – Liverpool is where it's at for style. With a "fashion for all" philosophy, Liverpool Fashion Week’s five nights of catwalk shows flaunt the latest trends from labels both local and national. Its glitzy exhibitions let fashionistas mingle with designers and pick up unique pieces direct from their collections.








Metquarter

Fussy fashionistas will find everything their hearts desire in this upscale downtown mall – a firm favorite with Liverpool FC players and local celebrities. Designer stores including Armani, DKNY and Mac are interspersed with high-end gift shops and fresh floral displays, while Metquarter’s trendy cafés are just the spot for a stylish mid-shopping snack.








Liverpool ONE

Anchored at each end by flagship department stores, Liverpool ONE is the pulsing heart of the city’s retail scene. This open-air shopping complex spans several streets, with two floors of the biggest high-street and designer names accompanied by an impresive array of international restaurants, an indoor mini-golf course and Liverpool’s largest movie theater.








Cavern Quarter

Liverpool and The Beatles go hand in hand, and nowhere more so than in the Cavern Quarter. This centrally located district is focused on Mathew Street and the eponymous nightclub where the Fab Four made their name. Fans can pick up souvenirs in The Beatles Shop, while fashionistas can find luxury labels in the Cavern Walks boutique shopping center.








Church Street

Liverpool ONE may get all the attention, but Church Street is still at the heart of the city’s shopping scene. Liverpudlians flock to this central avenue to stock up on everything from clothing and shoes to makeup and accessories. Flagship fashion brands found there include Top Shop, Primark and Forever 21.








Lark Lane

Situated near Sefton Park, south of downtown, this leafy street is Liverpool’s bohemian hub. Lark Lane’s Victorian buildings are filled with quirky boutiques, antique stores and fashionable cafés. Meanwhile, a monthly farmers’ market lets you pick up the best local produce fresh from the source.








Lord Street

This short thoroughfare is the meeting point of Liverpool’s major shopping districts. Lined with high-end shops and cafés, Lord Street neatly separates the vast Liverpool ONE complex from the trendy Cavern Quarter and the city’s most famous retail address, Church Street.








Cheshire Oaks

If shopping’s the only thing on your mind, this out-of-town outlet village should do the trick. Easily accessible from Liverpool, Cheshire Oaks is a label-lover’s paradise. Designer brands, including Ralph Lauren, Ted Baker and Gucci, are available at slashed prices, and the normal-brand street retailers and bustling restaurant chains complete the picture.








Concert Square

Whether you're looking for a shisha pipe in trendy Modo, soccer and a beer in McCooley’s, or a proper rave at The Krazyhouse – Concert Square has something for everyone. And if your head’s throbbing the morning after, you can sip an espresso at Soho Bar’s sun-kissed terrace.








Wood Street

Pick your poison – fruity tequila, Scottish craft beer, or cocktails in Moroccan medina-style surroundings. Whatever you choose, Wood Street has you covered. Its bars overflow with happy-go-lucky partyers every night of the week. To hang out with the cool kids, head to Bar Ca Va, BrewDog, or the Camel Club.








Stanley Street Quarter

This rainbow-flagged section of streets proudly welcomes visitors to Liverpool’s LGBT quarter. The area becomes the center of the city’s Pride festival every summer, but its party vibe continues all year round. Go to Superstar Boudoir for drag acts, disco tunes, and delicious cocktails.








Saint Peter's Square and Seel Street

If you’re looking for bar-hopping heaven, locals swear by Seel Street. Check out the Shipping Forecast to chow down on gourmet burgers and sip international craft beers. Then dance all night at Alma de Cuba’s church-turned-Carnival club – its Sunday brunch with live gospel choir will soothe any sore heads.








Shooters Sports Bar

Spicy chicken wings, ice-cold beer, and live soccer on TV – that’s the life! At Shooters you can have it all. This bar is perfect for getting together, whether you’re looking for a good-value dinner or just want to watch your team’s greatest triumphs with some good company. You can even catch a game of pool. Rack ’em up!








The Boot Room Sports Cafe

Under Liverpool FC’s legendary Kop stand, the Boot Room sports cafe is the closest you’ll get to Anfield stadium without a game ticket. It’s decked out in memorabilia celebrating the club’s biggest triumphs and widescreen TVs showing their greatest games. Throw in a family-friendly menu, so fans of all ages will enjoy spending time here.








Goodison Park

Are you a true Blue? This legendary soccer stadium has been the home of Everton FC since 1892. In that time, faithful Goodison fans have seen it all: trophy-filled glory days, great escapes from relegation, and giant wins in the cup. Even if you’re neutral, join the passionate sea of blue-wearing fans in the packed Gwladys Street for a roaring atmosphere.








Dale Street

Dale Street is famous for two things: Grade II-listed buildings and Grade A brewpubs. Sometimes they’re one and the same. Set in a charming Victorian building and serving real cask ale, the Saddle Inn is a great choice for a pre-game or post-game pint. If you can’t make it to the stadium, catch it on TV at The Excelsior over a steaming hot plate of fish 'n chips.








Mathew Street

The Reds and Blues of Merseyside might argue over who has the best soccer team, but there are zero arguments when it comes to music. After the final whistle blows, you’ll find fans of both clubs on Mathew Street, the rowdy birthplace of the Merseybeat. Join the jamboree of Beatlemaniacs and ’60s nostalgists at the Cavern Club for a hard day’s night of music and a good ol' time.








Liverpool One Shopping Center

If you only have time to visit one shopping center in Liverpool – make it this one! It has everything you can think of, from high-end chains and designer brands, to specialist shops, and soccer-club superstores. Liverpudlians are famously friendly, so don’t be shy about asking staff and fellow shoppers for tips or directions.








The Baltic Fleet Brew Pub

This charming old Victorian pub has plenty of character. Dark wood paneling and framed nautical pictures recall its past as a favorite haunt of thirsty sailors in the 19th century – but there’s some hidden history too! Pull up a stool and ask the chatty bar staff about the secret basement tunnels where they now brew their delicious cask ales.








Salt Dog Slims

A speakeasy-style bar for easygoing locals. In the middle of noisy nightclubs on Seel Street, this unassuming pub is filled with a chilled-out crowd and equally laid-back staff. Head inside if you like craft beers, cocktails, and seriously spicy hot dogs! Upstairs, the secret club requires a code – you’ll need to charm your fellow bar flies to crack it!

Popular Neighborhoods in Liverpool












Liverpool Shopping District


39 properties

A shopper’s delight – all you need is cash! Bold Street’s top of the pops for used vinyl and vintage clothes. If you dig designer threads at designer prices, hit the Metquarter Mall. Liverpool One’s unbeatable for big brands like Debenhams or Zara. Next door is breezy Chavasse Park, perfect for a timeout from the retail rush.

Accommodations in Liverpool Shopping District













Chinatown


35 properties

Liverpool is home to Europe’s oldest Chinese community. So, it’s no surprise that you’ll find the best noodles in town here. Duke Street’s glut of affordable pan-Asian eateries draws a young, studenty crowd. The area’s hard to miss – two bronze lions and a multi-coloured, 15-metre high Imperial Arch welcome you to the neighbourhood.

Accommodations in Chinatown













RopeWalks


30 properties

“How boss is this place, la’? Eh, how long’s a piece of rope?!” This is a bar-hopper’s heaven, and Scousers swear by Seel Street. Try the Shipping Forecast for gourmet burgers and hip craft beers. Then wiggle the wee hours away at Alma de Cuba’s church turned Carnival club. Its Sunday brunch with live gospel choir soothes any sore heads.

Accommodations in RopeWalks













The Docks


18 properties

Follow the Mersey’s flow to feel the city’s pulse. Once home to heavy industry, today this waterfront district blends cultural heritage with exciting nightlife. Delve into its shipping past at the Maritime Museum or join the big sing-along at the Beatles Story. Rock ‘n’ stroll around Albert Dock – it’s got pubs and clubs to beat the band.

Accommodations in The Docks













Hope Street Quarter


10 properties

This upscale area pops to life like a period TV show, all cobbled alleys and grand Georgian houses. Visit 60 Hope Street, a listed-townhouse turned swanky bistro that’s popular among theatre luvvies. Get in on the act and see a play at the Everyman Theatre. It’s been a bohemian breeding ground for politically-charged drama since 1964.

Accommodations in Hope Street Quarter













Cavern Quarter


6 properties

Centred on Mathew Street, this is the boisterous birthplace of the Merseybeat. Join the jamboree of Beatlemaniacs and ’60s nostalgists at the Cavern Club. A replica of the bulldozed original, it still delivers a hard day’s night of music and merriment. If DJs and cocktail bars are more your scene, Victoria Street’s the place to be seen.

Accommodations in Cavern Quarter













Baltic Triangle


5 properties

Creative bright sparks reignited this old shipping district. Its once crumbling warehouses now host everything from digital startups to underground clubs. Check out The Gallery or Arena Studios for up-and-coming regional artists. Then pitch up at Camp and Furnace for the night: its street food parties and psychedelic music fests are ice-cold cool.

Accommodations in Baltic Triangle













St George's Quarter


1 property

This old Victorian hub seems stiff at first. Its numerous Neoclassical buildings are hard to tell apart. Yet the stoic columns of St George’s Hall stand out like Liverpool’s answer to the Parthenon. Here, passionate locals gather to celebrate famous football victories or show their political colours. Don’t be shy, the more the merrier!

Local Tips for Liverpool







The suburb of Woolton




by Lauren

Lauren loves The Beatles (naturally!) and uncovering new hangouts when she’s back home visiting.


The quaint suburb of Woolton is worth the 30-minute bus ride from the city centre. Packed with cute cafés and restaurants, it’s the home of Woolton Picture House, Liverpool’s oldest cinema. Spot Eleanor Rigby’s grave in the grounds of St. Peter's Parish Church.

Shiverpool Ghost Tour




by Aimee

Whilst living in the city, Aimee loved checking out its bars and Bold Street’s vintage shopping.


This walking ghost tour is led by a creepy crew of guides determined to scare up some screams. Historic tales and horror stories show you the spooky side of the city. The tour even ends in the Anglican Cathedral graveyard to add to the scare factor!

The suburb of Mossley Hill




by Nicola

Transportation





Liverpool Transportation









Air - Liverpool John Lennon Airport



Running between 04.40 and 19.50, the Arriva 500 express bus connects Liverpool John Lennon Airport to Lime Street or Liverpool One bus stations in 25 minutes. Saveaway tickets cost GBP 3.90, offering a day’s off-peak travel. Rail services to Lime Street and Central stations run from Liverpool South Parkway, connected to the terminal by bus. They run between 06.00 and 23.00 Monday to Saturday, and around 08.30 until 22.00 on Sundays. A taxi will cost around GBP 18.




Liverpool John Lennon Airport
www.liverpoolairport.com











Taxi



Taxis in Liverpool resemble London’s black “Hackney” cabs with a “Taxi” sign on their roof and a badge displaying the driver’s information. Taxis can be hailed around the city centre, for example around the Albert Docks and the main shopping areas like Bold Street and Great Charlotte Street. You can now pay using your credit or debit card and Hackney-style cabs will display a “Chip, Pin and Go” sign if they offer this service.










Bus



Arriva and Stagecoach operate buses around the city centre. As there is no standard bus fare, the city’s Saveaway ticket is the most economical and costs GBP 3.90 for a day’s off-peak travel. It can be used at all times apart from between 06.30 and 09.30 Monday to Friday, and can be used on buses and trains. A weekly Trio ticket costs GBP 17.50 and can be used on buses, trains and ferries. Buses generally run between 06.00 and 23.00.










Train



The city centre has 4 main stations: Lime Street, Central, Moorfields and James Street, which is the closest to the docks. Trains run from around 06.00 until midnight. They are generally used to travel out of the city and to Liverpool South Parkway, in order to reach the airport. If you are taking the train within the city, a single ticket costs GBP 1.75 and a day return will cost GBP 3.70.




Mersey Rail
www.merseyrail.org











Bicycle



These green and white bikes can be found at over 130 stations across the city centre. Bike hire costs GBP 3 per day and GBP 9 for a week. You’ll need to register online first and pay by credit or debit card, and you will then receive a log-in and pin number, which you enter into the screen at the bike station. The citybike website will show you how many bikes are currently available at each station.




citybike
www.citybikeliverpool.co.uk











Car



When travelling around the city centre, it’s best to stay on foot, or to catch the bus or train. If you park on the street, you pay at a meter, so prices vary depending on the time of day. Multi-storey car parks can be found around the centre but they can be expensive, costing approximately GBP 2.50 an hour. Make sure you don’t drive in the bus lanes, as you could get a fine.










Ferry



Liverpool’s famous ferry across the Mersey departs from Pier Head Ferry Terminal, which is next to the Royal Liver Building and just north of the Albert Docks. There are direct 10-minute services to Seacombe, or River Explorer cruises which also stop at Woodside, taking about 50 minutes. Tickets cost GBP 10 for adults and GBP 6.50 for children.

Booking.com is part of The Priceline Group, the world leader in online travel & related services.



























Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
