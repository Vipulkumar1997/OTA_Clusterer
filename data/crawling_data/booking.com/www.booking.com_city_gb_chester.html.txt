Plenty of variety.

Plenty of variety. Good centre with good shopping both independents and the usual large chains. Great for anyone interested in history of Chester from the Romans onwards. Lots of the old architecture to see and the river side with cruise boats very good. Walk the old city walls about 2 miles but well worth the effort

Chester has lots of interesting history to explore and some great restaurants and wine bars.The cathedral and zoo are brilliant to visit.It is lacking in some things you’d expect of a city though, such as a cinema or a proper theatre.

Love the city!

Love the city! Beautiful, historical and romantic, it’s like our own Rome on Manchester’s doorstep. It’s our first port of call for a few nights away. So many bars, restaurants, shops and points of interest, never tires.

It was very convenient to the railway station which meant taxis and buses were always available. A bit of noise from a room on the same corridor which made it difficult to get sleep on the second night of our stay. The first night was lovely and quiet.

Chester is my place of birth.

Chester is my place of birth. I brought a friend with me that has never been to the U.K as we both live in Washington State. We traveled from London, Oxford and then up to Chester . Of all the places we visited my friend loved Chester the most. She loved the fact that shopping was in walking distance, the beautiful old black and white buildings, the Roman walls the whole environment of my home town. She has remarked several times upon our return to Washington that she could live in Chester and plans on returning next time bringing her husband.

Chester was a beautiful, lively town.

Chester was a beautiful, lively town. We had a lovely stay of one night and two days and could have easily spent a week. Quintessentially English and a gateway to Northern Wales. Architecturally stunning. What more could a tourist to the U.K. want?








Hotels That Guests Love in Chester





Oddfellows Chester

Stunning hotel, have stayed a few times now! Love the quirky decor and comfortable large beds! Staff always friendly and attentive and also has a great location in the centre of Chester! 😀

Innkeeper's Lodge Chester, Christleton









“
We stayed in the annex (recommended) as nice and quiet. Right on the canal and a nice 40 minute stroll in to Chester.Staff were all excellent and real value for money compared to other Chester hotels.£7 taxi ride to City Centre.
”






Mill Hotel & Spa Destination









“
The hotel is located in a great area. The staff were great and the facilities were excellent. Very clean hotel. I will stay here anytime I visit Chester and would recommend it to anyone.
”






The Chester Grosvenor









“
Splendid Hotel in the heart of Chester and equally splendid Simon Radley Restaurant.
”






Chester Court Hotel









“
The room was clean and very comfortable and the breakfast very good, but the real star was the staff.  Both the evening staff and the morning shift went out of their way to make us feel welcome and to help with a problem I was having with my car.  Can't say enough good about the Chester Court Hotel!
