Breakfast”








Cliff Cottage


Review Score: 7.2




“Quiet place, good location, nice view from the tent. Good price.”








Beach Jungle


Review Score: 9.3




“Adam the owner was very welcoming as were all the staff there. The big bungalow with one double bed and one single is new and the bed the best I've slept in, though I slept on the veranda a few nights as my snoring was keeping my travelling companion awake. Excellent aircon + fridge and cooker as well as free tea and coffee.”








Parama Koh Chang

“The staff was great as well as the quality of the food served in the restaurant.”








Keereeta Resort & Spa


Review Score: 7.6




“Nice modern appearing place. Quite small.”








Pajamas Koh Chang


Review Score: 8.9




“Everything!!!Staff! Everyone is extremely helpful and knowledgeable and has a level of English more often than not more advancced than their guests ;) Rooms, especially pool facing ones are great. Fun upbeat decor. Reminiscent of Greece. Dorms are airy. There is a pool table. You can do your laundry and prepare your own meals. There is a small library. We were traveling with 2 young adults who found friends immediately, even when the place was quiet and luxurious enough for us oldies.”
