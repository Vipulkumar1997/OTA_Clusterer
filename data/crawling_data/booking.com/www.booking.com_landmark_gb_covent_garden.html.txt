Covent Garden Highlights









Covent Garden

Famed for its flower markets, street performers and coffee-swilling denizens, Covent Garden is also great for shopping. If you think you can never have enough bling, shoes or lipstick, check out the array of stores around the network of streets known as “Seven Dials.” Swing by Tatty Devine for divine handmade jewelry, then total up your receipts over cup o' joe in Monmouth Coffee.








Plaza Mayor

Salamanca’s main square is a real eye-catcher. Baroque colonnades line each side, embedded in ornate façades. It’s very much the heart of the city, so you’ll definitely find yourself passing through on more than one occasion. When it's sunny, the city’s sizeable student population hangs out in the square, sitting and chatting in the sun's warmth.








Covent Garden Market

A landmark in its own right, tourists flock to this West End sight. Located in London’s West End, the piazza is home to three markets dating from the 19th century. The Apple Market’s wares have become less fruit based and more fashion focused – selling clothes, toys, accessories, paintings, mirrors, and more.








Covent Garden Area

In the heart of Theatreland, this is the epitome of the real West End. Street artists bring the area's theatrical side to life to a soundtrack provided by street musicians. Inside the market, you can chat with designers selling their goods ranging from paintings to jewelry and handmade soaps.
