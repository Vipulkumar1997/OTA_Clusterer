Hotels That Guests Love in Bangkok




Fun Cafe and Hostel









“
This guesthouse is near Bangkok railway station (walking distance). It is a converted factory. They clearly put a lot of effort in the design and construction, so the atmosphere is very pleasant with attention to details. The architecture has been thought with the guest in mind. Enough bathrooms, dormitory beds are like 'capsule' (wide, clean sheet, a lamp and a plug, and a little locker, and a space for your luggage), TV room, a small 'kitchen'. It is clean and comfortable. Staff very friendly
”






At Home Guest House









“
The people in charge was really nice, our room was what we expected and the location is great! Near to Khao San Road but without the noise. I really recommend this guest house if you are thinking in some place in Bangkok
”






Amarin Inn









“
The lady who manages this guesthouse is so nice and speaks good English. She is always happy to suggest things for you to see in Bangkok and also cheap ways of doing things. The location is perfect and I stay here whenever I'm in Bangkok.
”






Once In Bangkok Guesthouse









“
It was the best place we stayed in Bangkok! The room and place was always clean. The bed was very comfy. It was like a 3 stars hotel! Location is perfect and just 5 mins to Khao San Road by walk. The staff have been really fantastic. They are always smiling and helpful. I would like to say thank you to the guesthouse owner Mrs. Lamduan :) Thank you for your great hospitality. You made us feel like we were a part of your family. I definitely recommend this guesthouse for other people to stay.
”






D Hostel Bangkok









“
I was supposed to travel alone here during second  visitation in Bangkok. As from guest houses where I've stayed so far, the quality was best!! Especially, because many foreigner tourists also from a diversity of countries looked like to have come to stay abroad here, I was very very glad to make diverse foreigner friends by my positive international mind to enlarge my capability of communicative power by English. If supposed to travel abroad Bangkok later once again, I don't hesitate to select to stay abroad here again...

Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
