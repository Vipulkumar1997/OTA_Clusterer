Booking.com Guest Review Guidelines

To keep the rating score and review content relevant for your upcoming trip, we archive reviews older than 24 months.

Only a customer who has booked through Booking.com and stayed at the property in question can write a review. This allows us to verify that our reviews come from real guests like you. Who better to tell others about the free breakfast, friendly staff, or their comfortable room than someone who’s stayed at the property?

We want you to share your story, with both the good and the not-so-good. All we ask is that you follow a few simple guidelines.

Reviews Vision

We believe review contributions and property responses will highlight a wide range of opinions and experiences, which is critical in helping guests make informed decisions about where to stay.

Reviews Principles

Contributions to Booking.com are a reflection of the dedication of our guests and properties, so we treat them with the utmost respect.

Whether negative or positive, we'll post every comment in full and as quickly as possible, provided the guidelines are met. We'll also provide transparency over the status of submitted content.

We'll use the same guidelines and standards for all user-generated content, and for the property responses to that content.

We'll allow the contributions to speak for themselves, and we won’t be the judge of reality. Booking.com’s role is to be a feedback distributor for both guests and properties.

Guidelines and Standards for Reviews

These guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly, without limiting expression or strong opinions. They're also applicable regardless of the comment's tone.

Contributions should be travel related.
The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don’t include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com’s services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams.

Contributions should be appropriate for a global audience.
Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, or the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted.

All content should be genuine and unique to the guest.
Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated.

Respect the privacy of others.
Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and other similar details.

The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties, and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.

Lovely house. Had everything we needed, in a quiet area, local to town centre. Couldn't fault it.  We were expected at 7pm and due to delays we didnt get to the property until 9pm which was unfortunate... however Jay was lovely and welcoming when we finally arrived even know me probably ruined his friday night (sorry)

Plenty of room for four of us, everything we needed,  walkable to Anfield or town but only a £5.40 for a taxi  when we weren't up for the walk. Excellent stay, even had a chance to sit on the wall outside and have a drink and gossip with the neighbours. Would definitely use this property again.

눉
For me was ok, but for example for my mom we had to put something to cover one bedroom window, because there was to much light coming in from the outside. So, maybe this could be a point to think about.
눇
It was very very nice to stay in this house. There was everything you need, the beds were very confortable, very nice and sweet decorations, free wifi.Everything worked very good, from getting the keys to all the informations we got.Bathroom has one or two "little things" that wasn't that nice, but nothing that I personaly would complain about, important is: everything worked, nice warm water, towels and so on...It is also in a quiet street, so there is no loud noises from the cars and you have parking place in front of the house.I would book again anytime.Thank you very much for the nice stay :)
