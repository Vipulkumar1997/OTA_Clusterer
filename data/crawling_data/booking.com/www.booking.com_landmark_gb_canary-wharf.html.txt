What Guests Said About Canary Wharf:





Christina

United Kingdom










Try Canary Wharf for an amazing view of the Shard at dusk and after sunset

Try Canary Wharf for an amazing view of the Shard at dusk and after sunset. Also, from the observation platform next to Cutty Sark in Greenwich Village. I'm sure there are many other spots but those are the two I came across on this trip :)






Anne

United Kingdom










Stay South of the river, visit Canary Wharf and use the Docklands Light Railway

Stay South of the river, visit Canary Wharf and use the Docklands Light Railway. The Emirates Cable Car is great value and the views are fabulous. Try Greenwich Park.

“
Great location if you need to be in Canary Wharf, clean and modern room, nice staff
”






Fraser Place Canary Wharf









“
Fantastic apartment, lovely balcony overlooking the river. Less than a 10 minute walk to Canary wharf tube station. Apartment was really comfortable. Everything was well designed and thought out. Bathrooms well stocked with shampoo and shower gels and lovely fluffy towels. Fully fitted kitchen, tea, coffee when we arrived. 24 hr reception staff who were also very friendly and helpful. We loved it and hopefully get to stay again
”






DoubleTree by Hilton London – Docklands Riverside









“
Tons of space and a huge comfy bed, what more do you need! All the staff were really friendly and helpful, Micheal on reception was fab. Dinner in the restaurant was gorgeous, nice easy menu and food well cooked. Breakfast was amazing, so much to choose from. Cookies and water on arrival was a really nice touch and the free ferry over to Canary Wharf was fab.
”






Britannia International Hotel Canary Wharf









“
Good location,  just a short walk to the centre of Canary Wharf, and the underground or DLR. Will be even better when the riverside walk is open again. Good value, being London I wasn't expecting luxury at this price.
