Things to Do in Manchester









Canal Street

Known for fun and revelry, Canal Street was the filming location for TV’s ‘Queer as Folk’. A clutch of clubs and bars cater to every imaginable subculture – plus a few new ones. Whether you’re flying the rainbow flag for Pride, a drag queen in search of a feather boa, or a group of friends out on the town, you’ll be welcomed with open arms whatever your persuasion.



Canal Street, M1 3WD

Manchester Town Hall

“The finest example of Neo-Gothic architecture in the world”, so experts say – Manchester’s town hall bell tower is the city’s pride and joy. The clock bell, Great Abel (like Westminster’s, Big Ben), is inscribed with an admonishment from the poet Tennyson: “Ring out the false, ring in the true”. Counting out the hours since 1879, if this doesn’t move you, you have no soul.



Albert Square, M2 5RT









Manchester Central Library

Inspired by the Pantheon in Rome, the city library is now a classic in its own right. After four years of restoration, at a cost of £50 million, this circular, neoclassical gem reopened in 2014. Settle yourself in one of the comfy chairs and make a start on the library’s two million books – and when you fancy a breath of fresh air, cross St Peter’s Square to the war memorial.



St. Peter's Square, M2 5PD




Open Monday–Thursday 09:00–20:00, Friday–Saturday 09:00–17:00









Deansgate

Deansgate is Manchester’s good-time central. It’s one of Manchester’s most popular areas in the evening (especially after work on Fridays), and at weekends. 250+ bars, restaurants and cafes are in and around the street and Deansgate Locks (aka ‘party town’). Business casual, gussied up or jeans and a tee, if you really want to let your hair down, this is the place to be.



Deansgate, M3 3NW









The River Irwell

The lifeblood of the city, the history of the River Irwell is as deep as the water itself – and remains a traditional icon for the city. Marking the natural boundary between Manchester and Salford, its banks are dotted with waterside bars, restaurants and spots to picnic, fish, swim or just watch the world float by.








City of Manchester 'Etihad' Stadium

Until recently, Manchester City were considered the poor relations of city rivals, Manchester United. The arrival of Sheikh Mansour changed all that. These days, you can see the world’s brightest soccer stars shine at the Etihad Stadium. And if you can’t get a match ticket, opt for a stadium tour instead and see the home of the Premier League champions close up.



Ashton New Road, M11 3FF




Open Monday–Saturday 09:00–17:00, Sunday 10:00–16:00









Old Trafford

The “Theatre of Dreams” has been making fans dreams a reality here for years. Manchester United has become one of the most popular football clubs in the world, and their titles and trophies are held at an onsite museum. Whether you’re planning to see a match or simply take a stadium tour, a visit here is an absolute must (unless you’re a Manchester City fan!).



Sir Matt Busby Way, M16 0RA




Open Monday-Saturday 09:30–17:00, Sunday 10:00-16:00. Check website for details.









Salford Quays

Both the BBC and Britain’s independent broadcaster, ITV, are based here. And where you have journalists and TV types, can the city’s best eateries and watering holes be far away? Go at the end of the day to see the reflections of the modern office blocks light up the waterfront and you never know who you might bump into having an after-work pint in one of the locals.



Salford Quays, Salford, M50 3AZ

Heaton Park

Over 240 hectares of historic estate, Heaton Park is one of the largest green spaces in Europe. There’s no better place for golf, strolling in the woods, boating on the lake during the day … and stargazing at night. Festivals, feasts and fun-runs are held here throughout the year and the Animal Centre is always a children’s favourite – just keep them at arms length.



Heaton Park, M25 2SW




Open Monday-Sunday 08:00-16:30. Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Trafford Centre

The Queen shops at Harrods. Everyone else shops at the Trafford Centre. If you fancy yourself a retail prince or princess, browse around this giant mall beneath its Romanesque arches. Among your royal subjects – Selfridges, Debenhams, John Lewis, Apple, Omega and Topman, Europe’s largest food court, the 20-screen Odeon cinema, mini-golf, bowling alleys and more.



intu Trafford Centre, M17 8AA




Open Monday–Friday 10:00–22:00, Saturday 10:00-21:00, Sunday 12:00–18:00









Market Street

Surrounded on either end by department stores, Market Street bustles with bargain hunters and fashionistas from dawn until dusk. Manchester’s main shopping street runs from St. Ann’s Square to Piccadilly Gardens, bordered on one side by the vast Manchester Arndale center. If you’re hungry, there’s even an escalator to whisk you directly from ground level to the Arndale food court.








Arndale Center

Occupying a huge section of central Manchester, the Arndale Center is part of the fabric of the city. You can find a whole host of name brands under one roof, and there's a covered walkway that connects to the flagship branches of Selfridges and Marks & Spencer, keeping shoppers safely sheltered from the Mancunian weather.








King Street

Once the seat of Manchester’s financial sector, this central street connects Cross Street and Deansgate. Today, fashionistas flock to King Street’s upscale boutiques and swanky eateries, many housed in historic  buildings. High-end labels making their home here include Calvin Klein, Emporio Armani and DKNY.








Kendal's

Known affectionately as “Kendal’s,” this venerable department store opened as Kendal Milne over 180 years ago. Its beautiful Art Deco building is a Deansgate landmark that’s now run by the House of Fraser chain. Mancunian shoppers still flock here faithfully to browse the best in beauty, fashion and homeware brands.








Cross Street

Cross Street cuts neatly through central Manchester, connecting King Street’s designer boutiques with the flagship Harvey Nichols and Selfridges stores. Along the way, you’ll find the main-drag hustle and bustle of the Arndale Center and Market Street, with the specialist shops filling the arcades and alleys around St. Anne’s Square.








Northern Quarter

Manchester’s Northern Quarter is a magnet for shoppers seeking all things alternative, from second-hand books to vintage clothes and vinyl records. You can snatch up one-of-a-kind jewelry, ceramics and artwork directly from local artisans in the Manchester Craft and Design Center, or browse Afflecks for weird and wonderful gift ideas.








The Trafford Center

All white marble floors, towering palm trees and gleaming gold-leaf columns, this flashy fashion palace is one of the UK’s largest shopping malls. The Trafford Centre houses hundreds of name-brand retailers and designer names, as well as dozens of trendy bars and restaurants set around a grand ocean-liner themed food court.








High Street & Thomas Street Intersection

This intersection is the epicenter of the Northern Quarter’s bar scene. On any given evening, especially on weekends, it’s wall-to-wall festivities here. Take your pick from Bluu Manchester, Apotheca, Odd Bar and Almost Famous…or just bar-hop between all four! And from there, who knows where the night will take you?








Tib Street

Tib Street cuts Manchester’s lively Northern Quarter right down the middle. There’s plenty of fun to be had here, especially in the blocks between Warwick Street and Dale Street. Grab dinner at Simple Kitchen before a round or two in the Tib Street Tavern. Then finish the night off at the Black Dog Ballroom, a New York-inspired speakeasy and pool hall.








Spinningfields

The Spinningfields area is busy with shoppers and businesspeople during the day – and filled with night-owl bar-hoppers in the later hours. There are Caribbean vibes galore at Revolución de Cuba bar, swanky Japanese sophistication at Tattu, and Alchemist lives up to its name with magical cocktail concoctions to delight your taste buds.








The Locks

The Locks is the name given to a series of ten railway arches on Whitworth West Street. These arches shelter some of Manchester’s most popular bars. Knott Bar is the place to go for top-quality ales, and Sakura caters to the discerning cocktail barfly, with a mix of Japanese and international glitz. For romantic Manchester panoramas, head up 23 floors to the very stylish Cloud 23.








Band On The Wall

This iconic Northern Quarter venue is named for its tiny stage high up on the wall where musicians used to perform. In the 1970s, the Band On The Wall was the beating heart of Manchester’s punk scene, hosting great headliners like Joy Division, Buzzcocks and The Fall. Today it’s a platform for everything from new local names to jazz legends and cult DJs.








Albert Hall

Albert Hall’s transformation from abandoned chapel to modern temple of music is one of Manchester’s greatest success stories. This venue has a fantastic atmosphere after sitting empty for 40 years. Now it features a packed calendar of live shows and club nights, with an underground Bavarian beer hall catering for both preshow drinks and after-parties.








Gorilla

Gorilla’s location under the Whitworth Street West train tracks gives this small venue a bunker-like feel. With intimate gigs and DJ sets, this eclectic space houses a grill restaurant, a trendy bar, and a mezzanine gin parlor that’s perfect for a post-show drink.








The Ritz

The Beatles, R.E.M., Arctic Monkeys, and The Smiths are just some of the artists that have graced the stage at The Ritz over the decades. This historic building has been a downtown staple since 1927 and still hosts regular concerts and weekend club nights under its modern name – O2 Ritz Manchester.








Antwerp Mansion

Tucked away behind Fallowfield’s famous Curry Mile, this  stately Victorian town house has been cleaned up and turned into a community-run creative hub. Its cavernous rooms fill up for art exhibitions, club nights, and eclectic gigs – plus all proceeds go towards preserving the historic house.








The Ruby Lounge

Behind an unassuming entrance on High Street, this roomy basement venue is known for its intimate atmosphere and acoustics. The Ruby Lounge hosts live music almost daily, as well as regular club nights – making it one of the Northern Quarter’s most popular nightclubs.








The Footage Bar

This converted cinema makes an ideal setting for dramatic cup finals and nail-biting penalty shootouts. Right on Manchester’s student-centric Oxford Road, The Footage has dozens of TVs showing multiple games at once, including two ginormous projection screens. Add some hearty pub food to the mix and a vast selection of local ales, and you’re on to a winner.








Tib Street Tavern

Tib Street Tavern is the stand-out sports bar of Manchester’s Northern Quarter. Its four HD screens promise views of the game from every angle, and the bar serves up homemade burgers and a wide range of local and international beers. The Tavern treats all teams equally and stays totally neutral, so no soccer team shirts are allowed inside.








Old Trafford Stadium

The “Theatre of Dreams” has been making fans dreams a reality here for years. Manchester United has become one of the most popular football clubs in the world, and their titles and trophies are held at an onsite museum. Whether you’re planning to see a match or simply take a stadium tour, a visit here is an absolute must (unless you’re a Manchester City fan!).








Etihad Stadium

Until recently, Manchester City were considered the poor relations of city rivals, Manchester United. The arrival of Sheikh Mansour changed all that. These days, you can see the world’s brightest soccer stars shine at the Etihad Stadium. And if you can’t get a match ticket, opt for a stadium tour instead and see the home of the Premier League champions close up.








Altrincham Market House

A historic building (Grade II listed), Altrincham Market House is more than your run-of-the-mill food hall. Trendy stalls sell an array of foods from behind vintage-style storefronts – with wood-fired pizza, pies, burgers, and baked goods just some of the delicious options available. To wash it all down, grab a beer from one of the North’s best microbreweries, or treat yourself to a cup of house-roasted coffee.








Tattu Restaurant and Bar

Located in trendy Spinningfields, Tattu’s exquisitely designed interior and cleverly-named cocktails get their inspiration from the long history of body art. This unique locale fuses traditional Asian flavors to create carefully plated, contemporary Chinese dishes. Sample bite-sized dim sum and treat your tastebuds to main dishes like soy-glazed wagyu fillet or the black cod in saffron miso.








The French Restaurant

Find this fine-dining gem hidden within the Midland Hotel. Created from ingredients grown on The French’s very own farms, the menu is filled with seasonal flavor. In the historic dining room, everyone's enjoying the restaurant’s modern twist on the traditional – both in the decor and the carefully crafted dishes being served up.








Manchester House Restaurant

Contemporary meets industrial chic in this eccentric venue. Offering impressive 10 and 14-course tasting menus plus a creative à la carte selection, there’s plenty to keep your taste buds happy. For an even more refined experience, request a table in the private dining room, which can seat up to eight people.








Mr. Cooper's House & Garden

Famous Manchester folk of the 1800s, the Coopers would frequently open their gardens to the public for picnicking. Bringing this concept into the present day, Mr. Cooper’s House and Garden features three different dining areas: the book-filled Library, the leather-finished Study, and the botanical Garden – complete with outdoor furniture and a 30-foot tree. And when it comes to the food, it’s delicious and simple, but still refined.








The Kitchens

The variety of options that make up the Manchester street food scene all come together at this one destination, The Kitchens. A project designed to encourage experimentation and growth, this Spinningfields-area treat features culinary creatives like the Hip Hop Chip Shop, Bangers and Bacon, and Dim Sum Su – each putting their spin on favorites from around the world.








Islington Mill

This former cotton factory downed tools to become one of Salford’s leading creative hubs, featuring a gallery, workshop spaces and a concert venue. As well as hosting epic club nights, eclectic live gigs and performance art, Islington Mill is also the home of the annual Sounds From The Other City Festival.








The National Football Museum

The stars, the stadia, the silverware. They’re all covered in this fascinating celebration of “the beautiful game”. With 140,000 items of memorabilia on display, the National Football Museum traces the sport’s history, from its muddy 19th-century origins to the glamourous global game it is today. Think you can play a bit? Step up and test your soccer skills on the interactive simulators.

Popular Neighborhoods in Manchester












Manchester City Center


142 properties

Amid the welcoming bustle of the city centre, Piccadilly Gardens is a green space with a difference. Redesigned by a Japanese architect, these 21st-century gardens are cool, modernistic and controversial. Take a bird’s-eye view from the Manchester Wheel, then steady the vertigo with a real ale at the KRO Bar.

Accommodations in Manchester City Center













Northern Quarter


37 properties

Don’t dismiss Manchester’s most “alternative” quarter as merely a hipster’s paradise. Sample a dizzying range of beers – locally brewed and from all parts of the world – in Port Street Beer House. Then soak up the brews with a chewy, cheesy, crispy pizza in “Dough”. There’s lots to do in this night-owl’s hotspot.

Accommodations in Northern Quarter













Salford


30 properties

Salford has arrived at last! Investment life-blood has transformed this urban wasteland into urbane sophisticate. The theatres and art galleries of the Lowry Centre – named for Salford’s most famed “matchstick men” painter – ensure that the area is beyond cool. And the presence of ITV and the BBC ensure the city’s role as MediaCity UK.

Castlefield


13 properties

Tradition meets inner-city calm. That’s what you’ll find in Castlefield, another area which proudly demonstrates the proud canal based history of the city. Recent redevelopments have not detracted from the charming character of this part of the city, with the Bridgewater Canal and the red brick bridges in particular worth a special visit.

Accommodations in Castlefield













Didsbury


7 properties

The streets of the outer suburb of Didsbury are peppered with Victorian mansions, homes of the mill owners who prospered there in the 19th and early 20th centuries. This district’s gracious, old-village atmosphere makes it the ideal place for quieter nights out in stylish surroundings. Pop in to the village for a choice selection of restaurants.

Accommodations in Didsbury













Old Trafford


5 properties

Manchester United. For many, they are the only reason they have even heard of the city. The stadium stands like a sporting skyscraper, with upwards of 70,000 people regularly packing into the arena, turning the surrounding streets into a sea of red. Hungry on match day? Stop at one of the fish and chip shops for an English tradition.

Fallowfield


2 properties

With a large student population, there’s always something afoot in Fallowfield. Local bars and restaurants specialise in catering for champagne lifestyles on lemonade wages. It's worth venturing here if only for is fabulous comedy club XS Malarkey. The atmosphere is young and lively but you don’t have to be a student to get a kick out of this area.

Local Tips for Manchester







Band on The Wall




by Sam

After 4 years studying in Manchester, Sam now lives in London but still maintains his Northern Soul.


This legendary live music venue has been part of Manchester’s history for over 200 years – the unusual name comes from the height of the original stage. I have great memories of Luv Dub reggae nights here, and now regular sessions include Mr Scruff and the Craig Charles Funk and Soul club.

Mum-of-two Amanda lives just outside the city and has been working in Manchester for 15 years.


This welcoming milk bar/kitchen is located in the bohemian Northern Quarter and serves an amazing array of American-style breakfasts – the eggs Benedict and peanut butter malt milkshake are my personal favourites. It’s always busy so you may have to wait for a table, but it’s so worth it!

I know Christmas is almost here when the markets open up in mid-November. They’re spread all over the city but the best atmosphere is outside the town hall in Albert Square. Stalls sell food, drinks and gifts from all over Europe – great for Christmas shopping while sipping mulled wine!

Transportation





Manchester Transportation









Air



Follow signs for The Station to reach Manchester Airport’s central rail, tram and bus interchange. It’s a 20-minute train journey to Piccadilly Station (every 10 minutes from 05:30–23:30, less frequently overnight). Buy a ticket from the machines or booth for GBP 4.30. Metrolink trams leave every 12 minutes and cost GBP 4.20 – look out for the yellow ticket machines on the platform. It’s a 45-minute ride to Cornbrook, where you can change lines for the city centre.




Manchester Airport
www.manchesterairport.co.uk











Air



Liverpool John Lennon Airport is a hub for budget airlines and is just a 50-minute drive from central Manchester. Terravision buses leave from right outside Arrivals approximately once an hour from 05:00–23:50, stopping at Manchester Sackville Street (next to the main coach station) and Shudehill Interchange. Tickets cost GBP 8 single or GBP 12 return: buy them online, at the airport’s Terravision desk, or from Terravision representatives at the bus stops in Manchester.




Liverpool John Lennon Airport
www.liverpoolairport.com











Train



Manchester Piccadilly is a large modern station offering regional and cross-country services, including frequent connections to Manchester Airport and high-speed trains to London. It’s remarkably easy to navigate and has a good range of restaurants, cafés and shops. The smaller, more old-fashioned Manchester Victoria offers local services around the north-west of England. Free Metroshuttle buses link the two stations from 07:00–19:00 (Sundays 10:00–18:00).




National Rail
www.nationalrail.co.uk











Bus



Manchester’s main bus stations are at Piccadilly Gardens and Shudehill Interchange – from there, routes criss-cross the city and fan out to surrounding towns. Bus companies include Stagecoach, Arriva and First: all offer day passes for around GBP 4, available to buy from the driver. Free Metroshuttle buses also connect the city’s main train stations and shopping areas from 07:00–19:00 (Sundays 10:00–18:00). Night buses are mainly limited to the Oxford Road corridor.




Transport for Greater Manchester
www.tfgm.com











Taxi



Manchester has both London-style black cabs and private taxis. Black cabs can be flagged down in the street, found at a taxi rank or pre-booked. The metered fares are standardised and all vehicles are wheelchair accessible. Private taxis are either white or silver, with yellow number plates and a yellow sticker indicating the name of the company. They can’t be flagged down and need to be pre-booked. Fares vary but should always be displayed clearly inside the taxi.




Street Cars Manchester
www.streetcarsmanchester.co.uk











Tram



Metrolink’s 6 lines radiate outwards from the city centre through the suburbs, reaching nearby towns such as Bury, Rochdale, Altrincham and Ashton-under-Lyne. A new service also links Manchester Airport to Cornbrook, where you can change to other lines. Tickets cost between GBP 1.40 and GBP 4.70 depending on the journey – buy before you travel from the yellow ticket machines on the platform. Trams are surprisingly quiet so take care when crossing roads in the city centre!




Metrolink
www.metrolink.co.uk











Car



Driving in Manchester city centre is relatively straightforward – just look out for bus lanes, as driving in them is heavily fined. EU driving licences are valid in the UK, while non-EU citizens can use their foreign licence for up to 12 months. City-centre parking is very pricey: NCP car parks charge GBP 8 to GBP 12 for up to 4 hours, or GBP 13 to GBP 18 for 24 hours. Alternatively, there are free park-and-ride sites next to most train and tram stations on the outskirts of the city.

Booking.com is part of The Priceline Group, the world leader in online travel & related services.



























Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
