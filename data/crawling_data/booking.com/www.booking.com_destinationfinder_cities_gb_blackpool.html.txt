Visit Blackpool: Your Travel Guide


When it comes to British seaside resorts, Blackpool takes the biscuit. With its rickety piers and ubiquitous “chippies”, it’s a throwback to the glory days of British holidaymaking. Today, the adrenaline rush of Pleasure Beach and its lively bars brings in new generations in droves.

Things to Do in Blackpool









Blackpool Winter Gardens

Glitz and glamour a-go-go. This entertainment complex is Blackpool’s sizzling hotspot for all things comic and musical. The Winter Gardens has been rocking audiences since 1878. The Empress Ballroom’s stage is graced by top pop acts, while the Opera House hosts full-on Broadway-style extravaganzas. Combine your trip with a meal at one of its eateries and it’ll be a smash-hit!



Winter Gardens Blackpool, 97 Church Street, Blackpool, Lancashire, FY1 1HL




Open Monday-Sunday 10:30-16:00









Blackpool Tower

Got something to say? With 25,000 LED bulbs to spell out your message, Blackpool Tower can help you tell the world (or anyone in the vicinity). Aside from its big-statement capabilities, this tower is a real box of tricks. Nippers frolic in Jungle Jim’s Playground, old timers foxtrot across the Ballroom’s sprung-wood dance floor and all comers gulp at the 315 foot-high SkyWalk.



The Blackpool Tower, The Promenade, Blackpool, FY1 4BJ




Check website for details.









North Pier

North Pier is the essence of “The Great British Seaside Resort”. The rusty struts, the old-time circus lettering, the organ’s resolutely chipper melodies wafting through the sea air – this is faded Blackpool glory at its finest. Roll up, roll up for stand-up comedy and quizzes that’ll take you back to the days when Britannia’s pier-side entertainment ruled the waves.



Promenade, Blackpool, FY1 1NE




Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Blackpool Illuminations

“Let there be light”. Not only the words of Yahweh, but also those of cultural luminaries such as Dale Winton, Westlife and Red Rum, the prize racehorse. Switching on Blackpool’s lights is one of the highest honours Britain can bestow on anybody (or horse). The switch flicks and thousands of coloured bulbs turn the city into a glittering kaleidoscope from September to November.



Promenade, Blackpool, Lancashire, FY1 5BB




Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Sea Life Blackpool

No, you haven’t just stepped into a scene from “Alien”. You’re looking at Big Daddy, the largest crab in the world! This aquarium is home to this colossal crustacean, whose spindly front claws span a whopping 10 feet. Real-life “facehuggers” aside, Sea Life also swarms with Europe’s largest shark collection. Got nerves of steel? Slip into a wetsuit and go snorkelling in their tank!



SEA LIFE Blackpool, Promenade, Blackpool, Lancashire, FY1 5AA




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00









Madame Tussauds Blackpool

“You’ll never guess who I bumped into in Blackpool”. This waxwork museum is the perfect opportunity to rub shoulders with red-hot celebs. The effigies on show range from spitting-image doppelgangers to iffy imitations, and from the low-brow to the slightly less low-brow. Snap yourself singing to the X-Factor judges, leering with Benny Hill or getting rowdy with Jeremy Kyle.



89 Promenade, Blackpool, FY1 5AA




Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Stanley Park

What’s the plan, Stan? Work off those chip-buttie calories with a stroll around Stanley Park! This park has plenty to keep you trim, taut and terrific, including sports pitches, a BMX track, playgrounds, trampolines and crazy golf. You can even take a boat out onto the lake. Once you’ve got your breath back, grab an ice cream from a kiosk. You’ve earned it!



West Park Drive, Blackpool, FY3 9HU




Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Blackpool Zoo

Commune with critters. This zoo has a biblical ark’s worth of beasts. Visit not-so-distant relatives on Gorilla Mountain, waddle over to the penguin pool or crane your neck to grin at a giraffe. And it doesn’t stop there – young dino-devotees can wander among prehistoric brutes, accompanied by scene-setting sound effects. Disclaimer: may not contain real-life dinosaurs.



East Park Drive, Blackpool, Lancashire, FY3 8PP




Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Sandcastle Waterpark

Blackpool is a city of champions. It boasts numerous records – the world’s biggest this, the UK’s longest that. Sandcastle is one such winner – it’s no less than the UK’s largest indoor waterpark. This tangle of coloured flumes is flush with thrills and spills, including slides, a wave machine and burger bars. How else did you think you were going to stay afloat?



South Beach, Blackpool, Lancashire, FY4 1BB




Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Blackpool Pleasure Beach

The pride of Blackpool. This theme park has so many rides that the problem is knowing where to start. They range from the high-octane Big One rollercoaster right down to the cutesy Rugrats ride in Nickelodeon Land. Best of all, the Pleasure Beach comes with a thoroughly English disclaimer – if it rains for three hours straight, you can come back for free the next day.



525 Ocean Boulevard, Blackpool, Lancashire, FY4 1EZ




Changes seasonally. Check website for details.









Blackpool Seaside

When you think of North-West England, beach time isn’t always the first thing that comes to mind. However, beaches aren’t just about deepening your tan. Blackpool seaside is a case in point. Along this legendary strip of coastline, you’ll find an overwhelming array of theme parks, water parks, mini golf, candy floss stalls and family-friendly restaurants.








Blackpool South Beach

When the sun’s out, there’s nothing better than the beach. Blackpool South Beach has fun for the whole family with donkey rides, lounge chairs, and golden sand that’s perfect for building sandcastles. Just make sure to check the tide times before you visit – at high tide the whole shore is underwater!








Grand Theatre

The Grand is a beloved old theatre that offers something for every Blackpool visitor. On its stage – and in its adjacent studio – you’ll find riotous stand-up, funky musical extravaganzas, thought-provoking dramatic pieces, family pantomimes and more. Check out their listings and get ready for an evening’s entertainment, Blackpool-style.








The Opera House

Don’t be fooled by the name – this theatre isn’t really about opera any more. There is definitely a musical theme running through its productions, though – with a full complement of pop acts, musical plays and uproarious pantomimes on offer. If you enjoy tapping your foot along to a jaunty number or dabbing your eyes at a heart-rending ballad, check ahead to see what’s on here.








Blackpool Central Pier

Head to Blackpool’s Central Pier any time between June and November and you’ll be in for an entertainment extravaganza. As well as a spectacular musical show that’ll get your feet tapping, there’s a pirate-themed family bar with swashbuckling waiters on hand to spice up your visit.








The Cottage

Situated on a sleepy residential street, this cosy chippy feels worlds away from Blackpool’s crowded coastal strip. Inside, the catch of the day is paired with crisp homemade batter, secret-recipe tartare sauce and thick-cut chips made from locally grown spuds. Purists can wash their meal down with a traditional pot of tea, but there’s also a fully stocked bar.








Yorkshire Fisheries

It may be named after a rival county, but this charming chippy is the pride of the Lancashire coast. Blackpool’s oldest chip shop has been dishing out delicious fish and chips since the 1950s. Alongside traditional battered cod and haddock, Yorkshire Fisheries also serves up everything from salmon, swordfish and scampi to hearty homemade pies.








Harry Ramsden's

This legendary chippy chain first opened its doors near Leeds back in 1928. Since then it’s expanded across the UK, and this bustling Blackpool branch is one of the best-known. Situated smack bang at the bottom of Blackpool Tower, it serves a varied menu of meat and veggie options alongside its famous battered fish and thick-cut golden chips.

Popular Neighborhoods in Blackpool












Blackpool Town Center


333 properties

Blackpool’s city centre has a little something for everyone. During the day, kiddywinks giggle at SEA LIFE Blackpool, and families share mealtime moments at Harry Ramsden’s. At night, the party commences! Happy-go-lucky revellers cavort through the streets, then pile into clubs like Popworld and Domain for shots and thumping beats.

Accommodations in Blackpool Town Center













North Shore


142 properties

Need some peace and quiet? Then you’re in the right place. North Shore’s a far cry from the hullabaloo of the centre. Residents busily run errands and older visitors enjoy the sea breeze on park benches. For a taste of Blackpool’s glory days, head to the legendary North Pier, where stand-up, bingo and palm-reading are the order of the day.

Looking for fun? Shore thing! This area is home to Blackpool’s top frolics. The Pleasure Beach draws in squealing crowds with its array of hair-raising rides.

Revolution Blackpool




by Jake

Party animal Jake lives in London but has plenty of experience of Blackpool's lively bar scene.


Get yourself down here on a Monday for 'Skint Mondays', when there are plenty of deals on food and drinks. It draws a younger crowd because of the cheap drinks and loud music. They tend to have some kind of live music and competition at some point too.

Mis information by tram staff, the last tram from Starr Gate to Fleetwood is 11.45pm, we were old the trams run until 1.45am, that is the return journey to Starr Gate. Spent a freezing cold 30 minutes waiting for a tram, we did manage to get a taxi but might not be so lucky if the resort busy.

Transportation





Blackpool Transportation









Air - Manchester Airport



If you're flying into Manchester, you have three main options for getting to Blackpool. Direct trains to Blackpool North Station take 1 hour and 40 minutes and cost around GBP 20 for an adult single ticket. Coach links to Blackpool Central Coach Station take just over 3 hours and cost around GBP 10. The quickest option is by taxi. This costs around GBP 90 and takes around an hour. If you're travelling as a group of 4 then this could be the easiest way into Blackpool.




Manchester Airport
www.manchesterairport.co.uk











Air - Liverpool John Lennon Airport



Imagine you're arriving at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. To get to Blackpool you could take the train, which leaves from the airport train station every 30 minutes. You'll need to make either 2 or 4 changes, depending on the route. It's best to check beforehand so you know where to get off! Tickets cost around GBP 20 for an adult single ticket. The quickest way into town is by taxi, which takes around 1 hour and 10 minutes. However, it'll set you back about GBP 90.




Liverpool John Lennon Airport
www.liverpoolairport.com











Tram



Blackpool's tram line runs up and down the coastline, providing a regular service to most of the city's main attractions. The modern trams are purple, white and black, while the double-decker vintage trams are green and cream-coloured. You can buy tickets online, on board or at the Travelshops on Market Street and Rigby Road. Tickets are always slightly cheaper online. If you're planning to take a bus later, Blackpool1 tickets are usable on both modes of transport.




Blackpool Transport Services Ltd
www.blackpooltransport.com











Bus



Blackpool has 14 different bus routes, covering most of the city. The buses are black and yellow, and you need to hail them from the stop with your arm, otherwise they'll drive straight past! The price depends on how far you're travelling, but single tickets cost between GBP 1 and GBP 2.50. Children's tickets cost GBP 1, and under-5s are free. You can also make a saving by using Blackpool1 tickets, which are also valid for tram trips.




Blackpool Transport Services Ltd
www.blackpooltransport.com











Taxi



Taxis are a quick and easy way to get from A to B. The cars range from saloon cars to hackney carriage-style vehicles. There are taxi ranks outside Blackpool North Station and Coral Island. If you need a cab late at night, it's best to book in advance as it can often be tricky to find taxis to hail on the street at the wee hours of the morning.










Car



There are plenty of pay-and-display car parks around the city, most of which are open 24 hours a day. Most have some kind of height restrictions, and only a couple accept motor homes. Beware that some of the car parks only accept coins. The pricing depends on how long you are planning to leave the car. On-street parking is also readily available, ranging from around 50p per hour in the town centre to GBP 7.50 for 12 hours on the promenade.










Train



Blackpool has 3 train stations: Blackpool North, Blackpool South and Blackpool Pleasure Beach. Blackpool North is the main station, offering direct services to London Euston, taking less than 3 hours. Blackpool Pleasure Beach offers less frequent trains, mainly linking Blackpool and Colne. Blackpool South offers local connections to Colne and Preston. Tickets are available online or at the station.




Northern Rail
www.northernrail.org











Bicycle



Biking in Blackpool is a great option for getting around, as it's very flat and there are many cycle lanes in place. Bright yellow bikes can be hired from Solaris Centre on South Promenade and the council’s sports centres (Blackpool Sports Centre, Moor Park Health & Leisure Centre and Palatine Leisure Centre). Prices start from GBP 5 for a half day’s rental, which includes a helmet and route map.
