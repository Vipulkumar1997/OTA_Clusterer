Things to Do in Brisbane









Treasury Building - Casino

Fancy yourself as a poker pro? Head down to the Treasury to take on the house. This casino’s got ample ways to lighten your wallet, from cards and dice to red-and-black-squared spinning wheels. Once you’ve slammed down your final full house, splash your newly-won cash on a cocktail in The Kitty Bar, where a fistful of dollars and funky beats make the perfect match.



Top of the Queen Street Mall, Brisbane Queensland 4000




Check website for details.









Queensland Museum and Art Gallery

An array of art. Take a tour through the wide world of artistic expression, where a pot pourri of art is on show. The collections take you all the way back to Australia’s First Peoples, who created abstract works with swirling brushwork. Once you’re done browsing, take a seat at GOMA Restaurant, where chefs transform raw ingredients into their own scrumptious works of art.



Stanley Place, South Brisbane Queensland 4101




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00









South Bank Parklands

It can get pretty warm in Brisbane, so where better to cool off than at an inner-city beach? This riverside park contains a sandy urban oasis complete with turquoise water and beach bums galore. Once you’ve splish-splashed sufficiently, amble among bougainvillea or laze about on the lawns. If you’ve got a taste for local knick-knacks, don’t miss the weekend markets.



Stanley Street Plaza, South Brisbane Queensland 4101









Wheel of Brisbane

Brisbane’s roundest round trip. This Ferris wheel spins round on the banks of the Brisbane River and gives peerless panoramas over the city. Survey the cityscape from on high and scan over the ant-sized bathers of South Bank across to the legendary Gabba cricket ground. As well as the wicked vistas, you’ll get a potted city history delivered in mellifluous Queensland tones.



Russel Street, South Brisbane Queensland 4101




Open Sunday-Thursday 10:00-22:00, Friday-Saturday 10:00-23:00.









Suncorp Stadium

Brisbane gets its money’s worth from the Suncorp. This rectangular lightbox of an arena is pressed into non-stop service. It’s often a blur of muddy boots and hulking muscle during rugby league, rugby union and football matches. It also regularly packs out for concerts by biggest names in pop, such as Coldplay, Eminem and U2. If you’re into sport or music, check the listings.



40 Castlemaine Street, Milton Queensland 4064




Check website for details.









Story Bridge

A tall Story. This bridge offers an unusual adrenaline rush. Clip yourself in for the Story Bridge Adventure Climb – a climbing route that traces the top girders of the bridge as they curve and dip high above the Brisbane River. It’s a stunningly different view on the cityscape, one which you’ll be able to frame and put on your mantelpiece, as each grinning group gets a photo.



Story Bridge, State Route 15 New Farm Queensland 4169









Kangaroo Point Cliffs

Scale great heights! This craggy volcanic cliff-face is made for climbing. Strap on your harness, take a deep breath and clamber to the top. You’ll be rewarded with spectacular views across the river. If you prefer terra firma, you’re also in luck – the park’s a prime spot for sedate pursuits. Pack your “esky” (coolbox) with steak, wings and beer – and fire up the “barbie”!



Kangaroo Point Cliffs Kangaroo Point Queensland 4169









Mount Coot-Tha

Honey makes the world go round! Mount Coot-Tha takes its name from the Turrbal Aboriginal word for honey. This hill used to be awash with nectar-rich hives. If hikes and bikes get you buzzing, there are plenty of routes to keep you sweet. Once you reach the top, make a bee-line for Kuta Café. Its sweeping city views are the perfect accompaniment to your ice cream.



1012 Sir Samuel Griffith Drive, Mount Coot-Tha Queensland 4066









Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary

Those little noses, those funny tufty ears – yes, koalas are some of the cuddliest critters around. These eucalyptus-munching fuzzballs are the star event at this sanctuary. Many a swooning visitor goes weak at the knees during the regular “cuddle a koala” sessions. Aside from the koalas, Lone Pine is a Noah’s ark of quirky Antipodean wildlife, from kangaroos to cockatoos.



708 Jesmond Road, Fig Tree Pocket Queensland 4069




Open Monday-Sunday 09:00-17:00.









Roma Street Parklands

When in Roma, roam around a bit! This lush park was made for afternoon strolls. It’s a maze of vibrant natural colours, criss-crossed by trickling waterways and winding paths. As you tread the rainforest boardwalk, flanked by flapping fern fronds, keep your eyes peeled for resident critters. Possums, bats and water dragons all call Roma Street Parklands home.



1 Parkland Boulevard, Brisbane Queensland 4000









Shorncliffe Beach

When the sun’s blazing, pack up a picnic or some barbecue and head to Shorncliffe for an afternoon on the beach. Bordered by a children’s playground called Lower Moora Park, the kids can play the hours away while grown-ups enjoy a stroll on the pier. Outside of donwtown Brisbane, it’s a peaceful area that can be easily reached by train.








Tangalooma Beach

Hop on board a day cruise and float your way across the water to Tangalooma Island Resort on the beautiful Moreton Island. A real paradise, those looking to relax can lay back on the white sand as clear blue waters lap at the shore. Can’t sit still for long? Enjoy a ton of activities from sand dune tobogganing to shipwreck snorkeling, and even wild dolphin feeding.








Redcliffe

On sunny days in the city, sometimes you need to escape to a more relaxed place. This little bay-side town is just up the coast from Brisbane, and it’s the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle. Explore Scarborough Park, bike along the pretty promenade, or sit on a bench and watch colorful kites fluttering in the sky.








Moreton Island Day Trip

Moreton Island really is a little slice of paradise. Clear lagoons are surrounded by lush forest and rolling dunes. You can bob along the lakes on a kayak, snorkel through shipwrecks, or zoom around on a four wheeler. Better yet, just relax on the white sandy beaches and take it all in. The hardest part is fitting it all into a day!








Currumbin Beach

This beach is a favorite with locals. There’s something for every warm-weather lover here – long boarders zip on the surf, stand-up paddle boarders bob through the gentle waves, anglers cast their hooks off the rock wall, and beach bums soak up sun on the sand!








City Botanic Gardens

Nestled in Brisbane’s Central Business District, these gardens provide a perfect relief from the city buzz. Step through the gates and you’ll be immediately transported into a haven of lush lawns, funky plants, and serene ponds. Highlights include the romantic Bamboo Grove and Weeping Fig Avenue, plus beautiful views over the river.








Roma Street Parkland

Roma Street Parkland was made for afternoon walks. It’s a maze of vibrant natural colors, crossed by trickling waterways and winding paths. When you walk across the rain-forest boardwalk, keep an eye out for critters. Possums, bats, and water dragons all call Roma Street Parklands home.








Mount Coot-tha Forest

Mount Coot-tha Forest is a natural wonderland on the edge of the city, with around 370 animal species scampering and fluttering through its undergrowth. As you wander the trails, don’t forget to look up, down and all around. You never know where the native goshawks, possums, bats and creepy-crawlies might be!








Brisbane Forest Park

With so many amazing national parks in and around Brisbane, this particular one doesn’t have the reputation it deserves. Perfect for visitors looking for a quiet day out, start off at the Walkabout Creek Information Centre and choose between two bush tracks. One through a lush Eucalypt forest, the other skirting round Enoggera Reservoir before looping through woodlands that are home to thousands of chirping birds.

Popular Neighborhoods in Brisbane












Brisbane Central Business District


64 properties

Brizzie’s busy business district. This cluster of shiny skyscrapers is where suited and booted professionals earn their corn. Shopaholics flock to the Myer Centre, while plant lovers flee the crowds for the Botanic Gardens. Come dinnertime, you’re spoiled for choice – burger fiends head to Red Hook and seafood lovers flock to Jellyfish.

Accommodations in Brisbane Central Business District













South Brisbane


33 properties

Brisbane’s heart of art. Spend an enriching morning among the artwork of QAGOMA Museum, then snap up local designs at funky South Bank Markets. The park that surrounds it is a prime strolling spot, where buskers’ melodies will put a spring in your step. Dash to Max Brenner for a gourmet sugar rush, or for craft beer nirvana head to Tomahawk.

Accommodations in South Brisbane













Fortitude Valley


23 properties

The life and soul. This buzzing district comes alive after dark, with more bars and clubs than you can shake a stick at. Ric’s Bar serves up live tunes from local indie bands, while The Bowery’s chic Yankee vibe will put you in a New York state of mind. If you’re after a touch of class, glam up among the glitz and glamour of Cloud Land.

Accommodations in Fortitude Valley













Kangaroo Point


19 properties

River views a go-go. Kangaroo Point is a thin peninsula gently skirted by the Brisbane River. Take your pick from The Cliffs Café and Riverbar for waterside munching, or go DIY-style with a barbecue on Kangaroo Point Cliffs. If you prefer adrenaline to caffeine, take the Story Bridge Adventure Climb to see the city from a different angle.

Accommodations in Kangaroo Point













New Farm


10 properties

There’s nothing bumpkin-like about this farm. New Farm’s tree-lined streets and old Queenslander-style houses are home to Brisbane’s movers-and-shakers. The Powerhouse has transformed from power station to edgy arts venue, and it’s now the hottest ticket in town. Soak up the sophistication over lunch in Vue Lounge or Blurred Coffee Lounge.

Local Tips for Brisbane







Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary




by Sarah

When Sarah’s not hitting the shops, she’s planning her next trip in the sun to Hawaii.


If cuddling a koala ranks highly on your Aussie checklist, then don’t miss out on a visit to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. There’s plenty of native Australian wildlife to fascinate you including kangaroos, wombats and slithering snakes. You can even get a kiss from a cheeky dingo.

Joana loves her job where she has spent the last 4 months looking after Brisbane hotels.


Pack a picnic, grab some friends and head to New Farm Park to escape the hustle and bustle. Overlooking the Brisbane River, this leafy haven is a top spot to relax or watch locals go about their lives. If you’re traveling back to the CBD, why not hop on the ferry for a lovely river cruise.

Joanne’s first trip to ‘Brisvegas’ was part of a campervan road trip she did around Australia.


The Brisbane River is an extension of the CBD’s buzzing atmosphere and offers plenty of fun things to do. Enjoy a cocktail while marvelling the glittering reflections of the Story Bridge, or board the free City Hopper Ferry to explore Southbank’s man-made beach or trendy Dockside.

Fortitude Valley




by Natalie

Shop ‘til you drop is Natalie’s life motto, and she also digs a good day at the beach.


Fortitude Valley is a vibrant entertainment district like no other. Slightly hipster, yet sophisticated with an urban edge, ‘The Valley’ has a lot to offer. Chow down a casual dinner in Chinatown, or put your party pants on for a night of dancing to DJs in one of the cool bars or clubs.

Brisbane’s Southbank precinct




by Martine

Nothing wakes Martine up like an invigorating ocean swim or walk along the beach.


Southbank is an unlikely tropical paradise in the heart of a concrete jungle. This man-made beach is perfect for a refreshing swim, or to tan on the sand under a palm tree. The surrounding parklands feature outdoor yoga classes as well as cafes for a latte fix.

Night kayaking on the Brisbane River




by Leigh

Leigh keeps herself fit by playing netball and Oztag football, she also loves to watch sport.


Just when you thought water sports couldn’t get more adventurous, Brissy steps it up with a night kayaking experience.  Paddling down the river is possibly the best way to soak in the shimmering city skyline. If you’ve worked up a hunger, there are also nibbles and drinks included.

Brisbane Transportation









Air – Brisbane Airport



The fastest and cheapest connection from Brisbane Airport to the city centre is the Brisbane Airtrain. The journey takes around 25 minutes, and services depart every 15 minutes from 05:00-22:00 on weekdays and 06:00-22:00 on weekends. Tickets are $17 one way, kids under 14 travel free. Con-x-ion Airport Transfers offers a door-to-door shuttle for $49 one way, or taxi fares start at $55, both are about a 30-minute drive. There are also rental car desks.




Brisbane Airport
www.bne.com.au











Car



Renting a car to explore the CBD is not necessary due to the compact size of the city, however it can be convenient for exploring the outer suburbs and attractions. Car hire starts from $40 per day, not including petrol and insurance. Parking in the city is usually limited and quite expensive. On-street parking is time restricted and costs around $4.40 an hour, and secure car park prices can be over $18 an hour.










Ferry



Certainly the most scenic way to travel, the CityCat and CityFerry services operate along the Brisbane River between St Lucia and Hamilton, with 25 stops. Ferries depart every 15 minutes, daily, between 08:30 and 23:30. Ticketing options include the ‘Go Card’ or a single ticket, with fares ranging from AUD 3-17 depending on length of journey. The free CityHopper service runs every 30 minutes from 06.00 until 00.00, between Sydney Street, New Farm and North Quay.




Brisbane City Council Transport
translink.com.au











Bus



If your feet are weary, the easiest way to explore the city centre is using the free city loop buses. The city loop includes stops at Central Station, Queen Street Mall and City Botanic Gardens, and there is also a Spring Hill loop. Both the buses and the bus stops are red in colour. Services depart every 15 minutes between 07:00 and 18:00. There is also a paid bus service connecting to the outer suburbs.




Tanslink
translink.com.au











Taxi



Brisbane is a compact city that is easy to navigate by walking or utilising the efficient public transport systems. Taxis are a more expensive option, and are most useful for connecting to the airport. If required, taxis can be pre-booked, hailed from the street or found at a rank. Fares are around $2.15 per kilometre, with a $3-$6 flag fall depending on time of day.










Train



Central and Roma Street are Brisbane’s main train stations. The train network is best used for connecting to outer suburbs and attractions. There are also train lines that extend to the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. Service hours and frequency varies depending on the line, check the Translink website for more information. Tickets range from $3-30; you can buy a top-up ‘Go Card’ or paper tickets at most stations.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
