Visit Rome: Your Travel Guide


If one word could capture the essence of this historic city, it would be "drama." Start your day at the incredible Pantheon, followed by a gelato at the Trevi Fountain. Enjoy a pizza and dance the night away in vivacious Trastevere.

Things to Do in Rome









Victor Emmanuel II Monument

This spectacular but controversial monument was built to honor Victor Emmanuel II, the first King of unified Italy. The building hosts the admission-free Museo Centrale del Risorgimento and a rooftop bar. The monument holds the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, built after World War I, and also hosts exhibitions by some of the greatest 20th-century artists.



Piazza Venezia, 00186 Rome




Open every day 9:30 am – 6:30 pm









Roman Forum

Rome’s world dominance may be a thing of the ancient past, but its ruins are an eternal reminder of what once was. The Roman Forum was originally used as a marketplace in the ancient world, but also saw frequent processions, the occasional trial, and even gladiatorial battles. You’ll still spot remarkable details and craftsmanship in the buildings, shrines and temples.



Via dei Fori Imperiali, Rome




Open every day 8:30 am – 7:15 pm; changes seasonally (check website for details)









Pantheon

The Pantheon has been a model of perfection for almost 18 centuries. Known for its perfect symmetry (the diameter of the dome is equal to the building’s height), it’s one of the most well preserved buildings of Ancient Rome – and an enduring symbol of architectural perfection. It’s also the resting place of King Vittorio Emanuele II, Umberto I, and the artist Rafael.



Via dei Pastini 17, 00186 Rome, Italy




Open Monday to Saturday 9 am – 7:30 pm, Sunday 9 am – 6 pm









Trevi Fountain

Much to the annoyance of his fellow gods who chose to simply materialize, Oceanus preferred to travel by cumbersome shell-shaped chariot. Constructed in 1762 at the height of the baroque, the Trevi Fountain is one of the world’s most elaborate – and romantic – fountains, with Oceanus as its centerpiece. If you're thinking of taking a dip, beware of the vigilant fountain police!



Piazza di Trevi, 00187 Rome









Piazza Navona

Pope Innocent X was the king of 17th-century renovation, turning an unused stadium into a bustling square. You’ll see the extravagant Fountain of the Four Rivers by Bernini, whose archrival Borromini created The Church of St. Agnes in Agone on the western side of the square. 17th-century drama aside, today Piazza Navona is home to many restaurants and cafés.



Piazza Navona, 00186 Rome









Campo de' Fiori

You’d typically visit this square to enjoy a slice of gourmet pizza in the colorful street markets – but once upon a time, the square was the site of gruesome executions. The centerpiece is the Statue of Giordano Bruno, who overlooks the restaurants and bars. There's plenty of imbibing going on here in the evening, when the square transforms into a popular nighttime hangout.



Piazza Campo de' Fiori, 00186 Rome




Open every day









Colosseum

Picture this: you’re witnessing a bloody battle to the death, along with 60,000 screaming Romans. Mercifully, gladiatorial fights are a thing of the past, but you’ll definitely be mentally transported to historic times on a visit to the Colosseum. The stone, brick and concrete structure has been standing since 70 AD, constructed by order of the Roman Emperor Vespasian.



Piazza del Colosseo 1, Rome




Open every day 8:30 am – 7:15 pm; changes seasonally (check website for details)









Piazza di Spagna

Piazza di Spagna has an eloquent and romantic language all its own. The square is the perfect place to people-watch; take note of the fashionable people coming from the direction of Via del Corso. Explore the Church of Trinità dei Monti or the Keats-Shelley House, which was dedicated to the English romantic poets who were obsessed with Rome.



Piazza di Spagna, 00187 Rome









Castel Sant'Angelo

Hadrian was a vain emperor, building monuments to himself all throughout Italy. Hadrian’s mausoleum was originally constructed around 135 AD and over time evolved into a fortress, castle, and even a prison. Today it’s a museum containing sculptures, hidden causeways and ancient ruins. Ponte Sant’Angelo bridge has statues of angels sculpted by Bernini and his students.



Lungotevere Castello 50, Rome




Open Tuesday to Sunday 9 am – 7:30 pm









St. Peter's Basilica

How would you dress for a meeting with the pope? Book well in advance for an audience with the Pontiff himself, or just explore this spectacular church. The interior is a celestial wonder filled with religious artwork, including Michelangelo’s Pietà. This towering Renaissance-Baroque cathedral can be seen from all over Rome and holds up to 80,000 people during mass.



Piazza San Pietro, 00120 Città del Vaticano, Vatican City




Open every day 7 am – 7 pm









Arch of Constantine

Built to commemorate Emperor Constantine’s victory at the battle of Milvian Bridge, this monumental marble structure is the empire’s largest surviving triumphal arch, looming at over 68 feet high. Dating back to 315 AD, many of its features are even older, with panels repurposed from the time of Emperor Hadrian’s rule almost 200 years earlier. Even the statue of Constantine is secondhand – with its original face resculpted to look like him instead!








The Capuchin Crypt

This breathtaking underground crypt greets guests with a thought-provoking sign, reading: “What you are now we used to be, what we are now you will be.” Constructed between 1528 and 1870, it’s an archaeologist’s dream. Macabre yet strangely beautiful, six small chambers are adorned with ornate patterns and motifs created completely from human bones that spiral from floor to ceiling.








Musei Capitolini

A collection of art, archaeology and culture, the Capitoline Museum buildings date back to the 12th through 16th centuries AD. Together they are considered the first museum in the world. Located in Piazza del Campidoglio, the three main buildings, Palazzo Senatorio; Palazzo dei Conservatori; and Palazzo Nuovo, are packed with ancient artifacts, statues, artworks, jewels and more – a true catalog of Imperial Rome, and a history-lover's paradise.








The Pyramid of Cestius

Rome’s only remaining pyramid, this was once an extravagant tomb designed for magistrate and politician, Caius Cestius. His remains have been mysteriously missing for centuries – though a tunnel inside the burial chamber suggests foul play by medieval grave robbers. Formerly overlooked by tourists and locals due to its blackened exterior, the marble monument has recently undergone extensive restorations and can now be toured every weekend.








St. Peter’s Basilica

Archaeologists excavating the Basilica in the 1940s unearthed what is believed to be the bones of St. Peter himself. The almost 2,000-year-old remains were accompanied by ancient graffiti, translating to "Peter is here." Known as the Vatican Scavi or Necropolis, visits can be arranged by contacting the Vatican directly – but with restrictions on visitor numbers, you’ll need to book far in advance!








Saint Peter's Cathedral

At the very center of Rome and the Vatican, this vast basilica is absolutely stunning. Scale the heights of the dome to get breathtaking city views or walk the hallowed, marble nave that’s embellished to the nines with gold and handcrafted frescos.








Capitoline Museums

If monuments are your thing, then you can't miss this collection of the world’s oldest museums. Sculptures, statues, and hand-painted masterpieces adorn halls in this accumulation of treasures. Take the tunnel connecting Palazzo dei Conservatori to Palazzo Nuovo’s collection, through the Tabularium – home to Ancient Rome’s archives.








The Catacombs

Once the tombs of thousands, this subterranean Roman maze takes you into the depths of the city’s complex history as you’re guided through one dark alley after another. Eerie and intriguing, these tunnels have witnessed Gothic pillages and provided a resting place for popes, saints and martyrs alike.








Sant Angelo Castle

An imposing rotunda – this is where Emperor Hadrian was laid to rest. Inside, a trove of artwork draws crowds to this striking monument that has served as a barracks, papal residence, and defender of the capital city.








Villa Borghese Gardens

Villa Borghese has something for everyone. Culture vultures will lap up the Galleria Borghese, an art museum stuffed with pieces that include paintings by Titian and sculptures by Bernini. If you need a break from the subtleties of marble and paintwork, head outside and wander around the immense landscaped garden.








Pompeii Day Trip

Like prehistoric beasts preserved in amber, the town of Pompeii lies frozen in time. This coastal town, just a 2.5-hour drive from Rome, was showered in ash when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD – and its people, buildings, and streets can be found just as they were when the disaster occurred. It’s as eerie as it is fascinating.








Villa Borghese

Villa Borghese has something for everyone. Culture vultures will lap up the Galleria Borghese, an art museum stuffed with pieces that include paintings by Titian and sculptures by Bernini. If you need a break from the subtleties of marble and paintwork, head outside and wander around the immense landscaped garden.








Trastevere

When in Rome, do as the Romans do – and that means eating in Trastevere. This traditional neighborhood is all cobblestone streets and bustling squares lined with charming family-run restaurants, perfect for sampling authentic Italian cooking. As soon as you’ve eaten your fill, pick out a sidewalk cafe to sip an espresso and watch the world go by.








Testaccio

It’s a little off the beaten path, but you won't run into any tourist traps in Testaccio. This thriving working class district offers up a taste of the real Rome with its popular food scene. Housed in a modern building, its bustling market is actually one of the oldest in the city, and the neighborhood restaurants dish up simple but authentic Roman cuisine.








Monti

Hidden in plain sight, this tiny downtown neighborhood was long overlooked in favor of Rome’s more famous landmarks. But today, its thriving alternative scene has made Monti a haven for hipsters and foodies. Beautiful old buildings house artisanal bakeries and boho bistros, and the main square is lined with gelaterias, cafes and bars.








Ostia Antica

Only 20 minutes from Piramide Station by train, Ostia Antica was the first colony of the Roman Empire and was used as a seaport and commercial centre. Ostia Antica well-preserved ruins contain the remains of a Roman thermal bath, theatre and gym.








The Pantheon

The Pantheon has been a model of perfection for almost 18 centuries. Known for its perfect symmetry (the diameter of the dome is equal to the building’s height), it’s one of the most well preserved buildings of Ancient Rome – and an enduring symbol of architectural perfection. It’s also the resting place of King Vittorio Emanuele II, Umberto I and the artist Rafael.








Fontana di Trevi

Much to the annoyance of his fellow gods who chose to simply materialise, Oceanus preferred to travel by cumbersome shell-shaped chariot. Constructed in 1762 at the height of the baroque, the Trevi Fountain is one of the world’s most elaborate – and romantic – fountains. The God Oceanus is the fountain’s centrepiece. Swimmers take heed: beware of the vigilant fountain police!








Castel Sant Angelo

Hadrian’s architectural legacy is giant, so it make sense that his final resting place has such a colorful history. Originally constructed around 135 AD, over time this mausoleum evolved into a fortress, a castle…even a prison. Today it’s a museum containing sculptures, hidden highways, and ancient ruins. Book a guided tour to get the full story of this ever-changing monument.








Chiesa del Gesu

If you’re into your ecclesiastical history, you can’t miss this church. Saint Ignatius of Loyola—founder of the Jesuit order—lived in this building for the last 12 years of his life. You can visit his private apartments and lavish tomb, and come face-to-face with one of the church’s most well-known historical figures.

How can you enjoy the sights in Rome while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


We went second weekend of November, lucky with sunshine and temp was 20 degrees, so comfortably warm and just into their winter season so fewer tourists. Avoid visiting churches on Sundays as services in progress means restrictions.  Mondays some museums closed. Get a tour guide for some things, essential for the vatican, otherwise it is a visual overload with no time to consult the info, so much better to listen as you look. Vatican is always crowded so easier to follow your guide and also prepaying means you avoid the huge queues to buy tickets. Angel Tours highly recommended. When going to the Colosseum, choose the Palatine Hill ticket entrance to avoid long queues at Colosseum entrance.

What's the best way to make the most of Rome by foot?





Anonymous


From the airport you can get a train to the central station, Termine. Here you can get a 'Rome Pass', for either 2 or 3 days, the latter being about €25. This gives you free access to the metro as well as all buses, so getting around is very easy. Although it is more enjoyable to walk the city as most of the attractions are close by and you get to experience how the city feels. The Rome pass also offers free entry to 2 attractions which also allows you to queue jump. The Coliseum is naturally very popular so making this one of your freebies is a good idea. Also the Villa Borghese is a bit more expensive than other attractions, so again a good choice as a freebie

If you don't have an appreciation for art, but plan to see any museums (even ONE) it is a good idea to maybe study some of the better-know artists and sculptors of that time; It's hard to get an idea from the guide books as to just how much art there is - there is SO much to see; without an appreciation of what you're looking at, it all starts to look the same; in our experience, it was VERY helpful to have a tour guide - very well worth the money as we were able to make the very most of what we were seeing;

Difficult choice, there are so many beautiful churches in rome and they all have their own secret. Here's one favorite of mine: The S. Giovanni in Laterano. Enjoy the beauty of the church and then walk to the back of the church. On the left there are four pillars. If two people stand across each other and one whispers into the pillar, the other person across can hear it in the other pillar. Look it up, its astonishing! And like this other churches bare secrets too.

How can you get the most authentic cultural experience in Rome?





Anonymous


By heading to a restaurant, café or bar. The Romans love to eat and they have plenty to offer. Just sitting outside in the shade of a local café with a pint or a coffee and let the world go by around you. Pick up the lingo by listening on how the locals greet each other with passion and charm. Otherwise sit by a fountain or on a bench somewhere and just watch life in Rome unfold in front of you. Just watch for the beggers and pickpockets.

Transportation





Rome Transportation









Air – Fiumicino-Leonardo da Vinci Airport



Fiumicino-Leonardo da Vinci Airport is the largest airport in Italy, approximately 19 miles from the center. The most convenient connection to Termini Station (Rome’s central station) is by train, which runs every 30 minutes until 11:30 pm and takes 30 minutes. A single-journey ticket costs around EUR 14. Buses are cheaper still and can be booked online. Taxis are readily available outside the terminal and cost around EUR 48 to the center.




Rome Fiumicino Airport
www.adr.it











Air – Ciampino Airport



Ciampino Airport is Rome’s second airport. It's mostly used by low-cost carriers and is about 7.5 miles from central Rome. The cheapest central connection is by Terravision or SIT bus to Termini Station which takes 40 minutes and costs around EUR 4. As an alternative, take a bus to Anagnina Metro Station and connect to your final destination. A taxi costs around EUR 30 and takes 30-40 minutes.




Ciampino Airport
www.adr.it











Metro



Rome has a reasonably good metro system that makes it the easiest way to move around the city. The metro has 2 lines, A and B, that merge at Termini Train Station. Tickets can be purchased at any tobacco shop, newsstand or ticket office. If you’re visiting for a few days, it’s cheaper to buy tickets for 1, 3 or 7 days. A single-journey ticket costs around EUR 1.50.




ATAC Roma
www.atac.roma.it











Train



Termini Station is Rome’s main station. Transportation within Rome is easier with the metro, as the train is normally used only for outlying suburbs. If you’d like to take a day trip to other Italian cities like Florence, Bologna or Naples (or back to the Fiumicino airport), purchase a ticket from the service desks at Termini Station or in advance online.




Italo Treno
www.italotreno.it











Taxi



Taxis are widely available throughout Rome, particularly at taxi stands around stations – look for the large orange "Taxi" signs. To avoid being ripped off, only take official taxis that are white and marked with the acronym SPQR. A small surcharge applies during the day and costs slightly more at night. Signaling a taxi from the street is possible, but can be difficult at night.










Bus



Rome’s well-networked bus services can be daunting for visitors. You have to buy daily, weekly or monthly tickets before boarding the bus from tobacco shops ("tabacchi") – and tickets must be validated on board. Buses often don’t run on schedule. Night buses are available (12 pm – 5:30 am weekdays, every 20 minutes on Fridays and Saturdays). As an alternative, the "Roma Pass" gives you 3 days of bus and metro travel (and reduced attraction fares) for EUR 36.
