“Are you serious? How can you advertise a place like this in Booking.com? But to be fair, the room had a microwave oven and a fridge and at least it had an easily accessible power outlet. Ah yes and the room had blackout curtains which was probably a great idea because otherwise you could probably not sleep from all the lights coming from outside.”

How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
