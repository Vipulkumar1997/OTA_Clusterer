Auckland Travel Guide










Thrilling City of Sails and Volcanoes
Called the "City of Sails" due to the large number of yachts anchored in Waitemata Harbor, Auckland is the largest city of both New Zealand and Polynesia. Built on the Auckland Volcanic Field featuring about 48 extinct volcanoes, this city truly is a blast!
Auckland is a real cultural mix with strong Asian, European, Maori and Polynesian influences, celebrated in frequent festivals and sports events. Some examples of these cultures can be seen at the Auckland War Memorial Museum, one of the best in New Zealand. For more, try the upmarket dining of Viaduct Harbour.
Another must-see is the tallest free-standing tower in the Southern Hemisphere, the Sky Tower. If you’re feeling up to the challenge, you can even perform the Sky Jump, a controlled base jump from 630 feet!
Climbing the volcanic cones as well as the stunning Auckland Harbour Bridge will provide unforgettable, panoramic views of the city’s skyline. For a different perspective, why not try a cruise or sea kayaking?
Getting to the city center is an easy trip from Auckland International Airport. Find modern hotels, comfortable motels and cheap hostels on Booking.com, sure to have the perfect place to stay for your trip.

Great little city, we were there 2 nights and seemed like the right amount of time. We went to Waiheke Island which I highly recommend. The city was clean and had great food, easy to catch ferry to other areas!

Sky City was great and there are some good little cafes around. Don't go too far from CBD as only a few streets away it becomes dodgy and unsafe even during the day. Do your planned activities then get out.

A good entry point for NZ.

A good entry point for NZ. It is a big city but has many great sites within the vicinity. All the necessary transport aspects to other places  in NZ are in place and really easy to use.The traffic though has markedly gotten worse this time (this is our second visit this year). The new highway from airport to city helped but the other roads are packed with cars. Is not the usual thing you expect of New Zealand!

Way bigger than I expected.

Way bigger than I expected. Wasn't aware of how long it would take to get to places outside of the city and ran out of time to do what I wanted but may come back :) Wintergardens were a highlight!

A gateway to visit North island, many good restaurants, easy transportation. The Northern Exploerer train is must do for first time travellers. Take day trips from Auckland to Rotorua, Hobbiton etc. I took a hop on hop off bus to look around Auckland.

”






Heartland Hotel Auckland Airport









“
Excellent Shuttle Service experience, good location, close to the Airport. Staff very nice. The taxi service recommended by the hotel to travel to  downtown Auckland  is $35.00 nzd, which makes travelling to and from the downtown area very reasonable.
”






ibis Budget Auckland Airport









“
Check in staff member was helpful and told me about the flat rate $35 taxi from hotel to Auckland CBD which she could arrange in the morning. Remember to consider this if you wish to go the the city (especially with luggage). Clean room, comfortable bed. Housekeeping staff saw me struggle with my luggage in checking out and offered assistance, which was very kind.
