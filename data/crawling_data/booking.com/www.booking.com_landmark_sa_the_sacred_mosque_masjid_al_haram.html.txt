Everything about this hotel was nice. I travelled for Umrah with my wife, father and mother. They all loved staying in this hotel. Everything seemed new. Quick check in. Comfortable beds. Almost everything was available for use in the room and washroom. Very clean. Quick room service. 24 hrs available shuttle bus to Masjid Al Haram. Breakfast was good. Value for money. Highly recommended. :D

It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
