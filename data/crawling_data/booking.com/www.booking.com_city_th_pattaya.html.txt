Pattaya Central Travel Guide










Eden With an Edge
A paradise of turquoise blue, lush vegetation, and entertainment, Pattaya is a kind of Eden: sometimes as peaceful as its temples and coral banks, and sometimes loose and edgy.
Pattaya Beach is the liveliest area of the city. It runs parallel to the center of the city and the entertainment area, reaching its end near the racy Walking Street. It includes shopping venues like the CentralFestival Pattaya Beach, one of the biggest shopping malls in Asia.
Jomtien Beach, south of Pratamnak Hill, is the more tranquil side of the city. It's made up of beachside Pattaya accommodations, private apartments, shops, bars and restaurants.
Pattaya’s offshore islands of Ko Larn, Ko Krok or Ko Sak are perfect places to enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere, pristine beaches and great scuba diving. To fully get in touch with Thai culture, be sure not to miss the Wat Khao Phra Bat Temple and the Temple of Truth.
Whether arriving at Suvarnabhumi Airport or Don Muang Airport, don’t forget to check the deals on Booking.com before traveling!
