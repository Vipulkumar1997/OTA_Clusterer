Things to Do in Amsterdam









Dam Square

Dam Square is at the heart of Amsterdam, where history and modernity collide. The neoclassical Royal Palace is open to the public, and it’s worth venturing in to see the magnificent foyer and historical rooms of the Royal Family's ceremonial home. The New Church hosts year-round special exhibitions, and Kalverstraat and De Bijenkorf are magnets for shopaholics.



Dam, Amsterdam









Red Light District

You’ll need dark sunglasses to block the pink haze of "De Wallen," the city’s most risqué district. You’ll find a network of side streets with coffee shops (for legal highs), restaurants and Chinatown – punctuated with red-lit windows, shops, and shows dedicated to all forms of adult entertainment. The area's liberal vibe reflects the Dutch tolerance for freedom of expression.



De Wallen, Amsterdam









Anne Frank House

There’s no work of Western non-fiction more pure of heart than "The Diary of a Young Jewish Girl." Written between the ages of 12-14, the book tells the story of Anne Frank and her family, who were deported during Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in WWII. Anne died in Bergen-Belsen at age 15, but her story lives on in this museum – and it’s impossible to walk away unmoved.



Prinsengracht 263-267, 1016 GV Amsterdam




Open weekdays 9 am – 9 pm, weekends 9 am – 10 pm (changes seasonally)









Flower Market

Tiptoe through the tulips at the city's unique floating flower market. Founded in 1862, the market's vendors operate their stalls from houseboats that line the canals between Koningsplein and Vijzelstraat. You'll forget you're in the big city when you pick up the scent of freshly cut roses, chrysanthemums and irises that emanate through the surrounding streets.



Singel 610-616, 1071 AZ Amsterdam




Open Monday to Saturday 9 am – 5:30 pm, Sunday 11 am – 5:30 pm









Rembrandtplein

Suffering from twitchy feet? Treat them on the dance floors of the city's nightclub center. Rembrandt's "Night Watch," rendered as three-dimensional statues, forms the centerpiece of this square, and surrounding Utrechtsestraat and Reguliersdwarsstraat are great places for bistros, boutiques and beyond. Escape is deep-house central and playground of the fun and fabulous.



Rembrandtplein









Leidseplein

Dodging bikes is an Amsterdam rite of passage. So is Leidseplein. Dimly-lit Suzy Wong’s, big 'n' brassy Paradiso and the unending stream of merrymakers bring an undeniable energy to this cobblestone square. Come here any night of the week for a wine, dine or stein. Catch an edgy act at Melkweg, or jostle your way up Leidsestraat for brand-name shopping galore.



Leidseplein









Rijksmuseum

This huge fairy-tale castle is a diamond in the city's landscape. This recently renovated museum contains important works like Rembrandt’s "Night Watch" and Vermeer’s "Milkmaid." It also houses a huge collection of elaborate baroque furniture and religious accoutrements from East and West. Usually packed with tourists, it’s best to arrive early to avoid the lines.



Museumstraat 1, 1071 CJ Amsterdam




Open Monday to Thursday 11 am – 7:30 pm, Friday to Sunday 10:30 am – 9 pm (changes seasonally)









Heineken Experience

Find out what your dad was making in the basement all those years ago in this museum dedicated to the world's favorite fermented beverage. In this interactive museum, you’ll learn all about the beer-making process at the site of the former Heineken brewery, as well as the origins of this iconic Dutch beer brand. At the end of your stay, enjoy a cold beer at the World Bar.



Stadhouderskade 78, Amsterdam




Open Monday to Thursday 11 am – 7:30 pm, Friday to Sunday 11 am – 6:30 pm (changes seasonally)









Van Gogh Museum

The building might be as plain as milk, but inside you'll be basking in the honeyed warmth that radiates from Van Gogh's paintings. The museum houses an impressive collection of Van Gogh's art, including a self-portrait – a masterful study of his lonesome life. Works by his contemporaries also line the walls, including Rodin, Monet and Gauguin. Be early to avoid the lines!



Paulus Potterstraat 7, 1071 CX Amsterdam




Open Monday to Thursday 9 am – 5 pm, Friday 9 am – 10 pm, weekends 9 am – 6 pm









Vondelpark

A stroll around the ponds, trees and flowerbeds of this park could lead to a lucky stroke of inspiration. Named after the Dutch Shakespeare, Joost van den Vondel (1587–1679), Vondelpark is perfect for walking, jogging or just plain old meandering. Try the "Blue Teahouse" – one of four restaurants inside the park – or the Open Air Cinema in the warmer months.



Vondelpark









Amsterdamse Bos

Located on former wetlands at Amsterdam’s southern edge, this sprawling park features a winding network of biking paths. As you zip through forested trails, you’ll come across everything from a petting zoo and boating lake to a nudist beach! If you forget to pack a picnic, there’s a pancake restaurant called Boerderij Meerzicht  that locals love.








Windmills Route

It would be a shame to visit Amsterdam and not see a real windmill in action, especially when nearby Zaanstreek is jam-packed with them. Head northwest of Centraal Station and you’ll hear the whoosh of the region’s windmills after just an hour’s ride. Alternatively, you can take a train straight to Zaandam and rent a bike there.








Ronde Hoep Route

This classic biking route follows the banks of the Amstel River, serving up a mix of urban and rural scenery along the way. You can start from the bustling streets of Amsterdam and head south past Nieuwmarkt Square and the Rembrandt House. At Riekermolen Windmill, stop off for a selfie before carrying on to Middelpolder Nature Park’s pretty meadowlands.








Beachlife Route

Why not escape the buzz of the city and head for the ocean? This popular biking route brings you along the North Sea Canal, all the way from Westpoort Harbor to Zuid-Kennemerland National Park. Here, you’ll ride past acre upon acre of beautiful sand dunes before hitting the open coast. If you need a breather, veer off into the charming old town of Haarlem.








Rondje Markermeer Route

If you want to push yourself, a bike ride around Markermeer lake is just the thing. This 99-mile loop circles the polders, dykes and dams of North Holland, taking in the picturesque seaside towns of Hoorn and Volendam along the way. You’ll be awestruck by the views – and the wind – when crossing the Houtribdijk to Lelystad.








Haarlemmerbuurt

Just minutes from central station, Haarlemmerbuurt’s bustling streets—the Haarlemmerstraat and Haarlemmerdijk—are jam-packed with small independent boutiques, record shops and concept stores, plus cocktail bars, wineries and bistros. In fact, there's so much concentrated into this half-mile stretch, you might forget to explore the rest of the city!








Westerpark

Right in this neighborhood’s namesake park you'll find Westergasfabriek – a repurposed old gas factory now buzzing with the ideas of local and international creatives. Hosting a wide range of shops and galleries, bars, restaurants and even festivals, the calendar is filled with cultural projects and quirky community events in raw, industrial brick surroundings.








Jordaan

A neighborhood with working-class origins and distinctly left political preferences, the Jordaan’s maze-like streets are lined with quaint, crooked buildings and hidden courtyards. Home to a collection of eccentric boutiques, galleries, bookshops and ethical independent stores, it’s a haven away from the bustle of mainstream Amsterdam life.








De Hallen

Once just a tram depot, De Hallen is now a lively cultural hub. Packed to the rafters with a medley of draws, the venue has its own arthouse cinema and weekly craft market, a vibrant events schedule and best of all, a food hall with a range of eclectic eats from some of the city’s best kitchens. It also features its very own 55-room boutique hotel – the perfect base for trendy travelers.








De Pijp

Millennials are drawn to De Pijp's effortlessly hip cocktail places, gastro eateries and independent boutiques. Brunch couldn’t be cooler than at Hutspot, a concept-store-meets-café. Burger-flipping restaurant, The Butcher, even has a secret bar – but you won’t get in without the password. For a sip of authentic, locally brewed beer, Brouwerij Troost is an excellent alternative to the Heineken Experience.








Albert Cuypmarkt

In the heart of De Pijp, locals and tourists move together through the stalls at this sprawling market. Of course there’s the usual fruit, veg, and fish stands, but you’ll also find a wonderful variety of delicacies from all around the world – reams of vibrant fabrics, cool new clothes and quirky jewelery, to name a few. Not to mention hot, caramel-filled stroopwafels to nibble on as you stroll around.








Floating Flower Market

It’s busy, colourful, and smells great. The only one of its kind in the world, the Floating Flower Market is a must on your trip to Amsterdam. While some might see it as a tourist trap, it actually sells very rare bulbs that gardeners around the world will appreciate. If you don’t have green fingers, it’s also a good spot to get some souvenirs and soak up the bustling market vibe.








Keukenhof

The Dutch sure do love flowers, and the Keukenhof is where they go to worship them. An absolutely magnificent display of tulips, hyacinths, daffodils and other bulbs, this flower show runs for a few months each spring. You’ll love exploring the park’s many walking and biking paths, with unique and colourful displays around every bend.








The Hortus Botanicus

Perfect for a rainy day in Amsterdam, the Hortus Botanicus is packed with lush greenhouses and exotic plants. It’s one of the oldest botanical gardens in the world, and you’ll be amazed by the rich history and diverse plant life contained in such a small space. With flowers from the deserts and the tropics, themed outdoor gardens and a butterfly sanctuary, it’s a lovely place for nature- lovers to pass a few hours.








The Flower Strip

If the Dutch are the reigning beauty queens of flowers, the Flower Strip is the jewel in their crown. Stretching for over 30 kilometres between Haarlem and Leiden, these colourful fields are packed with blossoms from January to late May. The rows of red, yellow, pink and green are visible from trains and planes, but it’s best to see them up close. If you love tulips, head here in mid-April.








Amsterdam Forest

Stroll through a majestic English Park in the Dutch capital. The Amsterdam Forest is a sprawling, manmade testament to the wonders of nature. It’s beautiful any time of year, but flower fanatics will love visiting in spring, when the tender shoots of tulips and daffodils begin to bloom.








The Amsterdam Dungeon

Its subject matter may be dark and disturbing, but the Amsterdam Dungeon’s interactive exhibits are anything but tortuous – so long as you enjoy being horrified and fascinated in equal measure. You can expect films and re-enactments about the dastardly Spanish Inquisition, recreations of crude 18th-century medical procedures and live demonstrations of medieval torture devices. Ouch!

Local Tips for Amsterdam







Dappermarkt




by Jennifer

Jennifer continues to discover new things about Amsterdam since she moved here two years ago.


Dappermarkt is one of Amsterdam's oldest markets, where you encounter the "real" Amsterdam. Its noises, sights, smells and sounds will delight you. You can buy everything here from food to clothes and there are even some local delicacies that you can sample in the market.

Accommodations nearby



Dapperstraat 279, 1093 BS Amsterdam

Open Monday to Saturday 9 am – 5 pm








IJ Hallen Vlooienmarkt




by Alessandro

Curious Alessandro loves bold ideas and delving into the underground world of DIY.


When hipsters die they don’t go to heaven, they go to IJhallen. It’s one of the biggest flea markets in Europe and has an amazing location in a converted industrial area.  Because it's covered, it makes the perfect day trip in the summer or winter months.

Accommodations nearby



T.T. Neveritaweg 15, 1033 WB Amsterdam.

Open the first weekend of every month








Durgerdam




by Dena

Dena enjoys local markets, restaurants and shops instead of the main shopping strip.


Durgerdam is an old harbor village east of Amsterdam's city center, in the IJsselmeer. There's a long row of "dyke" houses on the edge, as well as a chapel, harbor and church. It's best to take a bike there on a warm day, to escape the busyness of city life.

Accommodations nearby



Durgerdam

Open every day








Thuishaven




by Hester

Hester hails from the province of Friesland and is an intrepid traveler at heart.


Amsterdam has many great places to party! In the summertime, one of my favorite places is Thuishaven, right next to Mercuriushaven harbor. Every Sunday, the location is transformed into a beach and you can dance all day long with your bare feet in the sand.

Accommodations nearby



Contactweg 60, 1014 BW Amsterdam

Open every Sunday 12 pm – 8 pm (summer only)








Sunday Market




by Suzanne

Suzanne loves the kitchen and feels spoiled by Amsterdam's wonderful variety of eating options.


On the first Sunday of every month, there is a cozy market fair on the industrial Westergasterrein. You'll find a wide variety of food products for sale, as well as art, fashion and design items that cater to every budget. Local businesses also use the area as a creative platform.

Accommodations nearby



Cultuurpark Westergasfabriek  Haarlemmerweg 8-10, 1014 BE Amsterdam

Roest




by Susan

Susan is never prouder to call Amsterdam home than when family and friends visit from Australia.


For a grungier taste of Amsterdam head to Roest! I love the mix of people who meet in this creative industrial site. It plays host to art exhibitions and music gigs, but I mostly go for the people watching and great bar. It’s guaranteed to surprise you (in a good way).

Proeflokaal Wynand Fockink




by Mindy

Mindy misses Amsterdam's diversity when she travels – plus the aggressive cyclists and "Dutch honesty."


Pronouncing the name is fun enough, but I promise it's worth visiting. This cozy small "jenever" (gin) brewery is hidden in the city center near Dam Square. Strike up a conversation with a local while getting educated on this delicious drink and experience "gezelligheid" in the heart of Amsterdam.

Accommodations nearby



Pijlsteeg 31, 1012 HH Amsterdam

Open every day 3 pm – 9 pm








Utrechtsestraat

Amstel River




by Simon

Simon has lived in Amsterdam since the 1980s and senses history on every corner.


When the weather is nice, scores of Amsterdammers take to their bicycles and head toward Ouderkerk aan de Amstel, a quaint little village south of the city. Just follow the bicycle signs to Ouderkerk. After a few minutes, you'll be in green meadows, where cows are grazing peacefully.

Accommodations nearby



Ouderkerk aan de Amstel

Open every day








Vesper Bar (cocktails)




by Daisy

Daisy loves Amsterdam so much that she only leaves when she goes abroad.


Vesper Bar has a perfect balance of modern and innovative design – and delicious cocktails – in one of Amsterdam’s historic neighborhoods. It’s where old and new come together – the perfect metaphor for Amsterdam. A slightly tipsy and romantic walk along the canals back to your hotel is great fun!

Accommodations nearby

Why do people say Amsterdam can be seen best by foot?





Anonymous


Amsterdam is a very pedestrian city that is best seen by foot, or on bicycles, which is the most used method of transportation. Most streets in the city center are very narrow, intersected with the water canals in most areas, and cars are only allowed on the roads during certain hours/days of the week. All this has turned Amsterdam into a very pedestrian friendly city.

How can you get the most authentic cultural experience in Amsterdam?





Anonymous


Look for a guesthouse rather than a hotel.  There is something about staying in the old canal houses (especially when you're North American and many of the houses are older than your country), and being able to come and go from your own apartment-type place on y our own and at your leisure makes it much easier to experience the culture of the place authentically.

What should you avoid to make the most of the nightlife in Amsterdam?

If you're like us, the red lights.  They were more widespread than we were led to believe, as was the drug culture.  While we understand that it is a different place and that many travellers our age are looking for these two aspects of Amsterdam's culture, we were not and they were more pervasive than we were expecting them to be.

The Rijksmuseum is astounding.

Transportation





Amsterdam Transportation









Air



Schiphol is Amsterdam’s main airport. The fastest connection to the center of the city is by train to "Centraal Station." The train terminal is located inside the airport a few yards from the arrival hall. Train journeys take 15 minutes (running every 17 minutes from 5 am – 1 am every day, 1 on the hour between 1 am – 5 am). The bus terminal is right outside, as well as taxi stands (20 minutes to the center). Watch out for unlicensed taxi drivers!




Amsterdam Schiphol Airport
www.schiphol.nl











Train



"Amsterdam Centraal" is the city’s main train station. Tickets are available from the yellow machines inside the station. Trams and buses depart in front of the southern exit, and the (free) ferry to Amsterdam North departs outside the northern exit. For convenience, purchase an "OV-chipkaart" (reusable ticket) from the yellow machines; it's valid for bus, tram, metro and train travel, and you can add credit at the machines at any station.




NS (Train)
www.ns.nl











Bus



Amsterdam has an extensive network of buses that can take you anywhere from a few blocks down the street or to the other side of town. Tickets can be purchased on board, or you can check in and out with a reloadable ticket ("OV-chipkaart" – see the Train section for more details). Buses to international destinations (usually for budget-conscious travelers) normally depart from Amstel Train Station. For all other travelers, trains are best for speed and convenience.




GVB
en.gvb.nl











Taxi



Taxis are an expensive way to get around in Amsterdam due to the abundance of small, one-way streets. However, they're readily available – just hail one from the street, visit a taxi stand or ask your hotel to reserve one for you. Smartphone users should definitely download the "Taxi Nu" app – with one touch, you can order a taxi anywhere within the city and it will be there in minutes.




TCA (Taxi Company Amsterdam)
www.tcataxi.nl











Car



Amsterdam is accessible by the A10 beltway that circles the city. Exits ("s" routes) connect you with different districts. However, be aware: Amsterdam has many narrow and one-way streets, canals, bridges and tram lines – not to mention thousands of bikers – that make driving treacherous and even dangerous for the inexperienced. If you need to rent a car, it's best to book a week or two before you arrive for the best deals.










Bike



The best way to see Amsterdam is with old-fashioned leg power. You can rent a bike from many locations, especially near train stations – just look for signs that say "fiets" (bike); "MacBike" is a popular option. You’ll see people of all ages biking everywhere. With clearly marked bike lanes everywhere, it’s the fastest way to move around this flat city – just make sure to check in all directions for car, tram and foot traffic.




Macbike
www.macbike.nl











Tram



By far the most efficient way to move around Amsterdam (second only to bikes), the city’s tram network connects the center of the city with almost every district. One-hour tickets are available on board and multi-day cards at machines in metro and train stations. Your "OV-chipkaart" (see the Train section) can also be used to check in and out. If you’re on foot, be very careful when walking near the trams!
