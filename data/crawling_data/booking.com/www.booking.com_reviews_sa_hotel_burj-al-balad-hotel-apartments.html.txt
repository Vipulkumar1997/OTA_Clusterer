Booking.com Guest Review Guidelines

To keep the rating score and review content relevant for your upcoming trip, we archive reviews older than 24 months.

Only a customer who has booked through Booking.com and stayed at the property in question can write a review. This allows us to verify that our reviews come from real guests like you. Who better to tell others about the free breakfast, friendly staff, or their comfortable room than someone who’s stayed at the property?

We want you to share your story, with both the good and the not-so-good. All we ask is that you follow a few simple guidelines.

Reviews Vision

We believe review contributions and property responses will highlight a wide range of opinions and experiences, which is critical in helping guests make informed decisions about where to stay.

Reviews Principles

Contributions to Booking.com are a reflection of the dedication of our guests and properties, so we treat them with the utmost respect.

Whether negative or positive, we'll post every comment in full and as quickly as possible, provided the guidelines are met. We'll also provide transparency over the status of submitted content.

We'll use the same guidelines and standards for all user-generated content, and for the property responses to that content.

We'll allow the contributions to speak for themselves, and we won’t be the judge of reality. Booking.com’s role is to be a feedback distributor for both guests and properties.

Guidelines and Standards for Reviews

These guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly, without limiting expression or strong opinions. They're also applicable regardless of the comment's tone.

Contributions should be travel related.
The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don’t include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com’s services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams.

Contributions should be appropriate for a global audience.
Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, or the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted.

All content should be genuine and unique to the guest.
Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated.

Respect the privacy of others.
Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and other similar details.

The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties, and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.

눉
Check out at 12:00 noon. The shower had a clogged drainage hole. Some insects (not much). Noisy area as the windows are not soundproof. No kitchen (despite a kitchen was shown in the photos on booking site). The mirror in the room was too low as if it was made to be used by children only ( you cannot see above your shirt's pocket in the mirror, you have to kneel down). No towels were there. But all are acceptable compared to the small amount of money paid, that's all.
눇
Great location, near Al-Baik restaurant, in the middle of the city where you can find all your needs nearby. Good for travellers without private cars (Don't go there if you have a car, the hotel already mentioned there is no parking there and they really mean it). Comfort bed & good range of TV channels are available. AC was good. Good staff. Easy check in & out. Cheap price, makes an acceptable value for money paid against service offered.

- No Parking (the biggest issue), although I managed somehow to park my car at the backside of this apartment.- Observed some cockroaches in bathroom and in kitchen.- AC was on the floor (not on the wall), which was quite uncomfortable at times, especially it was bad for kids as they were playing with its direct air.
눇
- Location is quite good, near to famous restaurants i.e., Al Baik, MacDonald's, Corniche and old Jeddah.- Staff was quite supportive.- Beds were comfy.- Room service was great.- It was great value for money.- All the things were available as per description such as microwave oven, some kitchen utensils, fridge, nice electric stove etc.

1. we booked days before our arrival. when we arrived in the hotel, we were asked to wait coz the rooms are being cleaned. so we did. then a group of girls walked in with no prior bookings. just after a few minutes, they got their room keys. i mean... what the??when i confronted the reception about this... he said, they are family, your single. and your booking is at 12nn (we arrive around quarter to noon). his explanation rose more questions than answers..2. the cups and glasses are not clean... its not well maintained3. there's 2 lamps placed on both sides of my bed's headboard... only one is working4. the AC was not enough to cool the entire room.

We check in around 9.30 or 9.45 pm then at 1.30 they call us that its time to check out because we book at 12pm so we stay only for for mor than 12 hours.

No welcome from the staff. Rooms were superficially clean, as long as you didn't look too closely. I found hairs in my bed clothes. The AC was very loud, and didn't cool the room well. The listing mentions the choice to request a quiet room. I did. It was very loud. There are awful windows, that don't close well. It's on a busy road, right next to a large mosque. We were woken not long after 4am with the call to prayer. I was travelling with a friend, and it was the first time I'd booked a hotel there. The listing mentions nothing about mixed sex sharing not allowed unless married and can prove it. We had to book two separate rooms. This place was probably something good in its day, but it's shabby and faded now. It was listed as "Pleasant" in overall reviews. I'd beg to differ.

The only advantage of this place, was that it was cheap.

눉
My stay here was most definitely the worst hotel experience I have ever had. They say only angry people write reviews, and in this case it is true! I am absolutely fuming at the service and quality I experienced here. It started off bad and continued to get worse. After initially tackling the abysmal parking issue, I was offered a room that smelled of mould and damp. Having booked on the same day I couldn't cancel, but was then offered a slightly better room, albeit with its own issues and problems I would later realise. After checking in we quickly left and explored the city of Jeddah. It was on our return that our experience quickly deteriorated. The first issue was the itchy bedding, making it almost impossible to sleep. This coupled with the rock hard pillow reduced me to tossing and turning all night.Another issue was the extremely loud AC. You find it impossible to sleep with the AC on, yet it too hot to sleep without it. You're stuck between a rock and a hard place, leaving you suffering all night.  It was in the morning that I experienced something unimaginable. Upon entering the bathroom I came to realise the door was broken. However this issue was minuscule compared to what would follow. While taking a shower I noticed something wrong. THE WATER WAS BROWN!!!!!!!! In shock I stepped out the shower and thought the issue would just pass, assuming the boiler hadn't been used in months. To my shock the brown water continued and didn't stop. What shocked me even more was that the water when you flush the toilet was also brown! When I went to the reception to complain they weren't surprised at all . It was clearly an ongoing issue. An issue they knew of when renting the room to me. I was then offered another room to shower in, but unsurprisingly it also had brown water. What left me fuming was when the manager suggests that perhaps I just use the cold water.
눇
Moving on to positives - there is a masjid a few meters from the hotel. 👍

눇
The check-in has a conflict.I arrived at 12 midnight and the staff refused to give the room I booked through booking.com because he said check-in type is from 13-21 hours.I was shock because I did not cancel my booked.Then he told me to booked again to change check-in time.So I booked again then it came out same check-in time my previous booking.So I ask the staff why is it the same booking check-in and he answer me ask booking.com.He is crazy I shouted him.The problem is the rate is different from previous booking it's expensive than the previous one.I told them they fooled customer.I warn to report to baladhiya.

For those who want to stay close to the magic of the old Jeddah, this is an excellent choice. It doesn't give you the comfort and impression of a luxury hotel, but in turn the price is low. For me it is important that the place is clean and the service prompt. I got both.

difficulty in locating the hotel because there is no english name.

He did everything we asked us from the WiFi to extra towels and microwave when we needed one.  He made sure that our stay will be a memorable one.  The rooms were big than what I expected. Value for money and the best apartmet hotel that I have been to in Jeddah Balad Area.Value for money. I  definitely recommend this place to everybody who wants to stay in Jeddah.
