Dublin Travel Guide










Great History, Greenery & Pubs
Dublin is home to more than a quarter of the entire Republic of Ireland’s population and was originally founded as a Viking settlement. A lot has changed from those Viking days, and Dublin is now famous for its literary history and the most green spaces of any European capital, making Dublin a real Irish gem.
Dublin Castle is at the heart of the city's history and Trinity College houses the renowned Book of Kells, a beautifully illustrated manuscript from circa 800 AD. The Ha’penny Bridge is the city’s most photographed landmark and the statue of Molly Malone celebrates the heroine of Dublin’s unofficial anthem.
Dublin is home to many important literary figures including Oscar Wilde, William Yeats, Samuel Beckett and George Bernard Shaw. As the famous location of James Joyce’s “Ulysses”, the city offers tours tracing the protagonist’s footsteps.
As one of the youngest European cities, Dublin has vibrant nightlife with the popular Temple Bar area and plenty of bars and pubs, which invite you to stay out until the wee hours of the morning.
Dublin Airport is the gateway to your Irish vacation, so whether you’re looking for a stylish hotel, an independent apartment or a trendy hostel, Booking.com has a perfect deal for your Dublin trip.

City with a lot of charm.

City with a lot of charm. Try to go off the beaten path to explore some of the less tourist-y pubs and activities. Highly recommend the Guinness Storehouse as well as a day trip to Cliffs of Moher or somewhere else across the country.

Please note that early November is not an ideal time to travel in Ireland if you want any kind of nightlife with locals. Otherwise the Guinness Storehouse and Temple Bar Area are lots of fun and well worth the trip.

Dublin was dirty.

Dublin was dirty. Locals downtownwere rough and rude. Would have preferred to stay outside the city. The further out you went, the nicer people got and the more beautiful the scenery was. No subway system and the rail system is limited in reach.

Fun to visit Grafton Street and the Guiness factory.

Fun to visit Grafton Street and the Guiness factory.  Followed Instagram suggested tour saw the book of Kells and cathedrals.  Loads of pubs and charm.  Bus service is cheap and easy to navigate.  Taxi’s are plentiful.  So many unique romantic spots.  Highlight was visiting “the Church” restaurant watching the Irish dancers and hearing the band.  Sit near the stage.








Hotels That Guests Love in Dublin





Clontarf Castle Hotel









“
The room was so wonderful we hated to leave it, even though we just going to dinner upstairs.The food and service upstairs was great. Our first 7nights in Ireland were spent in a Temple Bar hotel. We welcomed the comfort of Clontarf Castle Hotel!
”






Jackson Court Hotel









“
Because hotel is located above and beside Ireland's #1nightclub the security at the hotel is amazing.Located very close to Grafton St.
”






Egans House









“
Very comfortable small hotel, you can either catch a bus to the city or walk comfortably within 30 minutes which we did. Quiet area, we were very happy with our choice for our first few days in Ireland.Good breakfast for 10 euros, worth having as it set us up for the day.
”






Temple Bar Inn









“
The location of the hotel and the comfy bed were my highlights!  The room was great, and I was so looking forward to a great nights sleep prior to embarking on a 6 day tour of Ireland...
”






Ballsbridge Hotel









“
This was the first trip my fiancee and I took to Ireland. We stayed at Hotels and B&BS. The first night was at a hotel rated four stars and we were left gravely disappointed. The last two nights in Ireland we stayed at Ballsbridge (also a four star). It took for ever to find the place but when we called an spoke with Lisa she was fabulous. Then entering the room,we were speachless. The room was beutiful, comfortable, and homey. It was overall a fantastic experience.
