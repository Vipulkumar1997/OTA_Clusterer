Things to Do in Glasgow









Buchanan Street

Buchanan Street measures up for designer shoppers. Browse the House of Fraser for brands like Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan. Set across five finely kept Victorian buildings, the store is a Glasgow institution. Opposite it sits a wrought iron, Art Nouveau peacock, which beckons you into Princes Square Mall to seek chic threads by Vivienne Westwood and the like. Suits you, sir!



Buchanan St, Glasgow G1, UK









George Square

To quote poet Robert Burns, this square is full of “Scots wha hae” – in other words, national heroes. Statues of Burns, author Walter Scott and engineer James Watt dominate a site first built for an English king. No wonder independence debates got heated here! On Hogmanay (New Year’s Eve), Glaswegians put politics aside and link arms to belt out Burns’ song, “Auld Lang Syne”.



George St, Glasgow G2 1DU, UK









Glasgow City Chambers

Don’t let the grey façade fool you – the city council’s HQ springs to life inside. Its grand foyer dazzles from all angles, with mosaic floors and gold-leaf ceilings. Join a tour and climb the Italian marble staircase up to the Banqueting Hall. Trace the story of Glasgow in murals and paintings: from the granting of the city charter to the old shipyards on the River Clyde.



George Square, Glasgow G2 1DU, UK




Open Monday-Friday 09:00-17:00









Glasgow Cathedral

A true survivor. This is the only medieval cathedral to have escaped destruction during the Scottish Reformation. It’s built on the burial site of St Mungo, Glasgow’s patron saint. His tomb sits in the dimly lit crypt on the lower floor. Upstairs, the Gothic-arched roof soars above you, and the stained-glass windows bathe the nave in kaleidoscopic light.



Glasgow Cathedral, Castle Street, Glasgow G4, UK




Open Monday-Saturday 09:30-17:30, Sunday 13:00-17:00









Merchant City

This area became a boomtown in the mid-18th century. Tobacco barons and shipping magnates built grand residences here. Stroll past Ingram Street’s Georgian façades, then duck into the Corinthian Club, whose opulent Victorian setting is spiffing for afternoon tea. Finally, swing by the Italian Centre’s Palazzos to browse flagship stores by Versace and Armani.



27-29 Trongate, Glasgow G1 5EZ, UK









Kelvingrove Museum and Park

This museum is a real head turner, from the floating-face sculptures in the foyer to the century-old pipe organ that bellows out lunchtime recitals. In the Glasgow Style gallery, Charles Mackintosh’s “The Wassail” is the star attraction. Admire the gesso panel's blend of Japonism and Art Nouveau styles – subtle reliefs of plaster, glass beads and tin enrich the plain canvas.



Argyle St, Glasgow G3 8AG, UK




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00









Glasgow Necropolis

This Victorian graveyard is built on the hill where St Mungo first founded the city. He called it “glaschu” – Scots Gaelic for “dear green place”. It’s a sad yet beautiful spot where grey tombstones and mausolea line the grassy inclines. Scale the hill for glorious Glaswegian sunsets, but don’t stay too long – the “City of the Dead” is rather spooky after dark!



Wishard Street, Glasgow, Glasgow G4 0UZ, UK




Open Monday-Sunday 08:30-16:30









People's Palace and Winter Gardens

In 1765, James Watt conceived his world-changing steam engine here on Glasgow Green. Today, it’s the site of a museum that details Glasgow’s boom-and-bust history through photos, films and cultural curios. Delve into 1930s working-class life and 1950s dancehall culture. See the “banana boots” and whiskey-box guitar of Billy Connolly, the local ship welder-turned-star comedian.



Glasgow Green, Glasgow G40 1AT, UK




Open Tuesday-Saturday 10:00-17:00, Sunday 11:00-17:00









University of Glasgow

This imposing institution looks like Harry Potter’s Hogwarts. It’s seen wizardry of its own – the uni is the alma mater of John Logie Baird, inventor of the telly. It was here that the ultrasound image was born, too. Roam the ghostly, neo-Gothic arcade beneath Bute Hall. Then visit the Hunterian, Scotland’s oldest museum. It covers everything from art to zoology.



University Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK




Check website for details.









Botanic Gardens and Kibble Palace

These gardens have attracted plant enthusiasts and picnickers since 1842. Kibble Palace is the largest greenhouse on site – it’s a classic Victorian winter garden of wrought iron and glass. Step inside to see its prize 120-year-old Australian and New Zealand ferns. During fine weather, wander the River Kelvin walkway or lounge with sun-bathing students on the main lawn.



730 Great Western Rd, Glasgow G12 0UE, UK




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-16:00. Check website for details.









Bobar

Bobar is known for its friendly and knowledgeable bar staff. Chat to them about the single malts offered and they’ll help find one that’s right for you. If you’re looking for a specific cocktail that’s not on the menu, don’t worry – they’ll mix it up in a flash, and always with a smile on the side!








Bar Home

This bar definitely lives up to its name. With its friendly staff, chill vibe, and the happy-go-lucky crowd, you’ll feel right at home in no time. Even when the cozy space fills up and the lines at the bar grow, the staff keeps on smiling that Bar Home smile as they pour drinks for thirsty customers.








The Horseshoe Bar

Many 9-to-5ers make the Horseshoe their first stop after clocking out. Unwinding after the stress of the day always ends up with enough banter to go around – so heading here in the early evening is a great way to get familiar with Glasgow’s well-known wit and notorious dialect.

Very Good


Colourful and vibrant.  We ate across the road at the Wetherspoon pub, a great venue for people watching.  We went for the Christmas markets and shopping and visited a few pubs too.  A good couple of days in the city, enjoyed it very much.

Popular Neighborhoods in Glasgow












Central Glasgow


130 properties

The historic centre is a medley of architectural styles. Gaze upon the Italianate city hall on George Square, then head to Little Italy to chomp on top-notch pizza. Spot Doric columns and Palladian windows while bar-hopping in the Merchant City area. Then sip on a cuppa at the Art Nouveau Willow Tea Rooms, designed by Charles Mackintosh himself.

Accommodations in Central Glasgow













North West


102 properties

Glasgow University lends this area a youthful, bohemian vibe. Fresh-faced whippersnappers wander its illustrious campus, and kooky art lovers browse Kelvingrove Park’s galleries. Stop off in a student bar on Ashton Lane – this quaint, cobbled street is the perfect place to debate the Glasgow School’s contribution to Art Nouveau into the wee hours.

Accommodations in North West













South


64 properties

A green belt of possibilities. Among the gardens of Pollok Park lies a gallery with paintings by El Greco and Goya. Then there’s the Burrell Collection – it displays Chinese art in a quiet woodland setting. In Queen’s Park, go “quackers” for duck ponds and nature walks. Or, trace the history of Scottish “fitba” (football) at Hampden Park stadium.

Accommodations in South













East End


18 properties

The East End’s gritty yet charming. Head to Barras Market for classic Glaswegian shopping. Its independent traders sell everything from antiques to kilts. Pop into the Blue Lagoon chip shop to taste a deep-fried Mars bar (at your own risk!). Wash it down with a pint among raucous Celtic FC fans – their green-and-white pubs line Gallowgate Street.

Local Tips for Glasgow







Wander around the West End’s shops




by Emma

Emma’s lived in 5 different European cities but loves returning to her fun and friendly hometown.


One of my favourite things about the West End is its quirky shops. Just off Byers Road, Ruthven Lane brims over with vintage wares, while De Courcy’s Arcade packs in cute boutiques. Stop off in one of the area’s many cafés and take a wander up to Glasgow University’s beautiful campus.

Accommodations nearby



Ruthven Lane, Glasgow, G12

Open Monday-Sunday 09:00-17:00








The Lighthouse, Mitchell Lane




by Jayne

Jayne grew up in the countryside but can appreciate the bustle of big cities.


Formerly the Glasgow Herald newspaper’s HQ, this gem of a building was Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s first public commission. Inside, learn about his life and work in the Mackintosh Interpretation Centre, or take the spiral stairs up to the top floor for skyline views.

Loch Lomond day trip




by Sarah Murphy

Irish-born Sarah lives in London but finds inner peace by travelling in the countryside.


Take a day trip to Loch Lomond’s famous bonny banks! The scenic Balmaha village is within 50 minutes’ drive. Here, hire a rowing boat in the shadow of the Trossachs hills. Or, catch a train to Balloch and take the ferry over to Luss Pier on the western side of the lake.

Butterfly and Pig Tearooms




by Corina Platt

Raised in nearby Greenock, Corina came of age in Glasgow – she lived and studied there for 6 years.


After a night out back home, this is my go-to café for a hearty, cooked breakfast. Its shabby chic, vintage interior is adorable, too. Swing by for a cosy afternoon of tea, sandwiches and homemade cakes!

The journey takes 15 minutes and costs GBP 6.50 one way. Free WiFi is included. You can buy a ticket on board or via First’s mTickets mobile app. The airport is easily accessed by car or taxi thanks to the adjoining M8 motorway. Only official taxis are permitted to pick up passengers outside the arrivals hall.




Glasgow Airport
www.glasgowairport.com











Air - Glasgow Prestwick Airport



Glasgow Prestwick Airport is 53 km south of Glasgow. It offers a direct train to Glasgow Central that takes under an hour. Single fares usually cost GBP 7.80, but show your official flight confirmation and photo ID to receive a half-price discount. Trains run every 20-30 minutes until 23:00. Stagecoach's X77 direct bus reaches Buchanan Street in 45 minutes and costs GBP 5.80 one way. Buses run until 22:40 Monday-Thursday, 02:40 Friday-Saturday and 20:55 on Sunday.




Glasgow Prestwick Airport
www.glasgowprestwick.com











Train



Glasgow’s two main stations offer access to extensive suburban and regional networks. Queen Street Station is in the north inner city. It operates services to both Edinburgh and northern Scotland. The station also lies adjacent to Buchanan Street metro station. Glasgow Central Station, on Argyle Street, connects Glasgow with southern Scotland and the rest of the UK via the West Coast Main Line. A single ticket in greater Glasgow costs between GBP 1.50 and GBP 3.00.




ScotRail
www.scotrail.co.uk











Bus



There are four main bus stations serving Greater Glasgow. Buchanan Bus Station is in the north city centre, opposite the Royal Concert Hall. A single journey costs between GBP 1.20 and GBP 2.00, and tickets are purchased on board – but exact change is required. A one-day ticket is also sold on board and costs between GBP 4.30 and GBP 5.75 – it’s also valid for the 747 service to and from Glasgow Airport. Weekend night buses operate from 12:30-04:30.




First Glasgow
www.firstgroup.com











Underground



Glasgow’s circle-line underground is known locally as “Clockwork Orange”. A loop around its 15 stations takes 24 minutes. St Enoch and Buchanan Street are the central hubs; the latter connects with Queen Street Station's suburban and regional lines. The underground runs from approx. 06:30-23:30 on Monday-Saturday and from 10:00-18:00 on Sunday. A single journey costs GBP 1.40, and all-day tickets are GBP 2.70. Weekly tickets cost GBP 13.00. Under 16s pay half price.




Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT)
www.spt.co.uk











Taxi



Glasgow's famous black cabs can be hailed on the street if their orange light is on. Official taxi ranks are found outside transport hubs like Glasgow Central, Queen Street and Buchanan Street stations. In the West End, there's a rank on Byres Road, outside Hillhead subway station. Queues can be quite long after midnight on weekends. Fares are metered but often include a surcharge after midnight or if travelling outside certain city boundaries.










Car



If you're not a confident driver, avoid driving in Glasgow city centre: there are many one-way streets, bus lanes and pedestrian zones. Glaswegians are not the most patient of drivers, and they particularly dislike hesitancy. Parking restrictions are strictly enforced, and vehicles parked illegally or in an obstructive manner will be towed away. Fines of up to GBP 150 apply.
