FAQs





How do I find out how much commission I'll pay for bookings?

When you add your property to Booking.com, you pay commission for each booking. The commission percentage will be shown at the "Agreement" step of the registration process. At the end of each month, we’ll send you an invoice with the amount of commission owed.



What will happen after I sign up?

After you’ve registered your property, we'll review your information to make sure we have everything we need. Then you’ll receive an email with login details for your Extranet. This is where you’ll go to update your availability and prices. After that, you’ll receive instructions on how to set your property live on Booking.com!
