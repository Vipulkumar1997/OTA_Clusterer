Energy Inn


Review Score: 8.9




“Room is very modern, not too small and cosy enough. Bed is super comfy. Bathroom was clean and the water strength was good. Location was perfect, just a straight walk from the mrt station. Front desk service was superb as well! Definitely a first choice if I come to taipei again.”

How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
