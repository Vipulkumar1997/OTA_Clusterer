Cape Town Travel Guide










Cool, Colorful Cape
Between mountains and beaches, the 2nd largest city in South Africa mixes history, resilient modernity, and a typical laidback African character. From the top of Table Mountain to the colourful Bo Kaap quarter, and from the Victoria & Albert Waterfront to the modern business district, Cape Town blends multicultural influences and beautiful nature.
Known as Kaapstad in Afrikaans, its sunny weather and mild temperatures make it a perfect place to enjoy the large number of beaches that surround it. From Sunset Beach to Hout Bay, and from Simon’s Town to Gordon Bay, this city offers variety that suits all tastes. Whale and dolphin watching is a popular activity in False Bay.
Located on the Cape of Good Hope, the city was founded in 1652 by a Dutch trading company as a way-station for ships travelling to the East Indies. With the settlement process, all sorts of foreign plants were introduced, including the grapes in the famous Cape Winelands District, just outside of Cape Town.
Cape Town’s history does have some darker periods, and some of its memorable places from this time deserve to be visited: Robben Island jail, the City Hall from which Nelson Mandela gave his first public speech, and the statues of the 4 South African Nobel Peace Prize winners on the V&A; Waterfront.

Getting around with Uber is cheap as everything is quite close. It’s a tourist trap though, so rather go shop at markets in smaller suburbs instead of places like waterfront. When going out at night, beware of people saying “nice shoes” as you’re likely to get pick pocketed.

So much to do we squeezed that following:  a wine bus tour, trip to Cape Point, penguin viewing, beaches, Table Mountain, Victoria & Alfred and Water Shed shopping, Old Bisquit Mill, high tea at the Nelson Hotel, Robbin Island tour and water boat harbor ride. We also attended family dinners and a beautiful wedding.  It was worth the 18 hours of flight time!

A couple of nights in Cape Town would be fine.

A couple of nights in Cape Town would be fine. The VA waterfront is vibrant and rather touristy. Good jumping off point to  stay in the Cape winelands. The Wine Safari up Table Mountain is highly recommend and avoids the lengthy line ups for the cable car. Plus you get a lovely picnic with wine! The city bus tour is interesting but take a hat and lots of sun screen. Some of the best seafood is in the  VA mall - Willoughby’s everything from fish and chips to sashimi. Highly recommend. The newly opened modern art gallery is a must see

This was my second trip to Cape Town.

This was my second trip to Cape Town. We had a terrific time checking out the penguins at Boulder Beach, driving to the wineries at Stellenbosch and going on safari at Aquila (though I preferred Pilanesburg outside of Johannesburg). And, of course, Table Mountain, the shopping at Canal Walk and the V&A Waterfront were fun.

This boutique hotel is decorated beautifully, the rooms are gorgeous and comfortable with many lovely added touches (heated bathroom floor, sea-salt for the bathtub, filtered drinking water spigot next to the sink, etc.), the staff is amazing and goes out of their way to provide you with the best experience, the complimentary full breakfast in the onsite restaurant is delicious, and the location is great in a safe neighborhood just a 15-minute walk to the V&A Waterfront.  We loved this hotel and highly recommend it!
