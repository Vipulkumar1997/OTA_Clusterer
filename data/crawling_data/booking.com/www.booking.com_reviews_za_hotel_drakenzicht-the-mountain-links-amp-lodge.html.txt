Booking.com Guest Review Guidelines

To keep the rating score and review content relevant for your upcoming trip, we archive reviews older than 24 months.

Only a customer who has booked through Booking.com and stayed at the property in question can write a review. This allows us to verify that our reviews come from real guests like you. Who better to tell others about the free breakfast, friendly staff, or their comfortable room than someone who’s stayed at the property?

We want you to share your story, with both the good and the not-so-good. All we ask is that you follow a few simple guidelines.

Reviews Vision

We believe review contributions and property responses will highlight a wide range of opinions and experiences, which is critical in helping guests make informed decisions about where to stay.

Reviews Principles

Contributions to Booking.com are a reflection of the dedication of our guests and properties, so we treat them with the utmost respect.

Whether negative or positive, we'll post every comment in full and as quickly as possible, provided the guidelines are met. We'll also provide transparency over the status of submitted content.

We'll use the same guidelines and standards for all user-generated content, and for the property responses to that content.

We'll allow the contributions to speak for themselves, and we won’t be the judge of reality. Booking.com’s role is to be a feedback distributor for both guests and properties.

Guidelines and Standards for Reviews

These guidelines and standards aim to keep the content on Booking.com relevant and family-friendly, without limiting expression or strong opinions. They're also applicable regardless of the comment's tone.

Contributions should be travel related.
The most helpful contributions are detailed and help others make better decisions. Please don’t include personal, political, ethical, or religious commentary. Promotional content will be removed and issues concerning Booking.com’s services should be routed to our Customer Service or Accommodation Service teams.

Contributions should be appropriate for a global audience.
Please avoid using profanity or attempts to approximate profanity with creative spelling, in any language. Comments and media that include hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, sexually explicit remarks, violence, or the promotion of illegal activity are not permitted.

All content should be genuine and unique to the guest.
Reviews are most valuable when they are original and unbiased. Your contribution should be yours. Booking.com property partners should not post on behalf of guests or offer incentives in exchange for reviews. Attempts to bring down the rating of a competitor by submitting a negative review will not be tolerated.

Respect the privacy of others.
Booking.com will make an effort to obscure email addresses, telephone numbers, website addresses, social media accounts, and other similar details.

The opinions expressed in contributions are those of Booking.com customers and properties, and not of Booking.com. Booking.com does not accept responsibility or liability for any reviews or responses. Booking.com is a distributor (without any obligation to verify) and not a publisher of these comments and responses.

The rates are charged per person and not per chalet which I feel was not right. It should explicitly and not changed last minute.
The pool is green and dirty, and does not look the way it does in the pictures 
We were not provided with tea, coffee and milk in our chalet. Had to pay for it
눇
The friendly staff and the views was absolutely breathtaking and spectacular. The chalets are cosy.

The drive up to the lodge was beautiful and the staff/owners were fantastic. My family used this slightly remote location to disconnect and spend quality time together. The escarpment house was in a scenic prime position.

The dirt road is not for any car. Especially not a low one. Would have liked more variety in kitchen facilities in our room since we didn't want to use the restaurant.

The view is amazing. The rooms were neat and the bed was comfy! The staff were all very accommodating and friendly.

Wonderful Location! Great views! Great chalet with private braai and terrace looking over the hills and Golf course. The family that runs this place with their staff does absolutely know about hospitality and service! We had a great evening meal and where taken care of all the time. Thank you Marcelle and Thys for the wonderful stay! Will visit again.

A bit more attention to the cleanliness and facilities of the bungalow would have made the stay absolutely perfect.
눇
We were exceptionally looked after by the owners, who made sure we were comfortable and happy. When we mentioned that we had not shopped before arriving, they were only too happy to help us out with braai packs and vegetables from their garden. Quite amazing service and care - very much appreciated. The Lodge is located in an area of exceptional views, peace and quiet, arrived at via a long dirt road. With the isolation and beauty, we were able to spend long hours on a stunning balcony looking at the valley below. It was totally relaxing and peaceful. The Lodge is also Links golf course (quite a difficult course - but incredibly well maintained and beautiful) and my family enjoyed playing while my children were able to play using clubs generously lent by the owners children. (It is a totally family friendly environment and my children were very welcomed.)All in all it was an amazing holiday. Many thanks for looking after us so well.
