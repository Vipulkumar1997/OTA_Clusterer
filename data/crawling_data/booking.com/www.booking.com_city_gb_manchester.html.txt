Manchester Travel Guide










The Capital of Northern England
With an industrial past and a modern outlook, the complex fabric of Manchester is interlaced with interesting museums, English pubs and shopping centers.
Dash straight into the luxurious Selfridges and Triangle departments stores before checking out the old-English charm of the Shambles.
Manchester wouldn't be the same without its 2 famous football clubs and fans can go wild at either of the Old Trafford or City of Manchester Stadiums. Music fans will adore the many shows performed at the Manchester Arena, the largest of its type in Europe, and the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra.
The cultural foundations of this predominantly red-brick city are on display at the Manchester Museum and the People’s History Museum. If art is you preference, the extensive pre-Raphaelite collection at the Manchester Art Gallery is a sight to behold.
Whether you’re flying into Manchester International Airport for business or partying in one of the 500 bars in city, Booking.com’s hotels and apartments can match your accommodation needs.

Manchester is a beautiful city with some of the warmest, friendliest people I have ever met. It is a very relaxed city with everything a tourist could want - culture, arts, great restaurants for every budget and some really quaint bars. It is very easy to walk around the city or you can take the metro for free!! If you haven't been to Manchester yet, go! You won't regret it.

Lots of great restaurants, bistro’s, museums and shops.

Lots of great restaurants, bistro’s, museums and shops. Easy transport through the centre by making use of the trams. However, there were a lot of homeless people trying to get us to give them money and a lot of the buildings could do with some repairments and renovations.

Beautiful city, beautiful buildings and gorgeous libraries.

Beautiful city, beautiful buildings and gorgeous libraries. I found it a great city to walk around but the free metro shuttles were great too. I was only there for a concert but I wish I could’ve stayed longer.

We went to the match at Old Trafford against Newcastle which was great. Visited Christmas markets which were superb. Also visited Lowry Centre and Trafford centre which were brilliant. Had lovely lunch in Slug and Lettuce and had beautiful dinner in Bella Italia.

Best city in the UK.

Best city in the UK... forget London, too expensive, poor service compared to the friendliness and value for money in Manchester even at high end bars, restaurants and hotels. Also think it's a better night out. Shopping is also amazing and loads to do and see.

Fabulous city with so much to offer and do to keep you busy!

Fabulous city with so much to offer and do to keep you busy! Museums, shops, bars, cafes...easy to fill every minute of your stay come rain or shine!Between The Arndale, King Street, St.Annes Sq, so many shops and cafes. The Northern Quarter, Deansgate Lock’s, Canal Street are a must for many nights out! Curry Mile and China Town have way too many delicious restaurants 😋
