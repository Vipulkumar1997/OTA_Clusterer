Things to Do in Sydney









Sydney Tower Eye and SKYWALK

Sydney Tower Eye and SKYWALK loom in the skyline like a giant needle. Stand on the glass platforms at the observation deck of Sydney’s highest attraction to enjoy a bird’s-eye view of the city; it's definitely not for the squeamish! The tower also features a 4D cinema, two revolving restaurants and a bar.



Level 5/Westfield Centre 100 Market St, Sydney NSW 2000




Open every day 9 am – 9:30 pm









SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium

Discover life under the sea without getting your feet wet. SEA LIFE Sydney Aquarium is centrally located in Darling Harbour and is home to 700 animal species. The aquarium has 14 zones to explore including Shark Valley, Dugong Island and the Bay of Rays. For a closer look, take a behind the scenes tour, ride in a glass bottom boat, or enjoy a day in the life of an aquarist!



1-5 Wheat Rd, Sydney NSW 2000




Open every day 9:30 am – 7 pm









Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain

A long time ago, Old McDonald had a farm, which became an enormous domain. The Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain are at the site of Australia’s first farm. Peruse the Art Gallery of New South Wales or explore the grounds of the historic Government House. The Farm Cove walk takes you from the Opera House to Lady Macquarie’s Chair, which is a spectacular lookout point.



Mrs Macquaries Road Sydney NSW 2000




Open every day 9 am – 5:30 pm









Sydney Opera House

What do the Sydney Philharmonic, Dave Chappelle and Verdi’s Rigoletto have in common? Absolutely nothing, other than the fact that you’ll catch everything from opera to rock concerts, and stand-up comedy to Shakespearean tragedy inside this world-famous iconic building. Go behind the scenes with a guided tour or dine at one of the nearby restaurants.



Bennelong Point, Sydney NSW 2000

Sydney Harbour Bridge

If you’re ok with extraordinary heights, then it's time to grab your gear and start climbing! Scale the 200 steps to the Pylon Lookout atop the world’s tallest steel arch bridge. It has a breathtakingly beautiful 360-degree panorama at 440 feet above sea level. If you're afraid of heights, you can always drive, bike or walk between the Business District and Sydney’s North Shore.



Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney NSW 2000









Luna Park

Luna Park at the foot of the Sydney Harbour Bridge is fun central! Pass under the iconic smiling face and into this theme park filled with rides, entertainment and adventure. Brave the Wild Mouse roller coaster or experience the supernatural sensation of sticking to the walls on The Rotor. Enjoy the harbor views from the top of the Ferris wheel.



1 Olympic Dr, Milsons Point NSW 2061




Check website for details









Taronga Zoo

Charles Darwin would be grabbing his magnifying glass to examine the enormous range of species that call Taronga Zoo home. With a collection of 350 animal species, there are hosts of keeper talks and shows to check out – don’t miss the seals and the free-flight bird show. You can get up close and personal with an animal encounter, feed a giraffe, or even hold a snake!



Bradleys Head Rd, Mosman NSW 2088




Open every day 9:30 am – 4:30 pm; changes seasonally









Port Jackson

The Opera House and Harbour Bridge might be the crown jewels of Sydney, but the real treasure is 150 miles of pristine shoreline. Also known as Sydney Harbour, this large body of water is surrounded by beaches, bays and parks, including Sydney Harbour National Park. You’ll find native wildlife, bushwalks and protected island sanctuaries ready to be explored.



Sydney NSW 2000









Bondi Beach

Slip on your red swimming trunks and reenact the opening theme to "Baywatch" on Bondi Beach. Filled with beautiful young people who have a reputation for being slightly older than their body parts, Bondi is über-trendy, and a great place to soak up the sun. People-watch over a latte, then check out the surf shops on lively Campbell Parade or take the Bondi-to-Coogee coastal walk.



Queen Elizabeth Drive, Sydney NSW 2026









Manly Beach

At Manly Beach, every afternoon is the adventure of a lifetime. Swim between the red and yellow flags or take on the waves with a surf lesson. The Oceanway Walk takes you to Shelley Beach, a fantastic spot for snorkeling and exploring the rock pools. Check out The Corso, a strip of shops and restaurants, or have a picnic of fish and chips on the promenade.



Manly, Sydney NSW 2095









Sydney Ferry Tour of the Harbour

Where better to see the Sydney sights than from the water? Hop on a harbor ferry to get a whole new angle on the city’s iconic shoreline. The 20-minute trip from Circular Quay to Darling Harbour is a shortcut to close-up views of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House, and the historic Manly Ferry cruises out to the stylish northern suburbs.








Sydney Harbour National Park

This stretch of protected shoreline covers some of Sydney Harbour’s best hiking trails and swimming spots. Ferries shuttle day-trippers between the islands and headlands of the Sydney Harbour National Park for peaceful coastal walks, whale-watching sessions, or seaside picnics with jaw-dropping views of the city's skyline.








Sydney Harbour

Is there anything better than ringing in the New Year with fireworks overhead and a glass of champagne in hand? Well, relaxing on a boat in Sydney Harbour—with the world-famous bridge silhouetted in front of you—is pretty hard to beat. Rent your own boat or book early with a cruise company to avoid missing out on this breathtaking scene.








The Star

When it comes to celebrating New Year's Eve in style, The Star is at the center of the universe. Packed with upscale restaurants and chic bars, this casino sparkles with glitzy partiers counting down the clock with bubbly in hand. If you have a feeling that next year's going to be your year, give the roulette table a whirl!








Sydney's Harbour Islands

A classy meal, a Caribbean carnival, or some camping with the family under the stars? Sydney Harbour’s legendary island parties have something for everyone on New Year’s Eve. Head to Clark Island for a romantic dinner, hit the dance floor on Shark Island, or pack your deck chair and take in the amazing fireworks from Cockatoo Island.

Was it cheap, fast, or easy to use? What made it so simple to get around in Sydney?

Public transport was convenient but bus drivers very rude and unfriendly and unhelpful! In other country's the buses have signs telling you the next stop not in Sydney! You get on the bus and have no idea when to get off! The taxi drivers are also very rude and unfriendly, not a first good impression when you arrive into the country!

Transportation





Sydney Transportation









Air



Kingsford Smith is Australia’s busiest airport, and a town in its own right with some 200 shops and a range of restaurants. Airport Link trains are the fastest way into the city and depart every 10 minutes. A taxi to the center will cost you 45 to 55 AUD. For bus services, there are clearly marked bus stops on the arrivals level outside the terminal. Shuttle services and car rentals are also available.




Kingsford Smith Airport
www.sydneyairport.com.au











Train



Central Station is the hub of the Sydney Trains network. Connect to suburban, intercity, country and interstate trains here. Many bus services depart from the adjacent Eddy Avenue and Chalmers Street or from the nearby Railway Square on George Street. Coach bus services depart from Eddy Avenue. Taxi stands are at most major exits.




Sydney Train Information
www.sydneytrains.info











Bus



Sydney’s fleet of air-conditioned buses connects the entire city and is one of the faster ways to get around, thanks to the city’s dedicated bus lanes. Look for the dark blue and yellow signs; timetables are displayed at most stops. Tickets are available on board or at stations, newsstands and convenience stores. For something different, purchase a ticket for the Sydney Explorer bus – these red open-top, double-decker buses stop at 34 of Sydney’s major attractions.




Sydney Buses
www.sydneybuses.info











Taxi



Sydney’s major taxi stands are at Western Forecourt, Elizabeth Street and the corner of Chalmers and Devonshire Streets. It’s easiest to hail a taxi on the street (if the light’s on, it’s available). Taxis are convenient but expensive – drivers might ask where you’re going before they let you in. If you’re traveling late at night, there’s an hour when no taxis are around (usually 3 am); drivers usually change shifts after pubs close.










Light Rail



Sydney’s Light Rail network connects Central Station with Sydney’s Inner West area, extending to Lilyfield. The network has a limited reach and number of stops, so it’s easier and more convenient to take the train or bus to the districts further outside the city. To find light rail stops, look for red signs with "Tram Stop" in white. Tickets are available at ticket machines as well as station ticket offices.




Transdev Sydney
www.transdevsydney.com.au











Car



Several roads run between Kingsford Smith Airport and the city. There are plenty of car rental desks at the airport. Some of these roads incur toll charges, so plan your journey accordingly. With lots of traffic congestion, driving in the city can be intimidating for first-time visitors. Although free on-street parking is virtually non-existent, there are plenty of expensive parking garages that are clearly marked throughout the city.

Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.
