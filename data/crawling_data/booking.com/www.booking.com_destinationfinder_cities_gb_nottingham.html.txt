Things to Do in Nottingham









City of Caves

A world beneath your feet. This network of underground caves was inhabited by Nottingham’s poorest residents for centuries. There are plenty of fascinating tales to be told. Sign up for a guided tour with Annie and Archie, the caves’ in-house archaeologists. They will walk you through the darkened tunnels and spin subterranean yarns that dig to the heart of Nottingham’s past.



1st Floor, Broad Marsh Shopping Centre, Nottingham, NG1 7LL




Open Monday–Sunday 10:00–17:00









Galleries of Justice

“In the clink you go!” Nottingham’s old courthouse and gaol have seen their fair share of gruesome events down the centuries. In fact, this ghoulish museum has even won prizes for its hauntedness! Get the low-down on this house of crime and punishment with one of their guided tours. Take your pick from the Ghost Tour, Terror Tour, Prisoner Tale Tour and more.



High Pavement, The Lace Market, Nottingham, NG1 1HN




Open Monday–Friday 09:00–17:00, Saturday–Sunday 10:00–17:00









Nottingham Castle

Don’t expect turrets. This was once the site of a mighty 11th-century citadel, which was razed back in 1649. According to legend, it was the scene of the final showdown between Robin Hood and the dastardly Sheriff of Nottingham. Today it’s a stately home filled with artwork. It’s also the site of the delightful Trip to Jerusalem pub, which is allegedly the oldest in the world.



Lenton Road, Nottingham, NG1 6EL




Open Monday–Sunday 10:00–17:00









Rock City Nottingham

Rock on! As the name suggests, this music venue is all about volume-up-to-eleven, guitar-based shenanigans. As you’d expect from a rock cathedral, it’s not your average concert hall. Beer’s available in two-pint cups, your feet stick to the floor with every step and the acoustics are finely tuned for connoisseurs’ eardrums. Perfect for a wild night out!



8 Talbot Street, Nottingham, NG1 5GG




Open Monday–Tuesday 10:00–18:00, Wednesday–Saturday 10:00–18:00 and 22:00–03:00









Capital FM Arena Nottingham

Fancy going to a gig? What a capital idea! This sizeable venue has a busy roster of musicians and comedians to get your feet a-tappin’ and your head a-bangin’. It’s seen A-listers galore, from Elton John and Kylie Minogue to Metallica. Don’t hang about for tickets – when it comes to big-name concerts, overnight queues complete with tents are commonplace.



Bolero Square, The Lace Market, Nottingham, NG1 1LA




Open Monday–Friday 09:00–21:00, Saturday 08:00–21:00, Sunday 08:00–17:00









Nottingham Playhouse

Laugh, cry, stroke your chin with an air of studied erudition! Nottingham Playhouse lets you tap into the full range of emotions, with a schedule that’s packed full of comedies, tragedies, stand-up and musicals. Pick up tickets from the box office, snaffle a pre-show burger at Cast restaurant, then take your seat for the big performance. Bravo!



Wellington Circus, Nottingham, NG1 5AF




Open Monday–Sunday 10:00–18:00. Check website for details.









Mortimer's Hole

These caves under Nottingham Castle come with a gruesome backstory. They’re named after Roger Mortimer, the treacherous 14th-century nobleman who plotted the murder of Edward II. A hit squad snuck through these tunnels and captured him when he was hiding out here, bringing about his sticky end. Take a cave tour and plumb the depths of these spooky tunnels’ history.

I live not far from Nottingham but choose to stay over after a concert so we could enjoy drinks in the bars around the city centre. Had a lovely meal in the Saltbox near the arena and fabulous quirky cocktails in The boilermaker a hidden bar!

Popular Neighborhoods in Nottingham












Lace Market


3 properties

Frills and thrills. Nottingham was once a world leader in lace production, and it was here that this delicate fabric was made and sold. Today, the area’s laced with funky eateries and bars. Embrace the changing times at Pitcher & Piano, a gothic church-turned-gastropub. Sip a cheeky cocktail at The Lacehouse, then groove into the wee hours at Gatecrasher.

Accommodations in Lace Market













Hockley


2 properties

This little area specialises in the cool, the quirky and the curious. Independent shops line the streets, and alternative hangouts abound. It’s a shopaholic’s playground – Cow for vintage clothing, 5 Dots for art and Bookwise for second-hand tomes. Chomp on a curry from Anoki, then head to Tilt or the Rum House for cocktails in the coolest company.

Local Tips for Nottingham







Picnic at Newstead Abbey




by Debbie

Debbie's lived in sunny Spain for 7 years, but is always proud to say she's from Robin Hood country.


If you want a bit of dramatic inspiration, legendary wild poet Byron’s imposing Gothic home at Newstead Abbey is just down the road. History buffs can visit the house at the weekends, while locals picnic by the lake, with the original medieval abbey as a stunning backdrop for selfies!

Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem




by Ben

Songwriter and ace guitarist Ben loves travelling, cooking and football.


Pubs don't come more unique and characterful than this. It claims to be the oldest pub in England and is built into stone caves alongside Nottingham Castle, There's a garden and courtyard, souvenir shop and you can even take tours of the cellars. Cheers!

Rescue Rooms




by Sam

Polyglot Sam enjoys independent cinema and taking in the sunset on far-flung beaches.


With capacity for just 450 people, Rescue Rooms is a great place to see an intimate set from your favourite band. Previous performers include The Libertines, Bloc Party and The Killers, so when the next big thing hits the mainstream, you can say you saw them here before they were cool.

Arboretum Park




by Emma

Scottish Emma is enjoying being back in Blighty after spending time living in Spain and Germany.


Arboretum Park is Nottingham's oldest public park and the nearest one to the city centre. Whenever I'm in town, I pop down to have a picnic or relax with a coffee and a book. Bird lovers will love the big pond with ducklings, as well as the on-site aviary.

Broadway's a very cool indie cinema which shows a great range of movies, from blockbusters to arthouse stuff, as well as retrospectives. They also have events and themed nights. There's a bar, and you can take your pint or sandwich in with you to watch the film.

Transportation





Nottingham Transportation









Taxi



There are lots of taxi ranks in Nottingham, mostly around Old Market Square. Alternatively, you can book one online or over the phone, or just hail one in the street. Taxis usually charge using the meter, with a starting tariff of GBP 2.75, with an additional GBP 1.65 per kilometre from then on. However, you might consider negotiating the price before your journey in order to avoid any surprises.




DG Cars
www.dgcars.co.uk











Bus



Nottingham's public transport network has won awards for its efficiency. Its extensive bus network runs during the evenings, as well as all day Sundays. You can get single tickets, day tickets or passes for longer periods. Check online to see which suits your stay best. If you're travelling elsewhere in Nottinghamshire, get the Sherwood Forester bus. It's a hop-on, hop-off bus service that goes to attractions in the surroundings, including Sherwood Forest.




Nottingham City Transport
www.nctx.co.uk











Train



If you're travelling between the city centre and the suburbs, or further afield in Nottinghamshire, the Robin Hood train line is the one you want. However, for trips to other cities outside the county, you'll need to get a National Rail train. You can get to London, Birmingham and Manchester in under 2 hours. Tickets can be bought online or at the machines in the station.




East Midlands Trains
www.eastmidlandstrains.co.uk











Tram



Nottingham has 2 tram lines, which connect the outskirts to the city centre. They run regular services, with major stops that include Royal Centre, Old Market Square and the Lace Market. You can buy tickets on the trams themselves, just try to make sure you have something approaching the right change on you. Trams are easy to spot - they're white with a green trim.




NET
www.thetram.net











Bicycle



Nottingham has a public rental bike system called Santander Cycles. You don't need to be registered - just insert your bank card in the nearest terminal (next to the bike racks) and off you go! The bikes are designed for short trips within the city, so they're only free for the first 30 minutes. When you're done, just drop off the bike at one of the other stations around the city.
