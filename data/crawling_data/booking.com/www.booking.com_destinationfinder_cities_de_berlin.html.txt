Visit Berlin: Your Travel Guide


Berlin doesn’t claim to be Europe's most beautiful capital, but it's a city that represents Europe's past, and its future. It's hard to believe that only one generation has passed since Berliners tore down the Berlin Wall; now the city echoes with open-mindedness.

Things to Do in Berlin









The Brandenburg Gate

"Victory" takes on a new meaning on top of the Brandenburg Gate. The spectacular Quadriga Statue of Lady Victory was placed on the gate in 1791, then stolen and restored. She also survived allied bombing in WWII and spent decades within earshot of the Berlin Wall. She still crowns this 12-column gate today, having witnessed Berlin’s rise, fall and growth.



Pariser Platz, 10117 Berlin




Open every day









The Reichstag

The Reichstag is the building that could. Survivor of bombings, fire and revolution, today it’s one of Berlin’s most iconic buildings. The famous glass dome was designed by Sir Norman Foster, which led to the building’s rebirth as a symbol of the "New Berlin." If you’d like to visit the dome at the top, book free tickets in advance on the government’s website (www.bundestag.de).



Platz der Republik 1, 11011 Berlin

Holocaust Memorial

Remembered and never to be forgotten, this four-acre field commemorates the millions of Jews who were killed in WWII. Thousands of concrete blocks of differing heights and sizes give the impression of watching waves roll. An evening walk through the rows, especially when they’re covered in snow and ice, gives the site a poetic poignancy.



Cora-Berliner-Straße 1, 10117 Berlin




Open every day









Potsdamer Platz

This complex is the perfect place to indulge your senses. This area was resuscitated from the rubble of the Berlin Wall and is now a famous cultural hub for the "New Berlin." Crane your neck back to see the Sony Center’s ceiling of lights, take in culture at the Berlinale Palast or enjoy a pick-me-up at one of the world-class cafés or restaurants.



Potsdamer Platz, 10785 Berlin




Open every day









Kulturforum

Today a play, tomorrow a musical – Kulturforum offers a treat for every day. This complex is a collection of buildings offering an array of cultural experiences. Wander the divine sculpture gardens of the New National Gallery, or transport yourself to a musical paradise with an evening at the Berlin Philharmonie. Kulturforum’s calendar is filled with dozens of events throughout the year.



Matthäikirchplatz, 10785 Berlin




Open Tuesday to Friday 10 am – 8 pm, weekends 11 am – 6 pm









Checkpoint Charlie

Checkpoint Charlie should be on your list of places to visit; it's the most famous of the former Cold War border crossings between capitalist West Berlin and communist East Berlin. In the large (and free) open-air museum, explore the history of the Berlin Wall, the border controls and the big players during the Cold War.



Friedrichstraße 43-45, 10117 Berlin




Open every day









Museum Island

Buy one, get four more – for a small fee. One island, five prestigious museums, and one day is all you'll need for a round trip to the ancient world. At the Pergamon Museum, wonder at a full-scale reconstruction of Babylon’s Ishtar Gate; gaze into Queen Nefertiti's all-knowing eyes at the Neues Museum, or be classically inspired by the Altes Museum's ancient marble statues.



Bodestraße 1-3, 10178 Berlin




Check website for details









Jewish Museum Berlin

Learn the A-to-Zs of Jewish history. This spectacular building is shaped like a warped Star of David and was designed by "wunderkind" Polish architect, Daniel Libeskind. The kaleidoscopic walls and ceilings are intended to disorient the visitor and present art and artifacts in a unique light. The artifacts cover a wide scope and include many eras of German-Jewish art.



Lindenstraße 9-14, 10969 Berlin




Open Monday 10 am – 10 pm, Tuesday to Sunday 10 am – 8 pm









Alexanderplatz

"Alex" is every Berliner’s best friend. Berlin Alexanderplatz—or "Alex" for short—has an exciting history. In the 1920s, Marlene Dietrich’s voice resounded from the bars and clubs of the square's famous nightclubs. The area has lost its glamorous edge, but Neptunbrunnen Fountain, the Berlin TV Tower and the Alexa Shopping Centre add zest (and photo ops) to this plain square.



Alexanderplatz, 10178 Berlin




Open every day









East Side Gallery

Each crack in the Wall tells a thousand stories. On the longest remaining section of the Berlin Wall, graffiti depicts dozens of instantly recognizable images from the Cold War. Look for Russian leader Brezhnev and East German leader Honecker locking lips in a loving embrace, or artist Thierry Noir's vivid colors, alongside the immortal words: “No more wars. No more walls. A united world.”



Mühlenstraße, 10243 Berlin




Open every day









Alternative Berlin Tour

Come to grips with Berlin’s gritty side and go underground. The streets of Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg and Neukölln are brought to life by tour guides who will take you past some of the city’s most colorful facades, by squats and community projects. You might even come across a festival, or an impromptu concert or two.








Mauerpark

On what was once known as the "Death Strip," there's a  thriving green patch that sees all manner of Berlin life come its way. Hipsters, musicians and karaoke kings and queens make their way to Sunday’s free-for-all "Bear Pit" sing-off, while others choose to just chill on the grassy banks. A hub of all things artistic and cultural, it’s symbolic of Berlin’s impressive transformation.








Friedrichshain

Culture can be found around every corner of this eastern neighborhood. From the iconic, politically charged murals of the East Side Gallery, to the harrowing Stasi Prison, the area keeps history at the forefront while forging its way into the future with funky bars and quirky cafés on Simon-Dach and Grünberger streets.








Kreuzberg

This boho neighborhood is best explored on two or four wheels. Rent a bike to enjoy a snapshot of German history and roam the deserted runways of Tempelhof Airfield, or head out on a "Trabi Safari" behind the wheel of one of East Germany’s most iconic runarounds. The graffiti-packed streets are home to eccentric hangouts that stay busy until the early hours.








Mitte

Along the popular tourist track, you can still find lesser-known sights. Explore the Sammlung Boros art collection hidden in Nazi-era bunkers, or embark on one of many walking tours to help bring the historic streets and city secrets to life.








Neukölln

A melting pot of cultures, this is Berlin at its bohemian best. Scale the heights of Neukölln Arcaden, where you can chill on a rooftop garden with an unrivaled city panorama, or take a global culinary tour down Weserstrasse street.








Berlin Wall

The East Side Gallery sees remnants of the wall transformed into a colorful memorial, with powerful representations around Bernauer Strasse, where an open-air gallery and prison-like structures depict images of striking Cold War-era history.








Brandenburg Gate

Originally built as a celebration of peace, this 18th-century structure has witnessed some of Germany's most turbulent events – from World War II, to the rise and fall of the Berlin Wall. The city's most visited monument, the Brandenburg Gate is the last of the original eighteen gates that once guarded the city.








Reichstag Building

Neglected after WWII, the end of the Cold War found Germany’s once impressive Reichstag building a crumbling ruin. Before a large-scale reconstruction took place in the early 90s, previous restorations had removed many original features from its interior. A large glass dome was built to represent its original cupola, and certain historic features—like graffiti from the Battle of Berlin—were preserved for future generations.








Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe

This somber monument remembers the tragedy of the Holocaust. A field of simple concrete blocks arranged in various heights, it offers a quiet place for contemplation. In the information center below the monument, four dedicated rooms tell the story of this chilling historical period through biographies, timelines, and artifacts.








Charlottenburg Palace

Built for Sophie Charlotte—the wife of Elector of Brandenburg, Friedrich III—this baroque palace started out as a relatively modest summer home. Friedrich commissioned an extravagant expansion when he ascended to the throne years later – laying the foundations for the grand structure seen and enjoyed by visitors today.








Berghain Club

Come and worship at the Church of Techno. Berghain Club is famous around the world for having the best DJs, an incredible sound system and an open-minded crowd. Located in an abandoned power plant, this iconic club will have you dancing all night long – if you can get in.








Watergate

True to its name, Watergate overlooks the Spree River and offers amazing views of the Oberbaumbrücke, especially if you’re there until sunrise. The upstairs area is famous for its world-class DJs, with past lineups including Panpot, Sebo K and Kenny Larkin, while up-and-coming artists are featured on the Waterfloor. Bear in mind that you’re more likely to get in if you know who’s spinning.








Monbijou Park

Crowds of merry people huddle together with their loved ones in Monbijou Park every December 31st – and it's easy to see why. This picturesque place is the perfect spot to contemplate the past year and the one yet to come. While the fireworks pop, bang, and crackle across the sky, you'll also be treated to the historic Museum Island's silhouette, backlit by the glow.








Spree River

Leave the old year behind and set sail into the new with a cruise on the Spree River. Eat all night and sip your favorite New Year's drinks, while you glide past some of Berlin's most famous landmarks. And when it's time to ring in the new year, fireworks won't just be lighting the sky high above you, they'll be illuminating the waters below too, like a million stars.

Berlin is the most beautiful city I have ever been too, there is so much to do here and so much to see. This is my 3rd trip and I still haven’t managed to see all the things I want too. The value for money is great, people are always very friendly and it’s a beautiful place to be.

How can you enjoy the sights in Berlin while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


If you are going to see some of the museum's in and around Berlin I would definitely recommend the museum pass. It gives 3 consecutive days access to all museums in the program (you get a book telling you which ones with the card). You only need to go in to three museums and you have pretty much broke even on the cost of the card. It also cuts out most of the ticket queues as you just show the card to get in. You do still need a timed ticket for some museums though so read the signs as you will be refused entry if you don't have one, they are free but where required you must have one. If you are going to the Pergamon museum I would recommend getting there before it's scheduled opening time. I got there half an hour before the advertised time and was let in. A couple of hours or so later and there was a 2hr queue just to get tickets. It is also stupidly busy on weekends as buses ship a lot of tourists in from the surrounding cities and countries so I would avoid these days if possible.

Transportation





Berlin Transportation









Air – Schönefeld Airport



Schönefeld Airport is Berlin’s main international airport. The most convenient way to reach the center of Berlin is by train. Follow the signs across a covered walkway to the station. Catch the S9 train to Ostkreuz, then switch to the S7 train for the Hauptbahnhof/central station. Schönefeld is in Zone C and tickets are available at machines inside the station. Taxis are available just outside the airport – trips to the center take around 35-40 minutes and cost around EUR 40.




Flughafen Berlin Schönefeld
www.berlin-airport.de











Air – Tegel Airport



Tegel Airport is 5 miles north of Berlin. The fastest way to reach Alexanderplatz (in the center) is by TXL JetExpressBus. Purchase a ticket at a machine inside the station, then head toward Terminals A and B. The bus departs right outside every 10-20 minutes between 4:30 am – 11 pm. It takes around 28-40 minutes to reach Alexanderplatz. Taxis are readily available at every terminal – they cost around EUR 25 and it takes about 20 minutes to get to Alexanderplatz.




Tegel Airport
www.berlin-airport.de











Bus



In the west of Berlin, bus services run far more frequently than in the east. The major bus terminals can be found at Hauptbahnhof and Alexanderplatz. Bus stops are easily identifiable on the street and timetables are clearly displayed. Tickets cost around EUR 2.60 or EUR 6.70 for a day pass and can be bought directly from the driver. Buses in the city center generally run between 6 am – 12 am on weekdays and 7 am – 12 am on weekends, depending on the route. Night buses are also available.










Tram



In the east of Berlin, the vast network of trams runs more frequently than in the west. Trams are bright yellow and the stops are marked by a square white sign with "H" inside a bright yellow circle (the same signs for buses). You can get on at any entrance and buy a ticket on board from a vending machine (coins only). Berlin is divided into Zones A, B and C, so make sure you’re buying the right ticket. To get off, press one of the buttons on the poles.




BVG
www.bvg.de











Taxi



Official taxis are cream-colored with black and yellow signs on the roof, and are readily available in the city. Just hail one from the street or go to a taxi stand. Fares are reasonable and increase incrementally based on the kilometers traveled. It’s best to plan to pay with cash, since credit cards aren't always accepted. The taxi industry is heavily regulated, so the chance of being ripped off is low. Tips of 5-10% are standard for exceptional service.




Taxi Berlin
www.taxi-berlin.de











Car



Berlin is a "driver’s city." Many roads have red-brick bike lanes on both sides which drivers should pay attention to. Speed limits in the city center are under 30 mph. Parking lots and on-street metered parking spaces (which only accept coins) are available, but can be difficult to find. If you plan to bring your own car, you might need to get an "Umweltplakette" (emissions certificate) to enter certain parts of the city.










Bike



Biking in the city can be stressful, so get outside the center for some established bike paths. The city is relatively flat and the roads have bike lanes, identifiable by red bricks or white lines. There are many idyllic bike paths and cycling along parts of the Berlin-to-Copenhagen trail is especially popular. Bike rental costs around EUR 10 per day, depending on the vendor. Bike rentals are located in the main areas of the city, especially around the main train stations.




Berlin and Bike
www.berlinandbike.de











Train



Berlin's main train station is Hauptbahnhof; from here, catch the S7, S5 or S75 trains directly to Alexanderplatz in the east or Zoologischer Garten/Kurfürstendamm in the west. Outlying districts are reachable from Alexanderplatz by train, U-Bahn, buses and trams. The central "Ring Train" goes around the border of Zone A and runs from 4:30 am – 1:30 am on weekdays, and 24 hours on Friday and Saturday. Tickets cost around EUR 2.60 or EUR 6.70 for a day pass, and can be purchased from machines on the platform.
