The Christmas tree lighting and market opened the night we arrived. Everyone was very welcoming and very friendly. There is a lot of great history in Belfast but thankfully “The Troubles” as they are referred to by the locals have subsided and I felt very safe. This a beautiful city and had a small town feel.

Tons to see.

Tons to see. Lots of great shops, restaurants, and tours close by. People are very friendly and willing to help.  The giants causway is a must see! Also a meal at union street, their food is amazing!  Not a ton of public transport options so be prepared to walk or take a cab. Also everything but the pubs all it shut down by 9:30 so make sure you eat before then.. Great celebrity watching! Lots of actors, athletes, etc all about.

Enjoyed the Titanic experience.

Enjoyed the Titanic experience..at least 4 hours required to see it properly.We also enjoyed the Hop on Hop off tour..we had a great guide..funny and so informative. In addition we went on a day long trip to the Giants Causeway and other sights with Odessy tours. Our guide Paul was also very enteraining and knowledgeable. Belfast has plenty of shops, restaurants and great sights to see

The black cab tour is must and do it first so you get a understanding of the Ireland north/south thing. With that knowledge  Belfast makes more sense but 'irishly'. Prison, town hall, pubs good to experience

I loved the bus tour and the  Crumlin jail was definitely worth a visit. Getting around Belfast was easy. Taxi's weren't to expensive.The Nightlife was really good with lots of live music.Lots to see and do.








Hotels That Guests Love in Belfast





ibis Belfast City Centre









“
Staff were very accommodating and helpful. Hotel is reasonably within walking distance of the city center
”






ETAP Hotel Belfast









“
Very convenient location, Wifi speed was very fast. Staff very polite and welcoming. Although there's a pub right next to the hotel and can be noisy till 2:00 am it did not bother us much and our 3 year old was able to sleep well without much fuss. Would consider booking this hotel again next time we are in Northern Ireland. Such a lovely place.
”






The Fitzwilliam Hotel Belfast









“
Very modern hotel in the heart of the city. Close to everything. When we expressed our dissatisfaction about the air conditioning not working they immediately reduced our bill.  Great customer satisfaction
”






Holiday Inn Belfast









“
Staff was great.  Hotel has been completely renovated from top to bottom.  Bed was a bit firm but not uncomfortable.  Parking is across the street in a car park at 6 pounds a day as a guest of the hotel.  The City Center is only a 10 minute walk and it's a wonderful walk when it's not raining.  Room was clean, comfortable, really enjoyed our stay for 2 nights there.  The breakfast buffet was a bit pricey but not obscene.  Food was decent though.
”






Ramada Encore Belfast City Centre









“
Convenient hotel close to the heart of the city. Efficient staff and basic equipment, suitable for a short stay.
