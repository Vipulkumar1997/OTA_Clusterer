Sydney Travel Guide










From Beaches to Business, Sydney Has it All
From the glitz and glamour of the Star City Casino and trendy King Street Wharf in Darling Harbor to the waves of the Northern beaches, Sydney is full of great restaurants, bars and shopping.
Sail under the iconic Harbor Bridge on a ferry and take in a world class performance at the Sydney Opera House. Circular Quay is also home to the exquisite waterside Botanical Gardens and the Museum of Contemporary Art. The Sydney Tower is the highest point on the skyline and offers a restaurant with panoramic views.
Whether it's the quirky King Street in Newtown or the elegance of the Woollahra, travelling outside of the center uncovers each suburb's distinct flavor. The famous Bondi Beach is the starting point of a walk along the cliffs to the equally photogenic beaches of Bronte and Coogee.
Sydney’s Kingsford Smith International Airport is the main gateway to this capital city and only a short distance from the city center. From a dorm bed in King’s Cross to a 5-star, serviced apartment in the central business district, Booking.com will ensure you don’t miss the excitement in this dynamic city down under.

We stayed at the Sydney Harbor YHA.

We stayed at the Sydney Harbor YHA.
Although it was a hostel, it was VERY CLEAN. There was a very diverse cross section of people staying there, from school groups, to airline pilots.
It is within walking distance of the HARBOUR, bridge, Opera House.
The hop on- hop off bus was a 3 block walk. There are enough places to eat in the area.

Free walking tour of Sydney with a university student was great. Thoroughly enjoyed a play at the SOH & pictures reflected on the buildings in the evening. Blue Mts were lovely. Enjoyed Bondi Beach sculpture walk-Oct. Enjoyed the zoo & the ferry ride to it. Took public transportation- buses, trains, ferries. Easy to get around with Opal transportation card.

The city was pretty accessible by train or by hop-on hop-off bus tours. We were able to enjoy Bondi Beach, Manley Beach, Darling Harbour and all parts of the city easily. We enjoyed seeing a play at the Sydney Opera House and taking a backstage tour at the end of the week. There's lots of good shopping and many place to sit and rest or many places to have a snack or cup of coffee or tea. Love being able to access the different parts by train, fairy, or bus buy using the Opal card. The Japanese Botanical Garden and the Botanical Garden close to the opera house are must sees. You can take a two hour train ride using your Opal card to the Blue Mountains and enjoy many activities there.

I like the hostel life here.

I like the hostel life here. And the transportation is very convenient to bring you everywhere. You can go to the other side of Sydney like Blue Mountain and Kiama. And you can go to Taronga Zoo too which is the best yet the largest zoo I’ve ever visited. Sydney is the city of culture blend, you can find chinatown easily to go get your favorite chinese food, or you can find the other area from many country. Oh yeah, i just love Sydney.

We loved all the places everyone loves about Sydney.

We loved all the places everyone loves about Sydney. The Taronga Zoo had a fun Sky Tram up to the zoo entrance, and we were able to see all the Australian animals we couldn’t see in the wild. We went to a performance of the Streeton Trio at the Sydney Opera House that was incredible! There was a fun food and wine festival at The Rocks that we enjoyed—great cheese and food.

Opera house, Harbour bridge, Sydney Observatory Park,...

Opera house, Harbour bridge, Sydney Observatory Park, Darling Harbour, Chinatown markets on a Friday evening, Foodie Market at The Rocks on a Friday afternoon, Shopping in CBD is endless, Mrs Macquarie’s chair, botanical gardens and Bondi to Coogee coastal walk are all major highlights!! I could have easily stayed an extra day or two to squeeze in the Blue Mountains and/or Manly beach! Really easy to get around with an Opal card (free to get, just top it up.. although the money you don’t use on the opal card cannot be easily refunded... have to send off a form and stuff so make sure you use it up!) I used a really informative map from the hostel which included bus routes to main tourist spots but there’s definitely an app you can download to plan journeys on public transport. Getting from the airport is pretty simple and only two stops on the train to central but it does cost $17/$18 dollars! I got a tip from the hostel to jump off the train at Mascot then tap off and back on again to continue the journey on the next train which saved a few dollars!

Rydges Sydney Airport Hotel









“
The hotel is located directly across the front entrance of Sydney's international airport. The room was excellent, quiet, large, clean...perfect.
”






Megaboom City Hotel









“
The room and bed were comfortable.  The water pressure and modern restroom were excellent.  The location, in Sydney CBD, was perfect!  The hotel was mere minutes away from Darling Harbor and many stores, shops, and drinking/dining options.
”






Quality Hotel CKS Sydney Airport









“
It was lovely to be upgraded to a spacious and comfy room. The front office happily booked the airport shuttle for us.  We walked to this motel from Wolli Creek Station - footpaths all the way and not a problem with wheeled luggage (about 12 -15 minutes).
”

Great location to the train and airport.Has a restaurant which is handy.The room was cheap for it,s location and now I know why.It was cheaper to get a taxi than take the hotels shuttle.
