Things to Do in Melbourne









Federation Square

It’s amazing what $450 million Australian dollars and a little enthusiasm can buy. Local authorities and sponsors bandied together to fund this square, which became the city’s go-to spot for cultural activities. Its 15k-capacity amphitheatre is the stage of regular shows, gigs and concerts, while art galleries, flagships stores and eateries line the surrounding streets.



Corner Swanston St & Flinders St, Melbourne Victoria 3000









Her Majesty's Theatre

Curtain call at Her Majesty’s Theatre. Ushers escort late-comers to their seats, crowds talk in hushed whispers, and actors take their places. Then, the red curtains rise – applause! From operas and ballets to musical adaptations of popular films, only productions of plum pedigree grace this stage. Book early for front-row seats, otherwise have your lorgnette handy. Bravi!



219 Exhibition Street, Melbourne Victoria 3000




Check website for details.









Queen Victoria Market

Here, good food is always in fashion. The Queen Vic holds regular master classes with Aussie celeb-chefs, and this market has plum pickings for the health-inclined. From goat cheese to cake pops, the food section accounts for every gluten-free, low GI and organic fad diet around. The fashion section holds chain stores galore and a plethora of angora jumpers.



Corner of Victoria St and Elizabeth St, Melbourne Victoria 3000




Open Tuesday 06:00-14:00, Wednesday 17:00-22:00, Thursday 06:00-14:00, Friday 06:00-17:00, Saturday 06:00-15:00, Sunday 09:00-16:00









National Gallery of Victoria

Ancient stories are often the basis of Aboriginal art. William Barak is possibly the best-known Wujunderi painter. He created abstract compositions of rituals and traditions in primordial shapes, using a palate of burnt orange and harvest that’s as visually commanding as Australia’s landscape. View his works, plus swathes of other important world art from Bernini’s to Picasso’s.



180 St Kilda Rd, Melbourne Victoria 3006




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00









Rod Laver Arena

Who’s the queen of the ball? Whether you vie for Venus or side with Serena, virtually every major tennis star has played here. After the inaugural Australian Open here in January 1988, this arena has been used for major sport and entertainment events. The likes of Justin Timberlake and AC/DC have left audiences thunderstruck. Search online for a ticket and see it for yourself!



Batman Avenue and Olympic Boulevard, Melbourne Victoria




Open Monday-Thursday 08:00-22:30, Saturday-Sunday 09:00-17:00









Melbourne Cricket Ground MCG

Some things are just natural – the air, the sea, the Australian addiction to cricket! Since its first test match in 1877, this stadium has hosted everything from the World Cup to the Olympic Games. Concerts by the Madonna’s and Michael Jackson’s of this world have drawn crowds outside of game season.



Brunton Ave, Richmond Victoria 3002




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-17:00. Check website for details.









Australian Formula One Grand Prix Circuit

Do you feel the need for speed? Whizz down to Melbourne’s Formula 1 racetrack and see your speedster heroes battle for the podium! The circuit is essentially the road that loops around Albert Park Lake, just south of the CBD. The entire city joins in for the actual race in March, when the best vantage points are at the circuit’s sixteen corners.



Aughtie Dr, Albert Park, Melbourne Victoria 3206




Check website for details.









Chapel Street

Melbournians like their cakes fluffy, coffee strong and shops plentiful.  First-timers often careen along Chapel Street by tram, but it’s always more fun to walk. The sides-streets brim with urban cafés to blend in with buff, bearded and beautiful.  One end is for shopping, the other entertainment. If you find yourself somewhere in the middle, head to Jam Factory – a mall lined with chain stores.



Chapel Street, Melbourne Victoria









Flemington Racecourse

Beads, flowers and fabulous plumage … and that’s just the hats! The Melbourne Cup at Flemington Racecourse is equal parts annual horse race and gossip-rag extravaganza. With enough outfits to make Mr. Blackwell turn in his grave, the glitzy fashion separates the “supreme queens” from the “Kath & Kim’s”. Bet on the next “Phar Lap” and avoid getting carrot caught in your fascinator.



448 Epsom Rd, Flemington Victoria 3031




Check website for details.









Luna Park Melbourne

It’s midday at St. Kilda’s “Giant Face of Fun”. The sound of a summer carousel, the smell of caramel corn and the taste of candyfloss that’s like nibbling on a cloud. A wooden roller coaster loops the perimeter, the “Pharoah’s Curse" swings families into the air, and the Ghost Train spooks. Experience all the fun of a seaside fair with your whole family, right next to the beach.



18 Lower Esplanade, St Kilda Victoria 3182




Check website for details.









Lygon Street

Melbourne’s Italian epicenter, Lygon Street is filled with authentic delis, cafes, and restaurants that offer a taste of the old country. It’s the perfect pit stop if you love genuine meatballs, mozzarella, and multicolored pasta – especially during the Festa cultural festival. Decked in Ferrari red during F1 season, the street comes together like one big family to celebrate race victories.








Brunswick Street

Arty, bohemian Brunswick Street is as laid back as you can get. The main street is lined with colorful, graffiti-covered walls and charming buildings that house organic shops, ethnic restaurants, and quirky cafes. Think of it as a menu where you can pick and choose whatever you want from its mix of smells and flavors.








Acland Street

Chill St. Kilda is known for its laid-back vibe with Acland Street’s cafes and eateries that are the very definition of cool. You can try Hannah Café for a big breakfast and The Espy for a gastro-pub lunch, or head to one of the Vietnamese restaurants, serving up cheap and delicious dinners. For dessert, browse the frosted windows of the street’s iconic bakeries for a sugar-coated treat.








Chinatown

Originally settled during the 1850's gold rush, Chinatown now has a new treasure – world-class Asian food. As you wander the district’s bustling, neon-lit streets, you’ll find dumpling houses and noodle joints at every turn. Stop in one to try steaming xiao long bao or chow mein, then snap a souvenir photo under Chinatown Plaza's traditional arches.








Sydney Road

Home to a large Lebanese community, Sydney Road is a hotbed for great food. Here you can pick up exotic spices, dig into delicious flatbread za’atars, or gorge on flaky baklava pastries over pitch-black coffee. The yearly Sydney Road Street Party brings the neighborhood together with an eclectic line up of music and markets.








Southbank

Boasting an idyllic location along the Yarra River, Southbank Promenade holds the crown for the best bars and restaurants in town. You can arrive in style in a water taxi, then perhaps enjoy a cocktail while you lose yourself in the sparkling reflections of the city skyline.








Frank Camorra’s MoVida Restaurant

Born in Barcelona and raised in Córdoba, MoVida’s chef and owner Frank Camorra brings a taste of Spain to Melbourne. The many gourmet Mediterranean dishes are so mouthwatering, the hardest part is knowing which one  to pick. Lamb cutlets, marinated mussels and chargrilled calamari all compete for your attention.








Melbourne Cricket Ground

Known by locals as "The G," Melbourne Cricket Ground is epic by anyone's standards. The largest stadium in the Southern Hemisphere seats almost 100,000 and has seen tons of sports records broken in its 150-year history. Despite the name, it doesn’t only host cricket – everything from soccer, rugby, and AFL finals to rock concerts and Olympic ceremonies have been held here.

Melbourne is easy to get around.Carparking arrangements at zoo were ridiculous.  Get a tram! Make sure you have a Myki card loaded.Take a trip out to Warrnambool along the Great Ocean Road - best part of our time in Victoria.Melbourne is just another city.

Transportation





Melbourne Transportation









Air – Melbourne Airport



The fastest connection between Melbourne Airport and the city centre is by taxi in 20-30 minutes for around $60. Be wary of rush hour from 06:30-09:30 and 16:00-18:00. Another option is the SkyBus Express bus, which goes to Southern Cross Station every 10 minutes. One-way tickets are $18 for adults and $7 for children. There is also a public bus for around $8, which takes you to various train stations outside the centre. A top up ‘Myki’ card can be purchased on board.










Tram



Trams are the easiest way to explore Melbourne CBD, connecting to most of the main tourist attractions as well as the outer suburbs. All public transport requires a top up ‘Myki’ smartcard, which must be used to tap on and off each trip. These can be purchased at a convenience store or from ticket machines at stations. Tram stops are easily identified by signage and hand rails. Services depart every 6-10 minutes from 06:00-23:30.




PTV
ptv.vic.gov.au











Train



Flinders Street and Southern Cross are the city’s main train stations. The main train line services most city attractions, traveling in a loop around Queen Victoria Market, Melbourne Central and Parliament, before diverting to the outer suburbs. Services operate on weekdays from 05:00-00:30 and weekends from 05:00-01:30. Fares are around $6 with a top up ‘Myki’ smart card, remember to tap on and off each trip.




PTV
ptv.vic.gov.au











Bus



The Melbourne Visitor Shuttle offers a hop on and off bus to key destinations around the city. Services run daily between 09:30 and 16:40. An adult all-day fare is $5 and kids travel for free. There is also an extensive public bus system, with over 300 bus routes, similar to the train system. Services run on weekdays from 06:00-19:30, as well as Night Bus routes (01:30:05:30) on weekends connecting the city to the outer suburbs.




PTV
ptv.vic.gov.au











Taxi



Taxis are an expensive way around the city, however sometimes can be the most convenient option. If required they can be pre-booked, hailed from the street or found at a rank. Taxis are usually yellow in colour and charge fares of approximately $25 per 10km. Extra fees apply between 00:00-05:00 and for freeway use.










Car



Renting a car is most useful for traveling to attractions outside of the city. The CBD is well connected by public transport, making driving unnecessary. If you do choose to drive, a GPS can be handy to navigate the roads, as there are some places where tram lines cannot be crossed. Car hire starts at $50 a day, not including petrol or insurance. Parking in the city is pricey, starting at $5 an hour for on-street and $8 an hour in a secure carpark.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.





If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
