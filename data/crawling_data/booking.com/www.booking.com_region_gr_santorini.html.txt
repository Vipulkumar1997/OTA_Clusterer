Review

Enjoying views of Caldera in Santorini, the 4-star Philippion Boutique Hotel is located 250 metres from Fira Town centre.

"I cannot say enough good things about the hospitality and customer service that Philippion hotel provided. My two friends and I stayed here for three nights. When we first arrived the gentleman at the front desk (the one who works at night, sorry I didn't catch his name) spent time explaining to us how the cities and sites were set up across the island, giving suggestions and advice. They set up a boat tour and ATV rental for us. Nothing was ever an inconvenience for the staff here. When we crashed an ATV in front of their hotel, they ran out to help us and they even talked the ATV company out of charging us any extra fees. We accidentally spilled a pitcher of water all over the restaurant and they cleaned it up without hesitation. When we were at the ferry terminal five minutes before the ferry was to leave, we realized we forgot our passports in the hotel. We called them and they rushed it down to the ferry terminal right in time for us to make the ferry. We thought it would be impossible and our trip would have to be changed. They made it possible. If you want stand-out, fantastic service, this is the hotel to stay at! The room was also impeccably clean each day, and they have a great complimentary breakfast included. Shout out to Vas and the gentleman at night for the outstanding recommendations and helping even the most difficult of guests. We would definitely stay here again (although they probably wouldn't want to see us again... ha!)."

Santoríni Highlights









Watch the sunset in Oia

Oia’s stunning blue roofs and whitewashed buildings are an instantly recognisable scene. Sunset around the castle attracts flocks of budding photographers daily.








Museum of Prehistoric Thera

Set in historic Fira, this fascinating museum tells the story of the island’s prehistoric periods through exhibitions of pottery, ancient tools and weapons.








Cable car ride from Fira's Old Port

If you’re not afraid of heights, catch the cable car from Fira’s Old Port up to the town. The 3-minute climb offers stunning sea views.








Akrotiri Archaeological Site

Destroyed during the island’s volcanic eruption and excavated in 1967, the prehistoric settlement of Akrotiri is said to have been Plato's inspiration for Atlantis.








Kamari's open-air cinema

Listed as one of Europe’s best, Kamari’s open-air cinema offers the chance to kick back in a deck chair with a cocktail under the stars.








Perissa and Perivolos' beaches

The 7-km-long Perissa Beach is recognisable by its volcanic black sands and the imposing Mesa Vouno Mountain, which emerges from its crystal-clear waters.








Ancient Thera

Perched atop Mesa Vouno Mountain, this archaeological site forms the remains of a 9th-century Dorian colony. It is named after the island’s mythical ruler, Theras.








Wine tasting in Pyrgos

Pyrgos’ hilltop setting provides a great spot for sampling celebrated Santorini wines, accompanied by spectacular sea views.








Santorini's Red Beach

This small beach’s striking red volcanic sands and rock formations hug a piece of secluded coastline south of Akrotiri.








Santorini's volcano and Thirasia Island

No visit to Santorini would be complete without a trip over to its volcano and hot springs, followed by a traditional meal on Thirisia Island.
