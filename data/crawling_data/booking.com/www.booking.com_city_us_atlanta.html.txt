Atlanta Travel Guide










Peachy City of Historic Importance
Home to the world’s busiest airport and a vibrant arts scene, Atlanta has an important role in US history. The gateway to the American South, it's home to barbecue and hundreds of peach trees that make it a surprisingly green city.
Hartsfield-Jackson Airport is the main arrival point, and Booking.com has an excellent range of Atlanta hotels near the airport. However, the main sights are clustered around Downtown. Near the gold-domed Georgia State Capitol is Underground Atlanta, a shopping center at the former downtown street level.
Just north are a few hotels near Georgia Dome, a huge sports venue, and to its northeast is Centennial Olympic Park, commemorating the 1996 Olympic Games. On one edge of this park are the CNN headquarters with behind-the-scenes tours. Across the street is the New World of Coca-Cola where you can sample all their worldwide products. Next door is the massive Georgia Aquarium, the world’s largest indoor aquarium.
In the Auburn district is Martin Luther King, Jr.’s former home and church, and a museum dedicated to him and the Civil Rights movement. A few blocks south in Grant Park is the city zoo, and the Atlanta Cyclorama and museum, detailing the city’s Civil War battles.
More national history is in the Carter Center, and the former home of Margaret Mitchell, author of "Gone with the Wind.

Atlanta has way more to offer than what meets the eye.

Atlanta has way more to offer than what meets the eye. You just have to adventure out. Use Uber or Lyft. Marta doesn't go everywhere, or at least all the places you would want to go. Make sure to stop by Ponce City Market.

Atlanta is a great place to stay for a couple of days,...

Atlanta is a great place to stay for a couple of days, however, it's entirely too packed and congested. The traffic is crazy, but it depends on which side of Atlanta you are on. I actually stayed a night in Smyrna. Next time, I may try to stay on the outskirts of the city.

A Great place to be with wonderful attractions, fine dining, shopping experiences that satisfy a diverse style emphasis from eclectic to conservative professional style choices in easy to find locations throughout the city, but overall the people are great.

The hotel is nicely located on the north side of downtown Atlanta -- within minutes of the Georgia Aquarium, World of CocaCola, and other attractions, as well as a major bus and subway station just a few yards from its front door. It has its own restaurant and bar, fitness center, and other amenities.
