Bournemouth Travel Guide










Sea Air and Savoir-Faire
Known for its sandy beaches and good nightlife, Bournemouth is a popular seaside resort on the Dorset coast between Poole and Christchurch.
The town is centered on the Bourne River, running downhill towards the sea by Bournemouth Pier. This pier looks back towards a promenade lined with beach huts at the foot of grassy cliffs. The promenade continues west to Poole, while a road heads east to neighboring Boscombe, where anglers often fish from its pier. Overlooking it is a clifftop road housing some Bournemouth hotels with sea views.
Booking.com also has hotels near the BIC (Bournemouth International Center) in the West Cliff area. This convention center and music venue is a short walk from the Art Deco Pavilion Theatre next to the Lower Gardens. In this popular city park is the Bournemouth Eye, a tethered hot air balloon with far-reaching views.
At the park’s top end the river disappears under a large square, then emerges in the Central Gardens. Overlooking these gardens is the Victorian town hall, which used to be one of several spa hotels in Bournemouth. Nearby, there's a Grade I registered historic church, and St. Peter’s Church has the grave of Mary Shelley, author of "Frankenstein."
On the outskirts of town, near 4 golf courses and the Castlepoint Shopping Center, is Bournemouth Airport.

Bournemouth is my favourite place to visit, from the brilliant bars and shopping to the most stunning sandy beach , all in walking distance, It's always my first choice for a last minute weekend away .... you have to eat at 1812 opposite the BIC best meal we've ever had !  !

Clean, friendly, with excellent shopping and eating facilities. The seven mile beach was great and the sea did not go out to far when the tide went out. There is plenty to see and do within easy reach of the town.

Excellent city centre with contrasts of sea front and gardens. A good range of restaurants from casual to high end restaurants, easy access to quieter coastal areas, e.g Poole, great location for visiting the surrounding area, e.g Poole, Lulworth Cove/Durdle Door, Isle of Wight, Salisbury and Stonehenge, Dorchester.

Lovely promenade right along the cliff top with places to stop and sit occasionally. We really think the new cinema complex is really superb and looks well designed to sit low down so to blend in as much as possible with the gardens. We ate in The Real Greek, which was a great experience. We were greeted by a genuine guy, we think was the manager, and welcome just as you might in Greece. The atmosphere was buzzing and customers a mix of families and couples. All children  were also attended to by the  team , crayons, play dough, colouring books, Hugh chairs for comfort...lovely.nWe ate octopus, which was perfectly cooked, soft and delicious. Then lamb meatballs with salad...also perfectly cooked.  We drank house red - delicious and followed with a superb desert - warm custard tart with ice cream! It felt safe and friendly to walk home later and we had a perfect evening - oh and our time on east cliffe beach was really great too.. Very clean beach and again a real genuine family atmosphere.
