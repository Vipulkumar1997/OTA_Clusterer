Hotels That Guests Love in Los Angeles




Los Angeles Central Deal









‚Äú
I really enjoyed my stay at this hostel! Courtney was so helpful, kind  and definitely made my experience in Los Angeles amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. It is extremely clean and comfortable. The only thing is I think they should get rid of is the security guy because he is a little rude. Other than that don't hesitate üòÖ
‚Äù






Orange Drive Hostel









‚Äú
I liked the fact that I felt safe. It is also a nice place that has that older fancy look to it. The hostel is located right along the walk of fame strip. There is a lot of traffic around the area. I definitely recommend the place for those wanting to see the hollywood sign from a distance and to get a little taste of Los Angeles.
‚Äù






LA International Hostel









‚Äú
The accommodation is in gut location ‚Äì close to bus stops and some fastfoods and restaurants. In case of need you can walk to metro station as well (allow about 20 minutes). The hostel is not any luxury, but there is everything you can expect in good hostel, living room, equipped kitchen, big dining table... The atmosphere in the hostel is very good and welcoming. It is real youth hostel where people meet a talk.

Bamboo Hostel









‚Äú
This was my first time in a hostel and i must say it was pefrect ! Helpfull staff and easy to get anywhere in the city since its right in the middle of Los Angeles. Met a lot of travelers here.
‚Äù






Widblue









‚Äú
This hostel is not only clean!It's completely redone!From the floors to the bathrooms to the light fixtures and everything in between you'll feel right at home. Just minutes away from the metro station on wilshire and vermont you'll have access to the city of Los Angeles and surrounding areas. Secure Lockers clean linens and a great staff (erik) will make you feel at home
