Adelaide Travel Guide










Adelaide: Australia's Undiscovered Gem
Scratch the surface of Australia’s undiscovered gem with its blend of wonderful beaches, wide boulevards and extensive parklands including the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The City of Churches chimes to the beat during festival season with the Adelaide Festival of Arts, Adelaide Fringe and WOMADelaide.
The Torrens River flows through the city from the surrounding Mount Lofty Ranges. The Adelaide Hills features The Cleland Conservation Park that includes a wildlife park where you can pat koalas and Mount Lofty Summit with its panoramic views of the city. Hahndorf, with its German history, is another highlight.
The coast has some fantastic beaches, with historic Glenelg as a favorite local playground, while further south are the shores of Aldinga where you can drive your car onto the beach.
There are few better multicultural markets than the Adelaide Central Market, or choose from lots of museums and art galleries, some with free entry. The picturesque and historic Adelaide Oval is a favorite for sports lovers.
Booking.com has accommodations in the city, or visit surrounding areas like the Barossa Valley, Flinders Ranges and Kangaroo Island.

Adelaide is a beautiful city, a hybrid of Melbourne and Perth. We came down for the Croatian Food & Wine festival on Saturday and that was a great experience. If you’re even in Adelaide on the last weekend of November be sure to check out the festival and if you’re looking for an amazing spot to eat make sure to check out Coffylosophy. Didn’t disappoint.

We got a hire car and could go anywhere. We thought 1 week would be enough but it wasn’t. There is soo much to do. Vineyards, beaches, rivers, trams, parks, entertainment, churches, shops and 2 awesome zoos!!

Adelaide is small and quiet which makes it easy to get around. There are things to do and see but you need to plan it before you go because the likelihood of bumping into something great, randomly, is low

Adelaide is the cleanest city in Australia - I’m from Vic.

Adelaide is the cleanest city in Australia - I’m from Vic. Third trip to South Aust. The houses (East European influence) parks, beaches are gorgeous. Henley Beach and Glenelg beaches are a must. Adelaide is very kid and pet friendly. Hahndorf is great too.

Loved how helpful and friendly the people are.

Loved how helpful and friendly the people are. The ease of getting around in the city. Paths and bike tracks everywhere so no need for a car unless you are going further afield. Plenty of parks to walk through or enjoy are river trip with Popeye boats. Great cafes and restaurants to try too.

Nice hotel in the center of Adelaide. We were upgraded to a king room plus on check in without asking. The buffet breakfast has a great selection. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. I will stay here again on my next trip to Adelaide.

North Adelaide Boutique Stays Accommodation









“
Bed very comfortable the place was very clean and new with coffee machine laundry etc and I much preferred north Adelaide to the cbd
”






The Franklin Boutique Hotel









“
The room was nice and dark, and just the right size for an overnight stay. The freebies were appreciated, and the hotel was styled beautifully. It has the youthful spirit of a backpacker hostel with the privacy, comfort and quiet of a hotel. The ensuite was impeccably clean with new fixtures. We would definitely stay again next time we're in Adelaide.
”






InterContinental Adelaide









“
Wonky red 80's bathroom tiles, the northerly view over the Torrens & easterly view of the Adelaide hills, & the pool.
