Open daily 10 am – 6 pm









Prater

Take a break with a hot pretzel and the Prater’s gigantic Ferris Wheel, the main event in this expansive park. The Prater started as imperial hunting grounds and over time evolved into a park of year-round beauty. The Wurstelprater Amusement Park area inside has fun for families and thrill-seekers. The tree-lined alleys are particularly beautiful in the warmer months.



Riesenradplatz, A-1020 Vienna

Schönbrunn Palace

With 1441 rooms, Schönbrunn Palace was made for sleepovers. Originally intended as a hunting lodge, visitors can revel in the 17th-century luxury of the Habsburg monarchs, to whom the word "opulence" meant very little. The extensive gardens include the fabulous Gloriette (Franz Josef’s breakfast room) and Tiergarten Schonbrunn, the world’s oldest zoo.



Schönbrunner Schlossstrasse 47, 1130 Vienna




Open every day 8:30 am – 5 pm, changes seasonally









Leopold Museum

The best ideas are usually the simplest ones – like putting Austria’s best Modernist artists all under one roof. This compact cube building packs in 5,000 works of art, so you can pour over pieces by Klimt, Moser and Kokoschka. But the Egon Schiele collection takes center stage at the Leopold to shed light on the brushwork of this once forgotten Expressionist master.








Naturhistorisches Museum

A grand setting for an unbelievable collection. This 19th-century palatial depot was built to house the ginormous collections of the Habsburgs. Among its current 30 million artifacts, you can peruse a multitude of meteorites, a dedicated dinosaur hall complete with Diplodocus skeleton, and the delicate Venus of Willendorf fertility statuette dating from 25,000 BC.








Museum of Modern Art MUMOK

When it comes to contemporary art, Mumok’s the word. Its gray, bunker-like facade looks pretty strict, but inside anything goes. The 10,000-piece collection of fine art, film and photography is neatly broken into chronological chunks from post-WWII until the present day, with a strong avant-garde aesthetic throughout.








Pony Club

How to describe Pony Club in one word? Loud! Whether it’s the music, the clothes or the characters – this popular club night is an unabashed love letter to the 1990s. Its quirky inflatable props and cheesy tunes clash perfectly with the ornate surroundings of Volkstheater’s chandeliered Rote Bar, making for an irresistible night of fun.








Haus der Musik

By day, Haus der Musik is an interactive sound museum where visitors can explore the science behind music. But it also honors the artistry involved by doubling as a venue for the “Live on Stage” concert series that showcases up-and-coming songwriters. There's something for even the youngest of aspiring musicians, with special kids' concerts that really capture the imagination.








Flex

Techno, jungle, dubstep, nu-school…the Viennese love their dance music. Located within the close confines of an abandoned metro tunnel, Flex rumbles with the sound of bass heavy tunes pumped out by big-name DJs. Free earplugs are always provided, and the attached cafe/bar provides some relief by the pretty banks of the Danube Canal.








The Rhiz

Do you like music with a healthy dose of blips and bleeps? You’ve come to the right place. The Rhiz is as chill as you can get – with electronic whizzes churning out laptop loops under an old railway viaduct. A meeting point for all kinds of artists, you’ll also catch experimental, genre-hopping concerts in this cavernous club.








The Arena

Located in a former slaughterhouse, The Arena’s graffiti-covered surroundings give it a certain industrial charm. It’s the perfect gritty setting for an alternative rock act or a drum ‘n’ bass DJ to crank up the volume and blow the audience away. If it gets too much, take a breather in the courtyard where indie films are screened in an open-air theater.








Chelsea

The birthplace of Vienna’s underground scene. Chelsea was the first venue to open under the grotty Gürtel train viaduct – where the club hosted legendary punk acts in the 1980s. It hasn’t changed much since then, with noisy guitar bands, cheap beer, and alternative DJs still pulling in plenty of partiers.








Graben Street

On this swanky street you’ll find some of Vienna’s grandest buildings and some of its swankiest shops. On summer days, it’s perfect for people watching from a street-side cafe, and in the winter it’s decked out with Christmas lights, with the aroma of mulled wine wafting through the air.








Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien

Some people buy pendant necklaces, others build pendant museums. With identical exteriors facing Maria-Theresien Square, the Art History Museum houses important Renaissance and Baroque paintings by Titian, Veronese, Rubens and Caravaggio. Next door, budding archaeologists and their doting parents can learn how to excavate the past at the Natural History Museum.








Belvedere

When one is a prince, a summer home is a must-have. Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736) made his residence at this beautiful complex during the summer, which includes the impressive orangery, stables and park lovingly landscaped in baroque style. Visitors flock en masse to the world’s largest Klimt collection including The Kiss, an Art Nouveau masterpiece of indelible beauty.








Kunsthaus Vienna

Kunsthaus (Art House) presents a unique cross-section of art by the famous Austrian artist Friedensreich Hundertwasser. The permanent exhibition features colourful paintings, drawings, graphics, tapestries and architectural projects.








St Stephen's Cathedral

To stand at the pulpit of the iconic St Stephen’s is to commune with the divine. Founded in 1137 and finished in 1511, it’s said that Beethoven discovered his deafness when he saw birds fly from the bell tower but couldn’t hear the bells toll. This Gothic structure survived WWII fire damage and hosts a number of classical concerts and choirs throughout the year.








Belvedere Complex

When one is a prince, a summer home is a must-have. Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736) made his residence at this beautiful complex during the summer, which includes the impressive orangery, stables and park lovingly landscaped in baroque style. Visitors flock en masse to the world’s largest Klimt collection including The Kiss, an Art Nouveau masterpiece of indelible beauty.








Hofburg Imperial Palace

A visit to Hofburg will bring you closer to the enigmatic personality of Empress Elizabeth (‘Sisi’). Take a walk through her private quarters at the Imperial Apartments, learn more about her public and private lives at the Sisi Museum, or see just how many silver tureens it took to fill the Habsburg bellies at the imperial silver collection exhibition.








Schonbrunn Palace

With 1441 rooms, Schönbrunn Palace was made for sleepovers. Originally intended as a hunting lodge, visitors can revel in the 17th-century luxury of the Habsburg monarchs, to whom the word ‘opulence’ meant very little. The extensive gardens include the fabulous Gloriette (Franz Josef’s breakfast room) and Tiergarten Schönbrunn, the world’s oldest zoo.








New Campus of the University of Economics & Business

It took 500-million euros and six different architecture firms to dream up this space-age campus. But the star of Vienna’s revamped University of Economics and Business is the new library. At first glance, its features jutting out at a sharp angle make it look like it's leaning over. But inside, you’ll be amazed by its curvy, stark-white spaces.








Vienna's Ringstrasse

This amazing 3-mile loop of historic buildings shows off a variety of architectural styles. Built between the 1860s and 1890s, it became a kind of gated community for Emperor Franz Joseph and his rich friends. Today, you can take in the lavish spectacle in just one afternoon – from the City Hall's Flemish-Gothic spires to the Austrian Parliament's neoclassical columns.








The Museumsquartier

Old and new architectural worlds converge in this museum district. Most of the 70 cultural institutions that make up the Museumsquartier are located in charming Baroque-style royal stables from the 18th and 19th centuries. In sharp contrast, the Leopold Museum and MUMOK modern-art museum show off futuristic blocks of whitewashed limestone and charcoal-colored basalt rock.








The Haas House

Next to the rigid, Neo-Gothic buildings in Old Town, the Haas House looks like something from another planet. The contrast is even more startling when you see the iconic St. Stephen’s Cathedral's reflection in the glass facade of the newer building. An unlikely pair, but they're an awesome sight side by side!








Vermählungsbrunnen Fountain

This amazing fountain almost wasn't even built. In 1702, Leopold I promised to build a grand monument after the Siege of Landau. But the Vermählungsbrunn (“Wedding Fountain”) didn't arrive until 30 years later. Wander around its thick marble basin and admire the Baroque-style bronze canopy hovering above the stone figures of Mary and Joseph at the altar – a rare sight in religious art!








Donnerbrunnen Fountain

This fountain caused quite the scandal in the 18th century. Considered indecent rather than innocent, sculptor Georg Donner’s naked allegorical statues of Austria’s four main rivers were removed by Empress Marie Theresa. Luckily, copies of the muscular bronze figures now embellish the delicate fountain, and you can even check out the originals in the Baroque Museum at Belvedere Palace.








St. Stephen's Cathderal

Wherever you're at in Vienna, look up and the sight of St. Stephen’s Cathedral will definitely catch your eye. This Gothic masterpiece is the city’s most vivid symbol – from its 450-foot-high spire, to the vibrant patchwork of colorful roof tiles that carries Vienna’s coat of arms. Make sure you pack your camera to get close-ups of every intricate detail!








Old Town of Vienna

If you like architecture, Vienna’s historic center is a dream come true. It has everything from Gothic church spires to Habsburg-era palaces. And after you’ve gotten pics of the iconic St. Stephen’s Cathedral, follow the Ringstrasse for a tour of the city's many architectural styles – from the ornate Neo-Renaissance Opera House, to the Burgtheater's Baroque-Revival statues.








Kunsthaus Wien

Home to the world’s only permanent Hundertwasser exhibition, KunstHausWien is an eye-catching building with a haphazard checkerboard mosaic covering its facade. Designed by the artist himself, its interior is just as characteristic, featuring deliberately rolling floors, bold colors, and no straight lines in sight. With more than 4,000 square feet of available space, the Museum’s calendar is full of temporary exhibitions.

I went specifically for a relaxed few days and the Christmas markets. I was most certainly not disappointed. Vienna is a very easy city for tourists in terms of transport and things to do and see.Only thing be prepared to pay 50 cents for every toilet you need to use while you're there.

Vienna is a good place to visit if you like art, music and good food. If you dont like the high cost of living just take pictures back with you from this cultural gastronomy of history. Dont miss Schonbrunn palace or ringstrasse whatever you do.

Transportation





Vienna Transportation









Air



Schwechat is Vienna’s international airport. It’s modern and very well organized. The fastest airport-to-city route is with the City Airport Train (CAT) – it takes 16 minutes and departs every 30 minutes to Wien-Mitte Station. The cheapest option is to catch the local S-Bahn 7 train (25 minutes) starting at 4:30 am, but the staircases make it impractical with luggage. Taxis are readily available – book one online for a flat rate.




Vienna International Airport
www.viennaairport.com











Train



Wien Hauptbahnhof is Vienna’s main train station. The station itself features dozens of restaurants and shops. Connections can easily be made from here to the city’s metro, tram and bus lines. Tickets for journeys to other cities within Austria can be purchased from machines inside the station. Tickets for international or long distance travel can be purchased at the service desk or booked online.




OBB (in English)
www.oebb.at











Metro



The metro system is Vienna’s best transportation option and is available within the city and to the outlying suburbs, departing every 5 minutes (10 min. at night) and running all night Friday and Saturday. Purchase tickets from tobacco shops, online or at the station machines. Bundles of 4 single-journey tickets or 24/48/72-hour and weekly tickets are available. Single-journey tickets can also be used on buses and trams – make sure you validate before boarding or risk a fine.




Weiner Linien
www.wienerlinien.at











Tram



Trams have the best network for getting to the outer edges of the city, but they can be hard to navigate for the inexperienced. Stick to the metro, unless you know the exact route you want to travel. If you do decide to use the trams, stops are well marked throughout the city and depart frequently – look for the red and white "Strassenbahn Haltestelle" signs.




Wiener Linien
www.wienerlinien.at











Car



Many people don’t drive in the center of Vienna due to its relatively compact size. Parking garages are available and on-street parking (2 hours weekdays, free Friday 10 pm to Monday 9 am) is limited. Purchase parking vouchers in advance from tobacco shops and machines, or on-the-spot by text message. For a cheaper option, find a Park&Ride; near one of the stations.




Rental Cars
www.rentalcars.com











Taxi



Vienna has an abundance of taxis, so finding one shouldn't be hard. There are clearly marked taxi stands throughout the city or you can hail one from the street. Taxis charge a basic fare then an extra fare based on the time of day and distance traveled. Special services, like taxis for mobility impaired passengers, are also available by phone.




Taxi 40100
www.taxi40100.at











Bus



Buses for travel within Vienna don’t depart as frequently as the metro does. Night buses run after 12:30 am (check stops for the "N" sign). Buses for destinations outside the city leave from depots adjacent to the major train stations. Buses to major international cities depart from the Vienna International Bus Terminal (VIB) at Erdberg; tickets can be purchased at a service desk or online.




Wiener Linien (city buses)
www.wienerlinien.at











Bike



Central Vienna’s compact size makes it a perfect place for biking. Biking here is very safe, with clearly marked bike paths throughout the city. Look for colorful "City Bikes" at the bike stations – usually multicolored and easy to spot. Bikes can be returned at any bike station with a free place available. Register online before your trip to save time and get the first hour free.
