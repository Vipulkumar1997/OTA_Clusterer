Eiffel Tower

It doesn’t get much more romantic than gazing out across the city of love with your favorite person in the world. Maybe that’s the reason why hundreds of people drop down on one knee at the top of the tower every year. The dizzying heights and stunning views alone are enough to give anyone butterflies, but a meal at the magical "Le Jules Verne" restaurant might just seal the deal.

What Guests Said About Eiffel Tower:





Anonymous











I stood beneath the Eiffel Tower and looked up trying to imagine the past and the men that built this magnificent structure

if one goes to the Louvre you acquire headsets. It is pretty amazing viewing a painting of Napoleon crowning Josephine  and the historical significance of this amazing piece of art is explained in the most beautiful artistic voice. Captivating... , not just this one painting the whole museum of priceless treasures. I felt honoured to view this amazing collection. The artifacts are breathtaking. It is amazing riding a double decker bus and wearing a headset. Two trips around the city and you are most familiar with the sights and their historical significance to start your journey. Plaques in doorways and on statue's leave the visitor a good over view of the past. A trip to Versailles again headsets that advise the visitors the past. The streets, the cobblestones the architecture, the open markets and cafe's, the preservation of the past intact is so very  amazing to a first time visitor. Paris is exciting! Paris is busy. Paris is steeped in culture and is bigger than life itself. I stood beneath the Eiffel Tower and looked up trying to imagine the past and the men that built this  magnificent structure. The residents of Paris make their city come to life. They are proud of their city. Very clean and orderly.

), Sacre Coeur, Eiffel Tower & Notre Dame, and if you must, the Arc de Triomphe, but it's not worth the hassle)

Skip the Louvre & the Champs-Elysees, stroll the Tuilleries and the Latin Quarter instead, & talk to people, but remember you're in THEIR country so learn some basic French (please, thank you, G'day, G'eve, etc.) - you'll find a lot of people who speak English.  Use the Metro and the "river taxi" (that's what I call it, anyway).  DO enjoy cafe au lait often at outdoor cafes, look at around and up at the old buildings, take your time and soak it all in.  Don't waste money on 4 & 5, or even 3 - star hotels & "fancy" restaurants - see where the most French are eating and try those places.  But, I'm biased and fluent in the language.  One can "do" Paris in 3 days - Musee d'Orsay, Musee Marmottan (Monets!!!), Sacre Coeur, Eiffel Tower & Notre Dame, and if you must, the Arc de Triomphe, but it's not worth the hassle).  Skip Versailles, go to Fountainbleau (you can get a R/T ticket at the Metro station (subway, train, bus).  Hotel in the Latin Quarter.

A good view of the city can be found at the top of the wheel/roue within the jardin des tuileries rather than queuing for the tour Eiffel or scycraper

Find all the hidden playgrounds, visit the jardin du luxembourg and budget for carousel rides. A good view of the city can be found at the top of the wheel/roue within the jardin des tuileries rather than queuing for the tour Eiffel or scycraper.

Go to Eiffel Tower early, they shut down access to the top when we were there because of over crowding at the top

Eiffel Tower: Guests Love These Nearby Hotels





Private Apartment - Eiffel Tower - Ecole Militaire









“
The location is good to visit Paris. It is almost right in front of the Eiffel Tower, a ten minute walk away.  The train station is within 100 meters so you can go to the Champs Elysees by tube to find the shopping. It is a tasteful apartment and clean.
”






Hôtel Henri 4









“
Location is superb, 2 blocks away from Notre-Dame de Paris, staff is very nice and helpfull, the hotel has that "old hotel touch" that is amazing, and we could see the Eiffel tower from our room.
”






Hôtel de l'Exposition - Tour Eiffel









“
The breakfast was good and fulfilling :) EXCELLENT LOCATION, Eiffel Tower is walking distance. The parking was great, since having a car in Paris is not very ideal thing hehe Overall, our stay was really good, very recommended hotel! Would stay here again next time!
”






Avia Hôtel Saphir Montparnasse









“
The room was clean, soap, shampoo, and clean towels were provided, reception was very polite and spoke English. Metro station is right outside the hotel for easy transportation anywhere in Paris. Neighborhood is quiet and about a 20 min walk to the Eiffel Tower. Good WiFi quality.
”






La Clef Louvre









“
An easy walk to the opera area, Louvre, Notre Dame, St. Chappelle--a little further, but very pleasant walk, to the Eiffel Tower.  The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating.  The junior suite was like a beautiful little Parisian apartment.
