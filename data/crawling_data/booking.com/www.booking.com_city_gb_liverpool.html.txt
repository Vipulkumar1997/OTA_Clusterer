A great city with a lot of culture,exciting architecture both old and new.There is a spectacular waterfront with the Mersey being a wide river so it is worth a trip on the ferry.There is a sense of history and much of the older buildings have been carefully cleaned and restored.The museum of Liverpool is very interesting.A pity to see some beggars in doorways,but that’s fairly common in most places these days.

Vibrant, historical city with enough going on to occupy even the most fussy of travelers. Beautiful location on the marina, the city centre has hours of shopping to be discovered and a plethora of cafes, restaurants and bars to surrender to once exhausted. Teppanyaki sapporo is a must! Love thy neighbour if you love thy gin 😉🍸

Such a vibrant, exciting city.

Such a vibrant, exciting city.  full of heritage and memories of the famous who have walked its streets.  Shopping is amazing ranging from to brand stores in Liverpool 1 to bargain outlets in St Johns.  The dock is a delightful place for coffee or lunch.  There is practically every cuisine you can think of available in the city centre, and the most amazing Vegan ice cream.  For nightlife Liverpool cannot be beaten, From Mathew Street with the Cavern to Concert Square and Krazy House, there is a music genre available for everyone. you cant visit Liverpool without hunting for some superlambBananas, genius invention.  Finally the Liverpudlians are the nicest, most helpful bunch I have ever met, always feel 100% safe when Im in this awesome city.

Liverpool is my place of birth and is a wonderful modern city. The city centre has been reinvented with a genuine mix of classical architecture and modern comfort. There are a wonderful choice of excellent restaurants, bars,clubs and pubs. The Albert dock, echo areana, Sefton park, two premier league football clubs and Liverpool one all make the city a must place to visit.

Having gone for the Beatles hot spots, I realized how much more there was to do! It's a beautiful, clean city with lots of museums and great places to eat. Even on a random Friday in November, there was a buzz.

The Mountford Hotel









“
Nicely maintained Hotel "typical old fashioned english style a la Laura Ashley". Parking in front of the Hotel. Not too far from attractions in Liverpool city and harbour site (only 5 Pounds by taxi). Got a last minute booking discount/offer - means 45 Pounds instead of 85 (that made the stay reasonable).
”






Hard Days Night Hotel









“
Excellent location in the centre of Liverpool, next to Mathew Street & the Cavern Club.The hotel is housed in a lovely old building that's been converted tastefully into a great 'Beatles' hotel.Extremely friendly & helpful staff.They checked us straight into our room on our early arrival in the morning.They also upgraded our room without any delay when I reported problems with the bed and air conditioning.
