Recent Reviews








Sandee Place Chomthong


Review Score: 8.2




“Big rooms, nice bed, helpful owner and great location close to Doi Inthanon.”








Inthanon Hostel


Review Score: 9.2




“PJ, the owner, is really nice and the place is perfect for a gateway from the city. Quiet place, fully-equiped kitchen and A/C in the dorm room. ”








Touch Star Resort


Review Score: 6.7




“There is no good point except location around the hotel. And foods they serve are fairly good. ”








Bansuan Inthanon Low-Cost Resort


Review Score: 6.5




“The property is located close to Doi Inthanon National Park. It is a good place to stay if you plan to spend more than one day in the park or if you want to get an early start in the park in the morning. It is located just a short distance from highway 1009. The rooms are clean and the internet works great. We enjoyed our stay here. It is very basic, but the price is great. If you want luxury, then go to a more expensive place. If you want basic lodging at a great price, then this place is for you.”








Baan Suan Kittikorn


Review Score: 7.7




“Room was absolutely huge! Good parking and a lovely pretty garden. Wifi was good. The man who checked us in didn't speak a word of English, but that was ok!”

How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
