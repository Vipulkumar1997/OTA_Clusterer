It is a beautiful city and very easy to walk around from what I could see. I took a paella cooking class which was amazing. Check out the Bouqueria Market off La Rambla so much to see there wish I had more time to explore. Definitely have plans to go back.

Of all the cities I visited in Spain, Barcelona was the friendliest. I like it for its diversity in people and food. I spent 4 days here and saw a-lot of the major attractions and still didn’t see everything. I needed more time to get to know the non touristy side of Barcelona too. Maybe on the next trip.

Fourth time in the city and it never fails to always discover something new to see and visit old familiar places in this City.  It’s great to see the progression of the Sagrada’s construction year after year.  Commuting within the city has always been by far efficient and excellent.The city has too many exciting places to offer that will cater to any type of traveler. Always love to come back to it.

Hotels That Guests Love in Barcelona





Quadrat D'Or Apartamentos









“
The location is great with easy access to many sights. Room is very clean. Breakfast is the best in hotels we travelled in Spain. But, the best part is the service from Angeles! She is very helpful, considerate and did everything she could to make our trip to this great city enjoyable! Thanks!
”






Hotel Via Augusta









“
The rooms are very comfortable.  We get a  queen size bed (matrimonio) in Spain, and it was very comfortable.  After a 40 degree day in Barcelona, the air conditioning was perfect.  The staff is super accommodating and is ready to help with any need you might have.
”






Olivia Balmes Hotel









“
Modern clean hotel with all amenities. Quit rooms. Good silent and modern airco. Good breakfast at reasonable price (given you have no real alternatives due to lack of breakfast tradition in Spain )
”






Dream Gracia Apartments









“
The locatin is great. The metro is just a few blocks away. Lots of restaurants, supermarkets and shops around. Modern, spacious apartment with a well equiped kitchen. Very nice. Our best stay in Spain.
”






Hotel Center Gran Via









“
Everything! The staff especially Sofia were so helpful even emailing me beforehand to advise me of the best way to get from the airport to the hotel. They really take care of their guests with lots of excellent advice and help.Even though the location was right in the centre of Barcelona the rate was very reasonable. I liked it so much I am taking my wife to the hotel in October
