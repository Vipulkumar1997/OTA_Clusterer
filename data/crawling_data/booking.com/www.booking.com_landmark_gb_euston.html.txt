What Guests Said About Euston Station:





Anonymous











If you can, walk on foot instead of taking the underground (tube) it is possible to walk from Euston station to the british library and King's cross in almost a straight line

If you can, walk on foot instead of taking the underground (tube) it is possible to walk from Euston station to the british library and King's cross in almost a straight line!  Work out which tube stations are the nearest to the places you want to go and take the most direct routes.

Hilton London Euston









“
Convenient for my dinner event and London Euston Station. Clean room, comfortable bed, modern bathroom
”






Euston Square Hotel









“
Great location for Euston station. I used it as a stop over. Room was very small and tired looking. Shower was poor. Tiles were dirty. I did not have breakfast as I read reviews and they put me off. I got this room last minute reduced from £300'to £100. I know it's London but if I had paid £300 I would have felt robbed
”






The Belgrove Hotel









“
Location good, very handy for Kings Cross, St Pancras and Euston stations and underground. Buffet breakfast not too bad. Price good for central London. Decent places to eat and have a drink nearby.
”






Studios2Let - North Gower









“
I am impressed how they have managed to equip such a small room with everything you need - really everything! Good communication, WiFi is okay, Good location and really close to Euston station and Warren Street. Railway station St Pancras is close enough to be walked. They gave us a UK to EU plug.
