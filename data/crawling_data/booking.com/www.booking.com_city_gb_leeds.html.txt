Leeds Travel Guide










Stylish, Stately and A Shopping Haven!
Between Bronte Country and the Yorkshire Dales, Leeds is a stately city with a wealth of impressive Georgian and Victorian buildings. The most celebrated is the town hall, a historic gem with a huge clock tower supported by columns. Just around the corner is the understated Leeds Cathedral, and between the two is Millennium Square, a large urban space that plays host to outdoor concerts and a German Christmas market.
Shopping in Leeds is fantastic. Kirkgate Market is Europe’s largest covered market, and the magnificent, round Corn Exchange is home to exclusive boutiques. The city also has the first Harvey Nichols outside of London, as well as the usual high street brands.
As home to 2 large universities, Leeds has a young and vibrant vibe. It has repeatedly been voted the clubbing capital of the UK and is home to the Leeds Festival, an annual music event that attracts thousands.
The city also has excellent sporting pedigree. Internationals are held at Headingley cricket ground, and Leeds United FC and the Leeds Rhinos rugby league team are well-known names in their fields.
On the outskirts of the city are wonderful Roundhay Park, Kirkstall Abbey and Leeds-Bradford International Airport. Leeds accommodations on Booking.com covers all areas of this elegant city.

Lots of variety on activities available.

Lots of variety on activities available. Impossible to do everything in one to two days. A weekend would be enough to cover everything. Large selection of places to eat and drink. Plenty of shops and all easy to access.

Leeds is a beautiful city.

Leeds is a beautiful city. I don't think I realised just how beautiful. There is something for every body. I also liked the fact that it's not overly busy and you don't have to worry about being bustled about.

Only come to Leeds for the cricket, wouldn't want to go on a night out, during our short stay over 3 days, there were 2 stabbings & a suicide! Saw far too many drunks for our liking but this seems to be the norm in Leeds...we like a good time & a drink but there are limits!

Leeds is an awesome city, large enough to house an area but small enough that it's all walkable! So much going on in the city at one time. You should try bundobust (vegetarian Indian street food! Delish!)

I love Leeds!

I love Leeds!Take a walk down the back of the train station along the canal to the Granary Wharf where there are many lovely independent restaurants.  Catch a free water taxi to Leeds Dock to watch free performances of jousting at the Royal Armouries and then relax in a few independent bars.  Walk up over the Ampitheatre bridge to Brewery Wharf and The Calls where you can take in the magic of people watching with a glass of your favourite Leeds brewed ale... all before starting your shopping spree with class in the many shopping areas (no shop is repeated so no space is the same!). And to top it off... Leeds people are fabulously bonkers.  I love Leeds :-)
