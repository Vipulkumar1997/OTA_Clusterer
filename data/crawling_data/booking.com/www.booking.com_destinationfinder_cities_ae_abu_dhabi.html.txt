Visit Abu Dhabi: Your Travel Guide


Abu Dhabi’s as sleek as a sports car and growing at lightning pace. In a mere four decades, this dusty town of palm-wood houses transformed into a jungle of skyscrapers. Saddle up for mega-malls, eco-cities and adrenaline-pumping hyper-coasters, because this desert oasis is all about extremes.

Things to Do in Abu Dhabi









Qasr al-Hosn

If these walls could talk! The Qasr al-Hosn fortress is a view into the city’s distant past, or at least when your grandpa was in short trousers. In the 70s it was the city’s only major building. Today its 250-year-old bricks stand out against the glinting skyscrapers around it. Visit the annual Qasr al-Hosn Festival for innovative cultural shows and traditional markets.



Al Hosn, Sheikh Zayed the First Street, Abu Dhabi




Not officially open to the public. Informal tours can be arranged with the management.









Al Wahda Mall

Once upon an Arabian night you may have explored Abu Dhabi’s traditional souk markets. Today, those cluttered grottos have given way to a veritable “Cave of Wonders”. The Arabian-style Wahda Mall has one of the city centre’s grandest façades. Before you can say “Open Sesame!” you’ll be flitting between stores and bagging bargains faster than a flying carpet!



Hazza Bin Zayed 11th Street, Al Wahdah, Abu Dhabi




Open Sunday-Thursday 10:00-22:00, Friday-Saturday 10:00-23:00









Marina Mall

Dive into Abu Dhabi’s own seafront shopping centre. If you don’t want to waste valuable tanning hours searching for souvenirs, a 5-minute trot will get you from beach to boutique. From fashion to perfumes, antiques to local crafts – you can zip round Marina Mall and be back relaxing on your towel in no time. After getting yourself a nice big ice cream as a reward, of course!



Corniche Street, Abu Dhabi




Open Saturday-Wednesday 10:00-22:00, Thursday 10:00-23:00, Friday 14:00-23:00









The Corniche

Even when temperatures soar, Abu Dhabians still manage to exude cool. Fancy joining the in-crowd? Grab a flashy ride and cruise down the Corniche’s seafront strip. The more easy-going locals head to the promenade cafés for sunset views over the Gulf. Parks are scattered along this stretch with playgrounds, go-cart tracks and even stages for open-air shows.



Corniche Street, Abu Dhabi









Sheikh Zayed Mosque

The Grand Mosque’s scale is awe-inspiring. Its great white domes billow up into a vast and endless sky. Saying that, the beauty here is in the detail. Any corner of this palatial sanctuary can become a tiny cosmos. Chandeliers glitter like stars, pools shimmer like oceans and intricate carpets roll out like lush landscapes. Take the sunset tour for something truly otherworldly.



2nd Shaikh Rashid Bin Saeed Al Maktoum Street, Al Khaleej Al Arabi Street, Abu Dhabi




Open Saturday-Thursday 09:00-22:00, Friday 16:30-23:00









Yas Waterworld

And you thought the desert was dry! This waterpark is Abu Dhabi’s worst-kept secret for anyone looking to escape the city heat. Hang ten on the surf simulator, fly into watery battle on the Bandit Bomber roller coaster, or plunge into the belly of the beast on The Rattler. For more sliding and less queueing, avoid the Emirati weekend (Friday and Saturday) or get a VIP pass.



Yas Island, Abu Dhabi




Open Monday-Sunday 10:00-18:00. Changes seasonally.









Ferrari World

Buckle up, people, this is quite a ride! Hop into F1 racing simulators, whizz through 4D experiences, and put pedal to the metal on Formula Rossa – the world’s fastest roller coaster. Take a tour around a miniature Italy and stop off for an authentic Neapolitan pizza afterwards. For anyone who’s ever said a car is “just a car”, Ferrari World will make you think again.



Yas Island, Abu Dhabi




Open Monday-Sunday 11:00-20:00









Yas Mall

Furniture shopping one second and skiing the next? Yas Island’s “super mall” is about so much more than retail therapy. Practise your twirl at Snow City’s ice rink or swing by the Fun Works adventure zone with the kids. Even if you’re not so keen on rides, could you really say “no” to dinner delivered on mini roller coasters at Rogo’s Restaurant?



Yas Island, Abu Dhabi




Open Saturday-Wednesday 10:00-22:00, Thursday-Friday 10:00-00:00









Yas Marina Circuit

This place has the winning formula for F1 lovers. The world-famous track snakes around majestic event venues and the sparkling marina. Those short on time can get their adrenaline kick in the karting zone. For the more adventurous – get behind the wheel of an Aston Martin GT4 or an F1 racing car, or slide into the passenger seat and let a professional show you how it’s done.

Emirates National Auto Museum

Out in the desert, you’ll find a pyramid. This one’s not in honour of a great ruler – but great automobiles. Motor-mad Sheikh Hamad created the site for his own collection of classics, giving car lovers a place of worship. Swap the Great Sphynx for giant replica 4x4s, cash in the pharaoh’s riches for hot rods and Merc’s, then fall to your knees before the world’s largest truck.

Transportation





Abu Dhabi Transportation









Air – Abu Dhabi International Airport



Abu Dhabi International Airport is the city’s main airport. The fastest and most convenient way to reach the city centre is by taxi. The 6-seater black Mercedes Vitos line up at the lower curbs of Terminals 1 and 3. A taxi to the city centre will take about 30 minutes and cost around AED 75. Fares must be paid in cash. Alternatively, green and white A1 buses line up outside the terminals and take about 45 minutes to the centre. Fare is AED 4 and can be paid on board.










Bus



Abu Dhabi’s public bus system is well connected and has stops marked by signs in English and Arabic. The blue and white buses run 24/7 and arrive every 10-20 minutes depending on the route, with less frequency after midnight. One-way fare within the city is AED 2, which must be paid in coins on board. Regional routes cost AED 4. Chewing gum is prohibited on board and women and families have priority seating in the first 3 rows.




Abu Dhabi Bus
dot.abudhabi.ae











Car



Driving in Abu Dhabi is relatively easy, and rental cars are readily available at the airport. To rent a car, foreign travellers must present an International Driving Permit and a copy of their passport and visa. Delays are possible during rush hour, which is generally from 7:00–10:00 and 17:00–20:00. Parking is difficult, but hotels and malls generally have availability. Parking meters cost between AED 2 and AED 3 per hour, depending on the place.










Taxi



Taxis are a convenient and relatively cheap mode of transport in Abu Dhabi. The silver cabs can be easily hailed throughout the city, or reserved in advance by downloading the Abu Dhabi Taxi app. Alternatively, reservations can be made by phone. Cabs are always metered, and price increases incrementally based on distance travelled and time spent waiting. Tipping for good service is customary but not compulsory. Fare must be paid in cash unless otherwise noted.










Yas Express Shuttle Bus



The Yas Express is a hop-on, hop-off shuttle connecting all the major attractions of Yas Island, including most hotels, the beach and marina, Ferrari World and Waterworld. The Blue Route runs from 09:00–21:00 daily, while the interlinking Red Route runs from 09:00–02:00. The Saadiyat Route connects Yas with the neighbouring Saadiyat Island from 10:00–19:00. The Yas Express is free to use – just look for the designated bus stops around the island.
