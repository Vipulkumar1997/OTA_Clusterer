Bristol Travel Guide










From Brunel to Banksy!
Britain’s 4th most popular visitor destination, Bristol features Brunel’s magnificent Clifton Suspension Bridge spanning the Avon River. More Brunel handiwork is in the harbor, where his SS Great Britain steamship is moored. Pirate walks here detail the city’s underground naval history.
Further north in Clifton is the world’s oldest zoo outside a capital city. Other Bristol attractions include At-Bristol Museum and the Grade I registered historic Corn Exchange with its 4 "nails" outside where money changed hands. Also worth a visit is St. Nicholas Market, in a Georgian square home to several bars and a Slow Food Market on the 1st Sunday of every month. Other Bristol shopping options include shopping centers at Cabot Circus, and Cribbs Causeway on the outskirts.
As a student city, Bristol really comes to life after dark. The live music scene here is fantastic and has given way to several internationally known bands, but for something more alternative head to Eastside.
Another option for alternative-seekers is the work of hometown street artist Banksy. Just like Booking.com’s Bristol accommodations, his work is spread throughout this fabulous city.
This Gateway to the West Country is served by Bristol Airport and Temple Meads train station. The old Bristol to Bath rail line is now a cycle route and makes a great day trip.

Very walkable city with a lot to see.

Very walkable city with a lot to see. It has everything you would want in a city. Vibrant feel to it. We stopped in at a church and ended up staying for the beautiful, meaningful service. A fabulous city!

Bristol Cathedral to the suspension bridge and to the quay...

Bristol Cathedral to the suspension bridge and to the quay are pleasant walks into history.  "Evensong" will lift your spirit to new heights of appreciation for the architecture that the notes of the organ fills with reverent awe.

Bristol was great to get away from the bustle of London...

Bristol was great to get away from the bustle of London without losing access to cool pubs and restaurants. The city also offers some good sightseeing options (the views from Cabot Tower and the Clifton Bridge are quite nice), although that's probably not Bristol's greatest strength. If you stay more than a couple days plan side-trips (eg Bath, Weston-super-Mare).

Just around the corner from The Bristol there are riverfront...

Just around the corner from The Bristol there are riverfront bars. There are also some great pubs on King street serving food. It's easy to get around by car/bus or walking. Go to the Bristolian for breakfast/brunch but get there early, it's very popular.

Lovely hotel, convenient to Temple Meads train station. Somewhat run-down area of Bristol. Great staff.
”






Future Inn Bristol









“
Close to Cabot Circus but good pub (the Volunteer Tavern) behind and close to the Exchange where we went to see a band. Staff were helpful and friendly. Despite it being a Bank Holiday Friday the hotel was quiet. Free parking. Best value central Bristol Hotel I have stayed in.
”






Holiday Inn Express Bristol City Centre









“
This hotel whilst great for a visit Bristol is also ideal for visits to Bath where hotels are expensive. Directly opposite Temple Meads and a 11 minute cheap train ride to the centre of Bath.
