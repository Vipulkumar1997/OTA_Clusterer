I love Paris.

I love Paris. The shops, streets, the wonderful Parisians, museums, the bridges, the food, the Seine and Galleries Lafayete. And, the magnificent sights: the Eiffel Tower, Arc d'Triomphe, Musee d'Orsay. Just roaming the streets and sitting in cafes observing all the lovely people.

Paris is a very beautiful city full of history and culture.

Paris is a very beautiful city full of history and culture.  It is walkable and has much to offer all types of visitors.  You can't help but embrace the charm strolling down the cobblestone roads and exploring the side streets.  The local churches offer concerts by local musicians which is well worth the investment of your time.  There is a special ambiance that stays with you which makes you want to return.

This is my third trip to Paris.

This is my third trip to Paris.  The first was in 1983, the second in 2001 and then this one in 2017.  I found the people in Paris as very friendly and willing to help whenever help was needed.  I found this trip to be my favorite visit to Paris overall and this is reflective of the people of Paris themselves.

“
Excellent  little boutique hotel in the heart of Paris, attentive staff and a wonderful breakfast as well as extensive mini-bar
”






Apollinaire









“
The staff made us felt welcomed! The hotel is located in a quiet street, yet surrounded by restaurants & cafés, theaters, boutiques, a 10 min walk to Jardins du Luxembourg, close to a metro station, to gare Montparnasse and the Air France shuttles to the airports. The rooms are small, which is the case in lots of Paris hotels, but well equipped and quiet. The beds and pillows are very comfortable. Individual A/C unit in the room. Loved staying there!

Hotel du College de France
