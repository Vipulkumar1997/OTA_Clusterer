Venice Travel Guide










A City to Fall in Love With
Renowned for its romantic charm, the entire city of Venice is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spread across 118 islands, formed by 177 canals and connected by 409 bridges this city is truly magnificent.
Its breath-taking architecture and spectacular art entice millions to experience its history and beauty every year. From San Marco Square with the Doge’s Palace to the lively Jewish Ghetto, Venice can be both opulent and down to earth.
Visit the Rialto Market and the charming Rialto Bridge and then take a gondola ride through the canals before learning how Venetian and Murano glass is made. The city’s churches, piazzas and museums are all worth a visit and can be easily reached within a short walk.
The Venetian Carnival is an unforgettable experience, with or without a mask. The latest trends in modern art are on display at the Venice Biennale and Italy's cinema take center stage at the world’s oldest Film Festival.
Buses and boats run from Marco Polo International Airport and Treviso Airport to the city center. From luxury hotels, to comfortable B&B;, to self-catered apartments, Booking.com has great accommodations for your trip to Venice.

Venice is a very unique city with lots to see and explore...

Venice is a very unique city with lots to see and explore via walking or boat.  Traveling during the off-season provides significantly reduced crowds and a pleasant atmosphere as long as it doesn’t rain.  The water transportation is easy to use and very convenient.  Don’t miss the outlying islands, they are each worth a partial day trip to explore.

All the sights were so beautiful.

All the sights were so beautiful. The lines for some were a little long but I guess that is to be expected. It is such a unique and gorgeous city. Every picture we took looked unreal. Would love to go back!

Since we traveled in late November, the crowds weren’t too bad-I can’t imagine the place in high season! But an absolutely magical city. The city is wrapped in soft sea air and has a gentleness about it. The local people I spoke to had a real sense of place-kind of a feeling of investing in their home. Also, one of the themes of the city is respect, and that really came through to me.

Venecia es una ciudad muy bonita para dos días, obligatorio tener que ir acompañado, si vas solo con un día basta para decir que conociste Venecia.
La plaza San Marcos es su mayor atractivo, los paseos en góndola y la cena en una de sus callesitas más singulares al lado de los canales.

The water bus is the first thing you should do.

The water bus is the first thing you should do. Ride the route with your map to get your bearings then go to Murano, Burano and Torcello. When you are hungry stop and find a restaurant. They post menus on the outside. Watch out for a cover charge as this can run your bill up.








Hotels That Guests Love in Venice





Splendid Venice - Starhotels Collezione









“
Contemporary feel, friendly & helpful staff.  We have stayed at other sat at hotels in Italy.  They never disappoint!
”






Hotel Marte









“
We were a family of 5 traveling, 2 teens and 1 small child, in italy for 2 weeks via train.  This hotel was close to the station, in a nice area.  Venice can be a maze to get around so to tow luggage a short distance was important for us.    Be aware that this hotel has a lot of steps for check in and to the rooms.  It might be difficult for older people to operate this facility.
”






Hotel Belle Arti









“
Decent size room for a triple.Breakfast was typical for Italy.location was excellent no bridges to cross from either Academia or Zaterre  Vaporreto  stops.Dorsudorro district is much quieter than San Marco. When next in Venice we will use this hotel if it is reasonably priced.
”






Hotel Principe









“
Excellent staffs and very helpful...very warm welcome. Near train station. Room is perfect and clean. Best hotel so far for our trip in Italy
”






Hotel Flora









“
The breakfast was the best we had in our 23 days in Italy.  Eggs (scrambled or on a great open faced muffin), sausage, extremely fresh breads and pastries, charming outside courtyard, and attentive/friendly staff taking care of us.  Location was a reasonable walk to everything we wanted.  Near the San Marco boat pier and plaza (amazing), wonderful shopping, walking distance to more good restaurants than we could try.  Staff was super helpful with everything.  Room overlooked a treed courtyard.  A rare find in Venice.  Very quiet. Clean.
