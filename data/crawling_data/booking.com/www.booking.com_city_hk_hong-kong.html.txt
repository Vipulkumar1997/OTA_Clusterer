Hong Kong Travel Guide










Style Amidst the Skyscrapers
One of the world’s busiest and most populated cities, Hong Kong is best-known for its stunning skyline with over 1,200 skyscrapers and its “East meets West” cultural mix. With architecture and interior design influenced by feng shui and modern technology, this city is truly unique.
Hong Kong offers plenty of interesting city and thematic tours, ranging from cuisine-oriented, to architecture  or nature. The latter is particularly fascinating as Hong Kong has many amazing mountain landscapes, marine parks and the Tian Tan Buddha on Lantau Island is only a ferry ride away.
Kowloon is a busy urban center near Victoria Harbor, where ferries are an excellent choice to see just how tall Hong Kong's buildings actually are. Excellent tax-free shopping can be found in high-class malls, boutiques and street markets.
Hong Kongs’ unique cultural fusion is clearly seen, tasted and heard in the local food, like dim sum from Maxim's Palace or hot pot from street vendors complimented local Cantopop music in the background.
Arriving at Hong Kong International Airport you’re only a short trip from the city center. Whether you’re staying in a chic hotel or a budget hostel, Booking.com has the perfect accommodation for a holiday in Hong Kong.

Honk Kong certainly lives up to its name as a “world city”.

Honk Kong certainly lives up to its name as a “world city”. It has the most amazing public transport system that I have ever encountered. Everything works, but then it has to with 8 million people living in the most densely populated area in the world.  Besides the incredible number of shops and restaurants it has many places worth visiting. The beaches at Repulse bay, Stanley etc are wonderful. Places like Ocean Park, Pai O, HK Disney, Zoological gardens are all worth a visit particularly if you have children. There are innumerable bars and eating places. You will certainly never be at a loss for anything to do, eat and drink in HK!

Hongkong offers the best in food and in sights and in city lifestyle! 
I would definitely go back as Hongkong is now very near to my heart.
Just be careful of the hotel booking you would make. As there would be lots of walking involved, make sure a good night's sleep is there - key is good hotel. It does not have to be luxurious; it just has to be comfortable and clean!

Disneyland made my son so happy!

Disneyland made my son so happy!😊 We had a good time. It's priceless!Roaming around Hongkong was easy thanks to their MTR. Foods were bit expensive on some restaurants but still we enjoyed. Looking forward to visit again👍🏼

Hong Kong is great for travelers of all ages.

Hong Kong is great for travelers of all ages. For the young and adventurous, there are scenic hiking trails both within the city and along the coastal areas. For families with young children, it has child friendly theme parks like Disneyland and Ocean Park. Public transport is cheap and can get you to almost anywhere you would like to go. Tram rides on Hong Kong island is always a special experience. One is always spoilt for choice when it comes to food. The little noodle or roasted meat shops along the streets can turn out to be surprisingly good. For finer dining , Times Square or Lee’s Theatre at Causeway Bay have a great variety of cuisine to choose from.

Loved the city.

Loved the city. Easy to get around, lots of shopping and nice restaurants. We went to Happy Valley Horse Racing Wednesday night and it was such a good experience. Victoria Peak is of course a must - Uber up and tram down. Had Italian at La Taverna, and went shopping at Harbour City

“
Loved the feel of the entire hotel! So elegant and welcoming and the staff were most helpful and friendly. The rooms were very comfortable and bigger than the average hotel room in Hong Kong. The hotel is located very centrally and has everything within two mins walking distance including the MTR. Hope to stay at the Langham again!

”






Mira Moon









“
What was not to like from size of room, king size bed and stand alone bath with views over city - great after trekking in the Territories for 8 hours. Service was always polite and friendly and the happy hour at the bar a great way to recharge before hitting the restaurants and bars in the area. Hotel also provides free-wifi while you are out and about in Hong Kong - great for accessing Google Maps and finding restaurants.
