Recent Reviews








Villa Beaumarchais


Review Score: 8.2




“The breakfast was very enjoyable with a comprehensive buffet (meat, bacon, scrambled eggs, fruits, different breads, cheese, croissants, yoghurts, jams...). The rooms are bigger than usual in Paris and in an old fashioned style. The decoration of the common parts is very beautiful, in particular the canopy. The location of the hotel is very good, in a calm street (good to sleep) next to a bigger one with stores and restaurants”








Faubourg 216-224


Review Score: 6.6




“The bed was confortable. We had a problem in our room and the gentleman from the front desk ( night shift) was helpful and quickly sorted our problem. Breakfast was nice and a bus stop right in front of the hotel entrance was a plus. Mini fridge and safe in the room were also a nice touch. Towels and bed linen were clean.”
