Sheffield Travel Guide










Beyond The Full Monty
Partially located in the Peak District, Sheffield is best known as the setting of "The Full Monty" and indeed, vibrant Sheffield has everything: excellent shopping, great nightlife and an impressive athletic heritage.
It first became famous during the Industrial Revolution for its pioneering role in the UK steel industry. One technique invented here is commemorated in the name of its most famous theater, The Crucible, home of the Snooker World Championships.
Close by are the peaceful Winter Gardens with their multi-arched roof. The Peace Gardens are overlooked by the elegant town hall, and the focal building of the impressive Botanical Gardens somewhat resembles Crystal Palace, also by the same architect.
The city’s 2 soccer teams – Sheffield United and Wednesday – play at Bramall Lane and Hillsborough Stadium respectively. The cutting-edge English Institute of Sport is also based here, and the nearby Sheffield Arena is a prime UK venue for music and entertainment. The best shopping is found in the Meadowhall Centre near Rotherham.
Booking.com’s Sheffield accommodations include city center hotels with parking, others by Victoria Train Station, and guesthouses near Doncaster Sheffield Robin Hood Airport.

Sheffield is a vibrant buzzing city with great music and lots of creative vibes. Visiting the independent shops are a must and capturing the independent vibe. There is a constant update of new cool places opening. If you love coffee then Sheffield has some of the best coffee shops in the UK 😊

I really enjoyed the city centre although I only had 3 hours to look around. The Peak Disrict is beautiful. The car park that I parked in was a little bit of a mystery as no markings on the floor and no direction given to ascertain the whereabouts of the pay station!

Good food at Brown's at the plaza by the public buildings - old and new.  We were there for the art in the Cathedral and in St. Marie's, so in one day, had time for that.  We could have stayed another day, but this was only a stopover on the way to London from the Peaks.

We went to see the David Mellor factory in Derbyshire.

We went to see the David Mellor factory in Derbyshire.  Near hathersage.  We went to see Caro Emerald at the City Hall and it was a great venue.  The bus service seemed frequent and was ideal for getting into town.  However the staff did not know about it at the hotel.....








Hotels That Guests Love in Sheffield





Copthorne Hotel Sheffield









“
Clean, tidy and comfortable. Close to shops and convenience store is just few meters from the hotel. Free, fast wifi and good value. Friendly staff.
”






Halifax Hall









“
It was an authentic English style stay. However, the hotel should be a three star. No lift, and a converted old university building, the room has no air conditioning, although I did not need one when I stayed there at the middle of summer. A bit noisy, the staff however were genuinely friendly and helpful, lovely staff.
”






The Florentine









“
The rooms are really nice and clean and the place has a sense of Urban Chic.
The hotel is an old building but it is well maintained.
”






Holiday Inn Royal Victoria Sheffield









“
The hotel is okNothing awesome nothing bad
”






Garrison Hotel









“
Everything about this hotel was great. The breakfast was nice, staff were very friendly, and we loved our room. I was very chuffed to have found this and will use it again when I go to Sheffield.
