Bustling city, pretty expensive taxis were plentiful but would not listen to concierge you would get half way through a journey and they would ask where it is you wanted to go. You don't have wifi so difficult every trip. Make sure u have location on google maps before you leave wifi.

Great dining options, loved the hotel.

Great dining options, loved the hotel. To be honest we didn’t get out that much as we were a tiny bit ill after two weeks in India! I’m sure there is much scope for exploration! Dinner at The Table was great, and they do a good Pisco sour!






Sanjay

8.0


not proper night life, nothing to see some thing historical...

not proper night life, nothing to see some thing historical castle or forts, just some buildings of british era, new buildings are also ordinary, not upto the level of New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Dubai , traffic is among one of the worst very scary, no rule for traffic , vehicles don't follow lane system, very rough driving.






Chitra

I was in transit so can’t say much.

I was in transit so can’t say much. But my first impression was not good. Old rickety taxi from airport with lugfage being tied on top which reminded me of 30 years ago. Had to walk quite a distance to the taxi even though prepaid. No curbside pick up. Very antiquated and not something I would have expected of a large city.
