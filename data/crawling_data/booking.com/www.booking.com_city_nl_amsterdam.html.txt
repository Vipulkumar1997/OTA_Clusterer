Amsterdam Travel Guide










The Best Culture and Nightlife this Side of a Canal
Jump on your city bike or hop on a canal boat and admire Amsterdam, the Venice of the North! The beautiful city houses, romantic bridges, iconic canals and street cafés create its unique atmosphere and give you an ultimate taste of its fascinating past.
Famous for its museums, most important of which are located in the Museumplein, Amsterdam offers you a chance to see unforgettable masterpieces by Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Mondriaan and more. The Anne Frank House is a sobering reminder of the city’s more recent history. After a lot of walking, the Rijksmuseum is a great place to rest and get some extra culture before visiting Amsterdam’s lovely Vondelpark.
The medieval Old Center with the always busy Dam Square and the tempting Red Lights District is the most visited part of Amsterdam. Make sure to stop at Leidseplein and Rembrandtplein, homes to the best nightlife venues.
Shop till you drop at Amsterdam’s most luxury shopping street, PC Hooftstraat, the most popular street market at Albert Cuyp or in the fancy design shops of the Jordaan district. Famous pancakes and frites with mayonnaise are a must-try! The more adventurous traveler might want to try the pickled herring, followed closely by a local beer.
All these attractions are just a short train ride from the Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport. Whether you want to stay at a cozy hotel on a canal, a modern apartment in a quiet part of the city or a room in the center of everything, Booking.com has a perfect accommodation for your Amsterdam vacation.

Great town, people very friendly and helpful, interesting mix of nationalities, good public transportation, great little restaurants, old world feeling with mod coms.Only draw back is the weather was awful. Cold and rainy. Also it took me a while to get used to all the bikes and bike lane, almost got hit a few times. Also leave extra time at the Amsterdam Airport. It took us about 40 minutes to get through passport control after the security check in. Then there was about a 20 minute walk to our gate, longest ever.Still, all considered, I'd come back again but in the Spring or Summer.

One of the safest cities in the world.

One of the safest cities in the world. Great public transportation, great food choices, great museums, and so much more. Ate at the Upstairs Pancake House again, tiny with four tables and worth the wait, got foot massages in Chinatown, and shopped for Xmas. Love this city!

Beautiful city with a great flair and really good restaurants. The people seem to be very friendly and the atmosphere ist chilled.The setup with the small rivers all over the city makes it very nice.I really like the city and definitely recommend it.

Still one of the best cities I have seen.

Still one of the best cities I have seen. City layout, public transportation and canal travel make getting around very easy. Always seems like an example for others. Clean, beautiful, and the architecture is amazing.

A beautiful city with lots of things to see and do.

A beautiful city with lots of things to see and do.Transport links are very easy to access and are cheap.The people here are really friendly and helpful.Great for sight seeing and seeing the weird and wonderful.Be advised to book excursion/trip/museum tickets in advance a few weeks before you travel as popular attractions can be hard to get into if you haven't booked and paid in advance.Overall it was a great experience and I can't wait to book to go again

You can book a train ticket from schiphol airport to the town centre beforehand (train takes 15mins and is fairly frequent)  it's also worth buying tickets to the museums beforehand to avoid the queues. The free app for the rijksmuseum is basically their audio guide which is very good,  but remember to take headphones.








Hotels That Guests Love in Amsterdam





INK Hotel Amsterdam - MGallery by Sofitel









“
Comfortable bed, comfortable pillow, wonderful shower.  Room also had nice decor.  Staff was friendly, attentive, and helpful.  Hotel located in city centre and perfect for touring downtown Amsterdam.  We will be back!
”






Bastion Hotel Amsterdam Amstel









“
hands down value for money, staying in amsterdam in a "proper" hotel with free parking is by all means not cheap, and just 15 mins drive from center this hotel is a good bargain, staf were very polite, enteance area and lobby is very nice and give a 5 star hotel feel
”






Corendon Vitality Hotel Amsterdam









“
Amazing Hotel , Good vibe , excellent staff members very boutique interior Great break fast deal , the hotels restaurant has the best hamburger in whole Amsterdam !
”






Dutch Design Hotel Artemis









“
Nice hotel with a very good value for money (for Amsterdam, taking into account we got them via "late deal" on bookin.com). 20 minutes via tram to city center, but the tram route itself was very nice :)
”






Amsterdam Teleport Hotel









“
The best thing that the hotel is near Train station, and from that station to Amsterdam central there is every 4-6 minutes new train coming, and it takes 4-5 minutes to reach Amsterdam Central station. "The ticket cost 3.20 Euro.
”
