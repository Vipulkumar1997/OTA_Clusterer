Recent Reviews








Pacific Shores Inn


Review Score: 7.9




“Rooms was completely remodeled recently and very tastefully done.”








Good Nite Inn San Diego near SeaWorld


Review Score: 7.8




“Room-rate was okay for this hotel within walking distance of the old town. Good parking facilities: quiet neighbourhood. Dennis restaurant conveniently close with discount-tickets offered by the motel.”








Hotel Indigo San Diego - Gaslamp Quarter


Review Score: 8.9




“-Hotel are excellent, but I had bad experience. -Clean room, very comfortable bed, big shower. But they do not have a refrigerator.-Despite the holidays, we found parking on the street much cheaper (10-15$) than the hotel (47$). -Breakfast was delicious. But no reason buy room with breakfast, because they give you voucher for 15$ per person and you spend it on restaurant on 1st floor. -Friendly stuff.”








La Jolla Beach Travelodge


Review Score: 8.5




“We were met by a very nice lady who informed us about the hotel and the town. The room was well equipped, but a bit small. The motel is just a short walk from the beach, but quite a bit longer from the centre of town. Europeans can walk there, but americans would need to use the car.”








Best Western Plus Bayside Inn


Review Score: 8.6




“Great access to cruise ship terminal and several walkable sights and restaurants.”








Ramada Gaslamp/Convention Center


Review Score: 7.4




“In 1912, the elevators in this hotel were the "fastest in the world," and attracted visitors from all over southern California.  There is a very nice 360 degree view from the roof.  The staff was very friendly.”








ITH Adventure Hostel San Diego


Review Score: 8.6




“Perfect Location in San Diego Downtown. Stuff was very friendly and helpful during my stay. Would recommend this place to everyone who wants to have fun and interesting stay in San Diego”








Hyatt Regency Mission Bay Spa and Marina


Review Score: 7.7




“Location”








Holiday Inn Express - Downtown San Diego


Review Score: 7.9




“Position, friendliness of staff, cleanliness all excellent. Airport shuttle was a must in our decision making as we were going to the cruise port.  Bonus that the shuttle took us to other venues.”
