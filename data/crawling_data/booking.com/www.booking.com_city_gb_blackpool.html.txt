Blackpool Travel Guide










Beside the Seaside, Beside the Sea
A favored vaction spot since the Victorian era, Blackpool is a traditional English seaside town. Amusement arcades and crazy golf courses line the promenade and dotted between them are plenty of places to pick up fresh fish ‘n’ chips and Blackpool rock.
On the 5-mile sandy beach, children can enjoy Punch and Judy shows and donkey rides. Old-fashioned entertainment at its best. At the other end of the scale is the Blackpool Pleasure Beach, a fairground complex comprising a variety of rides, including The Big One - once the world’s tallest and steepest rollercoaster. They actually had to get permission from nearby Blackpool Airport to erect it!
More seaside pursuits are on the town’s 3 piers, one of which is Grade II listed. However, the most recognizable landmark is the Blackpool Tower which houses a circus, 4D cinema and a world-renowned ballroom, to name a few. Modeled on the Eiffel Tower, it is spectacularly lit during the annual Blackpool Illuminations, when the whole town is bathed in bright lights. The trams plying the prom are also lit. Look out for the one shaped like a ship.
A popular bachelor and bachelorette destination, Blackpool has accommodations ranging from North Shore hotels to South Shore B&Bs; - see Booking.com for the best choice.

Ongoing road works throughout approach to town.

Ongoing road works throughout approach to town. Many poorly signed diversions. It must be a nightmare for anyone visiting Blackpool for the first time. Public transport (trams and buses) are excellent.

Blackpool offers a glimpse of a holiday destination in the 1950's & the 1960's The tram system is wonderfull, it offers a cheap and reliable way to see Blaclkpool all the way down the coast to fleetwood.

Blackpool needs updating.

Blackpool needs updating.beautiful Victorian buildings decaying regrettably. But any short break is what you make of it.have a walk down the prom, call in at wetherspoons for a drink and something to eat. Buy candy floss and rock,have a McDonalds and stare out to the rough Irish sea. Enjoy Blackpool's illuminations in the autumn in the evening, and go to funny girls. Lifes way to short to never go to Blackpool and enjoy it for what it is..








Hotels That Guests Love in Blackpool





Tiffany's Hotel









“
This was a yearly trip to Blackpool with my 2 grown up daughters and toddler  granddaughter.  Just a couple of days for fun and rest and cocktails. Nice pink hotel, clean and bright.  Comfortable rooms and beds, at least in 2 of our 3 rooms. Entertainment looked really good but you need to get in very early to get a seat. Breakfast was quite nice. Sea view rooms nice. Food acceptable. Good for older people with no children.
”






The Savoy Hotel









“
Nice comfortable bed, only on first floor so able 2 use stairs, good choice of TV channels and like most of the hotels in Blackpool bus and tram stops right outside and very reasonable prices
”






The Trafford Hotel

”






Blackpool FC Hotel









“
When we arrived we were met by the concierge who showed us to a parking space and took our bags in. Nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are furnished lovely and nice comfy beds and facilities and the free biscuits were very tasty Not far from the seafront however it's a little walk to the town centre but it's a nice walkOne of the best hotels in Blackpool
