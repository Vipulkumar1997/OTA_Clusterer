Visit Tokyo: Your Travel Guide


What do you get when you throw together some sushi, shogun warriors, Hello Kitty, karaoke and goth-geisha girls? A bunch of clichés about Tokyo – but you’ll barely have scratched the surface of this ultra-modern city at the forefront of 21st-century living.

Things to Do in Tokyo









Kokyo – Imperial Palace

Japan’s imperial palace is a Shinto paradise, filled with lily ponds of ornamental carp and billowing weeping willows. Kokyo’s immaculate inner grounds are only publicly accessible on December 23 and January 2; any other time you can peek at the treasures within from the perimeter. Fun fact: in monetary terms, Kokyo’s land is worth more than all of the real estate in London combined.



1-1 Chiyoda, Chiyoda-ku




No public access









Takeshita Street

Maids, rockabillies and bears – oh my! Takeshita Street is loaded with niche costume shops selling everything from medieval wench-wear to "Gothic Lolita" maid uniforms to the odd pair of kitten ears. As part of the legendary "Harajuku Girl" charm, you’ll spot girls sporting the costumes as slightly impractical everyday wear. Kawaii (cute)!



2-1 Dogenzaka, Shibuya-ku




Open every day 11 am – 8 pm









Meiji Jingu Shrine

Don’t be afraid to "drop some coin," especially if it brings you good luck. Meiji Jingu Shrine is set in 173 acres of pristine forest, capped by the giant Tori Gate made from a 1,500-year-old cypress. Purify your hands and mouth before stepping towards Emperor Meiji’s shrine, throw coins into the box, bow twice, clap twice, then pray and bow again.



1-1 Yoyogi-Kamizono-cho,Shibuya-ku




Check website for details









Tokyo Tower

There’s no way to deny it – Tokyo is a gigantic city, which can be seen from every direction atop this iconic tower. Painted bright orange and white, this 1,092-foot steel tower is the second-tallest freestanding structure in Japan. There are observation towers at 492 and 820 feet above ground, providing a bird's-eye view of the city. Not for the squeamish!



4-2-8 Shiba Park, Minato-ku




Open every day 9 am – 10 pm









Ginza Wako Building

Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton darling…names, names, names! Identifiable by its clock tower, the grand Ginza Wako Building is a shopaholic’s paradise that’s fashionable by day, boldly illuminated by night. This renowned shopping, dining and entertainment district contains flagship stores for every international luxury brand you’ve heard of – even some you haven’t.



4-5-11 Ginza, Chuo-ku




Open every day 10:30 am – 7 pm









Shibuya Pedestrian Scramble

That poor chicken didn’t cross the road expecting to be snatched and plucked, but maybe that's how you’ll feel crossing this infamous pedestrian thoroughfare. You’ll be jostled every which way but up, as a zillion smartphone-glued people head past you in all directions. For the faint of heart, you can observe the drama from the Tsutaya Building’s Starbucks on the second floor.



2-1 Dogenzaka, Shibuya









Akihabara

If Robocop needed a new knee joint, you’d probably find him trawling the stores of Akihabara. Known as "Electric Town," tinker around Akihabara’s electronics shops that sell high-end appliances, DVDs, computers, and the odd robot part. It recently became a mecca for anime and manga fans, called "otaku" (geeks), who buy collectibles and figurines here.



Around JR Akihabara Train Station Sotokanda, Kanda, Chiyoda-ku




Open every day 10 am – 8 pm









Tsukiji Fish Market

Give a man a fish, and he’ll eat for a day. Teach him how to fish… and he’ll probably sell the spoils at auction. There’s no reserve price at Tsukiji Fish Market, where you can witness the daily spectacle of live tuna being auctioned off from 5:25 – 6:15 am. Limited to 120 visitors a day, arrive before 5 am and register at the Fish Information Center. Then treat yourself to some sushi for breakfast!



5-2-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku




Open Monday to Saturday 5 am – 2 pm









Sensoji Temple

Raijin (God of Thunder) and Fujin (God of Wind) preferred to simply bliss out than worry about all that pesky weather nonsense. Walk underneath their statues that stand proudly over the main gate, then make your way to the main temple – dedicated to the bodhisattva Kannon (Avalokitesvara). A post-temple bargain hunt in the stores on Nakamise shopping street can’t be missed.



2-3-1 Asakusa, Taito-ku




Open every day 6 am – 5 pm









Tokyo 'Skytree' Tower

Superman wasn’t the only being who could scale a tall building in a single bound. Shoot skyward in the rocket-speed elevators that head to Tokyo Skytree’s observation decks, 1,150 and 1,480 feet above ground. The tallest broadcasting tower in the world has an aquarium, planetarium and 300 shops and restaurants at the base of the tower, great for post-flight snacking.



1-1-13 Oshiage, Sumida-ku




Open every day 8 am – 10 pm









Shimokitazawa

Teenagers, trendsetters, and theatrical types rub shoulders in this hip Tokyo suburb. Youth culture reigns supreme in Shimokitazawa’s vintage clothes shops, record stores and buzzing student bars. The district hosts a popular theater festival every February, and annual music festivals in July see live performances spilling from tiny venues into the streets.








Koenji

Known as Tokyo’s capital of retro, Koenji is full of second-hand stores. Savvy shoppers flock here to nab bargain clothes and used electronics at awesome prices – before eating up yakitori and ramen in low-key local cafes! If you’re in town in August, the colorful Awa-odori festival fills the streets with traditional music and dance.








Nakano

Calling all geeks! The Nakano neighborhood flies the flag for nerd culture with an huge variety of stores catering to gamers, comic-book lovers, and collectors of every fandom imaginable. Cosplayers can pick up the finishing touches for their looks in the Nagano Broadway Mall before strutting their stuff in the local streets and bars.








Harajuku

Weird, wacky and wonderful – anything goes in Tokyo’s street style capital. All possible subcultures rub shoulders in Harajuku’s quirky clothing shops, from pierced punks to pastel-and-pigtail-wearing Fairy Kei divas. On Sundays, the hip young crowds show off their latest looks on Jingu Bashi Bridge in front of camera-wielding crowds.








Shinjuku

Towering skyscrapers, bright lights and flashing billboards. Shinjuku is everything you imagine Tokyo to be and more! Beyond the mainstream stores selling cut-rate cameras and computers, mingle with cosplayers and alternative types when you shop for quirky fashion in Shinjuku’s independent malls. Later, head to the neighborhood's karaoke booths and cartoon-themed bars for a night out with Tokyo’s hippest people.

Local Tips for Tokyo







Don Quijote Roppongi




by Rie

Rie has lived in Tokyo for a total of 15 years and loves the city inside and out.


Don Quijote (or "Donki") is a 24-hour discount store that sells everything under the sun. It’s disorganized chaos, where products are piled up in minimal space. However, it’s a reliable source of discounted snacks, cosmetics, electronics and even pet supplies.

Yokohama




by Mari

Mari commutes to Tokyo from Yokohama and loves Tokyo’s great boutique shopping and historic places.


If you're thinking about taking a day trip to Yokohama, try Junkaikaku Restaurant in Chinatown. It's small and inconspicuous but the shumai (dumplings) are to die for. After stuffing yourself, take a walk to the Red Brick Warehouse and the Yokohama World Porters for some shopping or a movie!

Kingyo




by Maiko

Maiko has lived in Tokyo for 6 years and loves its mix of tradition, technology, and underground cultures.


Kingyo is a cabaret-restaurant where talented (and beautiful) drag queens have been performing for more than two decades! The dancers are highly skilled and are absolutely amazing. The cover charge – plus a mandatory drink and dish – come to around JPY 5000.

Robot Restaurant




by Koichi

Koichi enjoys Tokyo’s awesome restaurants, endless entertainment and traditional culture.


Robot restaurant is an underground cabaret restaurant and café which has performances by beautiful ladies in skimpy dresses, a triceratops and flashing and dancing robots.  Sound crazy? It’s a ridiculous and outrageous sensory overload that must be seen to be believed!

Mangekyo




by Ayano

Ayano has lived in Tokyo for 3 years and loves the city’s cleanliness and cosmopolitan vibe.


There are many Japanese-style public bathhouses (called "super sento") in Tokyo. I recommend the Urayasu Mangekyo. It includes a big coed outdoor bath, where you wear a swimsuit. It makes for an enjoyable day trip and there’s a free shuttle bus from JR Shinurayasu Station.

Tachigui Soba




by Akane

After 20 years, Akane still enjoys Tokyo because it is safe, organized and clean.


At the tachigui ("stand-and-eat") soba restaurants, there's a waist-high counter where customers can stand and eat. They're really cheap and quite convenient, especially if you have to eat in a hurry before hopping on a train. There's usually a vending machine to purchase your meal ticket.

Shibamata




by Atsushi

Atsushi was born and raised in Shibamata and has lived in Tokyo for 35 years.


Shibamata is east of central Tokyo. It is one of the rare places with a traditional atmosphere, reminiscent of the Showa days. Taishakuten Sando has traditional shops with Japanese snacks like dango and senbei. Visit Shibamata if you're interested in seeing what the old days in Tokyo were like!

Shibamata, Katsushika-ku








Karaoke




by Mao

Mao’s 4 years in Tokyo have been spent enjoying cafes and restaurants in pursuit of culinary bliss.


When in Tokyo, karaoke is a must. These karaoke rooms are private so don't worry if you're not a diva! Just sing and dance to Lady Gaga or listen to your friends sing some heartbreaking love songs. These karaoke rooms usually have good food and drinks too!

How can you get the most authentic cultural experience in Tokyo?





Anonymous


Give yourself enough time to see everything.  Trains, metro, etc go virtually everywhere so get a Pasmo card and take to the rails.  Keep your eyes open and attempt to take it all in.  Tokyo is an overwhelming environment populated with the most polite and charming people I've ever met.  Eat all the things.  Go out to the suburbs and be confused by everyday things.  Use one of those pit-toilets.  Try to translate your experience into some kind of art form.  Photos don't mean much anymore.  Write a story, draw a picture, create something expressive. It really helps me feel a cultural connection to a place.

Booking.com asked travelers...

Was it cheap, fast, or easy to use? What made it so simple to get around in Tokyo?





Anonymous


Tokyo is so easy to navigate. All the stations have English signage and English announcements, the underground metro line and the overground JR lines are interconnected, and all easily colour coded. The PASMO/SUICA IC cards make paying very simple and cheap, without having to worry which ticket to get and where to. There is almost never a delay, and if there is, it is for a few minutes at most, and you will always be on your way in no time. Be careful of the morning rush on the busier lines (like the JR Yamanote and metro Ginza lines) as it is VERY busy and tightly squashed in the trains.

How can you enjoy the sights in Tokyo while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


We went to Roppongi Hills' Mori Tower Observation Deck for the last half hour of the night. We thought we almost missed it but luckily we had from 9:30 to 10:00pm to enjoy the sights. The only people at the deck at that time were young couples, there were maybe 5 couples. It was eerie, foggy and a great view of the city. Romantic! Also - for other sightseeing occasions, it is best to have an early start out of your hotel to explore. You get less people and the most sunshine out of the day!

What makes the people from Tokyo so friendly? Tell us your story.





Anonymous


People of Tokyo are often shy and insular, and only speak moderate English usually, but are always willing to help if they can, and will go above and beyond to make sure you are on the right track. People in shops and restaurants are polite and patient if you aren't sure of the customs and methods of shopping/eating. And if you are walking outside in the rain without an umbrella, expect to be asked multiple times if you would like someones as they are just walking past you.

Is there more to shopping in Tokyo than just brand-name stores?

Yes, there are many others! If you like souvenirs/food stalls/cheap and varied goods, head to Nakamise Street between Sensoji Temple and Kaminarimon Gate, Ameyayokocho Street near Ueno Park, and in Shinjuku and Shibuya for cheap stores with knick-knacks.
There are many other artisan shops, where the owners actually make their own goods, too!

How do they keep Tokyo so clean?





Anonymous


Good question! There are almost no bins in the city at all except for can and bottle banks near vending machines. Otherwise you have to wait to get to a train station or hotel to get rid of litter. I guess the cultural mentality is to keep everywhere clean and tidy, as we saw NO litter at all.

Transportation





Tokyo Transportation









Air



Narita is Tokyo’s main international airport. The comfortable JR Narita Express Train to Tokyo Station departs every 15/30 minutes. It takes approx. 90 minutes to reach the center and costs around JPY 4,500 (1st class) or JPY 3,000 (2nd class). As an alternative, you can book a one-way Airport Limousine bus at a desk once you arrive – it takes 90 minutes and costs around JPY 3,000. Taxis are readily available, take about 60 minutes and cost around JPY 25,000, excluding toll charges.




Narita Airport
www.narita-airport.jp











Taxi



Taxis are an expensive mode of transportation in Japan, so the cost-conscious should avoid using them if trains and buses are available. If you do need one (particularly when public services end after midnight), stop at a taxi stand or hail one on the street. A taxi is available if the light on top is lit, and occupied if it’s off. Traffic congestion is an issue in Tokyo and road tolls are usually added to your fare.










Train



Tokyo Station is the hub for Shinkansen (bullet trains) to other cities. The JR Train runs from 4:30 am – 12:45 am daily, but each line has its own schedule. Get tickets inside stations – prices vary according to your destination. At Narita, buy a reloadable Suica or Pasmo travel pass for JR trains, subway lines, buses and some taxis. If you're traveling on to other Japanese cities, a Japan Rail pass is available for 1, 2, or 3 weeks (online only, buy before you arrive).




JR Train
www.jreast.co.jp











Metro



Tokyo's 23 wards are connected by an efficient metro system. Ticket machines and station signs are in English and Japanese. Pick up a free subway map to navigate your way around or download one from the metro website. There's strict etiquette for using the metro, and talking on cell phones is not permitted. Women-only sections are available during the morning rush hour.




Metro
www.tokyometro.jp











Bus



Tokyo's buses are clean but often delayed because of traffic congestion. Instead of buying tickets, drop your money into the fares box – it’s important to carry 1000-Yen notes or coins with you. Within Tokyo, buses are usually used for short journeys within or just beyond the ward. To reach cities further away, Tokyo Station and Shinjuku are common departure stations.
