Things to Do in Mecca









The Grand Mosque

The real centre of the Islamic faith, this vast mosque surrounds a huge central courtyard where millions of pilgrims flock each year. Sacred sites include the Black Stone and the Zamzam Well. Visitors will be dazzled by columns, detailed tiling, domes and Ottoman-era flourishes.








Mountain of Light

A truly stunning sight, this peak provides pilgrims with a challenging ascent and an amazing panorama. The hike to the sacred site begins following the annual Hajj pilgrimage. The climb up to the summit takes around two hours and the dramatic views take in the striking landscape.








Makkah Mall

This mall is filled to the brim with shops stocking high-end international brands. You’re best to head here in the evenings and after 17:00, as most shops don’t open until after the Asr prayers. If browsing the stores has taken it out of you, there are plenty of pit-stops in the form of cafes and restaurants.

Verified reviews from real guests.
We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from
real, verified guests.



How does it work?





1




It starts with a booking

The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.








2




Followed by a trip

When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.








3




And finally, a review

After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.
