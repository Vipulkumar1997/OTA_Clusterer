Things to Do in Hong Kong









Mid-levels Escalator and Walkway System

Up, down, side to side... No, this isn't an obscure dance craze you missed out on. Necessity gave rise to a network of elevators spanning nearly 2,600 feet of hilly landscape. Escalators are broken into sections (rather than one continuous stretch) with 14 entrances and exits. Grab your camera and drift past busy streets, apartments and the verdant cityscape.



Connaught Road, Central and West District




Open every day









Victoria Peak

Hong Kong’s highest peak deserves a peek. Visitors flock to the Peak Tram, which scales the side of Victoria Mountain. The observation deck at the Peak Galleria rewards them with awesome views. (Bonus when the Symphony of Lights is blanketing the night sky.) Go ahead and take a picture! Your friends will be so jealous.

Victoria Harbour

There’s no other way to cut it – Hong Kong is BIG with a capital B. On the Kowloon side, propel yourself into space at the Hong Kong Space Museum, ponder two thousand years of Chinese imperial art in the Hong Kong Museum of Art, or brush shoulders with Bruce Lee’s statue on the Avenue of Stars. At 8 pm every night, the Symphony of Lights ignites the sky.

Happy Valley Racecourse

Happy Valley pulsates with excitement. Once you’ve made a bet (minimum 1 dollar, no maximum), head to the edge of the stadium closest to the tracks and cheer on your chosen horse. This five-tiered stadium has been drawing crowds since 1846, when the area was known as "Valley of Yellow Mud." Today, it’s one of the most fun ways to mingle with the locals.

Temple Street Night Market

Temple Street overloads the senses. Bump shoulders with salesmen hawking electronics, men’s clothing, shoes, watches – and the occasional designer knock-off. Before you realize you’ve bought a "Guggi" handbag, you’ll notice opera singers perfecting their pitch, street vendors frying up unidentified crustaceans, and even fortune-tellers working their magic.



Temple Street, Yau Ma Tei, Kowloon




Open every day from 2 pm to midnight









Ladies' Market

Modern ladies have modern needs. Whether it’s an armory of accessories, lipstick in shades of blush and bashful, or "unmentionables," this market will have you covered – literally! Along this half-mile stretch, you’ll find clothes, shoes and accessories galore. The best part? The street closes to traffic from 4 pm to midnight every day except Sunday.



48 Shan Tung Street,Hong kong









Ocean Park

Who doesn’t love swimming with dolphins? Enroll in a Dolphin Encounter then swim into the blue with a trained instructor. If you prefer your marine encounters at a safe distance, rally your troops and make a beeline for the Grand Aquarium. Stand beneath the world’s largest dome and watch a happy Pacific Walrus float on by with 4,000 of his fishy friends.



Wong Chuk Hang, Southern District, Hong Kong Island




Open Monday to Friday 10 am – 7 pm, Saturday and Sunday 10 am – 9 pm









Dragon's Back

After days of dumpling indulgence and general enjoyment, a bit of fresh air helps to clear the mind – and work off a few calories. This scenic hiking route connects Wan Cham Shan and Shek O Peak, running all the way along D'Aguilar Peninsula. Start your trek at Shek O Road and walk the 4-mile stretch to Tai Long Wan (Big Wave Bay) for awesome views of the city.

Did you know Hong Kong has its own magic kingdom? See all your childhood friends at the world’s most famous theme park chain on Lantau Island. Romp around in Tarzan’s tree house at Adventureland, hunt for bears in Grizzly Gulch, or learn the enchanting art of waving with the help of Cinderella and Snow White at the Princess Academy.



Penny's Bay, Lantau Island




Open every day 1 am – 9 pm









The Giant Buddha of Lantau Island (Tian Tan Buddha)

Abandon the mainland and make for Lantau Island. Once your boat is docked, 268 steps lead you to the remote Po Lin Monastery, home of a spectacular sight: the 111-foot Tian Tan Giant Buddha. The area is blessedly spiritual, so nourish yourself with delicious vegetarian food at the monastery’s restaurant, or find a quiet place to sit and contemplate.



Po Lin Monastery, Lantau Island









Chun Yeung Street

Hong Kong's wet markets give a true taste of the city, and none more so than Chun Yeung Street. Located next to the North Point tram terminal, this long, narrow street is lined with stalls selling fresh fruit and veg, meat and seafood. Even if you don’t buy anything, the thriving market is a sensory feast of sounds, smells and colors.








Cat Street

Upper Lascar Row may be the road's official name, but everyone in Hong Kong knows it as “Cat Street.” This buzzing nest of stalls is stuffed with knick-knacks, trinkets and, well, junk. These days you're more likely to find kitsch souvenirs than priceless antiques, but rifling through you might unearth anything from vintage propaganda posters to replica Ming vases.








Apliu Street Flea Market

Technological types get their kicks at Apliu Street Flea Market in the heart of Kowloon. Hong Kong's most famous electronics market is overflowing with all sorts of new and second-hand audiovisual equipment and electrical goods. Look out for everything from top-of-the-range tablets to discounted cameras and bargain-basement phone accessories.








Cheung Sha Wan Road

Known to residents as Fashion Street, Cheung Sha Wan Road is a must for thrifty shoppers. Dozens of local Hong Kong designers line the streets with their boutique showrooms. The focus is clearly on wholesale suppliers, but don’t be discouraged – many shops also retail their wares at slashed prices.








Horizon Plaza

Horizon Plaza is a 28-floor behemoth of factory outlets, including world-famous home furnishings and fashion brands. To get the most from your visit, it’s best to check the directory on the ground floor and focus floor by floor on the stores you want to see, before retiring to a cafe when you’re all shopped out.








Fashion Walk

This modern open-air shopping center covers four vibrant streets in Causeway Bay. Fashion Walk’s concept is simple – blending high-end and mall styles to give visitors the best of both worlds. Its glittering façades are filled with designer brands, while buzzy pavement cafés and restaurant terraces invite shoppers to stick around and dine in the great outdoors.








The Peak Tower

One thing’s for sure – you can’t miss Peak Tower. This gigantic structure looms 1,404 feet above Victoria Harbour, capped with a fabulous wok-shaped roof. Inside, buyers can browse Peak Market’s modern twist on authentic Hong Kong street shopping, accompanied by breathtaking city views. Don’t miss the chance to pick up souvenir artworks, silks and jewelry.








Times Square

Times Square houses ten stories of top designer names right above Causeway Bay MTR station. All budgets are addressed by its themed floors filled with local brands and international labels, including Zara, Tiffany and Gucci. Its vast granite atrium also hosts pop-culture exhibitions and events to celebrate holidays such as Chinese New Year.








Island Beverly Center

Blink and you’ll miss it – this unassuming shopping center doesn’t look like much from outside. Inside though, it’s a colorful treasure trove of all things kitsch and quirky. Island Beverly Center’s four floors are crammed with one-off designs from local labels and the latest imports from China, Korea and Japan. Stalls open late so it’s ideal for evening shopping.








Lee Gardens One & Two

Luxury is the name of the game at Lee Gardens One & Two. Located on an elegant tree-lined avenue, this swanky shopping center is one of Hong Kong’s most exclusive. Flagship brands including Louis Vuitton, Dior and Miu Miu bring in designer fans, while children’s concept floors bring little ones the latest looks from brands like Burberry Children and Baby Dior.








Causeway Bay

If labels are your weakness, Causeway Bay should be at the top of your shopping list. This swanky designer district is packed with upscale boutiques and some of Hong Kong’s most popular malls, including the high-end Fashion Walk, Times Square and Lee Gardens One & Two. Time to shop ‘til you drop!








Sheung Wan

Strolling through Sheung Wan is like stepping back in time to the Hong Kong of long ago. This eclectic neighborhood is famous for its handicraft shops, antiques dealers and traditional Chinese herbalists. Within a few streets, you can buy from local boutiques, sample healing herbal remedies or browse for vintage knick-knacks in Cat Street’s jumble of stalls.








Tsim Sha Tsui

Cleverly abbreviated to TST by fast-paced locals, Tsim Sha Tsui is Hong Kong’s premier retail district. Shoppers flock to this southern tip of Kowloon for designer stores, street markets and swanky malls, including the humongous Harbour City and iSQUARE. Granville Road is lined with outlets, while Nathan Road is a global mix of local and international labels.








Kowloon East and Kowloon West

Just off the beaten path from the frantic heart of Kowloon, Kowloon East and Kowloon West have a relaxed, residential feel. If you want to shop like a local, their neighborhood malls are the perfect spot to find international fashion, authentic Hong Kong food and family-friendly entertainment, from IMAX cinemas to skating rinks.








Lantau

Lantau Island is best known as a nature reserve, but savvy shoppers know it’s Hong Kong’s top outlet spot. Over 80 discount stores offer big-name brands at bargain prices – everything from Adidas and Nike to Levi’s and Quiksilver. Lantau is also directly linked to Hong Kong International Airport, making it an ideal stop for last-minute shopping before you fly.








International Commerce Centre

Soaring into the skies at 108-storeys high, the International Commerce Centre is the tallest building in Hong Kong. Dizzyingly huge from ground-level, a trip up to the ‘sky100’ observation deck will really bring home its sheer scale. You’ll see the other skyscrapers sprouting beneath you, and won’t be able to miss the city’s second tallest building, Two International Finance Centre, just across the harbour.








Two International Finance Centre

Knocked off Hong Kong’s tallest-building top spot back in 2010, Two International Finance Centre is still a towering contender. Overshadowed only by the International Commerce Centre across the harbour, it remains the highest skyscraper on Hong Kong Island. Its 55th-floor observation platform is free – just be sure to take photo ID with you.








Central Plaza

The third loftiest skyscraper in Hong Kong, Central Plaza was once the tallest reinforced concrete building in the world. Its façade blazes with bright LEDs well into the night, changing colour every 15 minutes to help city-dwellers keep track of time. The building is also home to the world’s highest place of worship, ‘Sky City Church’, which sits atop its 75th floor.








Bank of China Tower

The geometric Bank of China Tower juts into the skyline at 367 metres tall. Going against the traditional teachings of feng shui, its structure originally caused controversy due to its sharp edges and ‘X’ shapes. Now, however, the building is so iconic that its futuristic façade has even made it into an episode of ‘Star Trek: Voyager’.








The Center

Office building, The Center, is an iconic sight amidst the Hong Kong skyline. It’s an impressive building with a shiny steel lobby that was once featured in Batman film, ‘The Dark Knight’. After nightfall, its sides glow with bars of brightly coloured lights, running through the spectrum as they climb towards the heavens.








Nina Tower

The misleadingly named Nina Tower is actually made up of two high-rise buildings. Originally designed to be the tallest skyscraper in the world, it was chopped in two due to airport restrictions! Its top 40 floors house a five-star hotel, while levels one to five are a shopper’s paradise. Head up to the free ‘skylobby’ on floor 41 for panoramic views over the Tsuen Wan district.

The hong kong people is not as friendly as people in my town. Watch out for people from mainland china, they are rude. Hong kong people are busy doing their job to earn money and i can see they are stress out. so they are not that friendly.

Popular Neighborhoods in Hong Kong












Kowloon


466 properties

Catch a sea breeze in coastal Kowloon. As morning breaks, sport and Tai Chi enthusiasts head to Kowloon Park. Inside, the Hong Kong Heritage Discovery Centre exhibits the roots of British colonial rule. Strike it rich in one of the 400 shops at the Jade Market in Yau Ma Tei, or haggle with shrewd vendors at the Temple Street Night Market.

Tsim Sha Tsui


278 properties

The city’s busy tourist area mixes shopping and culture. Buy luxury clothing on Canton Road, or grab a bargain at Park Lane Shopper’s Boulevard’s factory outlets.

Endure a few light-headed minutes and take a tram up Victoria Peak for views of the Hong Kong skyline. Sun-soaked Repulse Bay and Deep Water Bay beckon you to a lazy day by the sea. Set sail for Aberdeen Island aboard a sampan (traditional boat) and lose yourself in the life of a traditional fishing community.

Accommodations in Hong Kong Island













Yau Ma Tei


82 properties

A cacophony of colour, this district is famed for Temple Street Night Market’s tacky tat and traditional tucker. Browse the bunting-clad stalls for “I <3 HK” tees and neon wristbands, then gorge on glazed rib-and-rice dishes amid Mido Café’s old-time charm. At historic Yaumati Theatre, round off the night in the dayglo daze of a Cantonese opera.

Accommodations in Yau Ma Tei













Mongkok


69 properties

Mong Kok means "busy corner" in Cantonese. Ladies’ Market on Tung Choi Street sells everything for the modern girl.

On a hot day, find air-conditioned comfort at the Sino Centre’s multimedia shops.

Accommodations in Mongkok













Causeway Bay


43 properties

Causeway Bay is organized chaos. Shopping centers erupt with shoppers day and night, especially in Hysan Place with its 17 floors of shopping. If elbowing your way to a bargain doesn't appeal, head to Jardine Crescent, a local shopping area with bargains to boot. Exhausted? Reenergize in Victoria Park's open spaces, or listen to the Noonday Gun blast.

Accommodations in Causeway Bay













Wan Chai


41 properties

Wan Chai is a friendly assault on the senses. Walk up Stone Nullah Lane for striking pre-war architecture, or slurp up noodles and congee at the local "Dai Pai Dong" (open-air restaurants). Hong Kong Arts Centre hosts provocative exhibitions year-round. Wan Chai's theaters stage popular musicals with a dash of Broadway panache.

Local Tips for Hong Kong







Beer Bay




by Kristin

Kristin moved to Hong Kong from New York and quickly fell in love with the city.


If you are looking to have a cheap drink with great views of Hong Kong Harbour, this place is for you! Located across from the Discovery Bay ferry pier (just a short walk from the Star Ferry in Central), Beer Bay is as low-key as it comes. It's also the most affordable spot in town!

Tech-savvy Calvert loves new electronic innovations and can easily spend a day searching for them!


Here is a shopping tip: Don't negotiate unless you have a few items from the same store! Most of the IT professionals in Golden Computer Centre speak English and are happy to give you advice. If you can, also check out Wanchai Computer City and the Mongkok Computer Centre.

Broadway Cinematheque




by Ivy

Ivy loves movies – and watching them in public areas with friends is a special experience!


I recommend going here to enjoy both the latest blockbusters and special screenings. Before the movie, enjoy a coffee inside the bookstore before heading in to your screening. There are annual themed film festivals, in which films from all over the world are screened.

Allied Plaza is near the Prince Edward MTR Station B2 exit. This mall covers two levels of the latest fashion, beauty, and cosmetics from South Korea and Japan. The price-to-quality ratio is very good! Make sure you bring cash or an EPS/Union Pay card – not many places accept Visa or Mastercard.

Cheung Chau Island and Lamma Island




by Sarah

Backpacker Sarah has traveled to 25 countries and loves different cultures – and hiking!


Cheung Chau and Lamma Islands were once fishing villages. Today, they maintain part of their traditional customs. No vehicles are allowed on both islands, so when you land, it feels like you've arrived in wonderland! The islands are only 25 to 35 minutes on a fast ferry ride from Hong Kong Station (IFC).

Cycling in the New Territories




by Kyle

Karaoke or Mahjong appealed to Kyle as a student, but now he loves cycling – a much healthier choice!


The New Territories will show you the real Hong Kong. Rent a bike in Tai Wai near the MTR station. The most common route is from Tai Wai to Tai Mei Tuk, passing by Sha Tin along the Shing Mun River and Science Park on Tolo Harbour. The scenery along the river and harbor on this 13-mile stretch is beautiful.

by Karen

"Ladies Market" has a lot to offer. Even though it's called Ladies Markets, you'll find items for both genders, like clothing, accessories, handbags, watches, cosmetics and more! The market covers a half-mile stretch and some vendors don't have listed prices – so put your haggling skills to the test!

How can you enjoy the sights in Hong Kong while avoiding the crowds?





Anonymous


Got to take lovely pictures at the Avenue of Stars by going there at 7am. After taking lots of pix, took the Star Ferry and went to HK Island. Walked to the Peak Tram station and before 9am there are no queues to purchase the tickets and boarding the Tram. Went down from the Peak at 9.50am and was the queues were already long as the many tour buses arriving at the station. 
Enjoyed Disneyland by going before noon and buying tickets in town instead of at the ticket counter.

Is there more to shopping in Hong Kong than just brand-name stores?





Anonymous


Yes. In fact, the brand name stores are expensive in comparison with local retailers, like Fortress. The reason? Brand names appeal to the Mainland Chinese who flock to Hong Kong to find goods that will demonstrate their wealth. It is a case of conspicuous consumption and that is what keeps the Gucci, YSL, Dior, Armani, Louis Vuitton stores and their like in business. It is certainly not local HK buyers who are too canny.

Transportation





Hong Kong Transportation









Hong Kong International Airport



Hong Kong's two-terminal airport is one of the busiest in Asia. The easiest way to get to Central Station is by train. Once you clear customs, follow the signs marked "Train." The Airport Express departs every 10 minutes from 5:54 am to 11:28 pm daily. You can buy tickets online or at counters or machines in the station.




Star Ferry
www.starferry.com.hk











Subway



Hong Kong's MTR metro system covers most of the city. Trains run from 5 am to 1 am daily and connect Hong Kong Island and Kowloon with Lantau, right up to the border with China. If you plan to travel extensively, invest in a reloadable Octopus Card, which can be used for both buses and trains. The lines are clean and easy to navigate, with clear English instructions and signs.




MTR
www.mtr.com.hk











Bus



Citybus is the main bus operator for Hong Kong Island. To catch a bus, go to the main terminal at Exchange Square or get on at a bus stop. Destinations are displayed on the front of the bus in Chinese and English. Once you board, deposit the correct change into a fare box (no change given!). For convenience, buy an Octopus Card from a kiosk at the station. This allows you to check in and out on buses. Stick to the MTR trains for travel on the Kowloon side; they cover a wider area.




Citybus
www.nwstbus.com.hk











Taxi



Taxis are easy to find – just stop at a taxi stand or hail one from the street. Fares are relatively low compared to western cities, and must be paid in Hong Kong Dollars. Taxis are color-coded according to their areas of operation. The red Urban Taxis are the most common, serving most destinations in Hong Kong. Keep the name of your hotel in Chinese on hand to show to the driver. It’s customary to round the fare up to the dollar, but tipping isn’t expected.










Car



Rental cars can be arranged at the airport or in the city. Road conditions are excellent and signs are in English and Chinese. Road safety is a priority for the authorities, so there are harsh penalties for breaking the rules. Due to heavy congestion, driving in the center can be stressful, even when it's not rush hour. Parking and gas prices are also extremely high. Remember to keep your international driving license on you at all times.

The cafe is situated on a quiet street which is about 5 minutes' walk away from the Univeristy of Hong Kong. You cannot fail to notice it because its wall is painted in orange and the doors and windows in green. You will feel relaxed once you step inside the cafe because of the soft lighting, the gentle music, and the nice smell of second-hand books.
