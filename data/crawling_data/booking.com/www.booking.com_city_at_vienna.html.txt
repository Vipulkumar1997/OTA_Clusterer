Vienna Travel Guide










Waltz Through the Pretty Streets of Vienna
Previously the center of the Hapsburg Empire, Vienna is the current center of Austria’s culture, economics, and politics. Visitors may think they are in a museum as they walk through the historic first district, but Vienna also has a youthful and dynamic side with lots to offer.
St Stephens Cathedral in the Inner-City is surrounded by the Ring Road, with grandiose buildings like City Hall, the Austrian Parliament, the State Opera House and the Burgtheater. Enjoy the city where amazing musicians like Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, and Mahler once lived. If you're visiting during the carnival season, practice your waltzing skills at one of Viennas 200 glamorous annual balls.
Visitors can wander around beautiful park grounds in the Wiener Prater and Schonbrunn Palace provides imperial and extravagant grounds to stroll through. After exploring, eat with the locals by enjoying famous sandwiches at Trzesniewski, a Wiener Schnitzel at Cafe Central or taste traditional wines at the city’s many Viennese pubs.
Vienna International Airport is the doorway to the heart of Vienna. Booking.com has luxury hotels, charming bed & breakfasts and modern apartments to meet any accommodation needs for your stay in Austria’s capital.

One of our favorite cities in the world.

One of our favorite cities in the world. We feel safe and comfortable in the city. We love the public transportation (easy to use and weekly passes are a great value). The Christmas markets plentiful and fun.

The museums were beautiful and reasonably priced and the public transportation is simple, cheap and convenient. The food is amazing. Most definitely visit the Cafe Central for a wonderful boutique like experience and you must try the schnitzel at Figlmüllers.

Vienna is a wonderful city!

Vienna is a wonderful city!!! Full of arts, music and excelente restaurants!I enjoyed the museums, the city walks!!! I spent a week in the city and was unable to visit everything I wanted!!!I love Vienna!!!

Vienna was absolutely amazing.

Vienna was absolutely amazing. I went for 4 days with my girlfriend and we both loved everything about city. Thanks to the well connected public transport, getting around the city is very easy. Just hanging out at cafes and looking around makes for pleasant time. And there are so many things to see that we couldn't manage it all. For first time travelers, we'd recommend the Tiergarten and the churches. My girlfriend and I surely want to return to Vienna. :)

Beautiful, clean city with great public transportation.

Beautiful, clean city with great public transportation.  Lots to see and do.  Could easily spend a week there.  We used the Viennapass and found it well worth the money for both the transportation and sites to see.

Hotels That Guests Love in Vienna





Hotel Post Wien









“
Room was large and clean. Hotel breakfast was above average for a European hotel. Hotel was in city centre. Bed comfort was average.
”






Star Inn Hotel Wien Schönbrunn, by Comfort









“
Located next to a train station so it's easy to get around city. The rooms have air conditioning and are a fair size for Vienna. Breakfast was typical Austrian hotel fare.
”






Hotel Am Konzerthaus Vienna - MGallery by Sofitel









“
The location is great! You can easily just walk to all the main attractions. But, even though the hotel is very close to the city centre, it's located at a fairly quiet street. I was placed in a very quiet room - perfect for a good night sleep after all the sightseeing.
”






Hotel Ambassador









“
The hotel has an excellent location in the city centre where all the action is there. Surrounded with very good bunch of  restaurants. Furthermore, the rooms were very big and has a nice old style furniture... I loved it
”






Hotel Hahn Vienna City









“
Hotel was chosen do to its vicinity to the U Bahn station which also has a park and ride garage (Erdberg). We parked our car there for a fee of around 3 euros per day. From there it's a 10 minute walk to the hotel. Although free parking is available in the hotel area, finding a free spot isn't easy. But it takes only 10-15 minutes to get to city centre by U bahn. The hotel is modern, clean and serves quite good breakfast so I recommend eating at the hotel before you move on to the city.
