Fraser's on Rainbow











3 Day / 2 Night 4WD TAG-ALONG SELF-DRIVE SAFARI
The Fraser Island Tag-along allows you to have your own 4WD adventure with your mates while having the security and guidance from an experienced lead driver. This safari allows you to experience nature at it’s finest while you camp in your tent under the stars.
HOW IT WORKS: The Tag-along experience involves 4 vehicles on a 4WD adventure on Fraser Island.
The lead vehicle, driven by an experienced guide, seats up to 10 guests while the other 3 vehicles can seat up to 8 people each and are driven by travellers.
It’s the perfect choice for groups after their own freedom but still wanting to learn about the famous island and how to handle a four-wheel-drive safely.
Solo travellers needn’t worry about joining the tour either as they can easily hop aboard any of the vehicles.
Regardless of which vehicle you travel in, the driving is mixed around, giving you the opportunity to experience the thrill of four-wheel-driving on a sandy beach.
A compulsory safety briefing takes place at 2pm in the hostel the day prior to departure. Fraser’s will give you an overview of the trip including a video on the highlights of Fraser Island and a comprehensive driver safety talk to ensure you will safely enjoy your time on the island.
THE PRICE INCLUDES:
Low-kilometre 4WDs
All camping and cooking equipment/utensils
A knowledgeable and experienced trip leader
Return ferry to Fraser Island, approximately 10 minutes from Rainbow Beach
Comprehensive afternoon briefing with video about highlights of Fraser Island
Thorough information on vehicle and driver safety
Pre and post accommodation at Frasers on Rainbow: 2 or 3 nights depending on your package
A spare day in Rainbow Beach to enjoy great local activities or the beach
Food for 3 days and drinking water facility
Camping fees, ferry vehicle access and national park permits

Address: 18 Spectrum St  Rainbow Beach, QLD  4581
