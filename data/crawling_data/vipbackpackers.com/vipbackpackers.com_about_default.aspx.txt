About VIP Backpackers

VIP Backpackers launched in Australia more than 25 years ago when a group of independently owned and operated hostels formed a strategic alliance to help backpackers seek out value for money and quality products that offer special discounts.

Our current owner bought the business around 16 years ago. The owner already had extensive experience in the backpacker sector and started the global expansion of VIP Backpackers Resorts International Pty Ltd. Today, we have more than 1200 independently owned and operated hostels and backpacker resorts in 80+ countries and our global head office is in Brisbane, Australia.

The company philosophy of “save money and do more”, saw the launch in 1989 of VIP Membership which includes a kit containing the VIP International Discount Card and Accommodation and Discount Guidebook. By purchasing a VIP Kit, travellers automatically become a VIP Member which provides them with access to thousands of exclusive discount offers through respected VIP Hostels and Discount Partners.

The continued annual growth of VIP membership is testament to the reliability of the brand to deliver quality, affordable accommodation, a huge range of premium discounts as well as being the recognised source of all things important to the cost conscious traveller.

Covering Australia and Oceania, Europe, Asia, Africa, North, Central and South America, VIP is an instantly recognised brand with the best range of hostel accommodation in these regions.

Today, VIP Backpackers is the largest independent backpacker accommodation network in the world, with over 1,200 hostels across 80+ countries, and counting.
