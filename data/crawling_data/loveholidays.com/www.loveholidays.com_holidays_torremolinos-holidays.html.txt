Top Attractions






For those seeking an adrenaline fix, head for Aqualand, the largest waterpark in the whole of Andalucia and a great place to take the little ones for its rides and slides.

The nearby Tivoli World is Costa del Sol’s biggest theme park that has an array of rides and attractions, regular concerts and flamenco shows.

For some relief from the sunshine, the Sea Life Aquarium is a great place to visit, with crabs and starfish as well as rays and sharks.

Those looking for a memorable experience should visit El Ranchito riding stables in La Colina, where an equestrian show is held on a weekly basis.

Explore the beautiful Sierra Mountains and the charm of the traditional town of Mijas, with its characteristic whitewashed buildings, or take a jaunt along the coast to the cosmopolitan resort of
Marbella
with its excellent shopping opportunities.

Refuel after all the excitement found on a holiday in Torremolinos by heading to the seafront promenade. Known for its beachside bars and seafood restaurants, you’ll find everything from authentic Spanish cuisine to British classics, so you’re guaranteed to find something to cater to your tastes.

Wine and Dine






Torremolinos is originally a fishing village, and no holiday to the area would be complete without sampling several of their famous casual seafood bars on the beach - also known as chiringuitos.

The chiringuitos are the perfect place to have a few romantic cocktails within metres of the sea, while you sample some of the fresh fish caught just that day by local fishermen.

You’ll find plenty of variety at these outdoor diners, with traditional paellas and gazpacho as well as fresh salads alongside the clams, sardines and other ocean bounty.

No time of day is too early or too late for churros, the delicious fried dough snack you’ll find in cafes and at food stalls all over Torremolinos. Try them for breakfast, either sprinkled with sugar or dipped in chocolate, to give you plenty of energy to get you through until lunch.

For Families






Aside from the Aqualand water park, Tivoli World theme park and the Aquarium, there are lots of other exciting places to take children on a Torremolinos holiday, that will be just as much fun for adults too.

The Crocodile Park is an educational experience, as well as a chance to get up close with these fascinating reptiles. See Europe’s largest crocodile, Big Daddy, who weighs in at 500kg and measures 5m long. There are lots of smaller creatures too, and curious kids can even handle some of them.

For days out in the sunshine with the family, the Parque La Bateria is a great place to explore. With more than 74,000 square metres of greenery, and a 9,000 square metre lake, it’s the perfect walking, cycling, rowing and sunbathing spot where kids can play and adults can relax.

If you feel like getting some gentle exercise and practising your golfing skills with the kids, you can also play a few games of mini golf at one of the two courses close to the beach at Playa la Carihuela and Playa El Bajondillo.

Action and Adventure






With its seaside location, miles of beaches and picturesque ocean, Torremolinos is the ideal holiday location for water sports of all kinds.

For an action and adventure holiday in Torremolinos, look no further than the beach, where you’ll find professional tour guides offering rides on giant sausages pulled along behind speedboats. Or you can hire your own equipment and, with a little training for beginners, take off kite surfing, windsurfing or just sailing along at a leisurely pace on a pedalo.

A short drive out to Comares means you can try Spain’s longest zip wire, flying through mountains for 436m for the thrill of your life.

The mountains also give you plenty of places to go hiking, climbing or even trekking around on horseback, taking in the breath-taking views and getting some exciting exercise at the same time.

Life's a Beach






If you’re in search of some winter sun, a holiday in Torremolinos could be just the ticket. A typical Mediterranean climate means that this resort experiences long, dry, hot summers followed by mild winters – perfect for a much-needed dose of vitamin D and relief from the rainy British weather.

The beaches of Torremolinos are one of the area’s main attractions. There are six main beaches to choose from, so you’ll easily find a sandy strip to settle down on and enjoy the sunshine.

Each beach has its own character, and gives you a slightly different Torremolinos holiday experience. Relax in the sedate beauty of Los Alamos beach, for example, with its pleasant breeze and tropical palm trees. Or, for those feeling more energetic, head to Playamar to try all kinds of watersports during your holiday, with everything from jet-skiing to surfing on offer.

Nightlife






If you like to be up and dancing until dawn without punishing your wallet in the process, a holiday in Torremolinos could be exactly what you’re looking for. Relax at beach bars in the early evening, drinking cocktails in hammocks as the sun goes down, and prepare for a beach party after hours with lots of like-minded fun-loving visitors.

There are plenty of restaurants, bars and clubs in Torremolinos with competitive prices, and it’s particularly well served for gay clubs and bars too. It’s a cheaper night out than somewhere like Marbella, but no less fun and lively.

But for the biggest clubs and the busiest streets, it’s less than a 20 minute taxi ride to the regional capital of Malaga, the nightlife centre of the Costa del Sol and the place that attracts people from miles around who are looking to party all night long.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






The romantic beach of the Playa El Bajondilo, with its long stretch of sand, is the ideal backdrop for a holiday for two in Torremolinos

Evening meals by the sea in the beachfront chiringuitos, with a few drinks, will certainly put you in a loving mood, and provide the perfect spot for a coupled-up selfie for your friends back home.

The seven-mile esplanade of the Paseo Maritimo is a lovely place to walk hand-in-hand by the sea, taking in the culture, sights and sounds of this popular route. Right in front of the old town, and stretching almost the full the length of the city, the esplanade is lined with palm trees, as well as quiet bars and cafes that couples will love. Try a walk at dusk to see the sun set for the ultimate in romantic holiday activities.

Culture






Taking in some culture and history is easy during a holiday in Torremolinos. The old town is easily accessible and full of things to see and do, so you won’t regret setting aside some time to explore it.

Start with a walk down the pedestrianized street of Calle San Miguel until you reach the historic Iglesia de San Miguel church, and spend a little time in some of the traditional squares where you can relax with a coffee and watch the real Torremolinos buzzing around you. To see how people with money used to live here, take a look around the Casa de los Navajas, the former home of a wealthy sugar merchant. Built in 1925, it’s now open for you to look around for free but you can tell from the interior that it would have taken a lot of money to live there at the time.

The former windmill of Torre del los Molinos would have been turning back when Torremolinos was still a little fishing village, and you can follow the steps down towards the sea to find shops selling handmade gifts and souvenirs.
