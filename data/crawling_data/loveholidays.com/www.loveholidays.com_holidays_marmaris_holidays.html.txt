Top Attractions






While the stunning turquoise waters and days spent on the beach may call to you, this resort town also has quite a bit of heritage and history to explore. Go back in time with at the historic sites of Ephesus and Hisaronu, which is well worth a visit for those who are looking to experience some ancient history on their Turkish escape. The Marmaris Castle and Museum brings you to the time of the Ottoman Empire, and also provides a stunning view of the marina. Old Marmaris is home to an excellent bazaar where you can pick up a souvenir or two, and the bustling market in
Fethiye
is the place to pick up some great bargains to remember your getaway by. Check out the Turkish baths where you can try a body peel, foam massage or oil massage; it is a must if you're after some relaxing things to do in Marmaris.
If you’d prefer to catch a glimpse of some of the great historical sites in Marmaris, pay a visit to Marmaris Castle. With courtyards abundant in bloom and splendid panoramic from the top, this is a must-visit for history buffs – make sure you dip into the museum for a bit of background history. In the shadow of the castle is a great daily market selling a wealth of Turkish souvenirs. Here, you’ll find sweet spices, locally made shawls and handcrafted jewellery. If you’re looking for something a little more contemporary, head to Thursday’s market at G Mustafa Mugali Caddesi – it is especially popular for clubbing wear and faux-designer clothing.

Wine and Dine






While on your trip to this seaside town, you can be sure that you can find something to suit all palates. One of the Marmaris attractions is to take advantage of all the fresh seafood and have a bite or five of grilled fish dishes, calamari, and fish soup. Dig into some delicious Turkish mezze and dips, and fill up on a wonderful assortment of meat dishes like stir-fried lamb and chicken ravioli. There are also mouth-watering kebabs and even Italian restaurants for those who like to stick with the classic holiday food.

For Families






The Uzan Yali Beach in Marmaris is a perfect place for family holidays with plenty of space to build sandcastles and splash around in the water with the kids. For some of the most beautiful beaches in Turkey that are also family-friendly, take yourself and the little ones away to nearby Olu Deniz, or to the stunning Cleopatra Island. Jump on a water taxi and head to the beautiful beaches that can be found on Icmeler or in the cosy resort of Turunc, rides are available from the Ataturk statue and take less than an hour to get to. You can also spend the day sailing, which is perfect for the older children. Of course, no family trip to this part of the country is complete without a visit to the water park in Ovacik, one of the highlights of nearby Marmaris attractions.

Action and Adventure






For thrill seekers and sports enthusiasts, there are plenty of things to do in Marmaris in terms of water sport activities including windsurfing, jet skiing and snorkelling. This Turkish resort is also the perfect destination for divers with an excellent diving school at the resort offering courses for all levels of ability. On your trip to the Dalaman area, you can hire a bike and explore the coastline or head inland to discover local villages and authentic Turkish living on wheels. If you fancy trying something different, try horse riding along the coast or quad biking up in the mountains. Head out on a Jeep safari and explore the mountains that brush up against the resort, or take a day trip to the Greek island of Rhodes, just across the way.
Adventure-seekers definitely won’t feel out of their depth on their in Mamaris. Instead, head to the main beach where you’ll find a full list of water sports- whether you’re looking to sail along in banana boats or hop on a jet-ski for a fun-fuelled adrenaline ride.

Life's a Beach






Marmaris is one of the busiest resorts on Turkey’s Turquoise Coast in the Dalaman Region and it no surprise that a large part of its appeal lies in its beaches. The long, narrow stretch of beach along the coast is mainly made up of volcanic sand and pebbles, adorned with sun loungers and providing an ideal spot for water sports. Here, you’ll find some great 5-star and luxury hotels situated along the front, perfect for staying close to the action on your Marmaris holidays. If you’d rather set yourself away from the hype, there are many apartments further into town away from the buzz of the beach and the glare of the neon lights of vibrant nightclubs. With short walks to the main attractions, this is a great place to base yourself on your holidays.
If you’d rather relax and recharge on your trip onto the sea, climb aboard a laid-back boat or yacht cruise while keeping your eyes peeled for quieter beach spots along the coastline like
Icmeler
and
Turunc
and the Greek Island of
Rhodes
.

Nightlife






The nightlife in Marmaris offers a good range of bars and restaurants serving local and international cuisines. Head to the seafront promenade or the Old Town for a lively night out or a romantic evening stroll for two. One of the best Marmaris attractions is to try out the great fish restaurants which can be found at the working fishing harbour near to the Old Town. Netsel Marina is packed with up market restaurants or for late night drinks and dancing head to Bar Street. Fans of rock n’ roll will appreciate the area’s only rock bar, Davy Jones’s locker.

Holidays to Marmaris are famed for their lively night scene. For a traditional night out, head to some of the resort’s restaurants, where you’ll be greeted with themed nights showcasing belly dancing and local folk music – with some even laying on some lessons. Once you’ve experienced a glimpse into Turkish culture, head to Bar Street for neon lights, loud and proud bars and clubs that stay open until sunset.

For Couples






Marmaris offers plenty for couples to do be it taking quiet walks or romantic meals. Turkey is the home of the Hammam - a steam bath similar to saunas - and for some quality relaxing time together time there is nothing like heading to a spa for a day. A perfect romantic activity is just to take a walk along the long stretch of beach as the sun is setting or at night, with the moonlight playing on the water. You will find lots of restaurants and bars to stop off at along the way.
