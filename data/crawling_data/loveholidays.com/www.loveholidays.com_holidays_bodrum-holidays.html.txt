Families and beach lovers will love Bodrum with its unbeatable combination of turquoise seas and fantastic activities.Nestled on the scenic south west coast of
Turkey
, where the Mediterranean meets the Aegean Sea, it is just a short transfer from the nearest airport and is only a 4 hour flight from the UK, so you could be soaking up the Turkish sun in no time at all.

There is everything from historical sites to modern marinas for you to explore nearby. You can spend a day away from the beaches, hire a boat from the Marina and sail to the beautiful island of Karaada or simply cruise along the Aegean coastline. For a great family day out head to the Dedeman aqua park or spend the day being pampered at one of the traditional Turkish baths. Why not take in some history and visit the 15th century St Peter’s castle which provides one of the central features of the town. By night, the marina comes alive with many buzzing nightspots to choose from. The central square has a great selection of restaurants to choose from, so whether you try the traditional mezes or are looking for some home comforts, there’s something to suit everyone!

Top Attractions






This cultural was once the site of the ancient city of Halicarnassus, home to the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Unfortunately the mausoleum suffered destruction in the Middle Ages at the hands of a powerful earthquake. Luckily the town is still home to many signs of this ancient world, ensuring that there are many interesting and historic things to do in Bodrum.

Alongside this cultural and historic appeal, Bodrum’s attractions have evolved in parallel to the destination becoming one of the centres of the tourism industry in
Turkey
. Museums and archaeological sites can make way for a beach lifestyle, a burgeoning water sports scene, and vibrant party tourism; resulting in a diverse range of attractions that make Bodrum a fantastic holiday destination.

One of the obvious landmarks of Bodrum is the town’s striking castle. Built from 1402, the attractive landmark also functions as a popular museum which documents and showcases all there is to know about underwater archaeology. Many culture vultures flock to discover the historical things to do in Bodrum, including sites and secrets based around the ancient city of Halicarnassus. Bodrum’s immaculately preserved amphitheatre is a great example of this area’s past treasures, while a visit to the foundations of Halicarnassus’s famous mausoleum are equally as impressive. The old city gates, also known as Myndos Gate, were the scene of a bloody battle during the siege of the city by Alexander the Great. Today they more or less lie in ruin, but their diminished grandeur is salvaged by a stunning location and a similarly attractive backdrop.

Wine and Dine






You’ll eat and drink very well in Bodrum; from cheap eats to fine dining, there are a great range of eateries to suit all tastes and budgets. Fresh seafood and traditional Turkish and Mediterranean cuisine are the order of the day. If your taste buds desire some local flavours, there are some great Turkish dishes to tuck into, including tasty Turkish ‘Mezes’, Bodrum’s scrumptious kofte meatballs, cheap and filling lahmacun, and of course the classic range of Turkish kebabs. A local drink known as raki is a popular partner to seafood dishes, but be careful that you don’t drink too much, as it is rather potent. Some of the best restaurants in the Bodrum area include Avlu Bistro Bar, famed for Mediterranean cuisine, and Kocadon Restaurant, which offers a romantic atmosphere and fantastic Turkish dishes.

For Families






Bodrum is spoilt with a range of great beaches, providing a perfect setting for a holidaying family. The sandy beach at
Gumbet
is a great place for the kids to play and paddle in the shallow water, while parents may prefer to kick back on a sun lounger and catch up on their beauty sleep. Another family-friendly beach can be found at
Bitez
– a Blue Flag beach which is great for swimming and snorkelling. If your family would like to take to the water in a grander fashion, a glass-bottomed boat tour is a fantastic way to keep the kids entertained while allowing further consideration of the riches of the Aegean Sea. Another great destination for some family fun is the Dedeman Aqua Park, a large attraction filled with relaxing pools and thrilling slides. Kids and child-like adults will spend hours splashing and sliding about at this fun joint, arguably one of the best Bodrum attractions for young families.

Action and Adventure






Water sports can be found throughout the coastal areas of Bodrum. Windsurfing, water skiing and jet skiing are all exciting things to do in Bodrum. If you’d like to take a peek at some of the underwater highlights, take to the clear and calm waters of the Aegean Sea and try your hand at some diving. PADI Askin Dive Centre is a great place to gain your diving certificates if you’re currently unfamiliar with the sport. The surrounding area and expansive coastline are fantastic areas to explore further afield. You’ll find various methods for this exploration, though the two most rewarding are by horseback and on foot. The Hayvansaray Horse Riding Centre offers riding sessions in an idyllic valley setting, as well as providing beginner lessons for less experienced riders. If you’d rather explore at your own pace, trekking across the surrounding walking paths provides a great impression of Bodrum’s further reaches.

Life's a Beach






For the beach lovers among you, the coastline is scattered with nearby sandy beaches. Whilst it doesn’t have its own beach, the nearby blue flagged beach at Bitez is perfect for children and families and offers all the water sports you can imagine. If you’re looking for something a bit more peaceful,
Gumbet’s
idyllic beach is lined with café’s and bars, where you can sit back and admire the beautiful sea views.

The relaxed beach lifestyle and chilled dining in Bodrum can be enough to help soothe any ruffled feathers. But Bodrum allows you to go beyond that simplicity and gain the maximum state of relaxation. A good starting point would be the town’s local Hamam, a local Turkish bath spa found opposite the bus station. Here you can enjoy a range of treatments from massage to foam baths. For a completely differed type of bath, you can head to the mud baths found a short journey away from Bodrum Town. If you’d prefer to stay around the water, Bodrum attractions include an active sailing and yachting scene. Windward Islands is a great yacht charter company that will allow you to head out on your own, or with a hired crew, and relax to the bobbing of the sea, as well as providing some memorable coastal views from the crystal clear Aegean Sea.

Nightlife






Bodrum is a nightlife seekers’ paradise! To get your holiday started there’s a fantastic range of bars easily spread out across the town so it’s easy to follow the whims of the evening. The Elbow Bar and Café is great for its stunning bay location and live bands, while the Marine Club Catamaran is a unique way to spend the evening under the stars with different choices of music and vibe on every deck. When you’re ready to hit the dancefloor, Halikarnas The Club, Posh or Sapphire Nightclub are great spots with all-night beats, while the Helva Bar and Kule Rock City offer different musical flavours for rock fans. If there’s an unmissable sporting event you want to catch, Pala Pub has a superb selection of beers, cocktails and screens so you’ll have great views of the match. Bodrum is a true paradise for nightlife, and with venues and music to suit all tastes your holiday is sure to be a blast!

For Couples

When it comes to winding down and enjoying some well-earned wining and dining, you’ll love the restaurants, bars and nightlife Bodrum has to offer.
