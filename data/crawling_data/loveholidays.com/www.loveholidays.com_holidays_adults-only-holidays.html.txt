Don’t feel too guilty about booking your next holiday without the kids, we’re here to help you pick the perfect adult only retreat in 2018 / 2019. Adults only holidays can range from
5 star holiday
luxury in a range of resorts, to a quaint seaside hotel. Whatever your dream holiday might look like, let us help you choose the perfect escape!

We know! Picking a destination can be tricky, especially with so much to choose from. From Majorca to the Canary Islands, we’ve got you covered on some of the most popular
all inclusive
adults only holidays. We've selected our favourites, but there's a lot more on offer. What about a getaway to the
Greek islands
? Crete, Corfu? Or you could go for Zante, or Kefalonia? Still fancying an island adults only retreat?  Paphos in Cyprus?  What about Malta? Might be the one for you. What about the old classic of the resort holiday, Benidorm? Or for a destination further afield, what about Dalaman?

We told you there was a lot to choose from! Whatever you want from your adults only holidays, we've got it here at loveholidays.










Portugal & The Algarve






Romance is number one on the Algarve. From endless sandy beaches under a blissful sun to the beauty of the Algarve's Quartafeira Riviera, the
Algarve
provides everything you need for your adults only holiday. Now, to pick the best adults only hotel… Spa, or next to the beach? Cocktails, or Portuguese cuisine? Look no further!

Albufeira
is the most popular resort on the Algarve and has its fair share of adults only ideal for your 2018 holiday. A resort of two halves, Albufeira has bustling nightlife and the quiet peace of the old town, with cobbled streets and alleyway taverns. What a perfect balanceyou’re your adults only holiday!

Sao Joao can’t be beaten for a true experience of Algarve: a backdrop of white buildings and blue skies to your romantic wanderings, Sao Joao is a great spot to enjoy an adults only holiday. Another hot spot for adults only hotels is
Vilamoura
, the height of Algarve luxury, teeming with bars, shops and restaurants to match your romantic getaway.

Lanzarote






Let’s see about Canaria, then.
Lanzarote
has some serious beach appeal, and you'll find a gorgeous adults only hotel to lay your head. Enjoying some West African winds rolling in off the continent, Lanzarote has almost perfect year-round weather. This means that whenever you choose to visit (maybe surprise the partner?) then Lanzarote is waiting for you.

Think Playa Blanca’s sandy beaches perfect for some romantic lounging,
Costa Teguise
with its quality restaurants for candle-lit dining, and Puerto del Carmen, the best-known resort on the island, which houses some of the top adults only hotels on the island along a beautiful stretch of 4 Blue Flag beaches, including the pretty Playa Chica.

If you want that amazing beach, we recommend Canaria! From
Playa Blanca
to Costa Teguise, Lanzarote is the perfect adults only retreat.

Canary Islands






Two birds with one stone, both
Tenerife
and Fuerteventura join Lanzarote as some of the best Canarian spots to enjoy an adults only holiday. Tenerife and Fuerteventura have great year-round weather and stunning natural landscapes.

Costa Adeje
, the most famous of the resort areas on Tenerife, offers up a fantastic selection of adults only hotels that provide all the luxury and space that you deserve. We recommend checking out Playa de las Americas for fantastic nightlife, dozens of restaurants and some seriously super adults only hotels.

Fuerteventura
has its fair share of beaches. If you want enough choice to dazzle you, pick Corralejo as the spot to enjoy your adults only escape. For a true Canarian feel, try Costa Caleta, a perfect place to wander the seafront and enjoy some delicious seafood in a candlelit setting, or the popular Cala de Fuste, offering some of the best beaches in the Canaries.

Majorca






Majorca has just about everything you need for an ideal adults only holiday. Fantastic hotels, glorious beaches and enough culture and entertainment to keep you entertained all week! With cheap flights and the hotel of your choice,
Majorca
is perfect for a quick beach getaway.

If you’re more of a city break type, Palma de Majorca (Majorca’s capital) sits comfortably in the beachy Bay of Palma.
Palma de Majorca
is a memorable way to combine both your love of city breaks and your passion for beaches! Pick the right adults only hotel, and enjoy a pampered Majorca holiday in the on-site spa.

A big benefit of a Majorca adults only holiday is the island proximity to both
Ibiza
and Menorca. On Ibiza, you can embrace your hedonistic side, and on Menorca choose to relax in a quiet, natural setting. An adults only holiday is all about you, so choose to indulge however you wish!
