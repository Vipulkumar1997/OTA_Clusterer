Top Attractions






Whether you’re seeking unforgettable nights with drink in hand or sun-filled days on the beach, a trip to Zante won’t disappoint. The main focus of all the Zante attractions is likely to be its glittering coastline, where sandy shores give way to idyllic coves and rugged cliffs. Experience the raucous nightlife of
Zante Town
or experience the laid-back pace of beautiful Alykanas. From strolling along its stunning landscapes to diving into the crystal-clear waters below, there are many corners of this island awaiting your discovery – just pack your bags and begin your epic adventure.

Those who enjoy a slice of history can revel in culture on their holidays in Zante. Spectacular landmarks include Soloumou Square and the majestic Saint Nikolas church, boasting an impressive legacy and striking Venetian architecture.

Greece

Fresh fish dishes are made with the catch of the day from the Ionian Sea, while delicious lamb stews and souvlaki can be found in almost every restaurant across the island. If you’re simply looking for a big breakfast to counteract last night’s antics, head to one of the street side cafes on the island for a taste of home.

Action and Adventure






Water sports are particularly popular for those seeking action-packed things to do in Zante. From seasoned scuba-divers to keen beginners, there is bound to be somewhere to cater to your skill level. St Nikolas Beach in Vassilikos offers the opportunity to climb aboard a jet-ski and venture out on to the water but if you prefer your activity to stay solely on dry land, you can still take part in mountain biking on some of Zante’s mountainous terrain.

Life's a Beach






When deciding where to chill out and soak up the sun, Zante boasts a long list of idyllic locations to choose from. The island’s beaches remain a draw for many embarking on their Zante holidays, with several to choose from.
Kalamaki
is a beach of two halves and well worth a visit –indulge in the myriad of water sports on offer or linger over drinks at the on-site beach bar. Meanwhile, the beach at Alykanas has everything on offer to keep you captivated – from windsurfing to banana boats. If you’d rather somewhere a little more romantic, take a stroll down to Dafni. Access is via a steep hilly road in between Argassi and Vassilikos, resulting in a quietly pleasant beach to in Zante.

Nightlife






When the sun goes down is when this island really comes alive. A clubber’s haven, it is easy to see why the island is popular with party-goers on their Zante holidays. Dressed top to toe in neon, head straight for Laganas and
Tsilivi
, which are filled with bars, clubs and pubs – offering everything from foam parties to neon nights.

Laganas
is the ultimate destination for party-goers, with numerous bars and nightclubs offering every genre of music imaginable. One of the most well-known clubs is Rescue Club, a super club famed for its high capacity and pumping dance music. While the island’s evening entertainment is comparable to that of bigger and rowdier islands, you’ll find your pennies stretch that little bit further – making it an excellent choice for clubbers seeking a fun-fuelled getaway on a budget. If you don’t fancy the bright lights of Zante’s nightclubs, head to one of the lesser-known cocktail bars and linger over a drink as you watch the sun set over the water.

For Couples






With its enticing concoction of great nightlife and fabulous stretches of sand, Zante is an ideal destination for couples. Of all the Zante things to do, the beaches are the main focus. Head to Kalamaki Beach for it honey-coloured sands – relaxing on the sun-loungers underneath the glare of the sunshine will give you that much-needed slice of paradise you’re after. What’s more, the beach is inhabited by the native loggerhead turtles that come here to nest so keep your eyes peeled for them!
