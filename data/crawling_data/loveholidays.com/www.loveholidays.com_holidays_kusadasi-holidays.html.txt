In Kusadasi you'll find some of Turkey's finest restaurants, serving both international and local cuisine. With many restaurants offering live music, along with traditional Turkish food and hospitality, visitors are sure to enjoy the authentic experience. Seafood lovers will be in their element as Kusadasi’s coastal location and popular local fish market provides an abundance of fresh fish and calamari on many restaurant and café menus.

Herbs and spices play an important role in the local cuisine, making Turkish pizza and kebabs a popular choice, as well as spiced meat dishes cooked in traditional earthen pots. Lighter salads and mezes offer a more refreshing taste, and sweet treats such as baklava will keep all palates satisfied.

No trip would be complete without the delightful Turkish breakfasts with their mix of fresh vegetables, cheese, eggs, honey and olives, keeping even the most active holiday-maker fuelled for the day.

For some truly local produce, head out to the old village of Sirince for a wide selection of homemade fruit wines and olive oil.

Be captivated by the House of Virgin Mary, Sirince village and the grotto of Seven Sleepers, and not least the Temple of Artemis, one of the seven wonders of the world.
