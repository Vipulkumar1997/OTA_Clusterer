Stylish Sitges holidays 2018 / 2019

Sitges is a beautiful, whitewashed former
fishing village
on the
Costa Dorada
that has developed into a stylish and lively resort without losing its charm. Ideally located just a short train ride from the glamorous city of
Barcelona
, Sitges boasts
gorgeous beaches
, narrow lanes full of
bars and restaurants
, and a couple of fascinating
museums
. A huge favourite with the LGBTQ community, Sitges is also famous for its wild
carnival
and
Pride celebrations
. If you want a break from the coastal hubbub, head to the
Garraf Nature Reserve
located just inland: this stretch of rugged coast offers wonderful walking trails and panoramic views.













Top Attractions






Sitges has no less than 17 fabulous
beaches
, which extend in both directions from the town centre. The busiest is the
Platja de la Ribera
, in the centre of town, which has plenty of facilities, including sun loungers, beach bars, and a lifeguard post. Behind it is a long promenade which is lined with bars, restaurants and shops, with more located in the tangle of narrow streets behind it. The town’s most prominent landmark is a very pretty
Baroque church
, which overlooks the sea. Nearby, the
Maricel Museum

and Cau Ferrat Museum
showcase Catalan and Spanish art. The
Port Aiguadolç
is a yacht-filled marina surrounded by restaurants, bars and clubs. The
nightlife
, especially in summer, is legendary, and there is a huge array of clubs and beach bars to choose from.

Wine and Dine






Sitges offers a huge choice of restaurants, most of which offer
Mediterranean and Catalan cuisine
, although you’ll find plenty of options serving Japanese, Indian, Chinese and Italian food too. Classic local dishes include the succulent seafood stew
suquet
, and a huge choice of Mediterranean rice dishes from paella to
arròs negre
(cooked with squid ink) or
arròs a banda
(cooked in fish stock). The local speciality in Sitges is
xató
, a salad or the  For dessert, try
mel i mató
, curd cheese drizzled with honey, or
crema catalana
, which is similar to crème brûlée. There are lots of tapas places, where you can tuck into
truita
(Spanish omelette),
xipirones
(fried baby squid), and
patates braves
(chunks of fried potato with a spicy sauce).

For Families






Sitges may not, at first glance, be an ideal destination for families, given its reputation for intense nightlife. But its
blissful beaches
,
compact size
, and
relaxed, beach town

atmosphere
make it ideal for a family holiday. There are no major sights, but kids will enjoy messing about on the beach, perhaps
renting a pedalo or a kayak
. You can head into the
Garraf massif for picnics
if you want a break from sun, sea and sand, or hop on the train to reach
Barcelona
, the
Roman ruins of
Tarragona
or
the PortAventura World theme park
(one of Europe’s larges) – all are under an hour away.

Action and Adventure






Sitges is a relatively small resort, and most of the action takes place along the beaches. There are scores of water sports available, mainly from the
Port Aiguadolç
marina. You can surf, paddle-surf, or rent a kayak to explore the coastline. The nearby beach of
Garraf
(a few minutes away by train) offers amenities for
wind-surfing
and
kite-surfing
. There’s a
golf course
with sea views, plenty of
spas
and places to indulge in some pampering, and the town also offers
tennis
courts. The Garraf hills located just inland, which are now a protected nature reserve, have several
hiking
and
mountain-biking
trails.

Life's a Beach






The main town beaches are the adjoining
Plata de la Fregata
and
Platja de la Ribera
, and the
Platja de Sant Sebastià
, which are all right in the town centre. The Platja de la Ribera is the best equipped of them all, with pedaloes and kayaks to rent, along with sun loungers and parasols. There is also a beach by the marina at
Port Aiguadolç
which is fractionally less crowded. There is a
cliff-top walk
along the coast that will bring you to a series of small coves, many of which are
nudist beaches
: in summer, a couple of them also boast laid-back beach bars.

Nightlife






Sitges is a famous for its nightlife, and is packed with bars and clubs. The nightlife is at its most intense in July and August, although the build-up to the summer season begins at Easter. In winter, most of the bigger bars and clubs close down. There are scores of bars all along the
seafront
, many with
terraces
which are prime
people-watching locations
, and plenty more in the centre of town. There are so many bars located on the
Carrer Primer de Maig
that it’s become known as ‘Sin Street’. Many of the LGBTQ bars and clubs are found on
Carrer Sant Bonaventura
and surrounding streets. There are several
enormous nightclubs
located on the outskirts of town, linked to the town centre with shuttle buses that run through the night.

For Couples






Sitges is a beautiful seaside town with gorgeous beaches and a charming old quarter. It’s a romantic place for a relaxing holiday with your partner. The main beaches can get crammed in the high season, but you can wander down to
Platja de la Barra
which is slightly less hectic and has, among other facilities, a massage service. In the evenings, you can enjoy an enjoyable stroll along the
seafront promenade
and then have a
romantic dinner
in one of the many charming restaurants. If you like
nightlife
, you’ll be spoilt for choice: from glitzy cocktail bars to rocking nightclubs, Sitges has got party hotspots covered.

th
century
Modernista mansions
. The two main museums in Sitges are located in a pair of seafront mansions: the
Maricel Museum

th
-century, while
Cau Ferrat
contains an enchanting treasure trove of paintings, ceramics, sculpture and random paraphernalia such as ancient keys and doorknockers gathered together by the artist Santiago Rusiñol. The
Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival
is one of the most prestigious events dedicated to fantasy and horror films. The biggest event on the local calendar is
