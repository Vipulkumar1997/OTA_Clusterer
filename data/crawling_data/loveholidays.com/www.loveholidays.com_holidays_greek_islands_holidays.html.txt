Top Attractions






No two Greek Islands are the same. Each island has its own unique charm to offer visitors. You can relax among ancient ruins then head to
Ios
or
Zante
for a non-stop party, head to
Kavos
on
Corfu
for hedonistic nights, and for beautiful Blue Flag beaches and sunshine, you'll love
Crete
.

Picking an island can be tricky. The Greek Islands are known for their party vibes, and if it isn't Ios or
Zante
, then
Mykonos
could tempt you. Other popular islands include
Kefalonia
with lovely beaches, and
Skiathos
, the quiet but glitzy charmer of the Greek Islands.


Read More about Top Attractions





Wine and Dine






Every region in Greece has slight variations on Greek food traditions and recipes. You will certainly find this on holidays to the Greek Islands. Fresh salads are a great way to start, so satisfy your hunger with olives and feta-covered greens. Follow up your salad with a
moussaka
, or try something completely new with
Bourdeto
. The fish recipe is a
Corfu
tradition. Wash it all down with a Greek red or white wine. Ouzo is an aperitif that is a favourite drink throughout Greece. Enjoy a glass of ouzo at a small café as you dine on mezze or appetizers.

Greek tavernas are perfect destinations for lunch. Get in touch with the local atmosphere by dining on local favourites and seafood specials caught that morning. If you are looking for a night out at an upmarket Greek restaurant, find an Estiatorio. Seafood is at the heart of Greek Islands holidays, and it doesn't matter whether you're grabbing a quick bite on
Zante
or a sophisticated meal on
Skiathos
, you're bound to find something to please in the versatile Greek Islands.

For Families






Although the Greek Islands have plenty of water and theme parks, there is so much more that kids will enjoy. Kefalonia, the largest of the Ionian islands, is a
family holidays
dream.
Kos
, the 3rd largest Dodecanese island, has fantastic family-friendly beaches and lots of activities for kids.
Skiathos
in the
Sporades Archipelago
has a long history of tourism and caters perfectly for families. Why not a little bit of mainland Greece as a family day trip? Halkidiki's three peninsulas are reachable from Kavala which is a 2hr drive from the
Kassandra
peninsula in
Halkidiki
and is where the ferry from
Thassos
arrives.

The islands have a great number of historical sites that are not only beautiful to look at but are educational, and most importantly – fun to explore! A trip to
Rhodes
will give kids a view into the past, and once you’ve explored the history that surrounds them, they can investigate the island's beaches. Pack a picnic for the beach or head to one of the beach tavernas for a traditional meal.
Crete's
history museums offer more opportunities to learn about Greece's history. The
Natural History Museum
or
Cretaquarium
in Iraklio are educational experiences all their own.

Action and Adventure






Of course, the beaches of the Greek Islands are the best places to start your loveholidays adventure. However, there is more to the Greek Islands than just sun, sand and surf - although no one’s denying those are great!

Crete is outstanding for hiking. The western half of Crete is known as a walker's paradise. You will find a number of crisscrossing trails to explore.
Santorini
is another great island for hiking. Ascend to the top of Nea Kameni, an active volcano, and feel the raw power of the earth.

If historical adventures are on your bucket list,
Rhodes
is an ideal destination. Rhodes is the Greek island history capital, and home to the Colossus of Rhodes, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. If you're after visiting smaller Greek Islands like Kos or Milos, an ATV tour is a great way to see the entire islands.

Life's a Beach






If you're travelling to the Greek Islands, you're likely doing so for sun, sand and surf! Beaches are central to a holiday to Greece.

If you're looking for upmarket beaches, the island of Santorini is the place to go.
Santorini
has numerous dark sandy shores, lined with palm-thatched parasols and sun loungers.
Kamari Beac
h and
Perissa Beach
are two of the most popular choices, with beach bars and restaurants close by.

If you want something slightly off the beaten track,
Paros
is perfect. Alternatively,
Corfu
is the best Greek Island destination if you're looking for family-friendly shorelines. The warm, shallow waters and soft sands on Agios
Georgio
s and
Agios Ioannis
will please any group.

Zakynthos
(known as
Zante
) offers water sports, scuba diving and boat trips, plus a heaving nightlife. Sandy beaches such as Banana and Agios allow visitors to try water skiing and paragliding, while rocky bays like
Porto Koukla
and Keri
Caves
have their own unique features to offer.

Skiathos was one of the first Greek Islands to cater to tourists, its glitzy beachfronts are paired with protected areas of coves and beaches.
Skiathos
makes a great choice for family holidays to the Greek Islands, or what about
Kefalonia
?

Nightlife






While the Greek Islands may be calm, sunshine-filled havens in the daytime, come nightfall most islands hum with music. Whether you’re drawn to loud and lively nights on
Zante
, or calm and candlelit strolls overlooking the Ionian Sea, there’s plenty of choice in the Greek Islands.

Mykonos
,
Corfu,

Ios
and
Zakynthos
are all great options for a heady nightlife, whereas one of the quieter islands such as
Santorini,

Rhodes
and
Crete
would suit families and couples looking to avoid the noisy clubs and pubs. If you're looking for a Greek Island completely off the Ionian path, the little-known island of
Lefkas
is a beauty. Try
Skiathos
for upmarket peace, or
Kefalonia
for a beautiful stay in the island capital of
Argostoli
.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






Couples looking for a beach break should head to the sandy shores of Zante. The island's northern reaches are unspoilt natural areas perfect for hiking, biking and swimming. Kefalonia has some awesome beachfront hotels that are perfect for a romantic holiday, plus you'll enjoy exploring the picture-perfect beaches. On
Rhodes
, you'll find the charming medieval Rhodes Town to be quite a stunning affair, plus there are numerous romantic spots along Rhodes' many beaches.

Couples that fancy their food can find the best in Greek cuisine on Crete. Fresh meats, local ingredients and spirits will are perfect dining options when you head to Crete with a loved one.
Paxos
, one of the smaller Greek Islands, is ideal for a low-key holiday and its romantic air will charm you. The mountains of Andros are excellent for travellers that love to walk and hike. Another romantic jaunt is the walk around the romantic old town of Skopelos Town, on
Skopelos
. Museums, churches and lush beaches.

The beauty of the Greek islands is unmatched anywhere else in the world. Whether it is a family getaway or a romantic beach break, loveholidays can take you to the Greek islands.

Culture






History lovers will enjoy the ancient churches and monuments of
Mykonos
. Although it is also well-known for it is nightlife, Mykonos provides visitors with an incredible glimpse into the past. The 15th century Church of Panagia Paraportiani is one of the crown jewels of the island.

Corfu also has its fair share of historic monuments, for example, the Old Fortress and Aggelokastro. The imposing medieval castle situated on the top of a tall cliff offers tourists unique views of Corfu.
Crete
