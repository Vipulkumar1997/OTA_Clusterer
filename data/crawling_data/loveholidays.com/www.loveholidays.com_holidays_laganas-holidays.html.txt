If you are looking for a beach holiday in 2018, look no further than Laganas. This vibrant resort paradise is full of young, fun-loving holidaymakers soaking up the Greek sun. Located on the Ionian Sea island of Zakynthos, Laganas is one of the premier destinations for European tourists. Laganas holidays are always packed with plenty of punch and are unforgettable – whether you fancy joining in its all-night dance parties or settling into its laid-back beaches.

If the beaches and great nightlife grow tiresome, guests shouldn't worry too much. The natural beauty that surrounds Laganas is at everyone's fingertips. Zakynthos’ steep cliffs are the perfect hiking locations for adventurous visitors. Meanwhile the island's history oozes from every pore. The island's original architecture was influenced by
Venice
and other former rulers, and can still be seen today.

After exploring the island, guests can relax by the pool, dine on delicious Greek food or spend the evening strolling the sands.

Top Attractions






A trip to Laganas allows visitors a glimpse into the great history of the island. Explore the wonders of Zakynthos Town, and its quaint plazas and cafes. The two are a beautiful spot to enjoy during a day out in the sun. Stroll by the gorgeous Agios Dionysios church, built in 1708, to see the remains of the town's patron saint.

The island's Venetian influence can be seen in its old and new architecture and a visit to the town's Venetian castle offers spectacular views of the old ruins.

Head to the northern end of the island to see the wonder of the Blue Caves. Tourists can explore the Blue Caves, named because of the sky and water's reflection on the walls, in a glass-bottom boat. If exploring Laganas isn't enough, take to the sea for an around the coast boat trip.

Wine and Dine






Visitors will find traditional Greek food on a Laganas holiday. Yet locals love to spice things up and many traditional Greek dishes will be kicked up a notch with some spice thrown in. Many of the meals visitors find in local restaurants are the same recipes that the town's residents have been eating for decades.

Be ready for plenty of olive oil when tucking into the cuisine in Laganas. The liquid is the heart and soul of Greek cooking and cooks all over the island make hearty use of it. Much of the food is organic and the local farms sell directly to the restaurants. Many of the items eaten by visitors were grown around Laganas, which makes some items unavailable at certain times of the year.

Tourists can sink their teeth into feta covered Greek salads to kick off any meal. Follow it up with freshly made Moussaka and red wine. Satisfy sweet cravings with baklava and a coffee for a true Greek dining experience.

For Families






Family holidays in Laganas are perfect for sun worshipping at the beach, with the resort's miles of sandy shores ideal for families of all sizes and shapes. Parents and children can take to the seas for watersports galore. Boating, fishing, surfing and jetski riding are all at visitors' fingertips during holidays in Laganas.

Exploring Zakynthos' rugged landscape is a great way to see the island. Hiking and horse riding in the mountains and hills gives everyone a new perspective on the island. If everyone's feet become too tired, enjoy a jeep safari around the resort to see some of the local ruins.

If the kids get too hot from all of the exploring, cool off in Sarakinado's wet and wild water park. It is the largest of the island's water parks and it will leave everyone with a smile on their faces.

Action and Adventure






Thanks to its rugged interior, Zakynthos provides visitors with the opportunity to hike challenging trails. Not all of the trails will test travellers, but they will provide visitors with tremendous views of the beautiful island. Hiking the Limnionas to Kampi route is one of the most beautiful in all of Europe. The trail will lead visitors along the cliffs with views out to the Ionian Sea.

Animal lovers will love a day out at Askos Stone Park. Located near Volimes, the park is full of animals wandering through a gorgeous green habitat. The park is perfect for families or couples, and visitors can walk through Askos Stone Park at their leisure.

One of the most unique sights to see on a Laganas holiday is the loggerhead turtles. The turtles breed on the beaches of Laganas, and there are plenty of tourist adventures organised to view the turtles. Take a glass-bottom boat ride to see the amazing creatures swimming under the water; or take a cruise to discover the turtles and watch them swim through the sea.

Life's a Beach






Laganas Beach is the largest on the island and considered one of the best spots to soak up the sun on Zakynthos. Nature lovers will find the largest breeding ground in Europe for loggerhead turtles between June and August at Laganas Beach. Unfortunately, the turtles breeding limits the water sports that can be found on offer.

Visitors that want to explore their surroundings can find adventure at Agio Nikolaos Beach. Just 32 kilometres from Zakynthos Town, Agio Nikolaos is one of the most exciting beaches located on the island. Restaurants, bars and a plentiful helping of watersports are all on hand when visiting.

Shipwreck Beach is another of the island's great sandy spots. Surrounded by cliffs, this white pebble beach is secluded, especially after day trippers head back to their hotels in the afternoon. It gives visitors some privacy away from the beach going crowds. Shipwreck Beach is so secluded, guests need a boat taxi to take them ashore.

Nightlife






Laganas holidays are known as a great destination for a continuous party atmosphere. By night, guests will find more than 100 bars to choose from along the ‘Golden Mile’.  The area attracts famous DJs from around the world to its bars and clubs. There, visitors can dance the night away or find a cool spot to chill out as they escape the Greek heat. One of Laganas' most popular night spots is Sugar. With its great music, outdoor seating and fruity cocktails, travellers will be happy to stay all night.

Travellers can head to the seafront for a wide variety of bars and restaurants. These gorgeous coastal eateries allow guests to dine while watching the sunset over the sea. Laganas is well-known as a great night out across the Greek Islands, and once the sun comes up, visitors can retreat to the pools, beaches and sun loungers to soak up some hangover curing sunlight. After some rest and relaxation, there will be plenty of opportunity to enjoy the resort's nightlife all over again.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






A Laganas holiday is perfect for couples. Spend days lounging on the beach soaking up the sun and surf before heading out for a romantic dinner and drinks. Couples looking for non-stop fun will love the variety of bars and restaurants to go to when the sun goes down.

Those that want something a little bit more relaxed will enjoy evening beach strolls and cafes serving fine Greek cuisine. It is difficult not to be consumed by the romantic atmosphere of Zakynthos Town as couples walk its small streets and alleys. Stop off at a cozy café for a coffee or cocktail to watch the world go by.

After living the picturesque town, couples can find a quiet beach spot, like the one at Shipwreck Beach. There, the romance of the island truly comes alive and couples will fall in love all over again.

Culture






The island of Zakynthos is steeped in Greek mythology. From Artemis and Apollo to the War of Troy, the island has a fantastic history that dates back centuries.

The island has had numerous rulers from the Romans to the Venetians to more modern days with Britain taking control. Each has had its influence on the area, and those influences can still be seen today. Unfortunately, an earthquake in 1953 wiped out some of the island's older, more fragile architecture. But what survived has been complimented by newer buildings that resemble the old.

Today, locals continue to celebrate their past, despite Laganas' move into modern times. While it may be a tourist hotspot, generations of Greeks continue to recognise its history. Carnival and St. Dionisios Celebrations are two of the biggest events during the year. Visitors can experience a true Greek Island celebration during this time. Saint Dionisios is Zakynthos' patron saint, and twice a year the islanders pay homage to him.
