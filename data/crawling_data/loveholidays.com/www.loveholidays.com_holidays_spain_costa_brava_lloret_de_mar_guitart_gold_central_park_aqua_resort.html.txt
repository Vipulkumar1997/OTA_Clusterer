The Guitart Gold Central Park Resort & Spa is a 4-star hotel located in Costa Brava, which offers convenience and fun for all the family, with plenty of activities and a great location for beaches.

Larger suites have more amenities including extra TVs, beds, a separate living area and a larger bathroom. Soundproof rooms give you a great night’s sleep, at the same time as being close to the city centre.

Staying on-site at the hotel can be a lot of fun too, with billiards, bowling, tennis, table tennis and a games room to play in, as well as an indoor and an outdoor pool to choose from, there is everything you need right there in the hotel for a fun and relaxing day. Dine in the hotel at the buffet restaurant or the a la carte restaurant, or wander a short distance into the city centre to find even more choices at mealtimes.

Several beaches are within walking distance of the hotel so you can sunbathe and swim to your heart’s content. You can also rent a bike from the hotel reception to explore the local area, or hire a car for exploring further afield.

Kids are well catered for at the hotel, and have their own playground and kids’ club with organised activities. While adults can work out in the fitness centre, relax with a massage in the spa and wellness centre, sauna and solarium, or sun themselves outdoors on the terrace or in the gardens.

Please note:
The Aquapark facilities open at this hotel in June 2018.
