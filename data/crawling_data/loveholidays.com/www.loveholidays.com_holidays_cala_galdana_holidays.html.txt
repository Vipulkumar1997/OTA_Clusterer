Families, couples and friends will all find a warm welcome in Cala Galdana. If you’re looking for a top-quality beach resort for your 2018 holiday, you’ve found it. With soft sand like no other and stunning limestone cliffs topped with a green forest of pine trees, Cala Galdana is a beautiful bay basking in the Menorcan sunshine. Generally warm the year round; temperatures creep up into the high twenties in summer. With plenty of beach-based activities on offer plus bars, restaurants and cafes to refuel in, there’s no reason to leave the beach. Inquisitive explorers won’t be disappointed either. With hiking, biking and an expansive horse-riding trail around the island to explore, a holiday to Cala Galdana offers much more than just a beach escape.

Visit the town of Ferreries to uncover the island’s culture or
Son Bou
to dance the night away in one of the town’s clubs and bars. To explore the whole island, hire a care and go on a winding drive along the coast, stopping along the way to sample some of the island’s delicious food and local cuisine. When you’re done exploring, head back to your hotel to relax by the pool and recharge your batteries before another splendid day in Cala Galdana.










Top Attractions






This resort makes no apologies for its top attraction being its stunning beach. But on a holiday in Cala Galdana you can find much more to do than sunbathing or sandcastle building. Menorca is known the world over for its stunning horses. The remarkable horsemanship and their beautiful animals can be seen in one of the island’s best horse shows - Somni. Watch the trusty steeds get put through their paces in mesmerising displays of dressage, while true equestrian fans can also visit the centre for a peek behind the scenes. With the coast playing a central part to the resort, most attractions are near the beach. Children will love the Tobogan snack bar, which, as well as serving up tasty food, has a small water park and mini-golf course. For a larger water park, just 30 minutes away by car, the Aqua Center
Menorca
offers a huge range of slides, games and fun for all the family.

Wine and Dine






Menorcan dishes tend to be traditional, simple and reflect the changing seasons. As you would expect from somewhere surrounded by the ocean, seafood is an important part of any Menorcan menu. On a Cala Galdana holiday you have a huge range of dining options. With everything from high-end cuisine to quick and easy fast-food options and everything in between, one thing’s for sure, you won’t go hungry in Cala Galdana. For a mid-priced restaurant offering spectacular views of the bay, track down El Mirador. Serving delicious seafood and Mediterranean cuisine, alongside the ever popular steak and chips, this restaurant is a great place for both lunch and dinner. Book a table or arrive early to secure the best seats in the house. Try a few of the Menorcan wines during your stay. Vineyards on the island were wiped out in the 19th century but are now flourishing once more, producing some great tasting wines. If you prefer gin, the maó, or gin xoriguer, is made from a secret recipe using local juniper berries. Used in pomada - gin and lemonade - it’s refreshing, but quite strong!

For Families






Holidays to Cala Galdana are perfect for families who love spending long days on the beach. With plenty of beachside cafes and places for kids to play, there’s no reason to leave your prized spot in the sand until the sun goes down. Active families can take advantage of the excellent water-sport facilities, play a family game of beach volleyball or build some serious sand castles. Away from the beach, join a boat trip to see the rest of the coastline while you relax as someone else takes the helm. If you’re keen to explore at your own pace, speedboats and sailboats are available to hire. Kids will love the waterparks on the island. Cala Galdana has its own small park, with a larger park around 30 minutes’ drive away. Inquisitive visitors of all ages should head to nearby Ferreries and the Binissues museum. Set in a beautiful manor house, there’s a diverse selection of exhibits and children will love the huge display of bugs and insects. Ideal for a cloudy day or a chance to enjoy some cool shade on a hot summer’s day, a visit here is definitely recommended.

Action and Adventure






Most of Cala Galdana’s action takes place on the water. Taking advantage of the soft, sandy beach and turquoise waters you can hit the water in a pedalo or speedboat - depending on your need for speed. Active holidaymakers can hire sea kayaks and paddle their way along the coast, exploring hidden coves and marvelling at the sheer limestone rocks rising up out of the ocean. To discover what’s happening beneath the sparkling waters you can snorkel or find a PADI approved diving school to experience the underwater world of scuba diving. If you haven’t quite found your sea legs and prefer to stay on land, Cala Galadana holidays come complete with plenty of hiking and biking options. Last but not least, in a region famed for its magnificent horses, there’s an opportunity to explore the Cami de Cavalls. Literally translating as ‘Horse Road’, it’s a coastal path winding round the whole island. See the sights from horseback and ride along the beach or explore the forests and countryside with an experienced guide.

Life's a Beach






Don’t let the sheer limestone cliffs trick you into thinking this section of Menorca’s coast is bereft of beaches. Cala Galdana is home to one of the island’s most photogenic beaches. Regularly used to promote the area on flyers and brochures, the beach looks almost
Caribbean
. Soft, white sands, shallow, turquoise waters and a beautiful backdrop of the pine tree covered cliffs make this a beautiful place to spend the day. A long promenade at the back of the beach is home to bars and cafes, where you can take shelter from the hot sun and grab a refreshing drink or bite to eat. Water-sport fans can take to the water for some high-speed fun. If snorkelling is more your style, a short walk to nearby Cala Mitjana rewards you with some top-quality snorkelling and a quieter ambience away from the jet-skis.

Nightlife






This laid-back beach resort likes to maintain its quiet and sophisticated charm in the evenings. Expect a quiet stroll on the beachside promenade, cocktails in the bars or a leisurely evening meal rather than thumping bass and late-night parties. There is also a lot of entertainment on offer in the hotels. Hotel Cala Galdana puts on shows and frequently plays hosts to live bands. If your dancing shoes are keen to quick-step to the nearest late-night bar or club, head to
Cala'n Porter
or nearby Son Bou. For a night out to remember, check out Bou Hai in Son Bou. The towering cocktails come packed with fruit, the head waiter roller skates his way around the bar and the atmosphere heats up after 9pm at this quirky Hawaiian themed bar.

For Couples






Cala Galdana is ideal for couples looking for a romantic getaway. The beautiful horse-shoe shaped bay offers a dramatic backdrop for those all-important holiday snaps. Whether you’re topping up your tans on the beach or lying poolside on adjacent sun loungers, Cala Galdana was made for long, lazy days enjoying each other’s company. With the nearby town of Ferreries just a ten minute drive away, it’s easy to escape the bustling beach and delve into the alleyways of Ferreries to discover the charm of this inland town. Browse the farmers markets for delicious produce and take a picnic to a secluded spot. Back in Cala Galdana, the stunning views over the bay are the perfect setting for a candlelit meal accompanied by a glass of local wine.

Culture






Summer sees the island of Menorca come alive with a host of fiestas and festivals. Immerse yourself in the culture and tradition of the local residents by tracking down the festival and joining in the fun. Remember to bring your fancy dress if your Cala Galdana holiday is booked during Lent. The Carnival Fiestas run through the whole period with street parades and fancy-dress parties bringing colour, fun and laughter to the whole island. If you’ve missed the festival season, discover more about Menorca at one of its many museums. The closest to Cala Galdana is the Binissues museum, in the nearby resort of Ferreries. With an eclectic mix of exhibits, this museum set within a period manor house also puts on live displays showing how a typical family of peasants would have worked the land with their animals and tools. The restaurant at Binissues serves typical Menorcan cuisine and the giant traditional garden games will keep kids of all ages amused.
