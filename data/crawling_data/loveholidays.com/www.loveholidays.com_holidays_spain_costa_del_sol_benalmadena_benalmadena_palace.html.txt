Enjoy stunning views of Benalmadena with a holiday to the Benalmadena Palace Hotel; set in beautiful hills, it’s ideal for those looking for a holiday with plenty of activities in a relaxing and tranquil setting.

Spend your days relaxing by the pool and enjoying the sun terrace that’s equipped with sun loungers and parasols, or try some of the many activities on offer at the hotel. You could try mini golf, volleyball, football or French bowls outside. If you’re looking for a break from the sun, head to the games room or the well-equipped fitness room.

The hotel is ideal for family holidays and couple holidays alike. There’s plenty to keep the kids entertained, with a kids’ club run by the hotel, a playground, a pool and even a mini disco! While the children spend the day with games and treasure hunts, you could visit the spa where you can indulge in massages, beauty treatments or try the whirlpool and sauna.

If you want to explore the local area further, Benalmadena Palace is perfectly located just 150m from the beach and 2.5km from the resort centre, which can be reached by the shuttle bus. Here, you can enjoy a cocktail at the marina as you admire the boats, spend the day shopping and pick up some bargains, wander through the traditional whitewashed streets or sample some delicious dishes at the local restaurants. There are also plenty of bars and clubs where you can dance the night away.

Please note: due to its elevated position, Benalmadena Hotel Palace is not recommended for guests with walking difficulties. Studios have slanting roofs that may limit head space. A refundable breakage deposit of approx. 60 euros is payable on arrival.

Hi Ruth
The hotel has a miniclub for age 4 and over
Miniclub:   From Sunday to Thursday: 10.30 am till 3.00 pm . Friday and Saturday: till 7.00 pm
(From Easter till end of Summer, X-Mas time, bankholidays and Halloween till 7.00pm)

Minidisco: From 7.30 pm till 8.30 pm  in the Disco Pub ( in summer from 08.00 till 09.00 pm outside on the terrace)

Miniclub:  From 08.30 pm till 10.30 pm (Summer: 09.00 pm till 11.00 pm )

(Timetables are subject to changes)

Our entertainment team -Laura, Raquel, Patrice, Sisco, Mario, Sara, Patricia and Fátima , all love to be surrounded by kids. And our friend Beny the tiger comes to say hi every day and he just loves the Mini Disco at night.

In the Mini Club we can colour pictures, do handycrafts, get a face paint or play with all the toys we have. There's a small ball pool, a play house, a kitchen, a hopskotch, skittles, hoola hoops, a big connect four, balls, a Nintendo Wii and lots more...
In the outdoor play area we've got a climbing frame, a slide, table tennis, mini golf, basketball hoops and a trampoline and our recent new ball park.

We play lots of fun games and in summer we even play games in the outdoor swimming pool.

The Mini Club is for all kids from 4 to 12 years old. Just get your mum or dad to sign you in (name, room number, where are your parents and a phone number, just in case). Children younger than 4 can come in to play accompanied by one adult.
