Stunning Konakli holidays 2018 / 2019

Set on
Turkey’s
south coast, close to both
Alanya
and
Antalya
, holidays to Konakli are ideal for those wanting a relaxing break in the sun. Surrounded by stunning mountains coated in beautiful pine trees, flora and fauna this is a natural paradise just waiting to be explored. If all that sounds a bit too much there are plenty of opportunities to simply sit on the beach and soak up the warm rays of the sun, taking a dip in the cool, clear waters of the sea when the heat gets too much.

Those wanting to explore the local area will find

just a 20-minute drive away, while the bustling city of

If boat trips are more your thing there are plenty leaving the harbour every day, or you could give the kids a wild day out at the
