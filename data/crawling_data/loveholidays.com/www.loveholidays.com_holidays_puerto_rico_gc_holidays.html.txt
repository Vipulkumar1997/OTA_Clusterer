Picture sun drenched beaches, sparkling blue seas, a beautiful harbour and buzzing nightlife scene and you’re picturing the setting of a holiday in Puerto Rico,
Gran Canaria
’s sunniest seaside town. Carved into striking volcanic rock are modern hotels, international shopping outlets and a whole host of amazing restaurants, bars and clubs waiting to be discovered.

There’s as much to enjoy about a holiday in Puerto Rico by day as there is by night and the lovely harbour front provides an opportunity to go for a wander in the sun past local craft shops, restaurants serving up the freshest local seafood and outdoor sun terraces inviting you to relax with a cold drink. There’s beaches too, places to swim and watersports outlets aplenty. So in 2018 or 2019 head on down to the southwestern tip of the sunshine island of Gran Canaria for a Puerto Rico holiday you’ll never forget.

Top Attractions






There’s a huge array of fun things to do on a holiday in Puerto Rico, be it on the sea or on dry land. Go searching for dolphins aboard a catamaran, tuck into a seafood platter in the marina of Puerto Escala or catch a film under the stars at the Moonlight Cinema, Europe’s only permanent open-air cinema. If you love a pampering then you’ll love indulging in a spot of thassalotherapy, an age-old way to relax amidst salt-water pools, spas and massages. Go for a wander around the sun drenched harbour and explore its range of shops and bars, or even go mountain biking on one of the surrounding area’s off-road trails. The choice on a Puerto Rico holiday is entirely up to you.

Wine and Dine






Feast on cuisine both from the local area and across the world on your holiday in Puerto Rico. There’s something to cater to even the fussiest of palettes in this haven of food and drink. At Amadores beach you’ll find waterfront food outlets and bars, with the Amadores Beach Club coming highly recommended for an ambient setting. The harbour throws up a few surprises too when it comes to food and drink, with the Taj Palace Puerto Rico serving up some of the island’s finest Indian cuisine. Seafood platters are the order of the day in Puerto Escala and you’re never too far from a chair in the sun in which to relax and enjoy a cold beer or wine.

For Families






Aside from the family-friendly beaches and swimming areas, Puerto Rico packs in a wealth of activities for all ages. There’s mini golf courses, tennis courts and amusement arcades to while away the days. Don’t miss a trip to the Angry Birds Activity Park, a big hit with younger children. Climbing frames, pedal cart and scooter areas, ziplines and mini football fields are crammed into the park’s open spaces, with a shaded bar and food area for parents to relax in. Lago Taurito waterpark should keep older kids happy for hours as they play on corkscrews and kamikazes, whilst the Wild West-themed amusement park at Sioux City is a short drive outside Puerto Rico.

Action and Adventure






Holidays in Puerto Rico needn’t be all about relaxation. There’s several mountain bike hire companies offering guided tours across inland trails, with routes to suit all abilities from beginner to off-road pro. Take surfing lessons at nearby Bahia Feliz, go fishing for tuna, barracuda and swordfish or even launch yourself off the back of a boat strapped to a giant parachute and fly around the harbour.

Life's a Beach






Puerto Rico is renowned for being Gran Canaria’s sunniest spot, owing to its southwestern location that means it enjoys many hours of light. Two beaches in particular are worth mentioning, starting with the Blue Flag-rated Amadores beach. At just under 1km in length it makes for a perfect place to relax and play. It’s a popular place for water sports, the likes of parasailing and sea kayaks being on offer. Puerto Rico beach is closer to the town centre and all of the restaurants and bars that come with it, not to mention 2 public swimming pools and beautiful shaded gardens.

Nightlife






Puerto Rico comes to life when the sun goes down, with most of the town’s nightlife revolving around the Puerto Rico shopping centre. Here revelers will find dozens of bars and clubs in which to party until late. For something a little more relaxed yet no less fun, the Europa Centre is where you’ll be able to partake in a spot of karaoke, enjoy live entertainment and sip on delicious cocktails.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






Amadores beach roughly translates as ‘lovers’ beach’, giving you an idea of the beauty and charm of this horseshoe-shaped stretch of sand. It’s backed by picturesque bars and restaurants that make for ideal places for a romantic afternoon or evening. Owing to Puerto Rico’s southwestern facing nature, the town enjoys jaw-dropping sunsets and what better way to start a romantic evening than with a twilight cocktail by the harbour?

Culture






Experience the ancient
Canary Island
culture on your holiday in Puerto Rico, a melting pot of African, Spanish and Caribbean influences. The sleepy fishing village of Arguineguin is not as touristy as Puerto Rico and offers a glimpse into local life. Visit on a Tuesday when a local market is held that sells local delicacies, arts and crafts. For an all-in-one hit of island culture, take a short trip to the capital of Las Palmas for the Carnaval, an event that takes place between February and March and sees parades, music, dancing and crazy costumes take over the streets to celebrate the heritage and traditions of Gran Canaria.
