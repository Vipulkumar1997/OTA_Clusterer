Top Attractions






Of all the things to do in Turkey, the country is famous for its beautiful
Turkish Riviera
, friendly people, and delicious sweets. From exploring shipwrecks off the coasts to enjoying a traditional hammam spa day, there’s nothing quite like Turkey holidays.

Explore the bazaars of
Ankara
and
Istanbul
or visit the local fishing markets of the quaint villages along the coast, Turkey is best enjoyed by those who admire other cultures, long for some sunshine, and indulge in great food. Top resorts and areas for 2018 / 2019 include
Bodrum
, the ever-popular Turkish resort,
Belek
for its Mediterranean coast and Roman ruins and of course, the iconic
Marmaris
.

The Dalaman area, the Bodrum area and the Antalya area are all popular with tourists because they're ideal for families and each boasts their own great beaches and top quality hotels.

Wine and Dine






Turkey is a country on the brink of East and West, and its cuisine greatly reflects its geography. Home of the kebab, one of the top Turkey attractions is
eating!
Start off with some yoghurt-like soup,
cacik
, and delectable
sarma
, or stuffed vine leaves that are perfect on hot days. Try a bit of
kofte
mincemeat meatballs along with some stuffed vegetables, or
dolma
. You can also try a range of mezze platters before your main dishes, just like in Greece,
Cyprus
, or the rest of the Eastern Mediterranean. Have some Turkish delights with your Turkish coffee, or settle for some amazing
baklava
for dessert.

The Dalaman area overflows with restaurants to choose from and you'll both find both Turkish cuisine and international treats. From Marmaris to
Iclemer
, Dalaman has some fantastic seafood restaurants and chilled out beachside bars to check out.

In the Antalya area, you can check out
Belek
, which is all glitz along the Turkish Riviera. Visit Belek if you're looking for that special meal along the coast.
Bodrum
is also home to a range of restaurants serving local Turkish cuisine and international affair.

For Families






There is an abundant amount of family-friendly Turkey attractions. For a real family adventure, take the kids on a magical hot air balloon ride over the
Cappadocia
region of Turkey. For another kind of ride, take a cruise on a gulet around the coast of Antalya or on other boat excursions. Grab the kids for a day of exploring ruined cities like
Xanthos
and beautiful canyons brimming with picture-perfect vantage points while learning about the many cultures of ancient Turkey. Of course, nothing beats an old-fashioned day at the beach, and from Izmir to
Olu Deniz
and Lara Beach, the country is full of beaches.

Perfect for families are the Dalaman area, the Antalya area, the Turquoise coast, and the
Bodrum
area. With a number of popular child-friendly hotels, safe beaches and promenades and of course, plenty of activities for the whole family, these coastal resort areas are a good choice.
Altinkum
on the western coast is just a short drive out of Bodrum. Its family-friendly beaches make for a good spot to set up holiday-shop. Another family favourite is
Icmeler
near Marmaris.Not only is this Turquoise coast resort fantastic for children with a lovely beach and close proximity to the Atlantis waterpark, parents will adore the old-style village charm and many boutique shops and cafes.

Action and Adventure






Try out all the aquatic things to do in Turkey along its Mediterranean coastline in Fethiye,
Dalaman
, and Bodrum, to name a few. From jet skiing to parasailing and windsurfing, there are plenty of activities on the water to get your heart pumping. There’s also diving and sailing around the Dodecanese islands of
Greece
in the Aegean and around the coast of Antalya.

If you’re feeling like a mountain goat, Mt. Ararat is the highest mountain in Turkey and quite a feat to accomplish. There’s also the impressive amount of ruins found around the Lycian Way in the Antalya area. Grab a life vest and try some white-water rafting down the Coruh River, one of the best in the world.

Life's a Beach






There are few locations across Europe that will rival Turkey when it comes to beach holidays for 2018 / 2019, and you’ll be spoilt for choice in the country alone given its endless coastline and stunning beach resorts. Turkey's Aegean Coast, and particularly the northern resort of
Izmir
, is renowned for its warm atmosphere and beachfront cafes.

Antalya
is an immensely popular spot, combining the typical allure of the beach with the curious presence of archaeological discoveries. Bask in the sun at beautiful
Lara Beach
, an area also blessed by the presence of the intriguing medieval fortifications of Alanya.
Belek
is one of the top choices for a resort in Antalya thanks to its golden beaches. Belek, with its Mediterranean coast, gives you a taste of Turkey whilst retaining the warm seas and lovely beaches you've come to expect from a European beach holiday.

If the Turkey Antalya area doesn’t quite cut it for your Turkey holidays, then perhaps the
Dalaman
area will? The area mirrors Antalya in its diversity, sending you from bright lights and blue seas to authentic towns and historical sites in just a matter of minutes.

Marmaris
is the perfect destination for night owls, boasting a vibrant nightlife and dining scene which is guaranteed to inject a lively atmosphere into your trip, while those looking for action and adventure by the water would do well in spending their holidays in
Olu Deniz
, famed for its gorgeous Blue Lagoon and a vibrant water sports scene.

Turkey’s
Bodrum
area also ticks all the boxes of a sun, sand and sea-filled escape, combining the allure of gorgeous beaches, exciting water sports and a bustling nightlife to deliver an unprecedented holiday experience by the ocean. Our top pick of the resorts in Bodrum has to be
Gumbet
. Gumbet's famous beaches are golden and sandy, ideal for families.

Nightlife






Nightlife on Turkey holidays is an exciting fusion of eastern and western influence. Whether you’re taking in the bustle of one of the world’s great cities from a terrace restaurant in Istanbul or dancing the night away at the Halikarnas Disco in
Bodrum
, Turkey is a perfect choice if you’re seeking a real buzz during your holiday.

Just a short drive from Bodrum and you'll reach
Gumbet
, which has become known for its buzzing atmosphere.  Marmaris is also a fantastic option for variety seekers – from the open air coastal views and delicious Mediterranean food at The Garden Orange to the Turkish and global beats to be found at the Back Street Bar, this coastal resort is sure to have the thing for you.

If you’re heading slightly further east,
Oludeniz
, the Barracuda Restaurant and Bar serve up fantastic local cuisine before you dance the night away at the nearby Club Revolution. In Turkey, the country described as the ‘gateway to the east’, you’ll sample a truly unique vibe as two cultures meet. For nightlife seekers, the result is a holiday not to be missed.

For Couples






Holidays in Turkey offer it all to couples in search of adventure, culture and romance. Sitting relaxing and enjoying a sunset as you take in views of the Bosphorus from a terrace restaurant in
Istanbul
, through to snorkelling around the remains of a submerged village in Gumusluk in
Bodrum
, holidays in the wonderful country of Turkey will amaze you.

Sample some stunning Byzantine inspiration in the
Hagia Sophia Museum
, or a splendid array of Ottoman treasures housed in
Topkapi Palace
in Istanbul. Follow Turkey’s coast and you’ll quickly swap the raw buzz of Istanbul for the wonderful Aegean resorts of Bodrum,
Turgutreis
and Marmaris in which you’ll find delicious beachside restaurants and cafes, shopping among chatter of the markets, and tastefully themed bars and vibrant nightclubs.

If you’re heading inland, the thermal spas of
Pamukkale
, the Museum of Anatolian Civilisation in Turkey’s capital,
Ankara
, and the historical treasure trove of the Mevlana Muzesi in the beautiful city of
Konya
will delight. Turkish holidays mean plenty of sun, sea and sand, as well as masses of adventure and curiosity for couples seeking to divert off of the beaten track.


Read More about For Couples





Culture






There are plenty of cultural and religious festivals year-round here, and they’re one of the best Turkey attractions. If you want to escape the dreary UK in December, the annual
Mevlana Festival
s lasts a fortnight and includes a variety of dancing.

Time your visit to Turkey to coincide with
Mesir Senlikleri Festival
in the spring, a celebration dating to over 450 years ago, or another fun spring fair, the International Istanbul Tulip Festival. There are also plenty of film festivals taking place throughout the year, from the Ankara Film Festival in March to the Golden Saffron Documentary Film festival in September. No matter why you come to beautiful Turkey, make sure to catch a festival if you can!

Istanbul is the place to start with the amount of archaeological and cultural things to do in Turkey. Stand in awe of the dome of the beautiful Ayia Sophia in the heart of the city and explore the Ottoman Topkapi Palace. Go back to the time of the Greeks and Romans with a visit to one of the most famous sites in Turkey, Ephesus on the Aegean coast near
Kusadasi
.

Other not to be missed sites are the Roman Hierapolis in Pamukkale and the inland town of Bergama in the Izmir province. If you've seen the film Troy or read Homer in school, you should visit the ruins of Troy, discovered by a German archaeologist in the 19th century.

Turkey’s vast history extends to more than just the ancient Greeks, it is also the site of several older and advanced civilisations from the cuneiform writing Hittites in Hattusa who ruled several millennia ago to the famous sites of Gobekli Tepe in the east and Catalhuyuk located northeast of
Antalya
, both fascinating archaeological sites that are almost 11,000 years old.
