Top Attractions






Famed for its pristine beaches, volcanic backdrop and colourful markets, this resort has a host of attractions to suit every palate. The unique flavour of Spain is ever present throughout holidays in Costa Teguise, discovered in the character of the authentic villages and towns, along with the taste of imaginative culinary treats.

Ideal for golf enthusiasts, Costa Teguise is home to the only golf course on Lanzarote. The 18 hole Costa Teguise Golf Club is set on the foot of an ancient volcano in between lava, cactus and palm trees, and looks out to the Atlantic Ocean.

The popular Sunday market is a shopaholic’s paradise. If you’re looking for unique souvenirs, you must take a trip to Teguise Market, the largest outdoor market on the
Canary Islands
. Local lacework, hand-crafted leather, locally-made jewellery and homemade African goods fill the stalls, but if you tire of browsing, take a stroll through the town past one of the many cafes to enjoy the views, as well as a delicious local doughnut.

Wine and Dine






The geographical location of Lanzarote means that the food and drink here is characterised by Spanish, African and Latin American influences. These blends of flavours are complimented by the local produce. There's an abundance of Spanish tapas restaurants and bars in Costa Teguise as well as local seafood restaurants.

Make a reservation at La Cantina to enjoy your meal, along with live music on Friday evenings and Sunday lunchtimes in the back courtyard of the Secret Garden.

Serving modern international cuisine, El Navarro is regarded as one of the best restaurants on the island.

Occupying the oldest house in Costa Teguise, next to Playa Bastian Beach is the Villa Toledo. Boasting stunning sea views, the restaurant has a spacious outdoor terrace, small pool and fountain. The menu here is extensive and features typical Canarian dishes.

For Families






Because of its location on the sheltered east side of
Lanzarote
, family holidays in Costa Teguise are perfect. With a wealth of family attractions, beaches and outdoor space, the resort is brilliant for all ages.

If you have the children in tow, then spend the day at Costa Teguise Aquapark. With countless slides like the Kamikaze and Spiral, as well as a swimming lake this water park caters for everyone.

Some of larger beaches in Costa Teguise have children’s activity parks and at Playa Bastian there is also a soft-play area and bowling alley away from the beach.

When it comes to taking the family out for dinner, The Star Bar has a huge bouncy castle for the kids, along with a pool table and a television showing major sports events and music videos for the teenagers. Many of Costa Teguise’s restaurants let kids eat for free during the early evening, so you and the family can enjoy a meal out that won’t break the bank.

Action and Adventure






Surrounded by spectacular volcanic hills, Costa Teguise is the destination for outdoor activities. From hiking to windsurfing, the mix of mountain ranges and ocean means you can get lots of action here.

If you fancy a hike, take a trip to the Timanfaya National Park, formed from volcanic ridges and rock formations. Also worth a visit is Cueva de los Verdes that leads you down two chasms along a lava tube five miles long, formed by the volcano over 5,000 years ago.

For a day trip on the water, join the La Graciosa Catamaran Cruise that will take you off the north coast of Lanzarote. The cruise will take you to a couple of islands, past the cove-dotted coastline, dropping anchor for a chance to swim, snorkel or kayak in the crystal waters.

Life's a Beach






Costa Teguise is blessed with five sandy beaches that lead onto the long promenade that is lined with shops and restaurants.

The most prominent beach here is the magnificent crescent of pale sand of the main beach at Los Cucharas. Because it is a wind trap, Playa Cucharas is popular with windsurfers.

Families will love Playa del Jablillo as it is protected from the island’s breeze on its small horseshoe shaped beach and has shallow, calm waters.

There is more shelter from the large stone zocos at Playa Bastian. Bordered by exotic palms, the beach has excellent facilities including loungers, parasols and bathrooms.

Locals love Playa Ancla as it is located off the beaten track near the centre of Costa Teguise. Despite the lack of facilities here, the beach it is protected by large stone boulders which create the ideal conditions for swimming.

Nightlife






As a resort created for holidaymakers, you will never feel far from home in Costa Teguise as there are a variety of Irish bars in the Pueblo Marinero area.

For a great night out, hit the selection of clubs and bars on the Avenida de Jabillo. Or if you’d rather kick back by the beach, then head to The Beach Bar that looks over the Playa Cuchara. Perfect for daytime drinks and sunsets, there’s many varieties of beer and cocktails on the drinks menu.

For the all-nighter, Jesters Bar is usually the last bar closing in Costa Teguise, offering karaoke every night. With DJs playing the latest hits and pool tables for those who don’t want to dance, you should try their unique flavoured shots.

For Couples

You can escape from the crowds on one of the tranquil beaches or take up a water sport to get your pulse going.

For a memorable night out together, go to the ‘Jazz...Mi Madre!’ show for some live jazz and blues played by fantastic musicians. These late night shows start from midnight and go on until the early hours.

Culture






Although Costa Teguise is a new resort, there’s still plenty of history and culture that you are bound to see on your holiday here. The culture is a mix of European influences that seep into everyday life. You will find traces of the Canary Island’s culture from the white washed buildings, traditional restaurants and various festivals throughout the year.

Over in the south end of Costa Teguise is the Pueblo Marinero which was designed by the architect César Manrique. You will find the famous white buildings, typical of Lanzarote that hark back to Costa Teguise’s fishing village past.
