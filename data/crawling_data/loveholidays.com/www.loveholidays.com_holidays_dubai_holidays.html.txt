Top Attractions






Dubai is most famous for its glittering hotels, malls and beaches, but there's plenty more to this dynamic city you can discover on your 2019 Dubai holiday. Stroll around the
Al Bastakyia
district to get a flavour of the historic city, often overlooked, or take a cruise along the Dubai waterways. You can get out into the desert to stargaze, watch wildlife or take Jeep tours across the wilds. And of course,
Jumeirah Beach
- paradisiacal stretches of blazing white sand lapped by the turquoise sea - is a year-round draw.

The
Burj Khalifa
, the tallest man-made structure in the world, is also home to the world's highest nightclub and restaurant, and you can get amazing views from the observation deck on the 124th floor. The Burj Khalifa is the central part of the
Dubai Mall
, which, as well as its endless shops, bars and restaurants, is also home to a vast aquarium and an ice-skating rink. At the
Mall of the Emirates
, one of the most expansive malls in the world, there is even an indoor ski centre. Located on
Atlantis the Palm
is the awesome waterpark, Aquaventure. Perfect for cooling down after a day exploring.

There are so many world records in Dubai that the Guinness Book of World Records has set up an office there. Another of them belongs to the
Palm Jumeirah
, the world's largest man-made island, which is shaped like an enormous palm tree. Jumeirah also has some of the best beaches in Dubai. Then there's the
Dubai Fountain
(the second-largest in the world), with a 150-metre water jet that dances to music in a fabulous sound and light show.

Seek out the historic heart of Dubai to browse through the souks and markets in
Deira
, or admire the lovely old dhows bobbing in the bay at the
Dhow Wharfage
to get some insight into the Dubai that existed before it was transformed by the oil boom. Dubai is constantly evolving and no year is better to visit than 2018 or 2019. And escape the city by heading into the wilds, where you can learn about the remarkable Bedouin culture or go in search of the wildlife in the
Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve
among scores of other adventurous activities.

Wine and Dine






Eating out is one of Dubai's greatest pleasures: you'll find food from every corner of the globe at prices to suit all budgets. Plus, with our deals on flights and hotels for 2018 / 2019, you'll have more cash to splash on the more important things. There is a vast choice of eating options, ranging from shawarma bought from a street merchant right through to opulent restaurants awash with Michelin stars.

Enjoy the view from the
Burj Khalifa's
sky-high restaurant, check out the local markets

or explore your options in the
Palm Jumeirah
. Note that locals eat late in the United Arab Emirates, mostly because of the heat, beginning dinner around 9 or 10pm, but most restaurants open earlier to cater for the hordes of international visitors.

You can cool off with a mint tea in a typical Arabian tea house, tuck into brunch at one of Dubai's trendy loft-style eateries, and eat your way around the world at dinner, whether you want Japanese sushi, Italian pasta, Arabian treats or Lebanese mezze. After supper, head to one of Dubai's beach clubs in
Palm Jumeirah
or a luxury hotel bar to enjoy spectacular views.

For Families






If you’ve got the kids with you, you’ll find many things to do to keep them occupied. It should be noted that family is an important part of the culture in the
United Arab Emirates
, and you'll receive a warm welcome. Where else can you spend your 2019 on the beach, go snowboarding at lunchtime, explore the desert in the afternoon and spend your evening scaling the world’s tallest tower? With our deals on flights and hotels packages, you can keep this family holiday affordable, too!

From the
Dubai Mal
l,
The Mall of the Emirates
, or the
Burj
, Dubai is an awe-inspiring sight for little eyes. With our cheap deals on Dubai holidays - including flights to
Dubai Airport
and excellent child-friendly hotels - planning a family holiday to Dubai has never been easier.

There are numerous experiences to be had on holidays to Dubai, whether you’ve got adrenaline-seeking teenagers or inquisitive little ones.
Jumeirah Beach
is great for the whole family, with lots of adrenaline-fuelled activities like kite surfing for older kids, while little ones will be happy building sandcastles and jumping waves.

There's a fantastic aquarium and underwater zoo, a plethora of nature parks and theme parks - including the world's biggest theme park, the
IMG Worlds of Adventure
. You could also take the kids on a cruise in the Dubai Creek, or visit one of the fascinating museums - you'll find everything from beautifully restored historic houses dedicated to the city's long history as well as exciting galleries featuring contemporary art and design.

Action and Adventure






Dubai attractions are as exciting as they are varied but you should definitely partake in some water sports while you’re there, with water skiing, windsurfing, banana boats, parasailing and good old fashioned swimming all available. You can find many tour operators in the
Dubai Marina
. Other things to do in Dubai during your adventurous break include scuba diving, a 4X4 desert safari and a hot air balloon trip.

Dubai also prides itself on the fairly rare attraction of a ski slope in a mall, the
Mall of the Emirates
, complete with real snow! Those in search of more sedate sports in the heat can indulge in some golf at any one of the impressive courses in the area.


Read More about Action and Adventure







Life's a Beach






You’ll find myriad glorious sand-swept areas to laze upon in Dubai's year-round sunshine, the biggest attraction of the
United Arab Emirates
sizzling climate. This means whether you want to visit in 2018 or 2019, Dubai is always open. Make your way to the beach at Jumeirah for a much-needed dose of rest and relaxation. The
Jumeirah Beach
, located on the Palm Jumeirah, is ideal for a luxury holiday as many of the hotels have their own private beachfront.

Just south of it is
Kite Beach
, a hot spot for kite surfers and paddleboarders. While many beaches belong to hotels and are private (although you can often enter for a fee), there are numerous public options to visit, including
Mazer Beach Park
, which has Blue Flag status, is a perennial favourite and offers lots of great facilities.

For breathtaking views, head down to the waterfront. This vibrant
Dubai Marina
is the setting for many restaurants, bars and entertainment developments as well as featuring some of the most beautiful yachts and luxury apartments. By day, it serves as the ideal place for some shopping while by night you might find yourself sipping on drinks at one of its luxurious hotels. The best views of the Palm Jumeirah are from one of the viewing decks.

If you’re looking to dial things up a notch, Dubai holidays offer a plethora of high-octane watersports for those with a sense of adventure for your 2018 or 2019 holidays.

Nightlife






There's so much to do in Dubai when the sun goes down, with a huge selection of bars and clubs that cater to every conceivable taste. You could relax by the beach at one of the many beach clubs featuring DJs or live music. Or take in one of the luxury hotels that boast panoramic views of the stunning
Dubai Marina
and
Palm

Jumeirah
(which looks even more amazing from above).

There are US-style sports bars, Irish-style pubs, and outposts of a host of internationally famous clubs, many offering happy hours, theme nights and special entertainment. Remember that the weekend in the United Arab Emirates is considered to be Thursday and Friday, so plan your visit and your nights out accordingly!

Another way to make the most of your Dubai holiday is to plan around festivals that take place across the city. The largest is
Ramadan
, which will take place in 2019 between the 1
5th May and the 14th of June
, when much of the city will be fasting. Nights come alive during Ramadan when everyone breaks fast. Many hotels keep their bars and restaurants open during this time to cater to international tourists.
Eid al-Adha
will take place between the
21st August and the 25th of August 2019
.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






Dubai has much to offer its visitors, whether you decide to approach it as a city break or a luxury holiday for two. Our top pick for a romantic hotel is
Rixos the Palm Dubai
, located in the Palm Jumeirah. Rixos The Palm Dubai is a stunning 5-star property, you'll find its luxury and great location full of allure. With lots of choices on stunning couples hotels in
Palm Jumeirah
, Dubai is perfect for a whirlwind getaway treat for your partner in 2019.

Certainly, as a city break, Dubai ticks all the boxes with its superb range of beautifully appointed hotels, world-famous malls and a dazzling array of eateries to suit every budget and palate. With its superb beaches and range of watersports facilities, Dubai works perfectly for couples looking for a bit of adventure during their holiday in Dubai.

And what could be more romantic in 2018 / 2019 than sipping cocktails with mesmerising Dubai spread out at your feet at one of the glamorous hotels, or lazing under a coconut-palm parasol and gazing out at the sea?

Culture






Dubai's most famous attractions are its glittering skyscrapers, malls and beaches, but there's so much more to this fascinating city. Beyond the glamorous Burj Khalifa, explore the historic
Al Fahidi
neighbourhood, also known as
Bastakiya
, where the narrow lanes and souks have changed little in more than a century. You can also visit the outstanding
Dubai Museum
, set in an 18th-century fort, to discover more about the city's Bedouin heritage, pearl-diving trade and the history of the United Arab Emirates.

The beautifully restored home of
Sheikh Saeed Al-Maktoum
was built in the 1890s and allowed the Sheikh to watch the ships from his balconies. Down by the wharf, traditional dhows bob in the harbour, and some have been restored to take tourists on cruises along the coast.

The city also has a wealth of contemporary art galleries, as well as world-class performing arts venues, which attract the best opera, ballet, and contemporary dance companies from around the globe.
