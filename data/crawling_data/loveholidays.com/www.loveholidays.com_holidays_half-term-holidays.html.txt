Love half term holidays?

The half term breaks are the perfect excuse to get the family together in 2018, jump on some cheap flights, and make the most of some of the best destinations we’ve got to offer. If you enjoyed a 2016 half term break, why not try something different in 2018? From Gatwick - to where? Maybe you've already sampled the Canaries, or the Balearics, and you're keen to discover somewhere new.

Think Cala d’Or in Majorca, imagine

Half Term Activites











Spain






Spain is the original hard-hitter of half term family holidays. From
Costa Brava
in the North to the eternally sunny Costa del Sol in the south, Spain has a lot to offer.

Let’s start with Costa Brava. The region’s most magnificent attraction is the
Lloret de Mar
, a sweeping Blue Flag Beach lined with bars and pubs, and not a few fantastic restaurants. Lloret de Mar is a favourite for a half term holiday.

Moving down the coast of Spain, we reach the
Costa Dorada
, Spain’s “Golden Coast.” The Costa Dorada is home to popular attractions like PortAventura, Tarragona and Barcelona – including the family friendly area of Cambrils. The continuation of Blue Flag beaches makes the Costa Dorada another top destination for your half term holiday.

Further down Spain’s east Mediterranean coast and we reach
Costa Blanca
, home to the iconic Benidorm and the equally attractive Alicante. Here you’ll find the stunning Benidorm beaches of Playa Levante and Playa Poniente. Benidorm has been a favourite for family holidays for decades, this is because Benidorm boasts great family friendly accommodation and activities for adults and kids alike! Another family favourite, down the costa in
Alicante
, is Playa del Albir, in Moraira. Albir is a small, modern resort perfectly suited for a family getaway.

At the bottom of Spain resides the
Costa del Sol
, the Costa of eternal sun. Most popular for a half term getaway in the Costa del Sol is Benalmadena, a name you probably recognise. Home to the famed Tivoli Theme Park and the classic Blue Flag beach, Playa Santa Ana, Benalmadena is a great spot for a half term holiday. Next door to Benalmadena is the equally popular Torremolinos, where you’ll find yet more beaches, such as the Playa El Bajondillo.

Canary Islands






The Canary Islands throw their weight around in this battle of the half term holidays. A firm favourite for decades, the Canaries boast the obviously beautiful islands of
Lanzarote
, Tenerife, Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria.

Lanzarote boasts some of the best beaches in the Canaries, with big names like Costa Teguise, Puerto del Carmen and Playa Blanca. These beaches are family friendly. Costa Teguise is probably the best for small children, as it’s not as busy as Puerto del Carmen and has much more sand-frolicking potential than Playa Blanca.
Lanzarote
is also home to a verdant and stunning interior landscape, wherein Timanfaya National Park is waiting to reveal its splendours.

Tenerife is another big favourite. Big players in the beach scene, like Costa Adeje, Playa las Americas and Los Cristianos are busy, busy, busy, and you’ll soon see why. Just like Lanzarote, they’re beautiful and family friendly, making a choice between the two islands quite a tricky one!
Tenerife
even has its own national park, Mount Teide National Park.

If the choice wasn’t hard enough,
Fuerteventura
enters the ring. With the iconic Corralejo and Caleta de Fuste leading the fray, Fuerteventura has its own plethora of stunning beaches on offer. We can’t miss Costa Caleta for families, and the protected Jandia peninsula has shops, sports and golden sands galore. If you like water sports, Fuerteventura is for you. Sotavento plays host to the Wind Surfing World Championships.

Gran Canaria
could arguably called the sleepy sister of Lanzarote, Tenerife and Fuerteventura, but don’t be fooled. The beach resort areas of Playa del Ingles and Maspalomas create just as big smiles as their Canaries compatriots. If you do want something quieter, we recommend Puerto Mogan or Puerto Rico, where there’s more space and peace.

Whether you choose Lanzarote, Tenerife, Fuerteventura or Gran Canaria, rest assured there's something to please the whole family, from the oldest adult to the youngest child!

Balearic Islands






The Balearic Islands are varied and cater to all.

Majorca
is the keenest contender for top spot in terms of the best half term holiday destinations in the Balearics. With bold resort competitors on Majorca like Alcudia and Cala d’Or, is it really that surprising?

Booking a hotel in
Alcudia
means you’ll have access to two worlds on Majorca. Firstly, Alcudia has perfect Blue Flag beaches. The sands run along Playa de Muro into the resort of C’an Picafort. Secondly, Alcudia’s old town can please those looking for culture whilst on holiday to Majorca, there’s quaint cobbled streets and everything you might expect of a town lined with 14th century walls.

Rather than Alcudia, what about Cala d'Or? Cala d’Or is known for its main beach, Cala Gran. Cala Gran is your quintessential Mediterranean beach: white sands, blue sea, blue(r) sky.  Along the coast of
Cala d’Or
you’ll find plenty of restaurants, bars and taverns, all situated around coves lined with fringes of pine trees.

If it's a party atmosphere you're looking for you shouldn't forget Magaluf.
Magaluf
has become synonynmous with party holidays for British tourists to Majorca over the last decade. If we're talking about party destinations for your half term holidays, don't forget Ibiza. Ibiza is home of international music and partying in the Balearics.

Half Term Activites






Picking holidays with loveholidays.com means you’re going to have a lot of choice. Want to please the adults and the kids? The Canaries are a great choice: Lanzarote and
Tenerife
are teeming with activities!

But if you're keen for somewhere different, and we’ve seen the Balearics, the Canaries and Spain's Benidorm, where else is there?

To miss the Algarve off this list would be criminal.
Albufeira
is the crown jewel of Portugal’s Algarve, beautiful enough and buzzing enough to rival to Spain’s Costa del Sol.  Flights to Portugal are just as cheap, and the deals just as fantastic, as to any of the other destinations. Albufeira has everything you need for an exquisite half term holiday. Zoomarine Algarve, the incredible Falesia Beach (Olho de Agua) and enough family friendly hotels you’ll be spinning from the choice.

Turkey remains a popular half term destination because of its hot temperatures and exotic climes. Both Dalaman and Antalya are popular destinations for a half term getaway. Antalya is the so called Turkish gateway to the Meditteranean, or the “Turquoise Coast.” With numerous hotels and dozens of glamorous restaurants, bars, clubs and golden beaches, Antalya is a strong choice for your next half-term holiday. Dalaman is another firm favourite in a south western corner of
Turkey
, known for its verdant countryside and all inclusive hotels.

We shouldn't forget about the Greek islands. First, we pick...Corfu!
Corfu
has everything we've come to expect of a Greek holiday: great food, hospitality and nightlife. From Sidari to Roda, to the manic Kavos (Zante is similarly manic), Corfu has a little something for every type of holidaymaker on your half term holiday. Don't forget other treats from Greece, like the island of Skiathos, Agia Georgios in Crete, and Paphos or Limassol in Cyprus.

A recent burgeoning half term destination is the enthralling
Marrakech
. With a cheap flight over the Mediterranean it'll really be like you're travelling several hundred miles across the globe. Marrakech is exotic and alluring, if you fancy something different, why not investigate?
