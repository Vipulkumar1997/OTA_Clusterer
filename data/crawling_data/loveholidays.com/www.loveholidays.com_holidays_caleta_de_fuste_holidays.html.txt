Life's a Beach






Caleta de Fuste’s striking beach may just be paradise; the stunning lagoon shape of the resort hosts crystal clear waters and sun-bleached sand, an ideal sun trap for those looking to top up their tans. However, it also remains the ideal beach for little ones due to the wide, shallow shoreline and unspoilt, silky sand.

Take a leisurely wander along the shoreline after a day in the sun and admire the small harbour, which is the perfect viewpoint of the whole resort. If you’re more at home in the water, the resort’s beaches host a number of activities for adrenaline junkies and more laid back adventurers alike.

Boat trips and fishing excursions are also on offer, but it wouldn’t be unreasonable to spend an entire day relaxing on Caleta de Fuste’s exceptional beach if you aren’t too steady on your sea legs!

Families will appreciate the handy, newly developed amenities too.

Culture






The local culture has been largely fostered by Fuerteventrua's long relationship with mainland Spain, though the island does have its own unique quirks.

A 30 minute drive away from Caleta de Fuste is Batancuria, which is home to the Santa Maria cathedral, as well as museums of religious art, archaeology and ethnography. Batancuria is an ideal starting place for those wishing to explore local cultural landmarks and history.

The main meal of the day is usually eaten between 1pm and 4pm, during what is known as siesta time. A smaller meal is eaten late in the evening (usually after 9pm), which is not uncommonly accompanied by an alcoholic drink of some sort. Events tend to start quite late especially on weekend nights. This means that most people you'll encounter in discos or bars before 1am are likely to be fellow European holidaymakers.

The population is largely catholic, which means all catholic holidays are observed and are regarded as a public holiday.
