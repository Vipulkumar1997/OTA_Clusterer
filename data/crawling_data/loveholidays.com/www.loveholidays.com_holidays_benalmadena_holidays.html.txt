Top Attractions






Most visitors flock to Benalmadena for its fantastic range of beaches, its lively nightlife and its tasty and diverse cuisine. There are so many prominent Benalmadena attractions, particularly for those visitors on a family holiday. While you’ll never run out of things to do in Benalmadena, the resort is conveniently situated in the heart of the Costa del Sol region, providing great access to many more highlights of southern Spain including the historic town of
Malaga
, the vibrant resort town of
Torremolinos
and the beautiful Mijas mountain range.

When you want to head inland away from the beach, La Paloma Park is a landscaped garden with beautiful plants and waterfalls as well as small animals and exotic birds and is a perfect place for a walk and a picnic.

For a day trip, head to Arroyo de la Miel, a charming village and where you can get a cable carto the top of the mountain next to Benalmadena and experience fantastic views over North Africa. Or for some history, visit Benalmadena Pueblo where you can see the old heart of Benalmaena with whitewashed traditional Spanish buildings. From here, you can also explore Mijas Pueblo and the Colomares Castle built to commemorate Columbus’ discoveries.

Wine and Dine






The cuisine enjoyed in Benalmadena is rife throughout the whole of the Costa del Sol, so expect some tasty Andalusian treats. Many restaurants specialise in seafood, and you’ll find it difficult to beat the tasty selection at Restaurante Los Remos. The typical tapas affair and fantastic range of Andalusian hams and cheeses will be enjoyed the most at the brilliant Toro Restaurant, specialising in many regional dishes that are adored by locals and tourists alike. There are also a wide range of restaurants serving international fare, with many Italian, Indian and Chinese joints popping up in the resort. If the sun is shining and your temperature is rising, there’s no better antidote than a sweet and refreshing ice cream. You won’t find a shortage of places to satisfy your urge, but make sure you don’t wander past the excellent Gelateria Di Porto Marina, one of the top Benalmadena attractions – for ice cream lovers at least!

For Families






Benalmadena is a textbook family holiday location, with countless activities and destinations on offer to suit the young and the young at heart. One great family outing can be experienced in the form of a dolphin spotting boat trip. Many trips depart from Benalmadena offering people a glimpse of the beloved sea creature in its natural habitat. Although not strictly one of Benalmadena’s attractions, Aqualand in nearby Torremolinos is a fantastic family location. The water park is only a 20-minute drive away, and it is worth it for experiencing the numerous thrill-inducing slides and relaxing pools. A classic staple of the British seaside holiday is the local mini golf course. Luckily for you, the Spanish have embraced this tradition too, and Benalmadena has one of the most exciting and challenging mini golf courses in the Costa del Sol. Playa Mini Golf Espana provides a great place for families to spend an afternoon.

Action and Adventure






Along the port you’ll see a number of boat trip offers being touted, all advertising a variety of activities out on the water. Heading out on a fishing trip is a great experience, allowing you to catch your own evening dinner and explore more of the Costa del Sol coastline. You can take to the water in a number of adventurous ways in this part of the world, with a myriad of water sports opportunities awaiting you in Benalmadena. Along many of the beaches you’ll find banana boat rides, parasailing and water skiing. If you’re not after an adrenaline rush, you can just take part in some activities on the sand, such as a beach volleyball match. One of the most adventurous things to do in Benalmadena is hopping on the cable car to the top of the nearby Calamorro Mountain. From the top you’ll be treated to great views of the town and beaches below, as well as the distant stretches of the Costa del Sol’s coastline and the Mediterranean Sea. If you’ve had a night of partying hard on the town, or if you just want to drain yourself of the tensions everyday life has created, morning yoga classes are a good way to unwind or fight off the hangover; getting in touch with your spiritual side being the best way to combat what ails you. However, if you’ve embarked on your holidays to Benalmadena with the idea of having a splashing time, then Aqualand won’t disappoint. Costa del Sol’s biggest water park is worth sliding on down to and is something the whole family can enjoy, not just the kids. Another must-visit attraction will take you to Malaga; the winding castle walls of Gibralfaro climb a picturesque hill, providing princely views over the pleasant landscape.

Life's a Beach






Holidays in Benalmadena means first and foremost one thing: fun in the sun, sand and sea! With almost 10 kilometres of beach, you'll be spoilt for choice and will find many different places to enjoy Spain's wonderful weather; from quiet coves to activity loaded family beaches. There's even a nudist beach for those who don't like the idea of swimwear...

Carvajal beach is a popular family beach and tends to get quite busy. That being said, it is renowned for its excellent standard of cleanliness. There's plenty going on and many beach bars as well as beach based activities can be found here. This is where you take your family; while mum and dad relax in the sun, the younger kids will be building sandcastles as the older ones enjoy a game of beach volleyball.

If you're looking to rent boats of jet-skis, head over to Torre Bermeja beach. This action packed beach also has a beach football pitch set up, complete with goalposts.

Nightlife






Benalmadena boasts a vibrant and healthy nightlife, catering to visitors of all ages and tastes. For laid-back beverages in a lively atmosphere with live sports on the television, the Harpenny Bridge Irish Pub is the place for you. For a little more action but nothing too untoward, Monkey Business will offer you a little bit more thump to your nightly drinks. For those in search of a night of dancing, heaving drinking and potential debauchery, heading to the infamous 24-hour Square is likely to pay dividends. If you get a little home sick after trading in the winter cold for a slice of sunny Spain, you can always head to Boal’s Ice Bar during your holidays to Benalmadena and chill out, quite literally, in the country’s very first ice bar. As well as the ice bar you’ll have a variety of nightclubs from which to choose from, whether you want an authentic salsa experience in La Cubana or to bust a move on one of Kiu’s three dance floors, you’ll be sure to feel right at home in this party capital. If you’d rather relax in the evenings with a quiet drink to wash down the tapas during your holidays in Benalmadena, then the plethora of Chiringuitos and cosy beach bars provide calm atmospheres in which to indulge, whereas Sunset Beach Club supplies live music on most evenings in case you just want to sit back and enjoy the show.

For Couples






Many of you will find a particular realm of sanctuary in the resort’s expansive collection of beaches. One of the most relaxing things to do in Benalmadena is hop between the town’s 15 or so beaches, picking a quiet spot at each one and soaking up the rays. For those hoping for a little respite from the beach life, there are many other places to relax in the town that don’t take advantage of the sea and sand. Paloma Park is a large and beautiful expanse of green in the centre of town, providing a fantastic location for an afternoon stroll, a picnic or a kip. If your relaxation levels need to go spiritual, there is an attractive Buddhist temple in Benalmadena. You can enter and wander around the complex, absorbing the tranquillity and peace. If you’d like to take things a step further, why not join in a meditation session if you’re feeling mega stressed – it’ll prove a great way to clear your mind.

Culture






Due to its location in Andalusia, Benalmadena is steeped in history and culture; to the extent that even the name 'Andalusia' is derived from its former Arabic name 'Al-Andalus'. This rich history has had a profound effect on the Andalusian sense of cultural identity, which incorporates elements of Islamic architecture and many cultural phenomena often regarded as quintessentially Spanish, such as Flamenco music and bull-fighting.

Main cultural sites include the old Torre Quebrada watchtower, as well as Colomares Castle; a surprisingly modern castle built in the late 20
th
century which also contains the smallest church in the world. Also be sure to visit the delightfully colourful Bil-Bil Castle. The main attraction is undoubtedly the Benalmadena Stupa, which is the largest example of a Buddhist Stupa in the western world.
