Top Attractions






Sunny skies and sparkling blue seas await visitors to Benidorm, a popular Spanish beach resort in the beautiful
Costa Blanca
. The Old Town is well worth a wander, with its "Walking Street" packed with clothing boutiques, outdoor cafes, restaurants, and bars. View the old church and indulge in some people watching in this charming part of town. Most things to do in Benidorm revolve around its beaches, and you'll find over four kilometres of clean sand and warm water to explore.

Two of the most popular Blue Flag beaches include the bustling Levante and tranquil Poniente, which has recently been upgraded with a new Promenade. Both Levante and Poniente are enormous so, even during the busiest season, there'll be a spot to lay down your towel.

Another benefit of staying in Benidorm is the location in regards to other attractions on the Costa Blanca, including the bustling
Alicante
. Cheaper than Lanzarote or Tenerife, and something different than Majorca or the Algarve, the Costa Blanca is a top
cheap holidays
destination.

There's no shortage of things to do in Benidorm for children to enjoy. Walk on the wild side with a trip to
Mundomar
, a marine and wildlife park featuring dolphins, sea lions, playful lemurs, and exotic birds.
Terra Natura
is another wildlife park, split into five areas of adventure including a petting zoo and a poisonous animal area.

One of these areas is a massive water park called
Aqua Natura
with a Greek Islands theme, featuring zigzag water slides and a wave pool.
Aqualandia
is another popular water park in Benidorm that's ideal for whiling away a hot afternoon.

Those feeling bold can brave the thrilling roller coasters at
Terra Mitica
, which boasts over 30 rides to get the heart racing. If your children have a sweet tooth, try taking a day trip to the charming coastal village of
Villajoyosa
. Known for its chocolate industry, you can take a tour of the chocolate museum and walk away with some tasty souvenirs.

Obviously, Benidorm's large beaches Levante and Poniente are perfect for kids because of their shallow seas and fine sand.

Action and Adventure






With clean beaches and a pleasant climate throughout the year, water sports are some of the most popular things to do during Benidorm holidays. Take the Benidorm Island and Underwater Boat Tour off the coast of the Costa Blanca, which takes daily trips around the island with an underwater viewing lounge. Sailing, yachting, and jet skiing are all ways to pass the time, or you can take a ride in a rickety banana boat from Playa Levante. Pay a visit to Karting de Finestrat, a Go-Karting track featuring karts with a top speed of 130kph, or venture into the countryside of the picturesque
Costa Blanca
around Benidorm on a 4x4 Jeep Safari.

Life's a Beach






Many holidaymakers embark on holidays to Benidorm to experience the sought after beach lifestyle, and in Benidorm, Costa Blanca, you’ll find it in abundance. This vibrant area of
Spain
enjoys almost year-round sunshine, supplying you with plenty of sand and sea during your stay, whether you're here for some summer heat or winter sun.

Benidorm boasts two glorious Blue Flag beaches – Playa de Levante and Playa de Poniente, with each offering something different. Levante is where the heart of the action is, with a myriad of water sports and a diverse crowd of holidaymakers enjoying the beach. Poniente is more sedate, offering up a great spot to relax and unwind.

If you’d rather explore these stunningly clear waters on your Benidorm holidays, take a trip to the old fishing town of
Moraira
. Here, you’ll be welcomed with the opportunity to dive beneath the sea and catch a glimpse of the marine life that can be found.

Nightlife






Although the beaches of Levante and Poniente, and their water sports, are popular Benidorm attractions in the daytime, many visitors travel here solely for its legendary nightlife. You'll never run out of options with over 800 bars to choose from, and competition is fierce to lure in visitors. Theme bars, British pubs, and Spanish cafeteria bars abound and you'll find no shortage of sports bars to sit back and enjoy a game of football.

Many of these are concentrated around the
Playa Levante
area as well as the main drag in the Old Town. If you're looking for a lively evening that's suitable for all ages, try visiting the famous
Benidorm Palace
. You can enjoy an evening of cabaret performances with dinner included.

Visiting show bars is also a popular pastime in Benidorm, including Champions and Buddies or The Cavern in the Ricon Loix area. These feature drink specials along with live music, celebrity impersonations, and karaoke.

For Couples






If you can drag yourself away from the beach, you’ll find many more attractions to embrace, both in and around Benidorm. One of the best ways to explore Benidorm’s highlights is by donning your sturdiest pair of shoes for a stroll of its spectacular landscape. Discover the mountain ranges of
Puig Campana
or stroll around the traditional villages of Finestrast and
Albir
. A picturesque area easily accessible by foot, you’d be wise to take your camera to capture a fleeting moment of your Benidorm holidays.

If you’d rather spend your holidays doing something more relaxing, take yourself away to a spot of serenity by the sea. The picturesque resort of
Calpe
is only a 20-minute drive from Benidorm and offers a gloriously sandy beach to relax in on hot afternoons, while the calm water provides a great place to cool down.

Of course, holidays in Benidorm are incomplete without partaking in its exuberant nightlife. Whether you fancy lingering over drinks in a nearby beach bar or meandering your way through this resort’s buzzing nightclubs, you’ll find plenty of places to keep you entertained until sunrise. If you fancy a night out on the town with a different setting, head to nearby
Denia
. One of the best areas for fiestas, you’re sure to find a celebration in this enchanting old town.

Culture






Although every night is a party in Benidorm, the town also hosts a number of events and festivals throughout the year. Fiesta Week in November is celebrated in Benidorm to honour St. James and the Virgin of Suffering, patron saints of Benidorm. During this week, the town comes alive with football competitions, religious processions, fireworks and dancing. Carnival is another festive time in Benidorm, celebrated just before Lent in the month of February.
