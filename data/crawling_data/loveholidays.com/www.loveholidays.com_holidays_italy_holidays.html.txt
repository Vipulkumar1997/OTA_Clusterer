Along the lake’s edge are numerous beautiful little towns that cling to the water, while a bustling outdoor pursuit and water sports scene attracts holidaymakers seeking more than just some rest and relaxation. Another super popular Italian lake is
Lake Garda

Italy also boasts some beautiful islands, none more significant than
Sardinia

Sicily

Sicily is a rugged island, home to ancient ruins, a great trekking scene and the imposing Mount Etna, while Sardinia is a little more sedate, known as a haven for nature lovers who come in search of natural parks, stunning beaches and a vibrant sailing culture. An all inclusive hotel on either Sardinia or Sicily is a top holiday choice.

Rome
. Journey down cobbled streets away from the tourist mass to discover freshly baked pizza by the slice, before indulging in a hefty dose of gelato for dessert.
Tuscany
boasts some of the finest wine regions in the world, and the seaside nibbles along the
Amalfi Coast
, Campania's dramatically situated seafood restaurants and Sorrento's range of restaurants will keep your holidays foody! If you want to try some more seafood, where better to base yourself than on the islands of
Sicily
or Sardinia?

For Couples






Italy’s dazzling history and culture is best captured in one of its many remarkable cities. Choosing which one to visit can sometimes be the most stressful aspect of your Italy holidays, with so many grand and significant destinations dotted around the country, all boasting all inclusive hotels.
Rome
however is one of the world’s great cities, adorning many a holidaymaker’s bucket list - an obvious stop for any Italy break. A centre of power for over 1,000 years, Rome boasts stunning Roman wonders like the Colosseum, the Roman Forum and the Pantheon, combined with Catholic grandeur found in the form of the Vatican and over 900 churches.

Florence
, a Renaissance city of art and architecture. Don’t miss the stunning Duomo, the masterful Uffizi Gallery and the beautiful Ponte Vecchio.

Venice
is another must-see, the ultimate city of romance, with its unique network of canals snaking around sites such as St. Mark’s Square and the Rialto Bridge.

From the romance of Rome nights to the meandering canals of Venice, Italy has long been considered a destination of love. From
Lake Garda
to
Sardinia
, there's scenery and beauty abound. For those seeking Italy attractions with their other half, it is well worth heading to the
Amalfi Coast
. Cobalt blue waters, dramatic coastlines and stunning views are sure to bring out your inner-Casanova, while a drop or two of the local wine offers a great complement to your Italian getaway. Take a boat ride alongside the glittering Italian Riviera, experience a moonlit gondola ride on
Venice
nights or recreate that famous movie kiss from La Dolce Vita at Rome’s Trevi Fountain – you’re sure to fall in love with Italy and each other.

Culture






Italy holidays offer plenty of cultural things to do for all ages, worth leaving the all inclusive for. First off, let’s discuss
Venice
Carnival. For a week in February every year, Venice lights up with colour, fancy dress, music, drinking, and lots and lots of eating! For a moment of peace in all the action, head out along the Venetian Riviera. Opera season in
Verona
is a beautiful time to be alive, or perhaps Rome’s Cinema Festival in autumn will tick the boxes for you.

It would be a crime not to mention Italy’s best-loved sport - football, so if you can catch a game while you’re on holiday, you won’t regret the passion with which the Italians watch sport!

Jam-packed full of cultural offerings, there is a myriad of things to do during your Italy holidays for those seeking history and heritage. Each region boasts its own stories and sights, from Campania, to Tuscany, to the magnificent
Neapolitan Riviera
. Soak in the history of this stunning country one gorgeous destination at a time.

Once an ancient city,
Rome
is now home to a mass of restored ruins, fascinating monuments and churches. Catch a glimpse of the architectural skills of the ancient Roman people with a visit to the Colosseum and Roman Forum or make the journey to nearby Vatican City to browse through famous paintings, sculptures and artwork from centuries ago. From the Leaning Tower of
Pisa
to the unrivalled splendour of Mount Vesuvius, or
Sorrento
’s cliff-side, rambling streets, you’ll find some great Italy attractions worthy of a space on your camera.
