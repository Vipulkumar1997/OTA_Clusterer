Filled with Greek charm and bathed in sun, Tsilivi is a fantastic holiday spot on
Zante
’s north-east coast. This seaside resort has something for everyone - beach bums will love the miles of beaches and night owls will adore the lively bars and nightclubs.

It’s a
family
-friendly town and the locals here are very welcoming, so you will always feel at home. Whatever you want, Tsilivi will deliver. You can laze the day away on the golden sands and bathe in the crystal clear waters, or sing your heart out at a late night karaoke bar.

Keeping it traditional, thankfully the resort has not succumbed to tourism, but keeps its authenticity in the form of tavernas. These family run traditional restaurants serve the local Zakynthian Ladotyri cheese, washed down with a glass of ouzo.

Finding peace and quiet in Tsilivi is very easyand the romantic setting makes it a perfect
couples break
destination. During the evenings, soak up the laid back Grecian atmosphere, taking time out to watch the dramatic sun set over the horizon with a cold drink, or take a late night dip in the warm waters.

Top Attractions






There is lots that you, your family, a group or couple can get from a holiday in Tsilivi. Away from the bars and restaurants, the resort has an array of water sports and paragliding opportunities thanks to its long beaches. The area around Tsilivi is also brilliant for snorkelling and fishing. Bring your own rod and learn from the locals who tend to use a combination of hooks with bread wrapped around it.

If you would rather stay on land, saddle up at the Athina & Dennis Horse Riding Centre. From your horse, you will be able to experience the naturally vibrant setting of the town and surrounding area, taking in ancient sights.

The children will love a day out at one of the many theme parks here like the Reptile House, Luna Fun Park and Zante Water Village. There is also mini golf course, which is popular with youngsters.

Nearby is the buzzing town of
Zante
which is also the capital and port of the island. From here you can go on a glass-bottom boat tour or scuba-diving excursion. History buffs enjoy wandering around the town and taking in the unmissable landmark of imposing Venetian fortress.

Wine and Dine






Tsilivi has a host of family-run traditional Greek tavernas which take advantage of the surrounding olive groves to provide authentic local foods.

The best of the tavernas include Koukos Greek Taverna and Stamnes Taverna which serve the speciality moussaka. The oldest taverna in Tsilivi, The Olive Tree offers a traditional cuisine with lots of classic Greek food.

The Olde Vineyard obviously has a great selection of local wines whilst Benikos has the best deserts like baklava and fresh crepes on its menu.

For Families






Family holidays in Tsilivi are memorable. From water parks, to mini golf and 10-pin bowling, there is something for everyone.

No matter what your age, do not miss a day out at the newly developed Splash Fun Water Park. It has a range of slides and water themed rides, such as the Black Hole, as well as pirate ships and water jungles which the kids will love.

The beach has been awarded the Blue Flag, so you can be assured that Tsilivi Beach is safe for you and the children, as well as the waters being clear and shallow. If you want to be active, there are also lots of exciting water sports on offer.

Action and Adventure






Tsilivi is set amongst a beautiful backdrop of cypress trees, vineyards and olive groves. Its sub-tropical climate encourages a whole variety of beautiful flowers and are worth discovering. Walk along the coastal paths to the north of Tsilivi Beach to see the Venetian vardida, a type of ancient watch tower overlooking the town.

Elsewhere, the north of
Zante
is very mountainous and has several hiking trails that give you a first-hand view of island’s beautiful scenery.

Because of its coastal location, Tsilivi has an abundance of water based activities. In nearby Zante, take a boat cruise to spot Caretta loggerhead turtles who nest on the island. Along the way take a dip in the caves and translucent waters.

You can also take an excursion to Blue Caves and the Keri Caves, which can only be reached by boat. Don’t miss the Navagio the Smugglers Cove, one of the most photographed beaches in the world.

Life's a Beach






A holiday in Tsilivi would not be complete without a trip to the beach. Boasting the Blue Flag award, the clean two kilometre stretch of fine white sand gently shelves into the sea. Tsilivi Beach is well protected from the strong winds of
Zante
and the clear water is superb for kids as it stays shallow quite a way out.

Next to Tsilivi Beach is Bouka Beach with a small cove and a little fishing harbour. The quiet beach is ideal for a relaxing day of sunbathing and its shallow waters are safe enough for children to swim in.

Another nearby beach to visit is, Gaidaros Beach, once the home to donkeys. The sandy beach is uncrowded, with a few sun loungers. You can get some shade from the trees that border the sand.

Belussi Beach is situated between Tsilivi and Alykanas resorts. The small quiet beach is never very busy but has some great amenities including sun loungers and a volleyball net.

Nightlife






When the sun goes down, Tsilivi really does come alive. Aside from the hustle and bustle of nearby
Zante
, this resort has plenty of options for post-beach partying. As well as lots of themed bars and clubs, there are a few British pubs that keep it familiar for holidaymakers.

For a place to spend your whole night, head to Planet Pub which has a pool, snack bar, air hockey, karaoke, outdoor dancefloor and special DJ nights.

Ark Bar lives up to its name, with its wooden interior that gives the bar its maritime feel. The whole family can enjoy a night out here as there are big screens for sports as well as live entertainment.

Children are also welcome at Kaliva Pub, with its fenced play-area and green beer garden.

For Couples






Holidays in Tsilivi are made for couples. Start at the beach and inject some love back into your relationship when you take time out on the long stretch of fine white sand. Looking out to the Ionian Sea, you will get lost in the moment. Soaking in the sun, enjoy a romantic dinner on the waterfront and stay until sundown to witness a stunning sunset with a cocktail.

If you are looking for a little magic, then take a trip to Tsilivi’s sister island
Kefalonia
. The setting of Captain Corelli's Mandolin, you can feel the amorous vibes from island. Explore the untouched area and head up to the view point of Myrtos Bay.

During August, the major religious holiday, the Feast of the Assumption of Mary hits the town with a festival of feasting and dancing.

Zante Town
