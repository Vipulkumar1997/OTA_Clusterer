Whether you sunbathe on the shores of the red sea, gasp in wonder at the pyramids, or delve into the hustle and bustle of the exotic metropolis, Egypt is an idyllic
all inclusive
destination.

Beach lovers are spoilt for choice in Egypt. The resort towns of Dahab and
Sharm El Sheikh
nestle on the shores of the coveted Sinai Peninsula, while Hurghadi, El Gouna, Marsa Alam and Makadi Bay fringe the
Red Sea
, all offering sumptuous surroundings, exhilarating waterparks, and sun-drenched shores to spend lazy days on the golden sands. With all inclusive holidays incorporating food drink and entertainment, nothing can disturb your Egyptian escape.

Should you require a little more buzz, Egypt’s urban hubs
Luxor
and Cairo are an immersive collage of colours, sounds and smells, from the dynamism of the street markets to the modernity of the Mall of Arabia, shoppers of every kind can splash that freed up cash.

For those who spent childhood fascinated by tales of Pharos and Sphinxes, the great Pyramids need no introduction. Although accessible from Cairo, to really immerse yourself in the history and all inclusive stay in Luxor or Giza would suit you best. Bordering the river Nile, the Giza city shares its name and location with the Giza Plateau which is home to the Great Sphinx and Great Pyramid of Giza, as well as neighbouring the ancient Pharaonic capital Memphis. While Luxor, aptly labelled “the world’s greatest open air museum” lies on the very site of the ancient city of Thebes and across the
Nile
from the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens. Reside in all inclusive luxury with unbeatable access to the infamous West Bank Necropolis.

You want to discover the ancient world in 2018? Going all inclusive at Egypt will take you back in time.
