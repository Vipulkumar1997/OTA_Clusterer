How to get there

Getting to Edinburgh Airport is pretty straightforward: the airport is about eight miles west of the city centre, its entrance easily reached from the A8 Glasgow Road, close to the M8 and M9 motorways. The postcode to use for satellite navigation systems is EH12 9DN (if you're coming from Edinburgh, simply join the A8 from the city bypass and head towards Glasgow). If you are being dropped off, the Drop-Off zone is located on the ground floor of the car park and prices start from £1.00 for a 5 minute stay (there is also a free drop-off option in the Long Stay car park).

Buses to Edinburgh and other local destinations conveniently stop outside the main entrance of the terminal building. For example, Airlink 100 runs every 10 minutes and connects the airport with Waverley Bridge near the main rail and bus stations. Then, there is also Service 35 that runs to the city centre and on to Ocean Terminal, with stops including RBS World Headquarters, the Scottish Parliament and the Palace of Holyroodhouse.

Prefer travelling by train? Edinburgh Airport does not have a railway station but is pretty well connected to Edinburgh’s main rail stations. You can take a taxi or a bus, Airlink 100 calls at both Waverley and Haymarket stations, and is a good bet since it runs 24/7. A night bus, N22 also connects the airport with Waverley station. Both railway stations boast plenty of services to cities across the country.

Lastly, if you just need a quick transportation to get you from Edinburgh city centre to Edinburgh Airport, you can opt for the tram services. The journey time is only around 35 minutes and they run approximately every 8-12 minutes.
