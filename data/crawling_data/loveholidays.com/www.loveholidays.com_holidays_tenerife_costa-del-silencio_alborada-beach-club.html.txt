The 3-star Annapurna Hotel Tenerife is situated on Tenerife’s sunny southern coast. There’s a large saltwater pool right outside. Next, to the pool, where there’s a bar, and the patio leads conveniently down to a beach. Pool, bar, beach. The essentials of a Tenerife holiday.

Start your morning at the Annapurna Hotel Tenerife down in the hotel restaurant, which serves breakfast with a side-order of beautiful sea view. After breakfast, grab your towel and watch the waves roll in beneath the natural saltwater pool, which is the largest in Tenerife. Take part in some of the family activities or practice your table tennis in the games room if you need a break from the sun. Dive beneath the waves with the assistance of the divers from the hotel’s Diving School and explore the stunning seabed that surrounds the island, an unforgettable experience available right on your doorstep. In the evening relax in the bar or head to the disco for an evening of dance.

If you want to stay above water there are plenty of boat tours nearby, too! For the hikers among your holiday party, and those seeking a truly breathtaking view, the Montana Amarilla and surrounding national park provides an excellent day out. The Annapurna Hotel Tenerife is located in Costa del Silencio, a peaceful cranny of a bay located away from the main bustle of Tenerife.

How many meters away is it from the beach please? It says beachfront but also a short walk. Also are there fish and coral to see from the beach. Thank you.

The walk to the beach takes about 4 minutes. The beach at the Alborada is small, but nearby Las Galletas has many, many diving and tour operators that'll guide you to see the best coral and fish.

Hope this helps!
