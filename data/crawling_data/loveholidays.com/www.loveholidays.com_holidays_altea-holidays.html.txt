Located on
Spain
’s stunning white coast, or
Costa Blanca
, Altea is one of the most charming towns in
Alicante
. Although Altea is a neighbour of
Benidorm
, the two resorts are worlds apart. The mature portion rests on top of a hill where you can gaze across out of the coastline and admire the spectacular views. Not forgetting the impressive blue and white church with its tiled dome roof, so stunning it is one of the most photographed landmarks of the whole area. Visiting the old town is definitely a must-see when in Altea. The cobbled streets are packed with classy restaurants and an interesting formation of shops offering elegant local crafts, paintings and gifts.



As exciting as the old town of Altea sounds, you can't forget about the newer part of Altea, with its pebbled beaches along the promenade and the marina. Nothing says holiday quite like taking a gentle stroll to the beach and fine dining at one of Altea’s much loved restaurants, accompanied by the serene backdrop of the painted horizon. What more could you want from your 2018 holiday?
