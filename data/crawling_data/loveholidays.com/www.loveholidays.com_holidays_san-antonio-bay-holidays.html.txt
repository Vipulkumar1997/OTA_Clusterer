Top Attractions






For a small town, San Antonio Bay punches above its weight when it comes to things to do and see. From taking the ferry to nearby coves, to tucking into some delicious tapas as the sun goes down, you'll be spoilt for choice when you visit San Antonio Bay in 2018. Despite its reputation as being exclusively a party destination, Ibiza is actually home to some of the most wonderful attractions. The old town in Ibiza, which has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a must-see for anyone visiting this beautiful island. Start in the main square and from there you can explore the maze of streets and alleyways which lead off in all directions. Also located in the old town is the famous Ibiza castle. The castle combines 12
th
-century and Islamic architecture, and sits atop the town's biggest hill which offers visitors panoramic views of the medieval town below. Es Vedra Island lies just off the coast of Ibiza and is a perfect day trip. It's uninhabited and thus remains totally unspoiled.

For Families






While San Antonio Bay might not be the most child-friendly resort, there are plenty of wonderful destinations in Ibiza which cater to youngsters. Beaches which are suited to taking in people to are
Es Cana
, Talamanca and
Cala Llonga
. Many of Ibiza's attractions are also incredibly child-friendly. Some of the best are Ocean Mania, Slingshot and the Surf Lounge. A great thing to do with the kids is to rent a boat for the day. Even if you don't have a licence you’re still able to rent one of the adventure yellow boats. They are known for being easy to navigate and the hire company will even give you a designated map detailing where is great for a day of sailing. Another great activity is the acrobatic adventure park. This outdoor experience, which caters to both young and old, is nestled among a stunning area of pine trees just 100 metres from Cala Pada beach. Zip wires cover three different circuits and are set out a range of different heights making it suitable for a wide range of ages. They also have a selection of trampolines and estimate that the course will take you roughly two and half hours to complete.
