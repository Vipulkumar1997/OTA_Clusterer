5 unmissable things to do in Corfu




You’ve visited the old town, you’ve done the hiking and a fair bit of sightseeing & sunbathing, so what’s next? It’s time you tried the 5 unmissable things to do in
Corfu
. The things that make all the difference and turn your regular beach holiday into a ...

Top Attractions






While younger holidaymakers might rush off to sip freedom in the party-orientated city of Kavos,
Kassiopi
attracts adventure-seekers with a similar buzz. In Kassiopi pebbly beaches jutting out into rocky coves and bays are just as common as tavernas, clubs and music bars. Fancy a taste of local heritage and culture on your Corfu holiday?
Kassiopi Castle
is just the ticket.

Soaking up the sun on one of Corfu’s beaches is just as good as venturing down a trail into the cool of a pine forest, all thanks to Corfu’s northern location. With views of the Albanian coast,
Acharavi
is a top choice for a beach holiday. For a classic Corfu feel and picturesque beaches,
Aghios Nikolaos
ticks the boxes. For a mix of great beaches and an awesome evening atmosphere,
Sidari
is one of our favourite destinations.
Kavos
Beach is popular with the younger crowd, and if you're looking for a party, you'll find it here.

You will find that the weather in Corfu is great for both action-packed holidays and sightseeing alike. Chapels, forts and palaces challenge long stretches of beaches in a battle for your attention, making both culture and nature the two main reasons why a holiday in Corfu is a must.

Wine and Dine






When on holiday in Corfu, eating throughout the day is just as much of an activity as any other. For a starter, satisfy your pangs of hunger with a bowl full of fresh salad and feta or the savoury
tiropita
. Greeks have a way with meat and spices, so feel free to sink your teeth into their succulent
sofrito
and
stifado
for the main course. Top it off with a sweet dessert such as
baklava
for a real all-round Greek experience.

To embrace the true lifestyle of the Greeks however, make your way to one of the local
Kafenions
, grab a friend and share your stories over coffee, Greek-style. As an alternative, grab a glass of
tsitsibira
– the second best thing to ginger beer! While a traditional Greek taverna is still a place to go to for a midday meal, take the chance at an ouzeria where you wash down mezze with... you guessed it, ouzo. If you yearn for some red carpet treatment, try a posh
estiatorio
instead. For a sweet finish, go to a
zacharoplasteion
where coffee, sweets and baked goods - all are sold in one place. How convenient!

Some of the top destinations to enjoy some cuisine at a range of tavernas would have to be the top resorts, such as Acharavi, Sidari and Aghios Nikolaos.

For Families






Holidays to Corfu are a natural pick for both solo travellers and families owing to its reputation as a safe haven. Apart from the all-time favourite past times you find on the beach, there are water parks in Corfu that offer a mixed bag of beautiful surroundings and fun with their sky-high water slides. But what’s a Greek island without ruins? Corfu is home to a number of well-preserved sights as well as overgrown ruins. These are perfect for outdoor activities such as treasure hunts or picnicking in the wild. Depending on where you’re staying, your resort may also provide options such as horse cart rides or flying model aircraft. Keep your eyes peeled for these lesser known attractions not to be missed. We'd like to suggest
Aghios Ioannis
, which is one of the lesser-known destinations but fantastic for families. It has one of the largest waterparks in Europe, Aqualand!

Action and Adventure






You are bound to get your second wind with the first rays of the Corfu sun. Pine tree forests offer many trails for trekking, and the little villages off the beaten track hide many a secret for you to discover on foot. Bikes and motorbikes are alternatives to getting round the island too. Those into sports will hardly get out of shape taking advantage of facilities for tennis, golf and cricket. Talking adventure would not be complete without water sports, so take a ride in a canoe or pedalo as a warm-up, and then feel the adrenaline rush as you have a go on a wakeboard or a pair of water skis. Top resorts for watersports include the bustling
Gouvia
and off the coast of
Acharavi
, one of Corfu's top resorts. Try diving and paragliding if you want to look at your holiday in Corfu from a brand-new perspective!

Life's a Beach






The island has all the makings of a beach lover’s paradise, especially in the summer months.A holiday to Corfu in early June or late September means you can enjoy slightly cooler climes, and the island has plenty of places to satisfy your inner beach bum’s holiday needs. For a holiday that makes the most of the coast, the former fishing village
Roda
proves to be among the most popular with sand-seekers. There are all sorts of ways to keep busy in Roda, many of which include making a splash, of course! Quad bike safaris, cycling, horse riding and fishing, along with boat trips and water sports are up for grabs for an all-round experience. For activities you'll want to check out
Gouvia
(head here for beach-based nightlife, too!) or
Dassia
. Fans of sandy beaches choose the town of
Aghios Gordios
mainly for its coastal views. This is also where active adventurers make the most of the scenery while having a blast on a motorbike or taming the waves from the safety of a hired boat. Other top favourites include
Acharavi
,
Sadari
and
Aghios Nikolaos
, all with that Ionian Sea lapping at their shores.

Nightlife






When it comes to nightlife, Corfu is as mixed as they come – in other words, nightlife in Corfu can be whatever you want it to be. If you’re after a relaxing evening meal,
Corfu Town
is the place to be. Dotted with family-run restaurants and chilled bars, it’s easy to see why holidaymakers love this part of Corfu so much.

On the opposite end of the scale you’ll find
Kavos
and
Gouvia
. If you’re looking for a night out like no other that you may or may not remember, this is the place to be. Packed with buzzing nightclubs and neon-lit bars, it doesn’t take long before holidaymakers are up on the dancefloor. Best of all, drinks are cheap – meaning the nightlife here is rarely a quiet affair!

For Couples






For lovebirds in search of a romantic escape like no other, look no further than a holiday in Corfu. Corfu’s awe-inspiring backdrops, sweeping coastline and cosy ocean-front tavernas mean this is an island that lends itself effortlessly to a blissful couples retreat. If you’re a duo in search of adventure or simply a peaceful break to get away from it all, Corfu’s endless attractions in the form of ruins and ever-popular water sports make it a highly recommended choice for a couple’s getaway.

Acharavi
is one of the most popular resorts on Corfu, and one of the most iconic. Head here if you're looking for the simple Corfu holiday, with beaches, bars and pools.
Aghios Nikolaos
is a little more laid-back, and generally less busy: perfect for a few quiet moments with a loved one. For even more tranquility and peace, head east to
Perama
. Clear seas and white sands, Perama is perfect if you're looking for a loved-up beach holiday to Corfu.

Culture






Culture vultures, get your picnic baskets ready and set out to
Angelókastro
- Corfu's most prized castle that still stands tall today. Yet another reason for Greeks to be proud of their heritage! There are various quintessential towns and villages dotted around Corfu. Heading north into the country towards the northern resort of
Acharavi
you're bound to stumble across some treats.

Seeing Corfu’s crystal waters and green mountains is enough to put you in a dreamy mood, so a leisurely stroll amidst its nature and against a backdrop of deserted ruins is never a bad option. For complete immersion hire a boat or a yacht and set out in search of a secluded beach or cove, many of which are best accessed by sea. We cannot promise you will be the first to set foot there, but these minor spots are unmatched for their peace and quiet.
