We give all our customers the option to spread the cost of their holiday with an initial low deposit

            departure date and full payment must be received 14 weeks before.

            departure date and full payment must be received 14 days before.

to holiday





Terms and Conditions

An initial low deposit is taken today to secure the booking, thereafter a monthly payment plan with set amounts will be paid to make up the rest of the trip cost. Payments must be taken from the card used to secure the trip by the lead passenger. In the event of cancellation, the full deposit must be paid in addition to any cancellation charges imposed by the applicable supplier and our administration charge. If you would like to make changes or add extras to your booking, you will be asked to pay the additional associated charges (i.e. amendment charges) when the amendments are applied.
Once the final payment has been taken we will issue the relevant tickets/vouchers for your trip.
Our Interest Free Monthly Payment Plan is available for online bookings only and is subject to availability, entirely at our discretion.

How Low Deposit works





Holiday Bookings from £49pp




If you book your holiday more than 22 weeks before departure, we offer a low deposit
            option scheme so you can make multiple payments to secure your holiday on all
            destinations. Book now and pay a deposit from only £49 per adult.






Flight + Hotel Bookings from £49pp




If you book your Flight + Hotel package more than 6 weeks before departure, we offer
            a low deposit option scheme so you can make multiple payments to secure your holiday on
            all destinations. Book now and pay a small deposit only on the price of the flight.
            Final balance payment due just 14 days before departure!






Hotel Bookings from £10pp




If you book your hotel more than 8 weeks before the check-in date, we offer a low
            deposit option scheme of just £10pp to secure your room. You are required to pay the balance in multiple payments up to 4 weeks before you go.







First payment,
deposit of £49pp




Second payment,
remaining deposit amount




Last payment,
up until 14 days
before you go





Terms and Conditions

The initial low deposit is due per person and will be highlighted at the time of booking. A deposit top up amount is required after the low deposit is paid. This top-up will bring the full deposit paid equal to the standard deposit per person. The outstanding second deposit will automatically be deducted from the same credit/debit card used to pay the initial deposit and you will be informed of the due date before booking. In the event of cancellation before the due date of the second deposit, you still remain liable for the full deposit, and this must be paid, in addition to any cancellation charges imposed by the applicable supplier and our administration charges. If you would like to make changes or add extras to your booking, you will be asked to pay the additional associated charges (i.e. amendment charges) when the amendments are applied.
Once final payment has been taken we will issue the relevant tickets/vouchers for your trip.
The Low deposit option is available for online bookings only and is subject to availability (entirely at our discretion).
