Just outside Benidorm and with its very own water park, the Albir Garden Aqua Park is a great choice for a fun-filled family holiday in Costa Blanca.

The recently renovated Albir Garden Aqua Park boasts an ideal location in Playa del Albir – it’s a little way from the hustle and bustle of Benidorm, so you can be sure of a truly relaxing break, but still close enough to the beach and local amenities. There’s a bus service from the hotel into the centre of Benidorm, meaning it’s easy to get out and explore the area’s bars, restaurants and shops.

The new on-site waterpark is open from April to October, and we can guarantee the whole family will have a splashing good time racing down the flumes! The waterpark features 16 slides – the tallest of which is a thrilling 10 metres high. Albir Garden also has 2 outdoor pools and a children’s pool, so if a gentle swim and some sunbathing is more your scene, you’ll feel right at home. For head-to-toe relaxation, why not head to the spa to use the sauna, whirlpool, or indulge in a massage?

Decorated in a bright, modern style, the hotel has 426 apartments that can sleep up to 4 guests. All rooms have a private balcony or terrace, kitchenettes and seating areas with satellite TV. The Albir Garden’s buffet restaurant serves a selection of international dishes, while a snack bar offers refreshments throughout the day. Albir Garden Aqua Park offers a range of daytime and evening entertainment – get involved with sports and pool games during the day, and when the sun goes down, enjoy live music, quizzes and professional shows.
