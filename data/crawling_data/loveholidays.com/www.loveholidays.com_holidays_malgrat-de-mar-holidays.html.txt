A holiday spent in Malgrat de Mar is sure to be a holiday to remember. With its stunning beaches and warm temperatures year-round, it really is the perfect location for a family holiday or a romantic couple’s getaway in 2018. This friendly Catalonian resort offers plentiful activities to keep everyone entertained. Depending on your mood, you can simply plonk yourself on the beach all day, with a cocktail in hand, or try out various white-knuckle inducing watersports. Either way, there’s no shortage of restaurants serving fresh seafood to round off the day as the Spanish sun goes down.

The best part is that it’s all just a stone’s throw away from the excitement of
Barcelona
. Hop on a train and within an hour you’ll find yourself strolling around the city’s enchanting winding streets. World-class restaurants and shopping await you, should you wish to indulge in a day trip during your holiday in Malgrat de Mar.

Top Attractions






Malgrat de Mar’s origins can be traced back to 200 BC, with the beautiful architecture in the old town is a visual reminder of the area’s history. Meander through the quaint streets and you’ll be amazed by the facades of the buildings you stumble upon, such as the St Nicolau’s Church, the Town Hall and the Malgrat’s public library. On your stroll through the town you’ll find lots of little hidden away cafes and bars that offer the perfect spot to quench your thirst. Then, in order to really get under this skin of this Spanish town, make time to check out the old fish market. Once all that culture gets too much, head over to Parc Francesc Macia. Kids will love taking the mini train to the entrance, and once inside you can let them loose on the climbing frames and swings. Meanwhile, parents can enjoy a peaceful picnic under the trees, making for a relaxing day out.

Wine and Dine






Any holiday in Malgrat de Mar would be incomplete without sampling some delicious fresh fish. Most restaurants will serve a ‘fish of the day’ alongside a cold glass of crisp white wine; the perfect combination.  Another Spanish delicacy you can find here is arròs negre, a rice dish made with squid or cuttlefish. And, of course, some sort of paella dish is likely to feature on any Spanish holiday. Even though it’s not strictly native to Catalonia, most restaurants will serve it with big juicy prawns and a squeeze of lemon on top.  For those with a sweet tooth, look no further than Crema Catalana. We know it as crème brûlée, but in Malgrat de Mar it just tastes better somehow. Taste the hints of cinnamon and citrus melting in your mouth as soon as you bite in to the delicious custard. Sound tempting? Malgrat de Mar is calling your name this year.

For Families






Kids will love a holiday in Malgrat de Mar. There’s one place in particular that simply must be visited - Marineland. It’s one of the best attractions in the whole region, and for good reason. Here you can watch a dolphin show twice a day, as well as admire sea lions interacting with their handlers. Not only that but afterwards you can explore the on-site marine zoo where penguins and harbour seals reside. Just make sure to arrive in time for the feeding session! After that the whole family can spend the afternoon by the park’s pool area. There are six water slides that will provide hours of fun for kids and adults alike. Slip and slide your way down the exhilarating winding chutes together and you’ll make memories to last forever.

Back on the beach you can continue the water-based fun and send the kids off on a water-skiing lesson, or banana boat adventure around the bay. All you have to do is be on hand with the camera for those all-important holidays snaps!

Action and Adventure






If Marineland left you wanting some more by way of action and adventure, then no fear, Malgrat has more up its sleeve. If you’re in need of a break from the beach due to restless kids or too much sun, then head towards mini golf. Here you can enjoy a game of crazy golf with a drink thrown in for under 5 euros. What better way to keep everyone entertained and introduce a bit of healthy competition!

Talking of competition, there’s a unique activity to try in Malgrat that is guaranteed to get everyone’s brain’s working. It’s called “Houdini Escape,” and requires teams to effectively break out of a room by solving riddles and puzzles. It provides a great alternative to a day on the beach if the weather lets you down.

For those wanting to get a bit more active, there’s a beautiful park nearby which offers walking trails to get the heart pumping again. It doesn't take long to get there from the resort if you travel by car, and you’ll be rewarded with incredible views of the coast as you meander through the trees.

Life's a Beach






The central beach in Malgrat de Mar is so impressive that it has been awarded a Blue Flag, making it a popular destination for families. The water is calm and clear, with only light currents, so don’t hold back - dive in and cool off! There’s even an inflatable island you can swim to and admire the town from. When you head back to shore you’ll find charming bars and restaurants lining the sand where you can grab a refreshing drink. Then, flop back onto the sun lounger and get stuck into that book you’ve been meaning to read for too long.

If water sports are more your thing then it’s best to head over to Malgrat de Mar’s neighbouring resort, Santa Susanna, where windsurfing, parasailing, kayaking and more adrenaline fuelled activities are on offer. From here you can also take various boat trips in order to explore the coastline even more. The beaches of Astillero and Conca are both fantastic options for a change of scenery.

Nightlife






Malgrat de Mar might be a little tame for the true party animal, but that’s not to say that there aren’t plenty of night spots to enjoy. There are several lively bars and clubs along the beach that offer a perfect spot to enjoy a few drinks after a hard day on the beach. But, if you’re keen to party until the break of dawn, then Barcelona’s mega nightclubs certainly won’t disappoint.

In Malgrat you’ll find people enjoying local cocktails on ‘bar street’, where there is a strip of hangouts with a fun vibe.  Expect to find karaoke going on until 1am, and kids staying up much later than their normal bedtime. It’s a family-friendly atmosphere where lots of fun can be had. If you’re travelling with teenagers in tow and watching their parents flaunt their karaoke skills will make them cringe, then they might choose to take a taxi to nearby
Calella
which might be a bit more happening at night. It’s not too far away and a return taxi won’t break the bank.

For Couples






Although there are a lot of family oriented activities on offer in Magrat de Mar, that doesn’t mean it’s impossible to have a truly romantic getaway too. There are a few quieter beaches nearby for a more relaxing and secluded day lying around on the sand. For a truly romantic day out head to the Marimurtra Botanic Garden. It’s a stunning garden perched on rocks overlooking the azure-blue
Mediterranean
Sea. A  German botanist established the area in the early 1900s using all sorts of local and subtropical plants from all over the world; some from as far afield Southern
Africa
. The result is a peaceful garden with incredible views as far as the eye can see. Head up the steep hill and find the impressive temple to conclude the couples afternoon. For a particularly romantic evening, why not take a walk along Malgrat’s beach when the sun goes down, then find a candlelit spot to enjoy some tasty tapas and sangria.

Culture






A holiday in Malgrat de Mar is so much more than just a beach break. There’s plenty of culture to soak up should you wish to take a break from frying under the beating Spanish sun!  A popular activity is a trip up the funicular lift in town. It was only installed in 2010 but it takes you all the way from the bottom up to the tower on the hill.  It’s a 14th century structure that has come to symbolise Malgrat de Mar. It was originally a watchtower designed to protect the town from pirates which used to be a real concern in medieval times. Now it is a popular tourist attraction for those willing to learn about the area’s fascinating history.

In town there’s also an impressive church built in a neoclassical style. It was never fully completed, shown by the flat roof which looks a bit out of place. It’s called La Catedral de la Costa (the cathedral of the coast) because it is so big and imposing, and it’s definitely worth a visit during your holiday in Malgrat de Mar.
