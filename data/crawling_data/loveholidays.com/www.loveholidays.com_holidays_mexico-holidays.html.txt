Top Attractions






There is always something new and exciting to do on a Mexico holiday, with its extensive coastlines, exciting cuisine, artistic and archaeological lures. As one of the most popular tourist destinations on the planet, it is easy to see why you would choose to take a holiday to Mexico.

Full of history, the fantastic cities of
Mexico City
,
Cancun
,
Monterrey
and
Guadalajara
will give you a real flavour of Mexican culture and food. Be prepared to witness the
New Seven Wonders of the World
, the archaeological site of
Chichen Itza
and the
Teotihuacan
, which display evidence of Mexico’s previous inhabitants.

For something more low key, check out the attractive resorts of
Acapulco
, where you can enjoy all the delights of a coastal retreat. For a real escape, discover Mexico’s hidden secret,
Isla Mujeres
. Home to amazing coral reefs with thousands of species of tropical fish, the island’s shallow waters make it a heavenly snorkelling spot.

Wine and Dine






Mexico holidays are not complete without sampling the mouth-watering tastes of this vibrant region. Most dishes are primarily the result of Mayan and Spanish influences, so you will find a delicious combination of flavours at every corner of this fascinating country, from traditional Mexican restaurants to delicious street food. You must try
tacos al pastor
in
Cancun
and Pozole, a tasty national dish made from succulent chicken and pork.

For a unique experience, you can participate in the vivacious Day of the Dead festival in
Mexico City
, take a tequila tasting tour in
Jalisco
, or enjoy a Margarita cocktail on one of the relaxing beaches of the
Riviera Maya
.

Don’t forget, lime and salt go on everything - squeeze the lime over tacos, into your soup and into your beer. Obviously, there are many mouth-watering tequilas in Mexico, so make sure you try some before your holiday is over.

For Families






Family holidays in Mexico all centre on the outdoors, from the beach to adventure parks, as well as the Aztec ruins which are all waiting to be explored.

If you are looking for family-friendly accommodation in Mexico, you need to look no further than the resorts and complexes that offer kids’ clubs, water parks and pools, all ideal for family travel. With many of the hotels located on the beachfront, you and all the family are guaranteed to have fun on the beach and in the cobalt sea.
Playacar
is a top pick because of its sleepy atmosphere but excellent location next to the busy
Playa del Carmen
.

For activities for all ages, Mexico is brilliant. Whether it be a history lesson at the ancient Mayan cities, or a trip to one of the three best adventure parks on the
Yucatan Peninsula
–
Xcaret, Xplor or Xel-Ha
– all include zip-lines, stalactite river rafting, wildlife watching and jungle trails, all easily accessible from
Cancún
.

Action and Adventure






With plenty of natural vistas and stunning landscapes, Mexico is blessed with expansive deserts and lagoons in the north and lush dense jungles in the south, full of exciting wildlife.

Adventure runs through the whole of Mexico, whether you want to witness the contrast between the desert and the sea in

Baja California; the lush Huasteca shared by San Luis Potosi, Veracruz, Hidalgo, Queretaro and Tamaulipas; the river rapids in Veracruz and Morelos or the barren horizons in Chihuahua and Sonora.

If you want to take a hike, go to the forests in Michoacan and Jalisco, or explore the jungles of Chiapas and Campeche. If you would rather climb, choose the rugged horizons in Colima, Puebla and Morelos. Whatever piece of action you choose, you can be sure that your holiday in Mexico will always provide a challenge.

Life's a Beach






A Mexico holiday will offer endless opportunities for exploration and its many beaches are a great place to start. When temperatures never go below 20 C, you can rely on the Mexican weather for sunshine-filled beach days.

Famed for its sun-kissed shoreline and unstoppable energy,
Cancun
is a regular favourite for fun lovers and sun worshippers. Bursting with contemporary hotels and luxurious resorts, this beachside haven is ideal for anyone who wants to have fun on the Caribbean coast. For keen scuba divers and water sports enthusiasts,
Cozumel
has a colourful array of marine life ready to be discovered.

Classy
Playa del Carmen
is the Yucatan Peninsula’s most glamorous city by the beach, with spectacular views of the Caribbean. The gated community of
Playacar
is a popular spot for tourist hotels. The beaches on the
Caribbean Coast
are definitely impressive, blessed with soft white sands and touched by turquoise waters that hide outstanding coral reefs.

Meanwhile, on
Mexico’s Pacific Coast
, the beaches are long and white with turquoise shallows waters shaded by glossy palms. Here there is a backdrop of a bottle-green jungle, with the jagged peaks of the
Sierra Madre mountain range
in the background.

Nightlife






For the ultimate holiday in Mexico, you need to sample some of its energetic nightlife. As a country of music lovers and dancers, there is a wealth of different types of music, of both Mexican and international flavour. Lively and diverse, after-dark Mexico offers something for everyone, from piano bars to all-night dance clubs.

Cancún
is a popular haunt for spring-breakers and party animals, as is Acapulco, both on the beach. Another party area is the capital,
Mexico City,
which offers an assortment of nightlife.

If you want to watch mariachi shows, head for the sophisticated
Guadalajara
, or for a laid-back party, casual restaurants and bars host nights out in
Cabo San Lucas
.

Back in the resorts, you will find even more entertainment, including booze cruises and fireworks shows during the evenings. From
Tulum
to
Playa Del Carmen
Whether you want to dance the night away on a table-top or sip a cocktail at a piano bar, you'll never run out of options in Mexico.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






You and your loved one are bound to fall in love all over again on a holiday in Mexico. There are many adult-only resorts and complexes, allowing you to relax in peace.

Whether you want a candlelit dinner on the beaches of the
Riviera Maya
, or to be serenaded by a mariachi band, you can have an intimate celebration with your partner. Book a catamaran, sunset cruise or even your own pirate ship at some resorts, for a truly romantic evening.

For the thrill-seekers, head to
Cancun
for high-energy activities on land and water. As the number one party destination, Cancun is home to world-famous clubs including Dady O’s, Coco Bongo and the largest club in Latin America, Bulldog and The City.

Honeymooners can choose to relax on the beautiful island of
Cozumel
or escape the crowds in
Akumal
. For absolute seclusion, the
Isla Mujeres
is only a mile away from the Cancun mainland and is the ideal spot for a romantic getaway.

Culture






Delve into Mexico’s historical legacy to get to grips with the local culture. This colourful country has a rich tapestry of monuments and landmarks, with the most prominent being ancient Maya temples and Teotihuacan pyramids, some of which have been named World Heritage Sites by UNESCO and can easily be reached from
Cancun
.

With hints of its Spanish past, the dusty colonial towns and cities provide beautiful plazas and shady pueblos, while the various museums and galleries from the Federal District to Campeche combine innovation from Mexico’s contemporary muses with the colourful influences of its former character. The largest colonial city, Guadalajara, is strewn with colonial plazas and landmarks. The neoclassical Teatro Degollado, a twin golden-spired cathedral, and The Palacio del Gobierno, which houses famous murals by painter José Clemente Orozco, are just a few of its' treasures.

Before your holiday in Mexico is over, be sure to check out Mexican folk art, which includes clay pottery, embroidered cotton garments, colourful baskets and rugs. For more colour, you need to become acquainted with Mexico’s most famous artists, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. You can view their work at the Frida Kahlo Museum and the Museum Dolores Olmedo , both in Mexico City.
