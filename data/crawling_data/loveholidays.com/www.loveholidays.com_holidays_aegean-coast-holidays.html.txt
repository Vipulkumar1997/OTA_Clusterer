Turkish
are famously proud of their delicious food and will be only too happy to bring you their favourites to try. The fish and seafood here are all locally sourced and freshly caught, with fish stews as well as fresh shellfish a must. The Turkish famously love their meat and you can try delicious succulent dishes, such as kebabs mixed with creamy dips and served up with delicious Greek salads, while there are plenty of options for vegetarians as well. If you’re travelling with fussy eaters or just prefer to try international cuisine why not try Italian,
