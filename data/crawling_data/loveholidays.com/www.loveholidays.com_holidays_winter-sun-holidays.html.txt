Local guide: 48 hours in Marrakech





Marrakech
is one of the most alluring cities in
Morocco
. It is known as the Red City for its rosy-hued walls and buildings, which seem to glow at sunset, and is dramatically set against the Atlas Mountains. Only 3 and a half hours by plane from the UK, it feels ...

Top 10 tips for avoiding jet lag




Fabulous holidays in far-flung destinations are everyone’s dream. The only drawback is that the jet lag can be a drag. Crossing time zones means, unfortunately, that your body’s natural sleep rhythm is disrupted, which causes jet lag. The more time zones you cross (regardless of how long the ...

Portugal & The Algarve






Portugal
is a holiday favourite during the summer, but it offers many hidden winter sun treasures for those willing to look for them.
The
Algarve
, with its breathtaking coastline, is more than just a summer escape with moderate temperatures, plenty of sunshine, and some fantastic deals on the most sought-after hotels and resorts. Flights to the Algarve over Christmas, in particular, are extremely cheap.

Alternatively,
Madeira
has an equally appealing midwinter holiday pitch. The archipelago boasts simply outstanding natural beauty,
gorgeous beaches
(which won’t be crowded in the winter) and a mild climate all year round. A glorious combination of historic European charm, particularly in the seaside town of
Funchal,
and that quintessential island atmosphere,
Madeira
is a fantastic
winter sun holiday destination
. With flights from airports across the UK, and a wonderful array of top-class hotels offering cheap winter holiday deals, finish off 2018 and kick-start 2019 with a taste of Portuguese paradise.

The Caribbean and Mexico






There is a reason December and January are highpoints for holidays on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. When Europe is at its coldest and greyest,
Mexico and the
Caribbean
enjoy their driest, sunniest, and most popular holiday period. UK winter is the perfect time to enjoy a
sun holiday
on a Caribbean island. Picture yourself sipping rum cocktails on the beach of the
Dominican Republic
, sunbathing on the sugar white sands of
Barbados
, dancing in the streets of
Cuba
, or embracing the laid-back vibe of
Jamaica
. Now that’s how we’d spend winter! With a fantastic array of
all-inclusive and half board hotels
, there’s a resort to catering towards every winter holiday preference.

If not a Caribbean Island then a winter break in
Mexico
is equally dreamy and we've got deals on flights and hotel packages, too. For relaxation in idyllic surroundings head to the stunning beaches of
Tulum and the Riviera Maya
. But if you’re looking to dance away those winter blues head to vibrant
Cancun
, where sun soaked days on the beach give way to throbbing nights of
clubbing, live music, circus shows and so much more
. With holidays to suit families as well as luxury adult only resorts, whatever your budget and holiday style you’ll find the perfect fit this winter.

Canary Islands






Eternal sunshine is the calling card of these island gems. Located just off the coast of Africa, the
Canaries
enjoy year-round sun as well as boasting striking landscapes, gorgeous coastlines, and a vibrant social scene. These winter sun holiday favourites are a perfect choice for anyone sick to death of grey skies and looking for an island paradise at bargain prices on flights.

Each island has a distinct personality and it’s worth going back to try them all!
Tenerife
,
the biggest of the bunch, really does have something for everyone. Beautiful beaches, the famous
Mount Teide national park
and stunning nature, as well as a
thriving nightlife
, you really couldn’t ask for more. However, Tenerife isn’t your only choice for a fantastic midwinter holiday.

Famed for its lunar landscape,
Lanzarote
also has some fabulous beaches, like the three which make up the
Playa Blanca
resort - perfect for lounging in the sun and building a winter tan. Lanzarote also has an average high of 22 degrees, even in December. Talking of beaches,
Fuerteventura
has an amazing 150 of them, and with that Canaries sunshine keeping the temperature high, it would be rude not to exploit them for a winter break. We haven’t even mentioned
La Palma, La Gomera, or the fabulous
Gran Canaria
, all of which will satisfy that craving for sun without breaking the bank. Gran Canaria, in particular, edges it by a small margin on the temperature front. For a sunny escape to fight off those wintry blues, you cannot beat a winter holiday to the Canaries.

We recommend the Canaries over the
Balearic Islands
for years-end sun, as islands like Menorca and Majorca (although fabulous in the summer) can become wet, windy, and have lower winter temperatures than the Canaries.

Cyprus






Boasting one of the warmest climates in Europe,
Cyprus
makes a fantastic winter holiday choice
. Anyone looking to enjoy some warm sunny skies, glorious landscapes, and fascinating European history, will find their fill of holiday delights without having to take a long flight. Visiting
popular spots like Limmasol,
Larnaca
and Paphos
in the off-season means you escape the crowds but enjoy the full benefit of historic coastal towns. Think stunning, uncrowded beaches, glorious local food, and fantastic rates at some of the top hotels and resorts! Towards the end of the year temperatures remain in the high teens to low twenties on the coast, so you can still enjoy a
sunny beach holiday even in December!
Inland on
Troodos mountain
, you’ll find snow should you feel like breaking up your beach holiday with some skiing. Make the most of
winter 2018 / 2019
and escape to one of Europes’ most unspoilt treasures for a cheap holiday you'll remember for years.
