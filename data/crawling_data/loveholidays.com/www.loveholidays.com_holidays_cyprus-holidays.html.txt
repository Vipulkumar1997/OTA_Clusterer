Top Attractions






Some of the tops in Cyprus include
Paphos
, which is the tourism capital of the island, expect international treatment along its beaches and in the luxury hotels.
Larnaca
(and the surrounding region) is home to the busy 18-30s club resort of
Ayia Napa
, so hit Nissi Beach if you're after hedonistic fun.
Protaras
offers lovely beaches and something a bit more chilled out, great for
family holidays
.

There are also a number of sites of ancient ruins, archaeological significance and bygone architecture, all waiting to be discovered by history loving holidaymakers. One of Cyprus’ most popular attractions is the ancient history embedded within the city of
Paphos
. The city’s
Archaeological Park
is full of numerous intriguing landmarks and relics, revealing a Cyprus of old to holidaymakers. Make sure you visit the
Tombs of the Kings
, the striking Paphos Fort and the magnificent Odeon.

Along with Paphos, the popular coastal regions such as
Protaras
,
Ayia Napa
in the
Larnaca Region
, and
Coral Bay
are the best place to have the best of both worlds during your holiday in Cyprus. If you’re looking to catch some rays and lounge on the sand along
Nissi Beach
in Ayia Napa, or explore the best of the Mediterranean above or below the waves - no matter where you stay, the Cypriot coast will certainly keep you entertained!

Wine and Dine






There are numerous authentic and traditional dishes that ought to be on your plate during your stay in Cyprus. From cheap eats in
Ayia Napa
to gourmet treats in
Paphos
, Cyprus is one of the top destinations for grub. Diverse and flavoursome, Cypriot cuisine is certainly one of the country’s top attractions.

Cypriot mezes are delicious and delightful tapas-like small plates, comprising meat and fish, and perhaps best sampled in the Cyprus’ most favoured regions such as Limassol and
Paralimni
.  Another of Cyprus’ most famous exports is the wonderful halloumi cheese - best enjoyed grilled on top of a fresh salad drizzled with olive oil. Seafood is also a big part of Cypriot cuisine, particularly around the coastal destinations such as
Larnaca
and
Pernera
. Why not indulge in an aromatic bowl of risotto or share a delicious platter with friends? Don’t forget the glass of wine - you are on holiday after all!

For Families






The general atmosphere of Cyprus shouts
family holidays
, and those that come along with the kids will never be left short of things to do in Cyprus. The beach lifestyle synonymous with a Cyprus holiday is perfect for the whole family, whether you fancy splashing around in the warm water, chilling out on the sand or getting active in the form of a variety of water sports, there is something for the whole family to enjoy.

Around
Ayia Napa
and the rest of the
Larnaca Region
there are a number of waterparks that will see the young, and young at heart, slipping and sliding for hours. While a boat trip to the sea caves along the coast is a great way to make plenty of memories of your holiday in Cyprus. If you want something more chilled out, the small village of
Latchi
is ideal.

The hotels and resorts dotted around the coast of Cyprus are fantastic for families with adults and children of all ages, with the main hub being
Paphos
. With many resorts having undergone recent renovation, visitors will now find that many have excellent facilities for the little ones, including shallow pools, playgrounds, kids’ clubs and some even have their very own on-site water park! Whether you head to
Limassol
,
Pernera
or
Protaras
you'll find child-friendly beaches and family-focused resorts perfect for you and your loved ones.

Action and Adventure






On land, or in the water, a holiday to Cyprus means you’re sure to find the right sort of adventure for you. There are an abundance of water sports on offer for those staying around the coast, including diving, snorkelling and boating to name but a few. Make the most of that warm Mediterranean sea and dive in.

For those that would rather stay dry, it’s well worth exploring the tiny villages hidden within central Cyprus. Wander through
Lefkara
and you’ll feel like you’ve stepped back in time with it’s wonky, cobbled alleyways, shuttered windows and quaint shops. Visitors will often find the locals handmaking delicate lace goods in the shade of the alleys which make for fantastic and unique souvenirs to take home.
Paphos
is a great place to start your adventures, not only because of the city's incredible history but also because of the range of safari's and activities that use Paphos as a starting point.

Fancy taking things higher? Then head inland and immerse yourself in the splendour of the
Troodos Mountains
. These parts are a hiker’s dream, with some wonderful trails leading through numerous traditional villages and towns including
Omodhus
and
Platres
. During the winter months you can even ski down the slopes whilst taking in the panoramic views of this beautiful Mediterranean island along the way.

Life's a Beach






If you’re a holidaymaker looking for a sunny spot to read your book and run powder-soft sand between your toes then look no further than Cyprus. Each and every beach on this island is blessed with unrivalled beauty. From buzzing
Ayia Napa
in the Larnaca Region, with its endless nightlife and popular
Nissi Beach,
to laid-back
Latchi
in
Polis
, or the ever-popular Paphos or
Protaras
, there are plenty beaches to choose from. With golden sands gently lapped by the bluest of Mediterranean waves, it’s easy to see why many visitors come to Cyprus for the beaches.

Larnaca
is a great option for those hoping to get active in the water, boasting one of the best wreck dives in Europe with the Zenobia dive attracting many underwater enthusiasts to this part of the island. The
Larnaca Region
is also home to the buzzing resort of Ayia Napa and
Protaras
. Protaras Beach is ideal for families with its shallow waters and easy access to local amenities like shops and restaurants, while Ayia Napa, the premier destination for those seeking revelry in the sunshine, isn't far away.

Polis
is a great example of something quieter than Paphos; located on the west coast of the island this town has a charming bay to enjoy.
Latchi
is also an excellent choice; billed as a relaxing resort and home to welcoming waterfront tavernas, this town offers a unique flavour of slower Cypriot life. Popular
Limassol
boasts a sandy and pebbly beach, but also access to a range of other beaches and the town of Larnaca.

Nightlife






Ayia Napa
, located in the Larnaca region, is considered one of the most vibrant and lively party hubs in the whole of Europe, drawing large crowds in search of long days and nights in the summer sunshine, as well as cheap drinks, top clubs and bustling bars. If you’re after a place to dance and drink, you’ll be at home in Ayia Napa, especially once the sun has set. Beach parties and beach bar-crawls along the popular
Nissi Beach
carry on well into the early hours, while the mass of music, lights and crowds found in
The Square
are sure to keep you going until the sun comes up!

Larnaca
is a bit more chilled out than Ayia Napa, but the popular
Finikoudes Beach
is lined with a palm-fringed promenade and a host of restaurants and bars, and
Paphos
boasts its own array of hangout spots for the more casual party-goer.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






Amid the party vibes and beach bum indulgence, Cyprus is a highly favoured choice for a romantic getaway. With stunning coastal walks offering panoramic views of the sun setting over the coast, and plenty of cosy tavernas and restaurants just right for a meal for two in resorts like
Paphos
, Cyprus is a lovebirds’ paradise. From exploring the wilds to relaxing on a Blue Flag beach in
Larnaca
, there's plenty to choose from on a Cyprus holiday.

A visit to Aphrodite beach in
Kouklia
is a must-do for any couple in search of the ultimate romantic day out in Cyprus. Home to Petra tou Romiou, or
Aphrodite’s Rock
, this is said to be the birthplace of Aphrodite - the Goddess of Love and Beauty. Legend suggests that swimming around this rock will mean you find true love, so if your holiday in Cyprus wasn’t already romantic enough, you know where to go.  To prolong the magic, set up camp in one of the stunning
Aphrodite Hills
hotels for the perfect romantic base.

If you and your loved one are ready to take the next step, Cyprus is a premier destination for overseas weddings. With its beautiful beaches, clifftop chapels and luxurious four and five-star hotels in the east and west centred on the main resort,
Paphos
, Cyprus offers the perfect setting for a big day to remember.

Culture






Cypriot culture is all about taking it easy and making time for you. Whether it’s a lazy afternoon spent chatting over seemingly endless dishes of meze and an ice cold glass of wine, an easy wander through the old towns, or a good few hours to get stuck into a holiday read on the beach - you’ll fit right in on a holiday in Cyprus. From mountain towns like
Platres
, to historic cities like
Paphos
, and even including the mythical birthplace of
Aphrodite
, Cyprus is an island bursting with culture, mystery, and wonder waiting to be explored.
Limassol
prides itself on the centuries-old Limassol Castle,
Larnaca
has the 9th century Church of
St Lazarus
and
Protaras
has its
Hellenistic tombs
.
