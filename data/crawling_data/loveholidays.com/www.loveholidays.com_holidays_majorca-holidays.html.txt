Top Attractions






Alcudia
is the perfect choice for families. Located in the north-east of Majorca, the seaside resort town of Alcudia, Majorca, boasts an impressive
8km beach
along the Bay of Alcudia, where the kids will love playing on the sand. In the evening, there are bars and restaurants to suit every taste. Why not brush up your singing in the karaoke bars or win great prizes by entering a pub quiz? Other popular family resorts on the
Bay of Alcudia
include
Ca'n Picafort
and
Puerto

Pollensa
(Port de Pollenca).

Magaluf and
Palma Nova
located in the south-east region of
Calvia
let you embrace the vibrant clubbing scene, and dance until the early hours on the party strip with world class DJ providing the soundtrack. When you’re not busy dancing, why not take part in various water activities such as jet skiing and banana boat rides. A visit to the
Aqualand Water Park
is also on many holidaymakers’ agendas. Other resorts in Calvia include the upmarket resorts of
Portal Nous
and
Illetas
.

You’ll be spoilt for choice when it comes to cultural things to do in Majorca. For a breath of history and some astounding natural beauty, the
Cuevas del Drach
is a must-see on your Majorca holidays. Situated in
Porto Cristo
, the caves are full of spectacular formations, while its underground lake –
Lake Martel
– is one of the largest in the world.
Palma
is a historic capital, and its beautiful
La Seu Cathedral
is a must-see.

Wine and Dine






Visit the capital,
Palma
, for fantastic cuisine in a variety of restaurants and all types of delectable dishes. In Palma, you can find Michelin star restaurants and traditionally run eateries that offer some of the best food in the Mediterranean. Try Simply Fosh, which offers fantastic contemporary dining in the centre of Palma. From delicious Spanish tapas to pub food, eating is one of the highlights of a trip to Majorca.

Seafood is an important part of life on the Balearics, and the same can be said of life in Majorca. Finding a seaside restaurant at any of the top beachfront resort areas (think Cala Millor, Santa Ponsa and
Alcudia
) is an easy task. For a super relaxed evening in a beautiful location, the serene
Illetas
is not far from the cheap eats Palma and Magaluf but offers a completely different taste (both culinary and otherwise) of Majorca.

For Families






Playa de Muro Beach
in
Alcudia
is great for families seeking safe play, relaxation and a little bit of adventure. This wide stretch of beach also has great facilities and water sports to try.
Playa de Palma
, because of its great location right next to the capital
Palma
, is a great beach resort for a family looking for something easy and laid back. Other excellent family-friendly resorts include
Cala Millor
,
Santa Ponsa
and
Puerto Pollensa
.

When the sun is shining there is nothing like a bucket load of fun at a water park and Majorca is home to no less than three fantastic water parks. With exhilarating rides, cool water pools and the latest attractions for families to enjoy it offers a splash-tastic day out.
The Western Water Park
in Magaluf is a must visit; enjoy a wet and wild adventure that children and adults will love. Or, try out the Exagon Park, an excellent family-friend hotel in Ca'n Picafort!

If you fancy seeing some nature and animals, there is a selection of fantastic zoos to visit that are the top Majorca attractions. Spend the day at the Safari Zoo near
Sa Coma
, which gives visitors the chance to get up close and personal with monkeys, flamingos and meerkats. The
Palma Aquarium
has a great selection of sea life, and the Marineland waterpark has daily dolphin and penguin shows to enjoy.

Action and Adventure






Majorca is now a hot spot for those who love to surf; a new artificial wave machine has been installed near
Magaluf
, giving amateurs and professionals the chance to surf under the sun. If you are looking for a lively beach with a great selection of watersports, then head to
Magaluf Beach
where you will find a hub of aquatic activity. Banana boats, parasailing and scuba diving are just some of the things to do in Majorca. If you are feeling brave, hire a pedalo and head over to nearby Lizard Island.

The
Tramuntana Mountains
are a haven for walkers, hikers and cyclists; this
UNESCO World Heritage
site is a fantastic showcase of Majorca’s amazing landscapes and is made for exploring. Along the north-east coast, in the
Capdepera
region, you'll find epic beaches around
Cala Mesquida
which are ripe for exploring.

Life's a Beach






Majorca is home to 554km of beautiful coastline, making it home to one of the most desirable stretches of beach in the
Mediterranean
. From Playa to Playa, Majorca's beautiful coastline seems neverending.

The
Bay of
Alcudia
is great for those that want to soak up the sun and revel in Majorca’s natural beauty in total peace. This quiet pebble beach is located in the north of the Island, near the picturesque resort of
Pollensa
. On the north-east coast of Majorca, just down from Alcudia, you'll find
Ca'n Picafort
, a timeless favourite for the beach-loving holidaymakers because of its pristine white sandy beaches.

In the south, not far from the capital Palma, is the ever-popular and enormous beach,
El Arenal
. Located at the base of the 6km long Playa de Palma,
El Arenal
is a go-go-go resort without the hedonistic nightlife of its sisters
Palma Nova
and
Magaluf
across the bay.

North of Palma Nova and Magaluf, in Cas Catala and the Calvia region, you'll find the awesome beach at
Illetas
, lined with upmarket hotels. Just up the coast is the sophisticated
Portal Nous
, one of the most desired addresses in Majorca.

On the west coast, the beach at
Santa Ponsa
is a Blue Flag beach ideal for families, white sands and warm blue waters. Sounds great, right? You're also not far from the beaches at
Port d'Andratx
and
Peguera
, both worth a look.

Far on the east coast, between
Cala Bona
and
Cala Millor
, you'll find around 2km of beaches to explore, and plenty of seaside restaurants to check out, too. In the south is the popular
Sa Coma
and S'illot Beach, then further north the chilled out region of
Capdepera
and the resorts of
Cala Ratjada
,
Cala Agulla
and
Cala Mesquida
with views of Menorca.


Read More about Life's a Beach





Nightlife






Majorca is a haven of entertainment in the evening for all ages. From even the sleepier seaside resort of C'an Picafort to the heaving
Magaluf
, Majorca has the perfect balance. In the capital,
Palma
, you'll find a range of restaurants and bars that curved along the beautiful bay, and along the coast in places like
Cala Millor
and
Santa Ponsa
you'll find a laid-back cafe culture perfect for dipping in and out of.

On the other extreme,
Magaluf
is a dream for clubbers and those on group holidays. Spend unforgettable nights under the bright lights, with the world’s best DJ’s and great music.
Mallorca Rocks
is one of Europe’s biggest music festivals and the hotel's annual event will welcome yet more awesome acts in 2018 and 2019. If you're looking for something more upmarket, just up the coast from Magaluf are the resorts of
Illetas
and
Portal Nous
, some of the most sophisticated addresses on the island.

Alcudia
, as one of the larger resort towns on the island, has a good range of bars and restaurants catering to a variety of holidaymakers. If you don't want to stay in the bustle of Alcudia, we recommend
Puerto Pollensa
, a smaller town not far away with its own share of gorgeous Mediterranean coastline. Further down the east coast are the secluded and quiet areas of
Cala Ratjada
,
Cala Agulla
and
Cala Millor
. Here's where you want to visit if you want peace and quiet.

For Couples






From luxurious beachfront hotels to self-catering apartments in its thriving capital,
Palma
, Majorca most certainly has the hotel for you. No matter if you're looking for a place to rest your head after an unforgettable night in
Magaluf
, or you want to relax with plenty of amenities on hand in the likes of
Cabo Blanco
, Majorca has got you covered.

Majorca is divided into almost distinct sections: in the south around
Palma
you'll find upmarket hotels in
Portal Nous
, but then just down the coast heaving party hotels in
Magaluf
. In the north around
Ca'n Picafort
and on the east coast around
Sa Coma
you'll find quiet hotels and romantic beaches.

There's a great range of resorts to choose from, which makes Majorca one of the top destinations for holidays in the Balearics. Whether you're looking for a relaxed holiday in
Cala Millor
, to a buzzing holiday in
Alcudia
, you'll be able to find a hotel that suits both of your needs.

An array of accommodation is available, whether you’re looking for a honeymoon suite to overlook the ocean, or a cosy apartment in a fishing village. Situated close to our fantastic luxury hotels are a number of bars and restaurants to suit your convenience.

Culture






Cycle around
Palma
– Local authorities in Majorca have announced a bicycle scheme for sightseers to enjoy in the capital. Similar to London’s bike scheme, holidaymakers can cycle and enjoy all of Palma’s fantastic sites using the rented bikes! With bike rental stops situated all over the capital, visitors can pick up and drop off the useful bicycles at their convenience. Five-day passes can be purchased for €12.

For history, try the medieval
Alcudia Old Town
. Visit a weekend market, explore the narrow streets and hop from cafe to cafe, soaking up the lovely atmosphere. In
Pollenca
, visit the
Puig de Pollenca
: a short hike up the hill to the medieval chapel and watchtower is a perfect plan for sunset. The large 14th century
Bellver Castle
overlooking Palma now houses a museum showcasing the history of the island. For art lovers, try the Museu d'Art Espanyol Contemporani, or the
Museum of Contemporary Spanish Art
, located in
Palma.
