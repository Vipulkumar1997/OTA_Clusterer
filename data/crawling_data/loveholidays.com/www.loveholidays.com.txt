Frequently Asked Questions

A holiday type for you

At loveholidays.com, our mission is to find the perfect holiday experience for all types of holidaymaker. From simple to book
all-inclusive holidays
, flexible
self-catering escapes
and
half board stays
, through to wallet-friendly
cheap holidays
that don’t compromise on quality or price, we’ve got the holiday type for you.




Summer Escapes

Summer’s the time to make the most of the heat and top up those Vitamin D levels (and tan!) on a
beach holiday
. At loveholidays.com, we recommend destinations like
Spain
,
Portugal
and
Greece
for a sizzling summer holiday. The beaches and activities are sure to keep the kids captivated on any
family holiday
!




Winter Sun

If you think that the seasons shouldn’t get in the way of soaking up some rays, our
winter sun holidays
are ideal. Far-flung destinations like
Mexico
and
Cuba
let you trade in the darker months back home for endless sun and brilliant beaches. Away from the busier summer holidays, a winter sun escape can be a more affordable option for your
couple’s holiday
.









Ref Code Search

On the 'Holiday Summary' page, you are presented with a reference code at the top of
					the 'Your Trip' breakdown box. This isn't the code you receive post-purchase, and you
					may end up having multiple reference codes from multiple searches. The codes differ in
					length and are alphanumeric, consisting of numbers and letters. These are not
					promotional codes.
