Top Attractions






Located in the south of Corfu, this vibrant capital has been luring party people since the 1980s with its sweeping sands and thriving nightlife scene. Renowned for its fast pace and energetic spirit, you’ll find plenty of things to do in Kavos, putting you on the beach by day and in the bars by night. Embrace the nature of this destination by packing your dancing shoes and heading to the clubs, or take a laid-back option by spending your days exploring the beautiful surrounding villages – the choice is yours. Shopaholics won’t feel left out on their holiday in Kavos. Handily, most of the shops in the resort can be found on the main strip – perfect for those last-minute purchases of sunglasses and sun-cream on your way to the beach. Whether you’re looking to peruse the rails of clothes and sports gear ideal for the beach or you’ve got your eye on some locally-made crafts and jewellery to take home as souvenirs from
Greece
, you’ll find something to suit you.

Wine and Dine






If you’re looking for delicious food and drink alongside your dose of winter sun, you’re in the right place. There are some excellent traditional tavernas on hand to sample Greek food, from mouth-watering moussaka to kleftico with lamb. Head down to the pier and you’ll find some great seafood restaurants, while closer to the town centre provides you with quintessentially British food – curries, Sunday roasts and full English breakfasts that make for the perfect hangover cure!

For Families






Kavos is well known as a party place but as it is geared towards tourists containing everything you need; it is also a good destinatino for families. Being a self-contained resort, you can be sure that you won’t have to hassle with travel to get to activities on the beach or restaurants to eat in. You are also well placed to explore the rest of the island of Corfu, go for walks in the countryside or take day trips to nearby towns or villages. The culture of Kavos is very child friendly as well so you will find restaurants and cafés ready to accommodate children and the whole atmosphere relaxing and friendly.

Action and Adventure






With its fast-paced ethos, there are a great many activities in Kavos for those looking to expend some energy. Kavos boasts an 8-kilometre strip of sand that serves as a great place to enjoy water sports. Jet-skiing and water skiing can both be found in and among these waters, while the beach offers plenty of high-octane thrills of its own, including cage catapulting and bungee jumping. Whatever you choose to do on your break, you’d better have a head for heights!

Life's a Beach






The biggest lure of Kavos holidays is of course, the long sandy beach that occupies most of the area. With plenty of sun-loungers scattered around, this 8km strip is an ideal spot to spend the day revelling in the sunshine and taking a cooling dip in the sea. Due to its shallow waters, it is also very family friendly and little ones will love paddling on the shores. Further out of the water is where the action really happens – from banana rides to jet skiing, water-skiing to diving. For adrenaline junkies, there is even bungee jumping and cage catapulting at the waterside – ideal for keen adventurers.

Nightlife






Those looking to dance until dawn are in luck – of all the activities in Kavos, a night out on the town is undoubtedly the most popular. The road that runs parallel to the beach is jam-packed with nightclubs and bars serving up plenty of drinks and the latest in sounds. From house to R ‘n’ B to those cheesy dancefloor hits you thought you’d forgotten, there isn’t a music taste not catered for in Kavos, while the themed nights make everything a bit more fun. Foam party anyone? This main street in the resort is often packed with partygoers and promotes good fun. Whether you’re into chart music, house or electro, foam parties or old school discos, you’ll find plenty of places in this thriving resort to shake your thing to.

For Couples






While you might not think of this Greek party paradise as a destination for romance, there are some great things to do for couples. If the bustling sands of Kavos’ main beach is doing nothing to create a romantic ambience, pay a visit to the nearby secret beach just 2 kilometres away near Asprokavos. Here, you’ll find an idyllic spot adorned with deck chairs – a great place to watch the sun go down or gaze into each other’s eyes.

Culture






This island is big on festivals, with any excuse to party. If you’re lucky enough to be visiting when the Celebration of Saint Prokopios is on, you’ll find plenty of things to do in Kavos. Spend your time at the side-lines watching vibrant parades and listening to the sounds of the Philharmonic orchestra – it makes a change from all that pulsating dance music. If that all sounds too sedate for you, climb aboard the famous boat party that visits the island. Dancing on the deck to the latest summer tunes, topping up your tan and joining a rave in a cave? This is a party you won’t want to miss. For the ultimate grand day out, climb aboard an all-day boat party for the perfect mix of intoxicating cocktails, glimmering waters, top music and endless sunshine.
