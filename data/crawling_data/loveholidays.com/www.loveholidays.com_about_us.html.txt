Who are we?

We are loveholidays. Our passion is travel and inspiring you to travel. As the fastest growing online travel agency in the UK, our mission is to create the ultimate online travel experience, just for you. We value building trusted relationships with our customers, which is why we work hard to maintain a connection with you long past the day you return from your holiday.






How are we different?

We offer a bespoke way of searching for your next holiday, ensuring that all your needs are catered for in one place. Not sure where or when to go? With us, you don’t have to search by date or destination; you can search by what matters to you the most such as budget, board basis, star rating and even temperature. Not completely convinced which hotel is the right one for you? You can search our holidays by TripAdvisor rating until you find the ideal accommodation.






Why book with us?

At loveholidays we have revolutionised the way we offer you holidays. We provide four flexible payment options to choose from, in a bid to make holidays more affordable for everyone. After all, there is no feeling quite like booking your perfect getaway!
