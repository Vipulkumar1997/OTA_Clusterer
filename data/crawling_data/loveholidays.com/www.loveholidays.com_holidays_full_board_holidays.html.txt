The best full board holidays 2018 /2019

With so many accommodation options out there, it's easy to get confused. We often find people asking us what is a full board holiday and how is it different to
all inclusive
? Full Board holidays include breakfast, lunch and dinner with the price of the room. That's all 3 meals taken care of so that you only have to splash out on treats, extra drinks and snacks.

If you’re looking for a hassle-free cheap holiday with breakfast, lunch and dinner included, then full board holidays in 2018 / 2019 are for you. With an astonishingly wide variety of destinations to choose from, cheap flights, and accommodation options to suit singles, couples, or the whole family, you can focus on relaxing and enjoying your break with all the big expenses taken care of.

If you’re looking for somewhere exotic, why not head to
Marrakech
? This beautiful desert city has an enticing historic Medina, an elegant modern quarter full of shops and restaurants, and you can escape into the desert for a truly unforgettable experience. For affordable fun in the sun, the
Algarve
ticks all the boxes: gorgeous coastline, vibrant resorts, and plenty of things to do. Cyprus is another excellent full board holiday choice, particularly the popular harbour town of
Paphos
, which combines beautiful beaches and fascinating history.
Spain
, which has acquired its expertise in caring for visitors over many decades, offers a wide choice of full board hotels options to suit all tastes and budgets, and the
Greek Islands
, each with their own character, provide an idyllic escape.

Check out our favourite full board holidays below, or, if you want everything included, check out our amazing
