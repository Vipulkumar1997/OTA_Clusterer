Charismatic Costa Caleta holidays 2018 / 2019

If you’re looking for a sun, sea and sand holiday in 2018/2019, Costa Caleta has all the gorgeous scenery, great attractions and excellent amenities that will take your Spanish holiday to the next level. Costa Caleta, or the
Caleta de Fustes
as it’s called locally, is located on the eastern coast of the popular
Canary Island
of Fuerteventura. As a purpose-built holiday resort, all the bars, restaurants and shops have been designed with tourists’ convenience in mind. With everything you need for a pleasant holiday located on the main street, you’ll never be short of things to do or eat.

With its setting in a curved bay, Costa Caleta boasts a kilometre of soft golden sands with a few pebbled areas dotted along the coastline. It offers up the ideal balance of sun and a cool sea breeze, with all the sun loungers, parasols and beachside cafes you’ll need to keep you feeling refreshed and ready for your next adventure. Costa Caleta has plenty for families, with a number of playgrounds and parks, amusement arcades and mini-golf courses within easy reach. You’re also just a 20-minute bus or taxi ride from the capital,
Puerto del Rosario
, with all its shops, restaurants and attractions.










Top Attractions






Costa Caleta offers all the convenience you’d expect from a purpose-built holiday resort, with plenty of attractions and activities for all ages and tastes. The main draw of Costa Caleta is its gorgeous golden beach, Caleta de Fuste, which offers a wide range of water sports by the beach. Acua Water Park is one of the most popular theme parks in the Costa Caleta area and wider
Fuerteventura
. As the only water park on the island, you’ll have plenty of plenty of fun at this bustling visitor hotspot situated on the southern
Corralejo
.

Other top attractions in the surrounding area include the Oasis Park at La Lajita Zoo, which has more than 200 species of birds and a botanical garden area, and Lobos Island, which is situated at the northern end of Fuerteventura. Here you can join a glass-bottomed boat tour to take in underwater sights without getting wet.

Wine and Dine






One of the best things about holidaying in Costa Caleta is the delicious, vibrant cuisine. As with much of Fuerteventura, the food and drink in Costa Caleta is centred around fresh produce and simple yet exhilarating flavours that tantalise the palette. The staple food here is fish and seafood, with an almost limitless supply being caught at the local harbours and immediately supplied to nearby restaurants. Fish is often salted here, to produce a dish called pejines, or added to a stew (sancocho). You can enjoy a wide variety of interesting fish species here including grouper fish, sama and corvina, which are traditionally served with papas arrugadas – tiny baked potatoes.

The food here is generally light and often served al-fresco out in the Spanish sunshine. Other delicious dishes here include the flan, which is very similar in texture to crème caramel, and the incredible bienmesabe, a moreish blend of rum, eggs, cream of almond and honey. All in all, Costa Caleta is a foodie’s dream and has a wide selection of both traditional Fuerteventuran and international food options.

For Families






Costa Caleta was designed with families in mind and has all the facilities and amenities you’ll need for a great family holiday close at hand. Costa Caleta’s beach is set in a pleasantly curving bay, providing ample shade to keep your little ones out of the strong Spanish sun. The sands are backed by a few beachside bars and cafes, and there’s water sports equipment available for hire too.

In terms of family-orientated activities, Costa Caleta has several play parks, amusement arcades and mini-golf courses. There’s also a bouncy castle close to the beach. For more variety in your activities, you can take the number 3 bus straight to the capital, Puerto del Rosario, in just 20 minutes. Here you’ll find a number of quaint sculptures and more choice of shops, restaurants and bars.

Action and Adventure






There are a number of sandy beaches located across the island, providing the ideal venue for a number of sports including running, walking and playing ball sports on the sands. Some of the most popular sports in the Costa Caleta region include windsurfing, jet-skiing, scuba diving and the adventurous parascending. The natural scenery features volcanic landscapes, providing ample opportunity for hiking and geotourism pursuits. For more moderate activities that are ideal for families and people of all ages, Costa Caleta is home to a number of mini-golf courses and small parks you can take a quiet stroll in.

Life's a Beach






The most popular beach in the area is Caleta de Fuste beach, a 600m-long stretch of golden sands with excellent facilities and water sports amenities. Holidays to this part of the Canary Islands give you access to the best sun, sea and sand no matter when you are going on holiday. Costa Caleta has good access to all of the best beaches in Fuerteventura, with a variety of beaches nestled in lush green hills, majestic mountains and other captivating seascape settings.

Corralejo is another popular beach spot with tourists, located on the north-east corner of the island set towards the Isla de Lobos. From Corralejo, head south to the
Playa Grande
for a 10km stretch of golden shore and sand dunes, ideal for exploring with the kids.

Nightlife






As well as being the main place to eat and shop in Costa Caleta, the central street is the resort’s nightlife hotspot. This street has a selection of bars, discos, clubs and Irish-themed pubs. The nightlife here caters to all tastes and age groups, with everything from laid-back Spanish bars and retro karaoke joints to cutting-edge clubs. As with much of Spain and due to the fact that many restaurants, bars and clubs don’t even open until very late in the evening, much of the nightlife here keeps buzzing until around 3am.

For Couples






With warm sunny days and balmy evenings, Costa Caleta is the perfect setting for a romantic holiday. The resort is blessed with soft, gold-coloured sands and with the warm Spanish sun radiating down, you’ll wake up each day feeling relaxed and refreshed and in the mood for love. You can head to Caleta de Fustes beach to stroll hand-in-hand on the soft sands, enjoy a fun game of mini-golf or take a day trip into Puerto del Rosario to see the unusual sculptures. For a relaxing day out with your loved one, take a drive to the Dunas de Corralejo National Park to immerse yourself in the wild natural landscape of the desert here.

For more variety in your romantic holiday, you’ll want to venture further afield to enjoy the other great romantic attractions in Fuerteventura. Fuerteventura has been designated by the UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve. The whole area is ideal for fuss-free romantic strolls, as no matter what direction you head in, you’ll find plenty of scenic views, colourful birds and plant life and exquisite, postcard-worthy landscapes. A particularly romantic park is the Cuchillos de Vigan Natural Park, where you’ll see some incredible animals with a breath-taking backdrop.

If you’re more of an active, get-up-and-go couple, you can head to El Burro, a beach on the northern coast of Fuerteventura where you can surf and windsurf. There’s also a number of luxurious spas across Fuerteventura, ideal for relaxing and unwinding after active days out. The best spas in the region include Soul Massage at Caleta de Fuste, which specialises in invigorating massages, and the Tranquillity Massage and Beauty Spa at Corralejo.

Culture






As a purpose-built tourist resort, Costa Caleta itself lacks some of the long-reaching history and culture of the traditional Spanish resorts but is forging a culture of its own - a rich tapestry of authentic Spanish lifestyle and tourist influences. Costa Caleta is most popular with tourists from Britain and was formerly known as Caleta de Fuste and El Castilo. Costa Caleta is home to the only golf courses on Fuerteventura, including the 18-hole Fuerteventura Golf Club, designed by Juan Catarineu.

One of the best cultural attractions in the surrounding area is the Salt Museum, which pays homage to the incredible craftsmanship of Las Salinas del Carmen. The landscape of Fuerteventura is dotted with picturesque mills and a number of lime kilns, which were used to support the island’s economy in past times. With religion playing a vital role in the culture of Fuerteventura, there are a number of exquisite chapels and churches. One of the finest is the Iglesia de Nuestra Senora de Antigua, as well as the 18
th
-century Castillo de San Buenavetura.
