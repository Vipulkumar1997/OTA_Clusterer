Hi Andy, the hotel is a good 15 minute walk to the nearest shop and bar but there is very little in the resort of Theologos itself which is a small greek village. The Meliton Hotel is close to a number of attractions and places of interest such as the Beach, Valley of the Butterflies, the Ancient City of Kamiros, Acropolis of Rhodes, Grand Master Palace and Modern Art Gallery if any of those places are something youd be interested in. The hotel itself has evening entertainment which includes greek nights and karaoke. If you were looking for more activities and abit of life outside of the hotel then I would look at another resort, Rhodes Town, Kalkithea, Lindos or Lardos for example. Kind Regards
