The Pierre & Vacances Fuerteventura Origo Mare Holiday Village is a 4-star resort which has been thoughtfully designed to ensure you have a comfortable, relaxing stay. The Village is situated in the north of Fuerteventura between the villages of Corralejo and El Cotillo and is a complex of self-contained houses and apartments surrounded by pools and beautiful scenery, just over a mile to the nearest beach.

With 321 rooms available, you can choose between smart studios or houses depending on your needs, and all are Mediterranean-style with a bright, summery feel and cool tiled floors. Every room has a private terrace or balcony which is furnished as a dining area, so you can enjoy the view with your morning coffee or a glass of wine in the evening. Air conditioning, en-suite bathrooms, a living area and a fully-equipped kitchen complete with microwave, hob and fridge are also included in each kind of accommodation.

Two large areas make up Fuerteventura Origo Mare Holiday Village - one for accommodation and one for dining, daytime fun and evening entertainment. This makes your stay as peaceful as possible when you’re in your own room, whilst still providing enjoyment and activity throughout the day and night. Swim in one of several outdoor pools on site, exercise in the fitness centre or just relax on the sun terrace while the kids are entertained at the kids’ club, in the children’s playground or at the on-site water park. Families can play billiards or table tennis together in the games room, have a round of mini golf or try out the tennis court. There are two restaurants and four snack bars on-site, so you’ll be catered for all day.

For added convenience, there’s a mini market and shop on site, as well as bicycle rental if you want to explore the local area. The fishing village of Beach Majanicho is just 1km away, and the beaches of El Cotillo and Dunas de Corralejo are accessible by bike. A free shuttle service to the beach is offered by the hotel, though this may be subject to the season - so check at the desk.
