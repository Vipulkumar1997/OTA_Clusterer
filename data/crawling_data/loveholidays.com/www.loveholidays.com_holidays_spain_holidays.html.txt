Top Attractions






On mainland Spain, the elegant capital Madrid, stylish Barcelona on the Costa Dorada, and romantic
Seville
on the Costa del Sol are perfect for city breaks, oozing with history and culture and providing plenty of great nightlife and shopping. The Mediterranean coastline – particularly along the Costa Brava, the Costa Blanca and the
Costa del Sol
– is lined with idyllic beaches and a huge choice of resorts. For an alluring combination of rural tranquillity and bustling beach towns, head to the
Balearic
s
or the Canaries.

Majorca, Menorca and Ibiza are the main Balearics on offer for Spain holidays.
Majorca
and its bustling nightlife, cultural sights and great beaches have made it a firm favourite for family holidays. Ibiza is known worldwide for its musical heritage of modern dance music. Predominately an under 30s destination, Ibiza is also home to a range of resorts suitable for families and those seeking a bit of peace and quiet. Menorca, the little sister, is for those looking for secluded beaches and relaxation on their Spain holiday in 2018/ 2019.

The
Canary Islands
are further afield, with flights taking just over 4 hours, but still boast the same Spanish flair tourists across the world have to come to love. Tenerife, Lanzarote,
Fuerteventura
and Gran Canaria all provide an absolute wealth of attractions suitable for couples, families and solo adventurers. Tenerife and Lanzarote, especially, draw thousands upon thousands of visitors to their volcanic shores and exciting resorts. Due to their outstanding year-round weather, the Canaries are ideal for a
Christmas holiday
.

Wine and Dine






Spain is a foodie’s dream destination. Not only does it boast some of the finest restaurants in the world, but its abundant fresh produce ensures that even the most humble tavern can offer delicious local cuisine. Tapas are its most famous export – tasty little dishes that are perfect for sharing, which might include anything from the celebrated local hams to freshly fried sardines or grilled aubergines drizzled with honey.

Every region has its own specialities: along the Mediterranean coast, you’ll find succulent rice dishes such as the famous paella or
Menorca
’s rich lobster stew,
caldereta de llagosta
, while inland, hearty mountain stews and grilled local meats and vegetables take pride of place on menus. On Spain's islands - Lanzarote, Majorca or
Tenerife
- you'll find a host of seafood options that make the most of local ingredients.

These are best accompanied by local wines, which run the gamut from the noble vintages of famous wine-producing areas like La Rioja to the champagne-style
cava
from Catalonia. Every region boasts its own robust and inexpensive local wines that are ideally suited to the area’s traditional cuisine.

For Families






The Spanish adore children, which makes a holiday in Spain perfect for
families
. Beach holidays are ideal for families – who doesn’t love sun, sea and sand? – and most Spanish resorts boast a huge range of facilities and attractions for kids of all ages. Whether you're staying in Canaria, the Balearics on mainland Spain, families are welcome.

Almost all family-friendly resorts in Spain feature fabulous beaches, along with water parks, safari parks and more. Many Spanish resort hotels in the top destinations like the Costa Brava, the Costa Blanca and the Costa del Sol, offer kids’ clubs and entertainment geared towards their youngest guests.

If you’re looking for something a little more low-key, consider
Puerto Pollensa
in Majorca, which has a large, shallow bay that is ideal for younger children. The Canary Islands, primarily Lanzarote, Tenerife and Fuerteventura, offer some fantastic beaches and family-friendly resorts. For more information check out our
family holidays
page.

Spain also boasts some of Europe’s top theme parks, including PortAventura World, near
Salou
on the Costa Brava, the
Terra Mítica
in Benidorm on the Costa Blanca, or
Parque Warner
Madrid, all of which offer thrills and spills guaranteed to delight kids of all ages. Spanish cities are full of parks where children can let off steam, and most museums and galleries offer child-friendly workshops and tours.

Many cities have excellent contemporary art museums that will appeal to teenagers, and football fans won’t want to miss a visit to the Camp Nou in Barcelona or the Bernabeu stadium in Madrid. All children will be spellbound by Gaudí’s fairytale buildings in Barcelona, as well as the Alcázar palace in Seville and the magical Alhambra palace in Granada.

Action and Adventure






The sky is the limit when it comes to action and adventure in Spain – quite literally if you choose to take a helicopter ride over Barcelona, sail over Andalucia in a hot-air balloon, or go paragliding in
Majorca
! As you might expect, there are watersports galore along the coast, from snorkelling and diving to sailing and surfing. In the biggest resorts, there are also tons of fun options, such as glass-bottomed sightseeing boats, pedalos and banana boats.

Inland, you can go white-water rafting, mountain climbing, horse-riding, skiing and hiking, among scores of other activities. There are numerous long-distance walking paths that criss-cross the entire country, including the GR221 in Majorca (also known as the ‘Dry Stone Route’), the GR92 which hugs the Mediterranean coast from north to south, and the magnificent GR131 in the Canaries.

Spain has fifteen national parks scattered across the country, including the snowcapped peaks of the
Sierra Nevada
and the magnificent Doñana wetlands (both in Andalucia), the tiny island of Cabrera in Majorca, which is surrounded by transparent protected waters, and the strange lunar landscape of the Teide volcano in Tenerife. These are all home to unique species of bird, animal and plant life and offer a wealth of experiences for those seeking adventure in pristine, natural surroundings.

Life's a Beach






Thanks to its year-round sunshine and glorious coastline, Spain is one of Europe’s top destinations for beach holidays in 2018 or 2019. You’ll find plenty of choice, from the famous cliffs and coves of the
Costa Brava
, the Barcelonian beaches of the Costa Dorada, to the glamorous resorts and warm Mediterranean waters of the Costa del Sol.

The Balearic Islands offer an enticing mix of turquoise bays and long golden sands, while the Canary Islands combine dramatic scenery with gorgeous beaches. The beaches on
Majorca
are busy, buzzing and home to some of the best all inclusive hotels in the Balearics. On Ibiza's beaches, you'll find dozens of beach parties and beach clubs. For peace and seclusion, both Menorca and Formentera make a good choice for a laid-back Balearic holiday.

The Canary Islands boast some of the most striking beaches. Although the beaches on Tenerife are predominately volcanic, the second largest Canary Island,
Fuerteventura
, boasts long stretches of white sand. Fuerteventura is also home to some of the top beach resorts, including
Caleta de Fuste
. Lanzarote is also home to a wide range of excellent beach resorts, including the popular
Costa Teguise
.

Popular resorts on mainland include the
Costa Blanca
, family-friendly Torremolinos, chic, whitewashed
Marbella
and the permanently popular, Lloret de Mar. The Costa Blanca, the Costa Brava and the Costa del Sol are all known for their fantastic beaches, and you really can't go wrong at any of these destinations for a 2018 / 2019 holiday.

Nightlife






The party island of
Ibiza
is world-renowned for its dazzling nightclubs and glamorous party scene, which reaches hedonistic heights of excess during the summer months. A holiday to Ibiza is like no other holiday to Spain, especially if you like dancing!

Other popular party resorts include
Sitges
on the Costa Dorada,
Torremolinos
on the Costa del Sol and
Lloret de Mar
on the Costa Brava, along with
Magaluf
in Mallorca and
Playa del Inglés
in Gran Canaria,
Playa de las Américas
in Tenerife and
Puerto del Carmen
in Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. Expect pool parties, foam parties, circus acts, boat parties and more – just don’t expect to get much sleep!

Cities like Madrid,
Valencia
and Barcelona offer year-round nightlife, with most clubs opening at midnight and closing at dawn. These cities also boast a great choice of live music venues, whether you’re looking for the biggest-name international acts or prefer something more low-key and intimate.

For Couples






The possibilities for romance are endless in Spain: you could watch the sunset over white sand beaches in the tranquil island paradise of
Menorca
, sip cocktails on a glamorous rooftop terrace in Madrid, or listen to flamenco on a jasmine-scented courtyard in Seville.

If you’re looking for a romantic city break, you’ll be spoilt for choice in Spain. Get lost in Madrid’s enchanting historic centre, where you can meander hand-in-hand through cobbled streets from tapas bar to tapas bar, or soak up the laid-back beach vibe of beautiful Barcelona, which offers style, culture and a gorgeous historic backdrop. Hipster-favourite
Valencia
combines fabulous beaches with a quirky offbeat charm. Foodies should head to
San Sebastian
, a paradise for gourmets which also happens to sit on one of northern Spain’s most beautiful bays. Other top picks for romantic breaks include Almeria and
Murcia
, two southern Spanish cities with lots of charm.

If you prefer the idea of a romantic beach holiday that offers plenty of time alone with your partner, consider the
Costa Brava
or the northwestern coast of Majorca, both of which are dotted with miniature coves, many accessed only by boat or clifftop path. The quiet island of Menorca is also full of quiet corners to explore, and, if you time it right, you could have the delicious little island of Formentera almost completely to yourselves.

If you prefer a more glamorous beach holiday, head to the glittering resorts of Ibiza, where you can watch the sunset while DJs spin mellow tunes, and party until dawn.

Culture






Some of the finest art museums, biggest palaces, and grandest churches on earth are to be found in Spain, making it a fantastic destination for culture buffs.

Madrid’s celebrated trio of world-class art museums – the Prado, the Thyssen and the Reina Sofía – are home to vast collection of outstanding artworks spanning more than a millennia. Also in
Madrid
is the enormous Royal Palace, the largest in Europe, with more than 2,800 rooms. Meanwhile, Barcelona boasts one of Europe’s best preserved medieval quarters in the Barri Gòtic and the largest concentration of Catalan Art Nouveau (‘Modernista’) monuments anywhere. World-famous Spanish artists such as Picasso, Miró and Dalí are represented in numerous museums, notably Malaga’s superb Picasso museum,
Palma de Mallorca
’s Miró Foundation, and the Dalí Theatre-Museum in Catalonia.

From the well preserved Roman remains of
Tarragona
on the Costa Dorada, to the extravagantly decorated architecture in
Almeria
and Murcia, Spain is also rich in historic monuments. Some of the world’s oldest cave paintings were discovered in Altamira in
Cantabria
, and the Balearic Islands are still scattered with the tombs and villages of the ancient Talayotic culture.

Santiago Calatrava’s stunning white City of Arts and Sciences in
Valencia
and Frank Gehry’s mind-bending designs for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao are just two recent structures that demonstrate the country’s commitment to contemporary art and architecture.

Traditional Spanish culture comes to the fore at the local festivals held in every village, town and city across the country. These exuberant events are celebrated with parades and a host of local traditions, such as the mock battles between the Christians and the Moors held along the
Costa Blanca
to the
correfoc
(‘fire-running’) popular in Catalonia. These festivities are accompanied with plenty of eating, drinking and dancing, and provide a wonderful insight into local Spanish culture.
