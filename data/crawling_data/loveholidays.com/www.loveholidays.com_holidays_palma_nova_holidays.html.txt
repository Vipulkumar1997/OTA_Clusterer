Top Attractions






For breath-taking vistas and a cool island breeze, Palma Nova is the go-to Majorcan resort. This vibrant town is home to many beautiful, beachside properties and restaurants serving up delectable dishes day and night. Whether you plan on topping up your tan, indulge in the nearby water park in
Alcudia
or explore the spectacular countryside surrounding the resort, you’ll find a great base in Palma Nova. Wake up to the sounds of the sea, only 200 metres from the nearest beach, in an all-inclusive dream hotel catering to couples and families alike. You’ll never be too far away from the golden beaches, sunshine, or a delicious and authentic meal during your Palma Nova holidays.

Palma Nova Beach offers sun, sand and sea right in the heart of the resort, with calm, clear waters that are perfect for days of swimming and splashing around. Visit the water parks with the whole family for a day guaranteed to keep a smile on everyone’s face, or check out nearby
Cabo Blanco
for unspoiled water delights. Make sure to take some time to explore the surrounding countryside on foot or by bike for gorgeous views of the island and the Mediterranean, before returning to the beach for some snorkelling and jet skiing. If you fancy a different beach setting, head to the island’s gorgeous east coast to resorts like Cala Bona or Cala Millor.

Wine and Dine






Many of Palma Nova’s best places to eat and drink can be found in the centre of town, alongside its many shops and bars. Here, a variety of food is available– from British-inspired fish and chips to delicious seafood restaurants and steakhouses, there’s something for even the fussiest of eaters! For an international flavour, head to one of the many
Spanish
tapas bars, or try the Indian, French or Mexican restaurants dotted around the town. A great place to visit is the Ibiza Restaurant on the seafront, serving traditional Italian food in their candlelit gardens. With comfortable seating and a great view across the sea, it is the perfect place to grab a cheeky mojito or two as the sun sets.

In the evenings, relax and indulge in some delicious world cuisine. You can choose from Chinese to Italian cuisine, or try fresh seafood and traditional dishes of Spain like tapas in one of the many cafes and restaurants overlooking the bay in Palma Nova, or pop to the nearby resort of
Cala Mayor
for even more culinary variety, before hitting the bars and clubs in Magaluf.

For Families






For a holiday that caters for the entire family, look no further than Palma Nova. The area is home to a variety of waterparks, activity centres and family-friendly attractions. Whether you’re on holiday with the little ‘uns or you’re simply trying to entertain big kids, there are plenty of things to do in Palma Nova. One of the most popular Palma Nova attractions for children is the Pirates Adventure, based in the outskirts of Palma Nova. An entertaining dinner show with a pirate themed story, this action-packed musical event will transport you to a magical world of thrills, comedy and swashbuckling fun.

If you’re looking for something a little more relaxed, however, try your hand at one of
Majorca’s
best mini-golf courses at Golf Fantastia. Set in Palma Nova’s spectacular tropical gardens, the course is concealed within a labyrinth of caves, waterfalls and lagoons. This attraction provides an unusual way to enjoy an afternoon of sport alongside the whole family.

Action and Adventure






Thrill-seekers will love the wealth of sports and activities on offer. One of Palma Nova’s attractions is its crystal-clear water, making it an ideal location for adventure diving. Explore a menagerie of marine life as you dive deep beneath the sea, journeying your way through abandoned shipwrecks and enchanting caves. For those with a real sense of adventure, coasteering is sure to get your pulse racing. An epic combination of swimming, rock climbing, caving and abseiling, this is not an activity for the faint-hearted! Swimming through caves, abseiling down gushing waterfalls and edging your way through rocky boulders – this is an adrenaline ride to make your holiday unforgettable.

Life's a Beach






With a promenade stretched along the beach and luxury yachts bobbing along the shore, the top things to do in Palma Nova definitely include enjoying this ideal spot to relax. For the perfect way to recharge your batteries, venture down to the seafront and book a boat trip from the island. Glass-bottom boats are an unusual way to view life beneath the ocean’s surface without getting your feet wet. To add a touch of luxury to your holiday, set sail on a luxury catamaran. A great way to top up your tan, you’ll enjoy peace of mind as the boat navigates its way around the Mediterranean Sea before sailing back towards the port. A trip on the open waters provides the perfect finale to an amazing holiday.

Nightlife






Palmanova’s nightlife features a majestic choice of beach bars and restaurants from which you can enjoy the beautiful bay views of the Balearic Sea well into the night. There’s also a number of exciting disco bars roaring to go for when you’re ready to hit the dancefloor! Banana Joe’s is a great place for this, and also has a good range of screens to watch sports in the evening as well as a resident DJ who goes on a journey from old school to the latest dance. There’s also retro-themed dancing and fun to be had just down the road at Reflex club. A casual walk along Palmanova’s stunning beach brings you to a seemingly endless row of beachside bars and restaurants – Zen Lounge Bar is a great stop off for tasty Mediterranean flavours and an extensive cocktail menu! Your holiday will be a special one with the perfect blend of relaxation and atmosphere that Palmanova offers, and it’s a Spanish treasure we’re sure you’ll want to return to again and again!

For Couples






Overlooking the stunning Badia de Palma, Palmanova is a perfect destination for couples looking for a combination of a relaxing seaside experience and bustling nightlife on their holiday. With its stunning views out into the Balearic Sea, Palmanova is a paradise for tourists. Golf Fantasia is a great way to kill a couple of hours in tranquil surroundings with some good competition, and if you’re feeling even more adventurous you can try Norwaydive for sub-sea experiences! If you prefer the surface of the water, regular boat trips offer stunning perspectives on the island and an amazing way to sample a sea view sunset. To wind down after your day, bars such as Monroe’s and Offpist bar will give you good food and even better vibes. If you prefer an even more bustling vibe, Palmanova also has the advantage that it is situated within close proximity of Magaluf and the throngs of clubs, bars and pubs that will satisfy the holiday party animals in you! Couples and Palmanova are made for one another.

Culture






Palmanova has a rich cultural heritage with plenty of evidence remaining for you to explore during your holiday. Start out with the defence towers across Calvia and some of the beautiful villages in the surrounding areas such as Naveta de n’Alemany. Once your taste buds are ready to be tickled with some scrumptious Mediterranean bites, Palmanova’s quirky side streets are home to many ‘off the beaten track’ eateries that simply have to be tried – the local paellas and cocktails are unmissable. While it’s not strictly culture, your holiday won’t be complete without a sunset stroll along Palmnova’s stunning beach promenade to enjoy the waves and soft Balearic sands. If you fancy heading a little out of town there’s also hot air balloon trips within easy reach of Palmnova to enjoy stunning views of the islands and the whole Balearic Sea. Alternatively, if you’d rather remain grounded you can sit back and take in a trip on the Soller trains and trams, taking in beautiful bridges, relaxing rivers and stunning scenery.
