Top Attractions






Rhodes Town
is a fascinating destination to explore, home to some wonderful examples of Byzantine architecture and boasting a
UNESCO World Heritage
Site listing, this is the place to come if you’re a history buff or culture vulture. The most iconic scene in the town is the famed
Street of the Knights
, leading down towards the striking
Palace of the Grand Master
– a sight that needs to be captured on your camera. You can also discover historical significance in the beautiful Acropolis at
Lindos
, a stunning archaeological site boasting equally stunning sea views.

If you want to experience traditional Greece during your holidays to Rhodes, then there are plenty of avenues to explore the island. For a lazy day along the sun-kissed coastline, look no further than
Kalathos
, home to cosy bars and welcoming tavernas, it’s a great place to team relaxation with a spot of culture. Other top picks include
Kolymbia
for beachy hotels, Lardos for a feel of inland Rhodes, and Kalithea, a coastal resort not far from Faliraki.

If you need to cool off after a day of exploring history and culture then head to the waterpark in
Faliraki
, boasting plenty of pools and slides to keep the young and young at heart entertained.

Island hopping is another great way to explore; you can even head over to
Turkey
and visit bustling
Bodrum
as a cool day trip on your holidays in Rhodes, which is full of bazaars and great shopping opportunities.

Wine and Dine






You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better example of Greece’s traditional cuisine than on this wonderful island of Rhodes. Heading to
Rhodes Town
will embellish your holiday with a variety of foods to gorge on as you seek a hearty meal to fuel your adventures among the many things to do in Rhodes.

Thanks to an increase in tourism over the last few decades, Rhodes has been subject to an investment of diverse international cuisines, ranging from English and Italian to Mediterranean and Chinese dishes – so there’ll be no doubt everyone in the group will be well fed on the food they love.

Like any Greek Island holiday, seafood will be the highlight of your culinary adventures. Low-key resorts like
Kiotari
boast a number of traditional Rhodesian restaurants, whereas the more modern resorts of Ialyssos or even the purpose-built, like
Ixia
, cater to a wider range of international taste buds.

For Families






Finding cultural activities is an easy task if you know where to look.
Faliraki
Water Park will host a day of entertainment which isn’t just suited to the kids, but the adults too! If you want to stay outside of Faliraki's bustling resort centre, why not try
Kalithea
? As well as having plenty of slides and rides, there are places to relax amid the chaos and parents will be well served when it comes to unwinding in a family-friendly environment.

Most of the resorts on Rhodes are family friendly, making Rhodes a top pick for a family holiday in 2019. If you want something relaxing then there's lots to choose from:
Kiotari
is small, laid-back and boasts a lovely beach;
Lindos
, a medieval town, will leave the kids wanting to explore as well play on the gorgeous beach;
Kolymbia
is the ultimate beachy holiday and the kids will love the sands here.

Action and Adventure






If you’ve come to Rhodes for an adventure then the diversified landscapes will be more than rewarding as you make your way around the island. Glass-bottom boat tours will showcase the exotic marine life which surrounds the island, while hiring a bike or hiking through the vegetative scenery will open your eyes to a wonderful selection of tropical titillations and Rhodes attractions. Tour Lindos by minibus or, for a more indulgent excursion, go on a wine, olive oil and honey tasting tour as you parade through Butterfly Valley. If that’s not enough then take a ferry from Rhodes to Bodrum to add some Turkish flair to your holiday.

Life's a Beach






Beach breaks and party escapes are often the theme for those hitting the island of Rhodes, with a plethora of resorts exposing holidaymakers to sandy and sunny climes, while other more bustling destinations are packed with lively bars and pulsing clubs, ensuring visitors are engrossed before and after the sun goes down on each day of your Rhodes holidays.

A popular place to stay is
Kolymbia
, which is home to a Blue Flag beach and a crystal clear bay. Kalathos is just as stunning, where you’ll be able to relax and unwind on banks of golden sand and cool off in the shimmering ocean – perfect for holidaying families with youngsters in tow. Kremasti is another fantastic base for families, boasting a quiet resort set up with much action and adventure to be had on the waves. Other top picks include Lardos and
Kalithea
.

Perhaps the most standout feature when visiting this Greek island is the many luscious beaches which host an array of the best things to do in Rhodes. Sunbathing and topping up your tan in the
Mediterranean
climate is a given when strewn across the soft sands which envelop Rhodes, but for a more active break you’ll be happy to make your way around the conveyor belt of water sports that include surfing, water-skiing and jet skiing - Lindos and
Pefkos
providing a variety to appease the adrenaline enthusiasts and adventure seekers.

Don’t forget to pack the flippers if you’re hoping to explore the world beneath the water’s surface, scuba diving being an experience to remember after having had the pleasure of witnessing Rhodes’ colourful corals.

Nightlife






If you’re one of many who come to Rhodes to sample the scintillating nightlife then take a non-stop trip to the thriving
Faliraki
. As the sun sets on the cultural captivations which litter the island, Faliraki becomes the beating heart within a neon-glazed cacophony of dance music and air-shattering tunes. If you prefer something a little quieter where you can see the evening in without a fuss,
Kremasti
is full of traditional pubs ingrained with casual live music and a cosy ambience in which to sip on the local tipple.

Shopaholics will love the quaint street markets in
Lindos
or the shopping quarter in the island’s capital, Rhodes Town, ensuring ample opportunity to pick up some great souvenirs from your holidays in Rhodes to take back to the family and friends back home.
Ixia
has a pleasant bar strip along the beach which mixes holiday resort and local Rhodes culture. If you're exhausted after a night of partying in Faliraki, head down the coast a short distance to the relaxed
Kolymbia
, where you can laze on a beach and recover.

For Couples






It is surprisingly easy to lose the crowds on Rhodes and find a quiet place where you can walk alone with your partner and enjoy some of the spectacular scenery in this part of the world. There are remote beaches with only the sound of the waves lapping on the shore and the stunning sky and surroundings around you. The coastline is chock full of wildlife and flowers and the old towns are romantic to walk around or find a restaurant with sea views for a perfect meal to remember.


Read More about For Couples





Culture






Whenever in Greece, you can be sure of an assemblage of ancient ruins and artefacts, the Archaeological Museum of Rhodes and the Municipal Art Gallery being fantastic ways to immerse yourself among Rhodes’ vibrant culture. The Medieval City is another mainstay which you’ll have to make time to visit, surrounded by veritable fortifications this old part of Rhodes will transport you back in time with a host of historically significant attractions within the weathered stone walls – top of the list of things to do in Rhodes without a doubt.
