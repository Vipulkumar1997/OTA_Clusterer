The Bellevue Club is situated in the popular resort town of Alcudia, on the sunny Spanish island of Majorca. Located right by a beautiful lake, and just a short walk or boat ride to Alcudia beach, the Bellevue Club has a fantastic range of facilities, making it the ideal setting for families, couples, and groups of friends seeking a relaxing holiday in the sun. The hotel offers all-inclusive, half-board, full-board, and bed & breakfast options for ultimate holiday flexibility.

Bellevue Club is a large complex, divided into 17 buildings and totalling 1468 private apartments, with well-kept gardens. The hotel has a range of different sized rooms to suit all parties and budgets, including studios that sleep up to 3 guests, and one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments. All are fitted with the necessary amenities to make your stay as comfortable as possible, including a kitchenette, satellite television, en-suite bathroom and WiFi. The Bellevue Club Hotel offers self-catering and catered options for guests, with excellent breakfast, lunch, and evening meals served in the hotel restaurant, and snacks available throughout the day from the Leda bar.

The Bellevue Club has a grand total of eight pools for guests to enjoy, all with shallow sections for children, and surrounded by spacious sun terraces. Several poolside bars mean that ice-cold refreshment is never far away. As well as the impressive number of pools, you’ll find facilities for tennis, mini-golf and go-karting. If that’s not enough, head to the lake and have a go at sailing or kayaking. The fun doesn’t stop when the sun goes down – the hotel has a show garden, where there’s a min-disco for the kids, the music and magic performances.

Whilst staying at the Bellevue Club you're only 800m from Alcudia beach, or around a 10 - 15-minute walk. Alcudia proper is just a short journey on from there, where you'll find a range of bars, clubs and restaurants, plus a range of shops and sights. The hotel is also well located close to the local avenue, Pedro Mas y Reus, where there are shops and local taverns.
