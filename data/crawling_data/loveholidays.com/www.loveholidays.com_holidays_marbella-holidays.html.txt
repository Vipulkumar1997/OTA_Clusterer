Top Attractions






Often considered Spain’s answer to France’s St. Tropez, Marbella is famous for its luxury and holidays to Marbella and
Malaga
will not disappoint. The playful wealth that energises this spot on the
Costa Del Sol
can make for some unforgettable experiences, right on your resort’s doorstep. Chill-out on the Playa La Fontanilla, or the Playa de Alicate, before taking a stroll along the busy Paseo Maritimo boardwalk heading towards the
Puerto Banus Marina
where you can revel in the conspicuous wealth: there are yachts at Puerto Banus the size of football fields and an afternoon spent wining and dining along this strip can leave you feeling glamorous. For something a little more traditional, Marbella’s Historic Quarter provides an excellent taste of “Old Spain” and Alameda Park is an excellent location to take a moment in the shade. For a moment out of the glitzy bustle of the town center head up into the Sierra Blanca’s for a day of hiking and scenic bliss. We recommend La Concha, the views are incredible!

Wine and Dine






Finding a place to eat in Marbella is like being handed a delicious tray of goodies and not knowing which one to pick first. Cuisine here is obviously international and there’s literally something to try from most corners of the globe. Most resorts and hotels along the Golden Mile offer comprehensive menus representing a wide range of delicious dishes.  You should head down the traditional route at first. Try some of the North African and Moroccan dishes that have blended seamlessly with Southern Spain’s cuisine. Spanish tapas and the Spaniard’s preference of seafood have merged with the Moorish spices and flavours over the thousands of years the two cultures have co-existed. There’s, of course, lots of Mediterranean restaurants to try out, but a place as internationally renowned as Marbella is bound to have a lot of cards in its hands. There’s Italian, French, Steak, Argentinian and Asian cuisines available, to name but a few, all prepared and served in guaranteed Costa Del Sol style.

For Families






Marbella, although known for its glitz, glamour and high-rolling parties, also offers a lot to a family seeking a relaxing getaway in Spain, along the reliably sunny Costa del Sol. Pick the right hotel and your kids will be looked after by entertainment teams, can splash and play in the pool and make friends in Kid’s Clubs. Don’t forget the beaches. There’s 23, remember? We’ve never met a child who didn’t like to play on the beach, and with so many to choose from it’s inevitable that you’ll find a comfy spot for your whole family to settle down and get relaxing, playing, digging, swimming, reading, lounging, or whatever it is that takes your fancy. We recommend Playa de Alicate, its wide beaches and calm seas are perfect for a family holiday. Too much sand? Impossible! But there’s always the reliable Aqualand in
Torremolinos
, and if the kids complain, don’t worry, you can just tell them you’ll feed them to the big crocs at the Torremolinos Crocodile Park! For a day-trip of exploration and fun, an hour drive up the Costa Del Sol and you’ll reach
Benalmadena
, known for the Tivoli World Theme Park. We can guarantee, however, that no child will be disappointed when you tell them that today will be another beach day.

Action and Adventure






Marbella is known for its beaches and there are plenty of opportunities to get involved with various water sports ranging from Jetboat Marbella, hovering around with RedFly Marbella or your standard kitesurfing, jet-ski and pretty much every other water-based activity you can think of. Flanked on all sides by beautiful mountains, you can also explore the wilds. Born to be Wild is a off-road tour service which offers an exciting whip around the Sierra Blanca. If you want to stay on 4 wheels we recommend Kart4Fun; go-karting is great anywhere, but with the stunning views of the mountains and unbeatable Spanish sun an afternoon racing around the track is hard to beat. Heading off the beaten track is not a bad idea, there’s lots to explore and getting away from the hustle and bustle can be desired after a few days living to the max along the Golden Mile. Bikes are readily available to hire from most tourist outlets and there are several Segway tours that you can take around the city and local area if you’re looking for something with more direction.

Life's a Beach






Sun-drenched Marbella has ridiculous beach prestige. The youngest and most popular place to be(ach) in 2018 is Bounty Beach, which is the name of the club situated on the Playa Del Cable. It’s wide, sandy and well-maintained, and the club hosts the beach parties with chilled out music and reasonably priced drinks that Marbella has become renowned for. For something a little more laidback, but as equally as beautiful, the Playa De Rio Real provides the same golden sands and blue seas with some extra water sports and activities; there’s also Playa De Alicate, popular with residents, and Playa Real De Zaragoza known for its particularly clean waters. The most exclusive Marbella beach experience can be found on Nikki Beach, famous all over the world for the big names it has attracted and the glitzy parties thrown nearby. Wait. We could go on all day. There are 23 beaches in total along the 27km of coast! Stop listening, book now if beaches are what you live for.

Nightlife






Unless you try and hide, the nightlife is bound to find you in Marbella. The Golden Mile bursts with life every night, Monday through Sunday, as the party waits for no one on the Costa del Sol. Begin in Marbella Old Town, which is famed for its romantic atmosphere and the buzzing energy of its streetside bars. After that head down to Bounty Beach for a warm-up where the sand is your dancefloor. For the most exclusive nightlife Marbella has to offer, head to Puerto Banus after you’ve warmed up your dancing legs on the beach. ASTRAL cocktail bar offers some insanely creative cocktails, the Ocean Club is the place to beat if you’re looking for a classy pool party and Patrick’s 19th is the best place to have a drink and watch the fast-paced pulse of Marbella’s party area. Get your party hats on, brace yourselves and most importantly, just explore! Marbella is packed with energy and life and is simply waiting for you to stumble across a hidden gem, the sort of place you go intending to spend an hour, and end up spending the whole evening instead.

For Couples






Walk hand in hand along the Paseo Maritimo boardwalk and dream of the first mega-yacht you’ll buy in Puerto Banus, which 5-star resort along the Costa Del Sol you’ll stay in next and where you should park the future Rolls Royce. Don’t worry - you don’t need mega-money to enjoy a romantic holiday in Marbella. The Costa Del Sol is a land designed for the dreamer and there’s no end to the romantic haunts, balcony views and candlelit dinners available in Marbella, whatever your budget. Wander the twisting streets of Marbella Old Town until you stumble across the Plaza de los Naranjos, explore the Sierra Blanca’s beautiful countryside in tranquil seclusion and lounge, side by side, on the Playa de Rio Real. There’s a reason why Marbella is known as a honeymoon hotspot: the idyllically romantic hotels, excellent restaurants and shopping, all bathed in a constant Spanish sun. What more could you want for your couple’s getaway?


Read More about For Couples





Culture






Culture in Marbella, like the holidaymakers that grace its golden sands, is a mixed assortment of many international flavours. These days Marbella is known for its glitzy lifestyle, but with money comes art, and with art comes more art. Visit the popular Municipal Exposition Gallery or the Casa Grande Gallery, both of which attract patrons from across the globe and offer up a palette of regularly changing exhibitions. If you’re visiting in June don’t miss the Marbella Arts Festival, a massive art-based street festival. You should check out the Ralli Museums for a taste of fantastic and contemporary Latin Art, or the Spanish Contemporary Engravings Museum, a top attraction in Marbella’s old town. Experience art in motion at the Black Box Theatre and uncover the many public art installations hidden among Marbella’s winding streets. And remember, Marbella’s history dates to 1600 BC, so keep your eyes peeled for ancient architecture whilst you wander the streets that generations and generations of people have traversed before you.
