Captivating Corralejo holidays 2018 / 2019

Corralejo is a resort of many faces. From the beachfront at
Town Beach
you'd be mistaken in thinking that Corralejo was just like any other tourist resort in
Fuerteventura
, just like any popular hotspot in the
Canary Islands
. However, there's a certain magic to Corralejo that sets it apart from the rest.

With a bustling nightlife, a host of self-catering apartments and all inclusive hotels, plus all the regular resort offenders like Irish pubs and fish-and-chip shops, Corralejo has also retained a lot of its original Fuerteventura charm. A working harbour which Corralejo fisherman still depart from, the epic
Corralejo National Park
, and the endless, seemingly deserted sand dunes at
Playa del Moro
exist alongside a string of Riu hotels.

Plus, in the centre of town, based around the focus point of Music Square, you'll find traditional Spanish seafood restaurants, narrow winding streets and old-world houses alongside international restaurants, boutique shops and bars.

Top Attractions






Corralejo is a resort of many faces. From the beachfront at
Town Beach
you'd be mistaken in thinking that Corralejo was just like any other tourist resort in Fuerteventura, just like any popular hotspot in the Canary Islands. Enjoy known brand restaurants, international shops and boutiques and locals that know what they're doing when it comes to catering to British tourists.

However, there's a certain magic to Corralejo that sets it apart from many of the rest.

Revel in Corralejo's sands, enjoy the vibrant nightlife, and take a trip over to
Los Lobos island
, a literal desert island which is home to rare fauna and flora. You'll find some of the best snorkelling spots in Spain here, plus it only takes 15 minutes from Corralejo pleasure harbour.
Flag Beach
, south of Corralejo, is a highly recommended surfing and windsurfing spot.

Wine and Dine






When the mood to break for a bite finally strikes, food lovers will easily delight in the locally inspired cuisine featured on most of the island's menus. Fisherman still fish off the pier and fishing boats still head out from Corralejo's harbour, so you can expect some truly delicious and fresh seafood.

Because Corralejo is an international resort you'll also find international restaurants, bars and clubs where you can enjoy the tastes of home, or anywhere else for that matter.

For Families






There’s many things to do around Corralejo that put the active in activity, so if you’re a particularly adventurous or energetic family, then you will find a number of different things to pass the time. The beautiful volcanic region of
Fuerteventura
is an idyllic one, to say the leas,t and embarking on a hike is the perfect way to experience that.

The beautiful region of
Montana de Tindaya
is home to a picturesque 400 foot mountain which is a sacred place for the island’s indigenous inhabitants, because of this, climbing the mountain is no longer allowed but the expansive walk around it proves just as invigorating. Be sure to keep a keen eye out for the footprint-shaped engravings left by the indigenous Majonero people hundreds of years ago.

When the whole clan is tuckered out, you can kick back, relax and embark on a minibus tour called
Flavours of Fuerteventura
. On this tour you will tick off all of the most impressive and popular sights the area has to offer; from the African-inspired lighthouse looking over
Las Playitas Beach
, Aztec-infused friezes around a local church and a scenic drive through the mountains of
Betancuria
. Throughout the tour you’ll stop for some local eats and whether it’s the bread, cheese and tomatoes offered at a rural hotel or a cheese-tasting session made locally at a goat farm, you’ll be sure to have great memories.

Action and Adventure






A water sports enthusiast's dream come true, Corralejo holidays are not complete until you have a go at windsurfing or kiteboarding on
Flag Beach
, both of which the locals traditionally enjoy during sunrise or sunset. For families, a day trip to nearby
Baku Water Park
offers a great change of pace which is sure to keep the little ones occupied for hours.

Life's a Beach






Beaches are best when they're soft and sandy, and Corralejo has plenty. The small
Town Beach
is located next to the operating harbour and is flanked by restaurants and bars. Further along is
Galeria Beach
, the bustling beach of Corralejo, where you'll find beach clubs, restaurants and safe swimming.

Flag Beac
h, south of the centre of town, is where all the surfers and windsurfers come to hang out and enjoy the winds that whip across
Fuerteventura
. Fuerteventura, in Spanish, means 'strong fortune' or 'strong luck', although some say this could also means 'strong winds.' Makes sense!

Further down is
Playa del Moro
, a huge expanse of protected beachfront. These rolling dunes are so massive and otherwordly that even during peak season it's like you've stepped out of a busy tourist resort to a remote island in the middle of the sea. Beautiful.

Nightlife






Travellers interested in laid back nightlife will find what they are looking for in Corralejo. Featuring lots of bars and clubs with nightly live music sets, you can sit back and unwind easily after dark.

For Couples






Aside from the beautiful beachside walks and candlelight dinners which offer romance aplenty, there are a number of things for couples to do when visiting Corralejo. For those looking to enjoy a night of entertainment, Music Hall offers many types of entertainment throughout the year, from drag shows to variety shows, so depending on your taste you’re sure to find something to satisfy both parties. The venue also offers an accompanying three-course meal to ensure you’re not wanting for anything.

For those more interested in live music, Imagine Bar is the place to be in Corralejo. With a talented cover band who have a repertoire as long as a giant’s arm, you’re sure to be entertained when attending a night in this atmospheric venue.

If you’re a couple seeking more memories in the outdoors then a visit to
Parque Natural de las Dunas de Corralejo
is a must. This beautifully untouched park is home to a copious amount of dunes and desert wildlife. Here you can take a relaxing stroll hand in hand as you bask in the beautiful sights and make some beautiful memories.

Culture






The
Canary Islands
are rich in folklore and festivals. The fiestas del Carmen in July is celebrated with decorated boats in the harbour and a procession carrying a statue of the virgin Mary by the local fisherman. Fish are roasted and music and festivities carry on through the night.
