Humberside Airport (HUY)
has been voted one of the UK’s best small airports. For holidaymakers based in the central UK region, it’s an ideal base for jetting off to sunny destinations across Europe thanks to its array of scheduled and charter flights to holiday hotspots. If you’re driving, it’s handily located
just off the M180
and boasts plenty of
parking
. It has excellent
public transport links
: the nearest trains stop at
Barnetby Station,
where you can hop in a taxi, or take the HumberFlyer, an
express bus service
from Cleethorpes, Grimsby, Barton and Hull.

How about popping over for a weekend in
Palma
in
Majorca
? This historic city’s chic boutiques and tapas bars are matched by fantastic beaches within easy reach! Or perhaps you feel like taking the family off for some fun in the sun on the beautiful
Costa Blanca
! There are direct flights to the gorgeous seaside city of
Alicante
, which is the gateway to famous resorts such as
Benidorm
. Maybe you’re in the mood to enjoy the beaches and nightlife in
Sunny Beach
, Bulgaria’s fun-filled resort on the
Black Sea
.

The airport has just one terminal and is
compact and easy to get around.
No dashing to find your gate here! You’ll still find enough
shops and services
to ensure your comfort before you jet off on your sunshine escape! Whatever kind of break you’re looking for, and whether you’re travelling with friends, the kids or your partner, you’re bound to find a

How to get to Humberside Airport

Located just off the main A18 trunk road, Humberside Airport is only three miles from Junction 5 of the M180, making it very easy to get to. If you are driving there, just insert the postcode DN39 6YH into your satellite navigation system and follow the directions for the best route possible. If you are being dropped off or picked up from the airport, there is a zone for arriving and departing passengers adjacent to the terminal in Car Park 1.

If you are travelling by bus, your best bet is the Stagecoach 'Humber Flyer' which operates Monday to Saturday between Cleethorpes, Grimsby, Humberside Airport, Barton and Hull.

The nearest railway station to Humberside Airport can be found just three miles away – that’s Barnetby Station and it is served by TransPennine Express and East Midlands Trains. The station has links with places such as Manchester Piccadilly, Leicester, Nottingham, and Sheffield, to name but a few. If you arrive here on your way to the airport, there are taxi services (Cable Taxi, the approved airport taxi company) that can take you from Barnetby Station to Humberside Airport in no time.
