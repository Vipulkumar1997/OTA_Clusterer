loveholidays takes your privacy seriously

loveholidays understands and respects the importance of your privacy and we are committed to safeguarding
				your personal information.

Any personal information you provide to us including and similar to your name, address, telephone number and email
				address will not be released, sold, or rented to any entities or individuals outside of loveholidays except
				where required by us to process your booking and to ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet
				your requirements. Our representatives may sometimes follow up, either by e-mail, phone, fax or mail, to people who
				have registered their details and we may periodically send promotional e-mail about new products, special offers or
				other information which we think you may find interesting using the e-mail address which you have provided.

We take full responsibility for ensuring that proper security measures are in place to protect your information. We
				must pass the information on to the relevant suppliers of your travel arrangements such as your tour operator,
				airlines, hotels, transport companies etc. The information may also be provided to security or credit checking
				companies, public authorities such as customs/immigration if required by them, or as required by law. We may need
				to disclose our customer list including any personal information relating to you to a third party who acquires or
				attempts to acquire all or substantially all of the asset/ stock in our company or our website.

Where your holiday is outside the European Economic Area (EEA), controls on data protection in your destination
				may not be as strong as the legal requirements in this country. We will not however, pass any information onto any
				person not responsible for part of your travel arrangements. This applies to any sensitive information that you give to
				us such as details of any disabilities, or dietary/religious requirements. (If we cannot pass this information to the
				relevant suppliers, whether in the EEA or not, we cannot provide your booking. In making this booking, you consent
				to this information being passed on to the relevant persons.)

Usually your tour operator or other principal will pass this information onto their suppliers once we have provided it to
				them. The tour operator or other principal's use of your information is subject to their policy, both in respect of your
				booking and any future marketing, and is their responsibility. Please ask either us or them for a copy of this if you
				would like to see it.

CREDIT & DEBIT CARD DETAILS

All credit card information and personal information is encrypted as it is passed between your browser and our
				website. When you make a booking your initial payment is cleared using the information you provide. Your credit
				card number is not held in our database. All encryption is performed using at least 128 bits making it virtually
				impossible to decrypt without the necessary decryption key.

MONITORING

To ensure that we carry out your instructions accurately, to help improve our service and in the interest of security,
				we may monitor and/or record: (1) your telephone calls; (2) customer activities using CCTV recording equipment in
				and around our premises; and (3) customer transactions and activities on our website. All recordings are and shall
				remain our sole property.

OTHER WEBSITES

Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you have used
				these links to leave our site you should note that we do not have any control over that other web site. Therefore, we
				cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites
				and such sites are not governed by this Privacy Statement. You should exercise caution and look at the Privacy
				Statement applicable to the website in question.

WHAT CAN I DO?

You are entitled to a copy of your information held by us. If you would like to see this please ask us. [We may make a
				small charge for providing this to you].

If you do not agree to our use of the information as set out above, you should inform us as soon as possible by
				writing to us at loveholidays, The Triangle, 4th Floor South Side, 5-17 Hammersmith Grove, London, W6 0LG.

In accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, you may ask us in writing for a copy of the information we hold
				about you (for which we may charge an administration fee) and to correct any inaccuracies in your information. We
				aim to respond to you within 21 days from the date of request.

You can also choose not to provide us with some of the information we request, however as a result we may not be
				able to complete your booking.

OPT-OUT POLICY

Subscribers can opt out of receiving further information from us at any time. You will also be given a fast and easy
				option of opting out on all communications.

				cookies, reject cookies, or notify the visitor each time a cookie is sent. You may elect to reject cookies by adjusting
				your browser's settings, but doing so will limit the range of features available to the visitor on our site and most other
				major websites that use cookies.

				often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor.
				All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how a
				website works.

Category 3: Functionality Cookies

				for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).

				and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising
				cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.
