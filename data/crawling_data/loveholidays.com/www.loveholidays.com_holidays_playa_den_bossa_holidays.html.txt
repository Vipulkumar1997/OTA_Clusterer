Top Attractions






On the face of it, a trip to Ibiza might seem like it’s all about dusk ‘till dawn partying, but that’s certainly not the case. With a rich and varied selection of things to see and do, Playa d’en Bossa and its surrounding areas cater to a wide range of interests. Take Aguamar waterpark for example, with its array of white-knuckle flumes, beginner’s rides, splash pools and picnic areas tailor-made for fun-filled family days out.

Ibiza Town, also known as Eivissa, is a hotspot for culture and heritage and boasts a quaint little harbour that’s just waiting to be explored. Take a walk through the Old Town’s cobbled streets and stop off for a glass of island wine and plate of local stew as you watch the world go by. Check out the Old Market, open on Saturdays and selling local foodstuffs including wine, olive oil, herbs and cheese. For a spot of local culture, check out the contemporary museum of art, and finally, climb Carretera Nargiso Puget, from where you can enjoy stunning views of the harbour below.

Ibiza’s nightspots are an attraction in themselves, so be sure to book ahead to experience the hedonistic beats at the likes of Space, Pacha and Amnesia.

Wine and Dine






Sure, you’ll find no shortage of san miguel and sangria in the beachfront bars on your Playa d’en Bossa holidays, but delve a little deeper into the hidden backstreets and there’s an incredible culinary scene waiting for you. Take the short journey north along the coast to Ibiza Town. You could go for lunch at somewhere like La Cava, which specialises in intriguing tapas such as quail eggs and sautéed potatoes. Sa Punta does a roaring trade in suckling pig, and to get a real taste for Ibizan wine head to Vino & Co where 80% of the produce is local.

For a pre-club meal the likes of Moorea Grill on the beachfront back in Playa d’en Bossa will do just the trick, with hearty sharing bowls of paella served up by the friendly owners. And of course you’ll never struggle to find a good English breakfast, burger or other international cuisine here, particularly in the more tourist-led resorts.

For Families






Aside from the party scene, Playa d’en Bossa is also well known for its array of family-friendly activities, with loads of stuff for kids to do. Aguamar waterpark is sure to put a smile on the faces of kids, and adults for that matter, whilst an assortment of pedalos, banana boats and water skis down at the beach should keep the whole family sufficiently entertained. Venture a little outside of Playa d’en Bossa and discover the delights of Ibiza, such as the tourist trains that will transport you around the north’s hidden delights. Go snorkelling together at Cala Bassa, where you’ll be enchanted by the colourful marine life that lies below the surface.

Cova de Can Marca is the island’s largest cave system once used by smugglers. Today they feature light shows, waterfalls and guided tours. The hike up to the cave’s entrance is pretty spectacular too and the whole family will love the spectacular views from the top.

Action and Adventure






Fear not adrenaline junkies, for there is plenty to get excited about during a holiday in Playa d’en Bossa and its surrounding areas. Activities such as jet skiing, wind surfing, scuba diving, treetop adventure courses and even hover board excursions are on offer here, so there’s certainly no shortage of thrills and spills to be had. Families and couples alike will love hiring kayaks to meander down the coast and explore all the  secluded beaches and coves. Particularly adventurous travellers will relish going on off-road tours, parasailing from great heights and cliff diving into the deep blue ocean below. If that’s not enough, you can also hire mountain bikes, go on hiking trails and get involved with the beach rugby festival that takes place in San Antonio every year. So, if you don’t plan on nursing a terrible hangover every day, then this island has plenty of wholesome activities to offer you.

Life's a Beach






The beats are always big on Playa d’en Bossa holidays. The same can be said for a day at the beach here. Cocktail bars lining the shore play party anthems all day (and all night) long, however if you want to get away from it all then head a little further along the beach and discover the miniature railway and water sports hire outlets. Or of course you could just pull up a sun lounger, put on those shades and let all of life’s distractions float away. You could also take a stroll along to the watchtower at the end of the beach and enjoy the view of the glittering blue sea stretching out before you. A little further along you’ll find a small, secluded bay that the crowds often miss, perfect for a sunset swim.

Nightlife






Needless to say, the principle reason for visiting Ibiza is to experience its legendary nightlife. In Playa d’en Bossa you’re right in the heart of the action, a short hop from the nightspots of Ibiza Town and surrounded by beach bars that never sleep. Handily, many of these bars have their own clothing boutiques stocking the latest clubbing wares, so you’ll never have to worry about not looking party ready.

Pacha, Amnesia and Space are arguably the holy trinity of Ibizan clubbing, but with such big reputations come big price tags (€40-€80). Pre-booking is advised, as entry tends to be more expensive when paying on the door on the night. Drinks aren’t cheap once you hit the clubs either, so many people choose to have a few sundowners at the hotel or nearby bar before venturing in. Most of the clubs don’t close until well into the next day, so make sure you’re mentally prepared for a serious lack of sleep, as a consequence of a seriously fun holiday.

For Couples






There’s no doubt that a Playa d’en Bossa holiday will be enjoyed to the full by couples who like to let their hair down. However, the region also has an assortment of hidden coves, stylish hotels and rich history that ensures that the island makes a great destination for couples seeking a helping of authentic romance. Active couples will love to go walking or cycling in the spring and autumn, whereas food lovers will cherish the backstreet candlelit bodegas of Eivissa’s Old Town.

You could take a boat trip to Formentera, a small island several miles off the southern coast that boasts a selection of quiet beaches and windy roads that can be explored by moped or bicycle. Bob Dylan and Bob Marley both used to escape here to relax in their heyday, so why not go and discover why they thought it was so special.

Culture






The Fiesta de la Tierra, taking place in Ibiza Town each July and August, celebrates the patron saint of the island with traditional folk dancing, processions, horse drawn cart parades and special children’s events. It’s a great time for a holiday in Playa d’en Bossa with the family. Culture vultures will be able to immerse themselves in exhibitions, live music concerts and markets at the time of the festival.

On the more raucous side of things, there’s an annual series of music festivals that takes place in San Antonio every summer. Ibiza Rocks and its sun-drenched hotel pool plays host to a series of house and techno pool parties, and later this year it will see the likes of Royal Blood, Stormzy and Primal Scream gracing the stage to delight Ibiza’s most hardcore party animals.
