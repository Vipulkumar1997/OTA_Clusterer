and you’ll find plenty of
car parking
available.

The airport has services to more than
80 fabulous destinations across the UK, Europe and the rest of the world
. It’s just a short hop to wonderful sun-drenched holiday spots like
Alicante
, gateway to the

Costa Blanca
, and
Faro

Algarve
. You might fancy a city break to
Palma

Majorca
, or perhaps you’d like to tuck into tapas and soak up the Mediterranean views in
Barcelona
. If you’re looking for somewhere to take the kids, then the

beckon! Gorgeous beaches, plenty of nature, plus vibrant resorts packed with entertainment and attractions await. Or why not head to
Dalaman

How to get to Newcastle Airport

A very accessible regional airport, Newcastle International Airport lies in the heart of the North East and the A1 (the principal north/south road) leads directly to it while bypassing the city centre. If you have satellite navigation in your car, the postcode you will need to input is NE13 8BZ.

Getting to the airport by bus is very convenient as well as there are regular bus services connecting the airport with Newcastle, Killingworth, Hexham, Oakwood, etc.

However, your best bet when travelling to and from Newcastle Airport might just be the Metro. Tyne and Wear Metro is a light rail system with 60 stations serving Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland, North Tyneside and South Tyneside. A Metro station is located right in Newcastle Airport, making it incredibly easy to access the extensive railway network. Plus, a journey from Newcastle city centre (Haymarket, Monument or Central Station) to Newcastle Airport takes only around 25 minutes – with trains running as regularly as every 12 minute. If you are coming from somewhere else in the UK, the journey between Newcastle Central Station and the Airport also takes around 25 minutes. The station is quite big, running services to/from Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, York, Manchester, and many more. Benefiting from such a quick access to the railway network is what makes Newcastle Airport an increasingly popular option for travelling among people based in the North.
