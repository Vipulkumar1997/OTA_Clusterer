Agency Terms & Conditions


Introduction:

Loveholidays is a trading name of We Love Holidays Ltd, with registered office at 4th Floor The Triangle, 5-17 Hammersmith Grove, Hammersmith, London, W6 0LG (“we”, “us” or “our”). References to “you” and “your” in these terms means you, the customer and any other person in your party.

We act only as an agent or sub-agent in respect of all bookings we take and/or make on your behalf including but not limited to flights, hotels, and transfers (“Arrangement”). Your contract will therefore be with the individual service provider of the Arrangement in question who is the principal or the agent of the principal (the ‘Service Provider’) and their terms and conditions will also apply to your booking. When making your booking, our service is only to arrange for you to enter into a contract with the applicable Service Provider of the Arrangement.

As just an agent, we accept no liability in relation to any contract you enter into with the Service Provider(s), or for any services or arrangements you purchase, or for the acts or omissions of any other person(s) or party(ies) connected with any Arrangement.

Your booking through us (either online or via telephone) is subject to these Agency Terms and Conditions and the specific booking conditions of the relevant Service Provider you have chosen to contract with - a list of these booking conditions can be found at the end of this document. You must
read both carefully and accept them in full prior to booking. The Service Provider’s terms and conditions (as well as any applicable international Conventions) may limit and/or exclude their liability to you. Copies of applicable conditions will be available to you prior to booking via our website and on
your request to us.

You may decide to make one or more booking through us at the same time. The price charged in total for more than one booking will always equal the prices charged separately for each individual booking. All Arrangements are available to be purchased separately at the same price as they are when more than one booking is made. This means that any multiple bookings do not constitute a package as defined in the Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992 but may constitute a ‘Flight-Plus’ for the purposes of the Civil Aviation (Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing) Regulations 2012 and protected by our Air Travel Organiser Licence (“ATOL”) number
10989
.

In any instance, where multiple bookings are made, they shall not constitute a “group” booking. Unless bookings are all made under the same booking reference, they will be treated independently (i.e. as separate individual bookings).

Any references to ‘package’ and ‘package holidays’ on our website, marketing materials or in these Agency Terms & Conditions refers only to the package holidays organised by third party Service Providers on whose behalf we act as an agent. We do not organise or sell package holidays in our own name and we are not an ‘organiser’ or tour operator.

By making a booking with us, you agree that:



you have read all the terms and conditions set out on this webpage and agree to be bound by them;

you consent to our use of your information in accordance with our
Privacy Policy
; and

you are over 18 years of age, and where placing an order for services with age restrictions, you declare that you and members of your party are of the appropriate age of purchase those services.


1. Booking and payment

When you request to book an Arrangement, you guarantee that you have the authority to accept and do accept on behalf of your party these Agency Terms & Conditions and any applicable Service Provider’s booking conditions. In order to confirm your chosen Arrangement(s), you must pay a nonrefundable deposit or full payment as required by the Service Provider of the Arrangement in question. You must also pay all applicable insurance premiums, fees and charges. Your booking is confirmed and a contract between you and the Service Provider will only exist when we send you confirmation by e-mail on their behalf, which contains a valid Service Provider reference number (“Booking Confirmation”). Please check your Booking Confirmation carefully and report any incorrect or incomplete information to us immediately where we will try to assist you. Please ensure that names are exactly as stated in the relevant passport. As we act only as booking agent, we have no responsibility for any errors in any documentation except where an error is made by us.

If you chose to pay a deposit, you must pay the full balance by the Balance Due Date notified to you in the Booking Confirmation. Unless otherwise specified, we will automatically (if possible) take payment from the same debit/credit card used to pay your deposit. If full payment is not received (for whatever reason) by the Balance Due Date, we will notify the Service Provider who may cancel your booking and charge the cancellation fees set out in their booking conditions. If you have chosen the option to spread the cost of your booking(s), all instalments must be paid by the date specified at the time of making the booking. In the event of non-payment, the booking(s) may be cancelled – please refer to the cancellation policy. It is always your responsibility to ensure your balance is paid by the Balance Due Date

We accept payment by debit/credit card (Delta, Switch/Maestro, MasterCard, Visa and American Express) and PayPal. Applicable charges/fees will be displayed to you at the time of payment.

Cards are accepted subject to security and fraud checks and we reserve the right to cancel your Arrangement(s) should your booking request fail any element of these checks. Debit cards issued outside of the UK will be processed as credit cards, and subject to credit card fees. Your bank or card issuer may also apply an additional foreign transaction fee.

Please note that booking requests can take up to 72 hours to process. A booking is only confirmed when we send you a Booking Confirmation with a valid booking reference number for each Arrangement. On rare occasions, we will be unable to confirm a booking, for example if the payment fails. In the unlikely event this occurs, our team will attempt to rebook the affected Arrangement at the same price. If this is not possible, for example because the payment is blocked or there has been a change in the price or availability of the booking, we will contact you via telephone or e-mail to discuss next steps. Unfortunately, there are times when the cost will have increased during this period of time. Any cost increases will need to be paid by you, as per your contract with each Service Provider.

Any money paid to us in respect of a booking covered by a third-party ATOL Holder, is held by us on behalf of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust at all times, but subject to our obligation to pay it to the ATOL Holder for so long as the ATOL Holder does not fail financially. If the ATOL Holder does fail financially, any money held at that time by us or subsequently accepted from you by us, is and continues to be held by us on behalf of and for the benefit of the Trustees of the Air Travel Trust without any obligation to pay that money to the ATOL Holder. See clause 20 for more details on Flight-Plus bookings.


2. Prices & Pricing Errors

We and each Service Provider reserve the right to amend advertised prices at any time.

We endeavour to ensure that all pricing and other information on the website is accurate. However, it is always possible that despite our efforts there may be times when obvious errors occur such as the price or some other detail displayed being incorrect. We will normally check prices before confirming your booking so that, where the booking's correct price at your booking date is less than our stated price at your booking date, we will charge the lower amount. If the booking's correct price at your booking date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you by telephone or e-mail for your instructions before we confirm your booking.

If we confirm and process your booking where a pricing or other error is obvious and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mistake, we may terminate the contract and refund you any sums you have paid us.


3. Low deposit/ Pay Monthly Payment Options

A Service Provider may in some instances offer low deposit and instalment plan options for payment of your booking and the full details will be displayed, including payment dates, at the time of booking.


Low Deposits:
The initial low deposit is due per person and will be shown at the time of booking. Depending on the Arrangement(s) you choose, we will attempt to take the outstanding second deposit automatically from the same credit/debit card used to pay the initial deposit and you will be informed of the due date before booking. In the event of cancellation before the due date of the second deposit, you will still remain liable for the full deposit amount (i.e. both the first and second deposit).


Pay Monthly:
Where you opt for the monthly payment plan, after payment of the deposit, we will attempt to take the remaining balance in monthly instalments with the final payment being taken on the date specified in your Booking Confirmation before your departure. In the event of cancellation after the second instalment, we/the Service Providers reserve the right to keep all payments made by you to date to cover administration charges.

We will attempt to take all payments automatically from the same credit/debit card used to pay the initial deposit. If you need to arrange for the remainder of the instalments to be collected from a different card, please notify us at
collections@loveholidays.com
at least five working days before the due date to avoid payment being collected from the original card.

Although we will attempt to take payments automatically where possible, it remains your responsibility to ensure all payments are received by us and the full balance is paid by the date specified in your Booking Confirmation prior to your departure.

Payment options are subject to availability and we reserve the right to end any such offers at any time without prior notice or explanaiton.


4. Online Content

We take all practical steps possible to ensure that the details displayed on the website are accurate and up-to-date, but we do rely upon the information given to us by the Service Provider(s) and are intended to present a general idea of the services and facilities being offered. Sometimes – and particularly at the beginning and end of the season – certain facilities may be withdrawn for reasons such as maintenance, bad weather or lack of demand from guests or low occupancy. Some advertised  activities or facilities, for example water-sports, may not be available all year round. There may be local charges for some facilities, for example, TVs, safety deposit boxes, sun-loungers, parasols, spa access, tennis courts, pool tables and air-conditioning. Unless specifically confirmed in your room type or board basis, you must assume some, if not all facilities will be payable locally. If your Service Providers advise us about significant changes to descriptions or about the withdrawal of any significant facility, we will endeavour to pass this information to you. Any complaints about services or facilities should be directed to the relevant Service Provider.

Transfer times quoted by the Service Provider for travel between airport and resort are approximate and, depending on circumstances, the journey time to your own chosen destination may be longer. It is your responsibility to notify the transfer Service Provider of any delays in other travel arrangements, such as flights, and the transfer provider reserves the right to alter or cancel the service as per their terms and conditions in these circumstances.


5. Flights

When booking a flight, we will act as your booking agent (except when booking through one of the Service Providers listed in section 23 below) on terms specified by you. In relation to such bookings, you appoint us to source those flights on your behalf and you are our principal. We will arrange for you to enter into a contract directly with the airline concerned and you will be subject to their terms and conditions which you must refer to on the relevant airline's website. You are advised to read these carefully prior to requesting us to book your flight. By making a booking for which we are acting as your agent, you specifically agree to the terms of this clause. We accept no liability in relation to any contract you enter into with the airline, or their acts or omissions, or for the flight service itself.

The airline will provide a booking confirmation directly to you by e-mail and we will be unable to access or alter your booking. As such, any amendments to your booking must be made by you, directly with them. We will issue a confirmation invoice that details our charges for the use of this booking service
(if any).

Monies paid to us for such flight services are held by us on your behalf until they are paid to the airline in question. Please note that payment by you to us does not constitute payment to the airline and if we collect monies from the airline on your behalf, theirliability to pay that money to you is discharged. However, you will receive an ATOL certificate to protect any payment you do make for the flight service.

For some other airlines, we act as an agent for the Service Provider and your Service Provider will issue you an ATOL certificate.


Charter flights:
When you book your charter flight through us, we act as agent for the charter flight provider who holds an ATOL. The contract will be between you and the charter flight provider based upon their terms and conditions; a copy of which will be available to you prior to booking and is available on request.
In all other cases, we act as an agent for the relevant Service Provider in booking your flight service(s).


Operating Carrier Information:
: In accordance with EU directive (EC) no. 2111/2005, Article 9, we are required to bring to your attention the existence of a 'Community list' which contains details of air carriers that are subject to an operating ban within the EU Community. The Community list is available for inspection at
http://ec.europa.eu/transport/modes/air/safety/air-ban/index_en.htm
. In accordance with EU Regulations we are required to advise you of the operating carrier(s) (or, if the operating carrier(s) is not known, the likely carrier(s)) that will operate your flight(s) at the time of booking. Where we are only able to inform you of the likely carrier(s) at the time of booking, we will inform you of the identity of the operating carrier(s) as soon as we become aware of this. Any change to the operating carrier(s) after your booking has been confirmed will be notified to you as soon as possible. Any change in the identity of the airline, flight timings and/or aircraft type will not entitle you to cancel or change to other flight arrangements without paying charges, except where specified.

Flight times can change for a number of different reasons. You should always look to reconfirm your flights 48 hours prior departure to ensure that no changes to your flight schedule has occurred.


6.	Data Protection

By making a booking with us you agree to the use and disclosure of the information you provide for the following purposes: to enable us to process your booking (when it may be transferred abroad and/or to the Service Provider), if you purchase insurance we may process your information and pass it to insurers, for market research and analysis, to avoid fraud and to enable us or our representatives to contact you by letter, telephone or e-mail.

You may unsubscribe from further contact at any time by clicking on the relevant link in any emails we send you.


7.	Final Travel Arrangement

Please ensure that all your travel, passport, visa and insurance documents are in order and that you arrive in plenty of time for checking in at the airport. You must reconfirm your flight details within 48 hours of departure by checking your airline's website for any travel updates, including any possible
schedule changes or cancellations. If your flight time has changed, please ensure you travel to the  airport with enough time to accommodate this change, and if you have transfers booked you notify your Service Provider(s) of these changes. We accept no liability in regard to flight schedule changes as these are managed solely by your relevant Service Provider or airline who in turn only accept liability for any schedule changes or cancellations in line with their specific booking terms and conditions.


8.    Amendments by you

Any amendment to your Arrangements will incur an administration charge of £75 per booking plus any charges from the Service Provider.

These charges include but are not limited to:



Change of destination

Change of hotel

Change of name


If you wish to make an amendment to your booking
please click
here
to submit your request through 'Manage My Booking' or call us on 01903 258 288 (Monday to Sunday, 9am to 5pm). Please note that any changes to any element of your confirmed booking(s) will incur charges as stated above even if this is for example one letter in a name. Amendments can only be accepted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Service Provider(s) of your Arrangement(s). The Service Provider may charge amendment charges which may be as much as 100% of the cost of the Arrangement and will normally increase closer to the date of departure.
Whilst we will try to assist, we cannot guarantee that such requests to make changes can or will be met.

At the time of booking you may have the option to select rooms or services which are available at a special rate as they are non-refundable, non-changeable and/or non-transferable from point of sale. This means that from the time the booking is confirmed, no amendments whatsoever (including
names, dates and duration) can be made and the only option available is to cancel. Cancellations of this room type may be charged a 100% cancellation fee by the Service Provider. These rooms are advertised as “Non-Refundable” and require full payment at time of booking.

Amendment charges are subject to change at any time. Please note that amendment fees are nonrefundable and can only be requested by the lead passenger on the booking.



9. Cancellations by you

In the event that you cancel your booking, and the deposit you have paid does not cover the cancellation charges set out in this paragraph (e.g. because you have chosen a low deposit option), you must pay any difference between the amount you have paid and the cancellation charge applied. In accepting these Agency Terms & Conditions you give your authority for us to automatically charge the payment card used by you when securing the booking (or any other card used by you in connection with this booking) at that time.
Any cancellation will incur a cancellation processing fee of £75 per booking plus any charges from the Service Provider(s). Please note that any credit card transaction fees are non-refundable::


Flight:
100% of the full booking value of the flights (including baggage, insurance).

Accommodation:
Cancellation charge will depend on whether you have booked a refundable or a nonrefundable product. Cancellation charges will be specified to you at the time of booking and vary from one Service Provider to another. You should check your Booking Confirmation and any documentation for details of your specific cancellation terms.
Non-Refundable products must be paid for in full at the time of booking and no refunds are given in the event of cancellation as per section 8 above.
Transfers:

Tour Operator holidays:
If you cancel your booking you will have to pay the tour operator's cancellation charges detailed in the tour operator's conditions.
