With stunning golden sands that stretch for 12 kilometres, Lara Beach boasts crystalline blue waters and
Mediterranean
temperatures that rise to 35°C degrees during the summer season. Found just outside Antalya in the south-west of
Turkey
, Lara Beach promises holidaymakers a sun kissed getaway that everyone can enjoy.

As Lara’s climate is very warm, and rain is rare, it is a popular spot for sun-worshippers. It has been designated a Blue Flag beach and has various amenities for sun bathers like parasols and loungers, as well as stylish beach bars serving cocktails and snacks for when you need to re-fuel.

Known as Turkey’s
Las Vegas
, the picture-perfect beach resort offers glamorous hotels that are modelled on world-famous landmarks and sit along the golden ribbon of sand. During the day, the glitzy hotel complexes provide brilliant shopping, transforming into nightlife hotspots with exciting restaurants and buzzing clubs by night.

Other than the year-round sunshine and pristine sands, Lara Beach is a shopaholic’s haven, filled with an array of boutiques, both inside the plush hotels and in bazaars in the town centre. From designer shopping outlets to traditional markets that sell locally made unique gifts, including jewellery, leather, cotton and pottery fare, there is something for every taste here. You can also find similar handmade crafts in the nearby city of
Antalya
.

Top Attractions






As well as an award winning beach and top notch shopping, Lara Beach has a brilliant selection of natural wonders on its doorstep.

An hour outside of Lara Beach is the Tahtali Aerial Cableway, also known as the Olympos Aerial Tram. As the longest cableway in Europe and the second largest in the world, the 4,350-metre-long cable car ascends over the Olympos-Beydağları National Park, to the snow-capped summit of Tahtali Mountain. At an amazing 2,365 metres above sea level, the incredible views from the 360 degree panorama at the upper station, at top of the mountain overlook the Mediterranean Sea and Taurus Mountain range.

Another great attraction, near to Lara Beach, is the creek of the Düden River. Over a 40 metre cliff, the mesmerising waterfalls can be reached by foot or you can take a boat trip that starts at Antalya harbour. This area is also home to a large park and caves.

As Lara Beach is only 12 kilometres from Antalya, a visit to the old town of Kaleici, is a must. Through the 2
nd
century Roman Hadrian’s Gate, down the well-preserved cobbled and winding streets that burst with character, you can explore the ruins that date back to the Roman, Byzantine, Seljuk, Ottoman and modern Turkish eras. To learn more about the area’s history, you can head to the seafront and the Antalya museum, which is packed with Greek and Roman relics.

Wine and Dine






The cuisine in Lara Beach is predominantly Turkish, however Italian and Mediterranean influences are common in some of the restaurants here.

During the day, if you are hitting the beach, then grab a bite at Sunset Snack to keep you going. Holidaymakers will also love the Jasmine Main Restaurant areas it is open all day and night.

Also on the seafront is the unique Yoruk Tent that is next to Lara Beach Hotel. Dine outdoors in the style of the Yoruks, a tribe of Turkish nomads, on the picnic-style tables. You will enjoy the stone-baked pizzas or gozleme, the savoury Turkish pancakes filled with local produce.

For some typical Turkish dishes, head to Big Chefs Café and Restaurant that has an array of delicious, local recipes and buffet-style breakfasts.

For Families






When you bring the family on holiday to Lara Beach, you can expect a great variety of attractions that suit all ages. If you’re looking for kid-friendly things to do in Lara Beach, a family favourite is the Troy Aquapark, which is about an hour away. Combining a fantastic selection of water slides, corkscrew chutes, lazy rivers and swimming pools for both adults and children, the water park will get your adrenaline going. During the summer months the Troy Dolphinarium, which is next door to the Aquapark, is open and features dolphin and sea lion shows.

Also in the Antalya area is the Antalya Aquarium and fairground, Aktur Lunapark. The city is also home to the Archaeological Museum and Antalya Zoo.

Lara Beach is blessed with a 10,000 metre beach of flat, soft golden sand that is complemented by the glittering, transparent waters of the Mediterranean Sea. This sunny retreat has calm and shallow waters making holidays to Lara Beach ideal for families with small children. The amenities at the beach are also family friendly, with sun loungers and parasols to soak up the sun and changing rooms and showers to wash off the sand at the end of the day.

Action and Adventure






A short car journey from Lara Beach are the Kunsunlu Waterfalls. Make sure you pack your walking shoes to reach the cascades, whilst you enjoy the shade and vantage points of the wonderful scenery and abundant pine forest. The path goes past shops where you can find some souvenirs, as well as a café for Turkish delights. You will also get chance to jump into the blue pools for a refreshing swim.

Take a trip to the ‘Little Falls’ on the Manavgat River, which is about an hour out of Lara Beach. A walk to the Selale Falls takes you past fast-flowing waters that crash down a ridge and lead to the Manavgat Waterfalls. From the viewing area, visitors can get their feet wet on the edge of the waterfall and if you stay until the evening you will see the falls illuminated in a magical way.

Just 30 minutes outside of Lara Beach is the wildly beautiful Koprulu National Park, home to a vast canyon that runs through it. Trekking through cypress and cedar trees, you will pass an ancient stone bridge. Along the river you can go camping or take part in various water sports, like white-water rafting.

Life's a Beach






The sparkling Mediterranean Sea, soft golden sands and plenty of sun loungers mean that you can truly chill out on Lara Beach. In a prime spot on the Turkish Riviera, the beach has been awarded the Blue Flag for its quality, so you can relax in comfort.

If you are looking for a little more excitement, then crystal clear water makes snorkelling and diving as well as jet-skiing and kayaking ideal off Lara Beach. The shallow shores also provide a safe environment for children to paddle and play in.

Away from the public parts of the beach, Lara Beach’s waterfront hotels have their own private areas of the beach, so you can unwind in peace with snacks and cocktails from the hotel beach bars.

Nightlife






Your holiday to Lara Beach isn’t complete without a night out. In the evening, the large strip of lavish hotels comes alive with nightlife and features a big line-up of entertainment including discos, quiz nights and shows.

If you are looking for something a bit more relaxed, the large collection of bars in Lara Beach also offers cocktails and chilled beers. Many of the bars and clubs are open until the early hours, with idyllic settings overlooking the water.

Salina Nightclub in Lara Beach is a great late night venue, playing host to well-known DJs and has table service and outdoor seating. Elsewhere, nearby Antalya has a great selection of night clubs, including Club Arma, the biggest outdoor disco in the area, offering live music from popular Turkish singers and bands, as well as great views of the harbour.

For Couples






From the luxurious hotels and beautiful scenery, to the stunning weather, holidays in Lara Beach are the perfect backdrop for couples.

You can escape to Lara’s quiet beach for a romantic stroll along the sandy and shingly beach and recline on a sun lounger whilst sipping a cocktail together from the beach bars.  If you want to get your heart pumping, join in a game of volleyball or rent a boat or catamaran to sail around the coast and witness the stunning views.

For more incredible views, visit Konyaalti Beach in Antalya to take in the views of the outstanding mountain scenery and the sweet smell of flower filled bushes that is sure to put you in an amorous mood.

Elsewhere, at the Sultan Bazaar, you can treat your other half to some handmade goods, designer brands and other high-quality products from over 70 stalls.

Culture






Lara Beach and the surrounding area is steeped in fantastic culture and ancient history.

The ancient Aspendos Amphitheatre is under an hour away from Lara Beach and was built for 8,000 spectators. Standing the test of time, the Roman Amphitheatre is still used today for ballet and opera productions. You can also take a guided tour, climbing to the top for incredible views.

The ancient city of Perge is also close to Lara Beach and was once an important city of ancient Parnphylia. The site is where most of the statues on display in Antalya Museum were excavated from. Within the Roman province is a stadium, Roman gate, nymphaeum, the Column Street, Roman bath, the State Agora and Hellenistic gate.

Another ancient city worth visiting is
Side
, an ancient Greek city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. Regarded as one of the best classical sites in the country, the old town is home to many archaeological relics including the Hellenistic Temple of Apollo by the harbour. A 2
nd
century theatre that once seated around 15,000 people also lies in ruins here.
