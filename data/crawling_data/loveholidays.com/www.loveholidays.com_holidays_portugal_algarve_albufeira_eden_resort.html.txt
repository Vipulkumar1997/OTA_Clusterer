The 4-star superior Eden Resort is a relaxing village complex for families and couples. Combining traditional Portuguese architecture with modern interiors and lush tropical gardens, the hotel is located on 11 hectares of green areas and leisure in the central Algarve, just five minutes away from stunning sandy beaches.

With recognition of quality by the Portuguese tourism authorities, Eden Resort has a low density build of only 20% with a great choice of holiday homes varying from one-bedroom apartments to four-bedroom villas, all offering modern facilities for a comfortable stay. All are finished to high specifications with ensuite bathrooms, well-tended gardens, terraces or balconies, televisions, fully-equipped kitchens and air-conditioning. Eden Resort also features several technological innovations, such as intelligent climate control system, powered by solar panels, and has been awarded the Oscar for Energy Efficiency.

Guests at Eden Resort can relax by one of the hotel’s three outdoor swimming pools, or take the hotel’s complimentary shuttle bus to the beautiful beach and soak up the famed Algarve sunshine. For some serious pampering, take advantage of the hotel’s spa and wellness centre, complete with indulgent treatments, a sauna and Turkish bath. If travelling as a family, the hotel also offers two outdoor children's pools and a kids’ club to keep the children occupied and an entertainment program during high season. There's a new indoor pool at the Eden Resort, which is heated, and provides access to a sauna, Turkish bath and 3 treatment cabins. A use of swimming cap is mandatory.

For delicious cuisine, look no further than Eden’s Resort buffet-restaurant, Pecado. Serving international and local fare, the restaurant is bound to keep tastebuds happy. There’s also a snack-bar by the swimming pool and the Apple Bar with a stunning panoramic terrace, serving refreshing beverages with seasonal entertainment.

Eden Resort is ideally situated to explore all that Albufeira has to offer, with a shuttle bus available to take guests to Albufeira’s old town. Guests can also enjoy outdoor pursuits with bicycle rental and walking areas available from the hotel.

I saw on the Eden Resort website that there is free wifi on resort, but then saw a conflicting question/answer on here.  Can somebody please confirm either way as we have 3 boys who rely on wifi as their lifeblood!

1 Answer













Hiya,

Wi Fi signal definitely varies throughout the day to coincide with peak teams/not peak times, but there is free WiFi in the lounge and access to the same free WiFI in the rooms through the Smart Television. (Please note: the TV has to be turned on to have access to the WiFi, we also recommend booking a downstairs room as the WiFi has an apparently stronger signal in the lower rooms.)

Thanks very much.
