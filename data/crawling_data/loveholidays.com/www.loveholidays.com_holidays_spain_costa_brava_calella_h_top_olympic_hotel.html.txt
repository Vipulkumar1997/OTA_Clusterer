Based in the quiet residential area of the resort town of Calella in Costa Brava, the H.TOP Olympic Hotel combines the benefits of a convenient location with lovely 3-star services and affordable accommodation. Just around 500m away from local beaches and situated at the centre of the resort, the hotel allows you an easy access to everything you might need for your summer vacation – fine sands, crystal clear waters, vibrant restaurants and an array of shops, everything is at your doorsteps.

However, the hotel in itself is quite comfortable, making for the perfect retreat after a long day spent soaking up the sunrays. There are 519 modern rooms, each of them in soft pastel colours and fitted with a private furnished balcony or terrace, air-conditioning/heating (depending on season), private bathroom with bathtub/shower, satellite TV, direct dial telephone, safe box and Wifi (surcharge). An ideal option for families, some of the twin rooms sleep 2 adults with 2 children.

There are 3 swimming pools on site to choose from – spend your days blissfully relaxing by them and your nights taking part in the fun evening entertainment. For the little ones, there is a separate children’s pool as well as a playground and a Mini Club with fun organised daily games and activities. Kids will also enjoy exploring the resort on board of the mini train that circles Calella during the summer months (conveniently stopping right in front of the hotel, this is a great option to get to know the area). This will also make it easier for you to choose where to grab a bite, or which beach bar to have a drink at.

So, for a great affordable option for your next stay at Costa Brava, consider the lovely H.TOP Olympic hotel that offers all the advantages of a central location, minus the huge price tag.

Please note:
There is currently off-site building works close to, but not within this hotel complex. The hotel will try it’s best to limit disruption, but has minimal control over the work itself. We have yet to receive notification on when the construction will be completed.

Answer








How much is the tax for stying here in Barcelona?

1 Answer













Please note we cannot guarantee tourist tax rates as they are subject to change. However we predict that for guests over 16 years of age the tax on a 3 star hotel will be up to 1 Euro per night and only valid for up to 7 nights (after which the tax is dropped). Therefore the maximum tax payable should be 7 Euros per person.
