Top Attractions






Tenerife is home to some of the world's finest holiday resorts. Costa Adeje is a resort with so much sway that holidaymakers will often choose Tenerife over its Canarian competitors like Fuerteventura and Lanzarote to experience some of the magic that makes
Costa Adeje
. Other popular resorts include
Playa de las Americas
,
Puerto de la Cruz
and
Los Cristianos
.

Most visitors come for Tenerife's fabulous beaches and resorts, but Tenerife, a UNESCO biosphere reserve, has much more to offer. Its biggest attraction is Spain's largest peak,
Mount Teide
, is a 3,718-metre active volcano which is the focal point of a huge national park. A cable car sways up to the summit in just ten minutes, offering spectacular panoramic views over all of Tenerife.

Tenerife also boasts two of Europe's biggest and most exciting theme parks,
Siam Park
in Costa Adeje, and in
Loro Park
in
Puerto de la Cruz
, you can watch dolphin shows and see an enormous collection of parrots. Holidays to Tenerife are perfect for family holidays.

Dolphins and whales
congregate in the waters around the southern part of Tenerife, and you can take boat tours out from
Los Cristianos
to see these wonderful creatures in their natural habitat. The crystal clear waters are also ideal for
snorkelling and diving
, with myriad aquatic creatures to admire beneath the depths, also available out of Los Cristianos.

Wine and Dine






As you'd expect from a popular international holiday destination, Tenerife offers every imaginable cuisine at prices to suit all budgets, and you'll be spoilt for choice when it comes to eating out. Many of the resorts boast a range of fantastic restaurants, with the capital
Santa Cruz
at the heart. Don't miss the chance to sample the island's unique Canarian cuisine, which has been influenced by Spain, Africa and the Caribbean over the centuries.

There are lots of Canarian seafood restaurants to check out in the biggest seaside resorts, including
Costa Adeje
, Puerto de la Cruz and Los Cristianos. Seafood, of course, features prominently on local menus, particularly parrot fish, sunfish and tuna. These are served with the famous
Canarian
mojo
sauce
: the mild green
mojo
is made with coriander, while the red
mojo
is more piquant.

Other classic dishes include
puchero Canario
, a delicious broth made with corn, vegetables and meat, or the succulent fish stew
cazuela de pescado
, both of which are thickened with
gofio
, a versatile cereal that finds its way into many recipes.

To finish up, try the
frangollo
, a light dessert made with milk, lemon, almonds and cinnamon. While you're on Tenerife, don't pass up the opportunity to try the
local cheeses
, typically made with sheep or goat's milk, which are creamy, flavourful and utterly delicious.

For Families






Tenerife is a hugely popular destination for family holidays, with plenty to do for kids young and old. Some of the top choices for family-friend holiday resorts include
Costa Adeje
,
Los Cristianos
and the hugely popular
Puerto de la Cruz
, all home to excellent international hotels.
Beaches
are usually the focal point of most family holidays, and Tenerife has got long, shallow beaches ideal for younger kids, plus sports beaches where teenagers can try kite surfing or diving.

The cable car up
Mount Teide
is a top attraction for all the family, and no one can fail to have fun at the spectacular
Siam Park
theme park in
Costa Adeje
, which has everything from a lazy river through lush tropical forest to the terrifying "Tower of Power" slide which propels you through a tank of sharks and rays.

There are
karting tracks
near bigger resorts like
Playa de las Americas
and dolphin-mad kids will love the boat cruises, where sightings of
dolphins and whales
are guaranteed. There are
glass-bottomed boat tours
and even
submarine tours
, as well as
camel rides
and
treetop adventure parks
with zip lines. The fabulous
Lago Martiánez
pool complex in Puerto de la Cruz was designed by artist César Manrique, and is a large seawater lagoon dotted with islands.

Action and Adventure






There’s no shortage of adrenaline rushes to be had on a Tenerife holiday. Be it quad biking, water skiing, taking a
jeep safari
,
hiking
up a mountain or even
paintballing
, thrill-seekers really are spoilt for choice here at a range of resorts. Many of the coastal resorts, especially the main attractions of
Puerto de la Cruz
and Santa Cruz, offer watersports galore.

You can take a three-hour quad safari from
Playa de las Americas
up into the mountains behind, or for a real taste of the wilderness on offer in central Tenerife, take an open-top jeep through the
Teide national park
ending up at the mountain’s summit, from where you can enjoy sweeping views.

For something a little different on holidays to Tenerife how about dinner at
Castillo San Miguel
in
Garachico
, which hosts regular jousting and battle events between knights in shining armour.

Life's a Beach






Famed for its natural volcanic sands, particularly in the quieter northern part of the island, Tenerife is home to some truly unique beaches and beach resorts. Just as an example, the
Playa Jardín
('Garden Beach') in
Puerto de la Cruz
was designed by César Manrique, the Canarian artist and architect, and is flanked by beautiful botanic gardens.

The
Playa de la Teresitas
in Santa Cruz is a picture-postcard stretch of golden sand, shaded by palm trees and blessed with a dramatic mountainous backdrop. Wilder beaches that are worth the hike on Tenerife include
La Tejita
, near
El Médano
, and the gorgeous black sand curve of
El Bollullo
, a half-hour walk through banana plantations from Puerto de la Cruz.

The south of Tenerife boasts long, family-friendly beaches at
Costa Adeje
, and the lively
Playa las Vistas
in Los Cristianos, which is lined with bars and restaurants.


Read More about Life's a Beach





Nightlife






The best-known resort for nightlife in Tenerife is
Playa de las Americas
, closely followed by
Los Cristianos
, which both have scores of bars and clubs to keep you going until dawn. You'll find everything from Irish theme pubs to some of Tenerife's most glamorous beach clubs. Holidays to Tenerife are buzzing affairs.

Costa Adeje
has plenty of chic cocktail bars and restaurants that cater to a dressier crowd, and also hosts the fantastic 'I Love Music Festival' (usually held in April) which features big-name bands and DJs. Costa Adeje is definitely quieter than its neighbour,
Playa de Las Americas
, making Costa Adeje a good spot to visit for family holidays.

If you want to party with the locals, head to Puerto de la Cruz, the university town of
La Laguna
or the Tenerife capital of
Santa Cruz
, but don't expect the bars to get going until gone midnight which is standard Canarian style.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






Tenerife is a wonderful holiday destination for
couples holidays
, whether you're looking for tranquility and relaxation or an exciting experience with plenty of eating, drinking and dancing.
Costa Adeje
, with its miles of golden beaches, is ideal for couples. Costa Adeje also offers plenty of
chic restaurants, bars and clubs
where you can wine and dine in glamorous surroundings.

You could take a romantic night-time tour to the Teide National Park to go
star-gazing
, or linger over cocktails at a stylish
beach club
with DJs in Playa de Las Americas.
Watch the sunset
from a secluded beach like Benijo in
Santa Cruz
, and then tour the charming Canarian tapas bars.

If you're adventurous types, you could make the hike from the lovely hilltop town of
Masca
, through a gorge to a remote beach, from where a boat will bring you back via the impressive cliffs known as Los Gegantes ('the giants').

Culture






The island of Tenerife is rich in history and culture, and all of Tenerife has been designated a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO for its unique landscape. Explore the historic city of
La Laguna
, established in the 16th century, which is filled with remarkable buildings, including the cathedral and the opulent Magistrate's Residence (now the city hall). Among its museums are the fascinating
Museum of the History of Tenerife
and the modern
Museum of Science and the Cosmos
.

Little survives of the Guanche culture, who inhabited Tenerife before its conquest, but you can visit the Cave of the Guanches, near
Icod de
los
Vinos
, which was once part of a small village that was settled around the 6th century BC. The Guanche culture lives on in the local cuisine and in the traditional games and sports (such as stone throwing, battles with staves and cart-pulling) that still take place in the island's villages.

Tenerife is now a major cultural centre, and its current capital,
Santa Cruz
, is home to the
Auditorio de Tenerife
, which was designed by starchitect Santiago Calatrava and inspired by the Sydney Opera House. It hosts an excellent programme of music, opera, theatre and dance. Santa Cruz also boasts the
Tenerife Espacio de Las Artes (TEA)
, which puts on regular top-class art exhibitions.
