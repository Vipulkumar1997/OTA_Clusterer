A superb 5-star retreat surrounded by splendid gardens and overlooked by the imposing Atlas Mountains, Eden Andalou Aquapark & Spa is ideal for a getaway to Morocco. Just 3 miles from the central square of Djemaa el Fna, the Eden Andalou offers the perfect balance between Marrakech’s vibrancy and luxurious isolation.

This charming 5-star resort hypnotizes with its beautiful design that draws inspiration from 10
th
century palaces. The most striking elements are the two superb lounges with carved stucco Domes, intricate zellij patterns, white marble and bohemian crystal that make a breath-taking ensemble. The hotel’s lavishly decorated guestrooms are spread over 6 riads built around lush courtyards replete with aromatic flowers and shimmering fountains.

The hotel’s facilities make for a truly relaxing 5-star experience! There are several outdoor pools including a white large pool lined with its beach with teak wood and a Majorelle pool (heated during winter and suitable for all ages!). You’ll love the indoor swimming pool, spa and wellness centre complete with Turkish baths, hot tub and massages. If you’re travelling with children they’ll love the dedicated area with a mini club. If that's not enough, there is always the huge Aquapark offering 19 attractions and slides (space hole, Boumerang, Caribbean aqua house, multislides, Zebra, lazy river…) open all year long! All inclusive includes access to this water park, but you will have to purchase drink and food in the Aquapark.

And when it’s time to eat, the Eden Andalou Aquapark & Spa has two restaurants offering a choice of Mediterranean, Moroccan and International cuisine – perfect whether you’re travelling with an adventurous foodie or fussy little ones. Later in the evening head over to the Jazz Bar for a sparkling atmosphere, delicious drinks and the perfect backdrop to your evenings.

If you’re looking to explore the local area, the hotel also provides free transportation to Djemma el Fna. One of Marrakech’s prime attractions, the
central square makes for a mesmerizing mix of aromas and movement. As the day progresses, the entertainment changes, and the snake charmers make room for dancers, storytellers, magicians and food stalls with hypnotizing aromas.

Whether you are planning your next holiday for a special occasion or simply looking for a last minute getaway, let loveholidays.com help you find the perfect hotel. Book your holiday online today and save!

Please note: Local Tax to be paid on the spot 35 MAD per person per night.

Answer








May I know what is the difference with the full board and all inclusive formula? Does it include airport transfer?

1 Answer













Hi Dani, Full board would include your 3 main meals, (breakfast, lunch and dinner). All-inclusive is another board option that tends to include a few extras over the full board option. This would usually mean drinks from the bar outside of meals and can sometimes include certain uses of hotel facilities. This is more down to the hoteliers discretion. Transfers are not included with this option.
