Home to Morocco’s biggest waterpark, the 5-star Labranda Aqua Fun (ex. Aqua Fun Club Hotel) is the ideal destination for a relaxing getaway with plenty of fun in the sun. Just a short distance from vibrant Marrakech, the five-star hotel boasts 40 waterslides, five outdoor pools and first-class facilities.

Labranda Aqua Fun’s waterpark offers fun for all ages. With a network of 40 slides including the sky-high multilane racers and a wide chute that the whole gang can hurtle down together in a big rubber boat. There are 18 mega slides, plus 22 milder slides to keep younger kids busy.

It’s not just water slides that will keep you entertained – there are also five pools to swim in, a rafting river and a wave pool. For some relaxation, soak up the sun on the wide terraces or head to the hotel’s spa, offering a wide range of treatments including a sauna, massage and Turkish baths. For those looking for some action, the hotel also offers sports facilities including a fitness centre, tennis courts, mini golf and a mini football pitch. And if you want to cool off, the en-suite guest rooms are spacious with all the modern amenities you would expect of a hotel of its class, including air conditioning and satellite TV.

The Labranda Aqua Fun has a choice of dining and drinking options, with four restaurants serving quality Italian, Asian, Moroccan and Mediterranean cuisine. Bars and cafes include a shisha bar, espresso bar, and a piano bar. For some night time entertainment, enjoy the hotel’s vibrant nightclub or head into nearby Marrakech for traditional Moroccan food, international restaurants, bars and nightclubs.

Please note:
the hotel requires a marriage certificate for a couple to share a room.
