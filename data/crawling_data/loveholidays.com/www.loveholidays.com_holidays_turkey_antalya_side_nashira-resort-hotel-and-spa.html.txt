Nestled in a picturesque palm oasis on the coastal Titreyengol area of Turkey and boasting its very own private sandy beach, the 5-star Nashira Resort Hotel & Spa offers an idyllic setting for your perfect summer holiday.

Retreat after a long day back to your room, which offers the utmost comfort with tasteful copper and turquoise tones and features traditional Seljuk motifs. Each spacious room is equipped with air conditioning, a flat screen TV and room service, enabling lazy evenings after an inevitably busy day. Even the fussiest of eaters are well-catered for at the Nashira Resort Hotel & Spa, with a buffet restaurant, four a la carte options and many snack bars spread out over the resort.

Kids big and small will love the masses of water slides in Nashira’s thrilling waterpark (open til October), and can make a splash in its massive pool complex - definitely the best way to cool down from the brilliant Turkish sun! Sun-worshippers rejoice, there’s also plenty of opportunity to work on your tan at this hotel, with attractively furnished sun terraces complete with comfortable loungers to wistfully dedicate your day to. When you’ve spent up all your energy, just book for a massage or scrub in the hotel spa – they’re certain to invigorate any aches and revitalise your senses to last you throughout your entire break.

Ready to head outside the hotel grounds? Culture aficionados can explore the ancient sites just a short distance away in the old Greek city of Side, and nature lovers will adore the close mountainous town of Manavgat. Across both you can find the Mediterranean influence on cuisine, which tends to focus on locally-rendered seafood. There’s so much to discover in the province of Antalya, and you’ll be guaranteed the typically Turkish hospitality no matter where you go.

Feel free to head downstairs for some evening entertainment for all ages from the animation team, some live music or a show. Nights are also the perfect time to make the most of the leisure facilities at the hotel (including sports courts, table games and a cinema), or if you’re in the party mood, there’s always something going on at the beach. There’s a mini-club at Nashira to keep the kids occupied, so you needn’t worry about that

If you fancy yourself on a resort holiday on Turkey’s stunning shoreline, look no further than the awe-inspiring Nashira Resort Hotel & Spa. Book now with loveholidays.com and save!
