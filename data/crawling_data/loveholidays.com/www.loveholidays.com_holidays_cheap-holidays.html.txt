Spain






Benidorm
is just one of those iconic cheap holiday destinations. Some say it is
the
resort in Spain, especially if you've struck the Balearics off your list for 2018 / 2019. When the first skyscrapers started popping up along the coast of the
Costa Blanca
, decades ago, no one was quite sure just how much of an important figure this resort would become to the average British holidaymaker. Home to dozens of all-inclusive hotels, Benidorm beats off its Spanish rivals, such as
Alcudia
in Majorca, or
Salou
in the south of Spain, as the king of cheap all inclusive holidays.

Known as a cheap holiday destination with perfect, well-kept sands and a choice of hotels - varying from all inclusive hotel bargains to stunningly good deals on great self-catering accommodation -  choosing
Benidorm
in the
Costa Blanca
for your next resort holiday makes as much sense as the copious amounts of ice-cream you’ll inevitably be eating. Booking a 7-night stay in Benidorm is a super cheap holiday, and the price includes flights and all-inclusive: a no-brainer! Then you won't even have to worry about the cost of that ice-cream. Whilst you're on the Costa Blanca,
Alicante
is another top choice and not far from Benidorm. Flights to the Costa Blanca land in Alicante.

Another popular Costa in Spain is the
Costa Brava
, with Lloret de Mar as a fantastic holiday option for a 7-night stay. Just up the coast from Barcelona,
Lloret de Mar
provides amazing Mediterranean beaches, affordable resorts and a range of family-friendly hotels. The Costa Brava is home to
Barcelona
, so if you ever tire of Lloret de Mar's great atmosphere down on the Costa Brava - which is unlikely! - you could always plan a holiday to the Catalonian capital. Also on the Costa Dorada is
Salou
, a perfect family holiday destination.

Balearic Islands






A  holiday to the Balearics is a holiday classic and with deals on cheap holidays for 7 nights at an all-inclusive hotel in
Magaluf,
Majorca
(flights included!) how can you resist the allure of a getaway?

Majorca has some of the best seafronts and nightlife in the Balearics, and its sisters Menorca and Ibiza boast their own iconic flavours. Majorca is the most popular with all age groups, ideal for romantic holidays and all-inclusive family fun in the sun. One of the most popular resorts in the Balearics is on the north of the island, and with an epic beach, Alcudia is a hotspot for cheap
family holidays
and perfect for your 2019 adventure.

Or, you could take a peaceful stroll along rugged coastline in
Menorca
or stamp the sand all night at a beach party on
Ibiza
. Both Menorca and Ibiza offer some fantastic deals on all-inclusive hotels to keep those holidays costs low. Cheap flights and hotels equal Balearic holiday bargains and some of the best experiences of your life. What more could you want?

Find the best deals for you at any of the Balearic islands, you could try Majorca first for a late 2018 escape with deals on cheap flights, or take flights over to
Ibiza
in 2019. Both Majorca and Ibiza are available with incredible summer 2019 deals.

Malta's not one of the Balearics, but you should keep
Malta
in mind for an extra Mediterranean adventure or for a 2019 holiday. With such reasonable deals on flights and hotels, why not?

Portugal & The Algarve






Maybe the
Algarve
seems like a new contender in the 2018 or 2019 holidays pack, but she’s been around a lot longer than you think. This part of southern Portugal easily contends with other popular holiday destinations, such as the Balearics or the Costa Blanca.

Due to
Portugal’s
new status as a cheap destination packed full of beaches, culture and tasty food, the Algarve is exploding in popularity. A 7nt holiday to Albufeira is becoming more and more popular due to the low prices on flights and the year-round weather, perfect for a late 2018 getaway or planning ahead for summer 2019. We think the best way for you to figure out why so many people are visiting the Algarve is to visit for yourself!

Albufeira
is our go-to for a bustling Algarve experience. Blue flag beaches, reasonably priced hotels and a flight directly into neighbouring Faro, Albufeira is a must-visit for an affordable 2018 holiday. Albufeira also has some great deals on hotels and flights throughout the year, making it viable for 2018 or 2019.

The Algarve, a golden stretch of Portuguese coast, offers up any number of resorts to choose from, from
Vilamoura
to Praia da Rocha, and we’re sure we can find something exciting just for you. With plenty of deals on flights, cheap hotels and all-inclusive packages, why wait to book your 2018 or 2019 Algarve getaway?

Canary Islands






Tenerife
, Lanzarote, Fuerteventura and Gran Canaria. The golden 4 for 2018 or 2019 cheap holidays. These are the
Canary Islands
!

Another cheap holiday classic, the Canaries are a great alternative to their Mediterranean cousins, the Balearics. The Canaries boast excellent all-inclusive hotels and
Lanzarote
, especially, has a fantastic beachfront lifestyle, all available with deals on flights and accommodation for 7 night stays.

Tenerife is the largest of the Canaries and offers some of the best deals on hotels, flights and all-inclusive packages for a 7-night stay in 2019. Why not try out the brilliant
Costa Adeje
? The Costa Adeje is perfect for a couple or family holidays to the Canaries because of its luxurious hotels and fantastic beachfront lifestyle, plus the Costa Adeje overlaps with the popular resort of
Playa de Las Americas
.

Lanzarote is another firm Canaries favourite with tourists because of its extensive coastline and all-inclusive hotels. Both
Lanzarote
and Tenerife are volcanic islands and boast dramatic landscapes, cheap haunts and plenty of activities. But wait, don't forget
Fuerteventura
and the super popular resort of
Caleta de Fuste
. Caleta de Fuste, in true Canaries style, boasts excellent weather and fine beaches.

These Canaries are a staple of the British holiday and cater to any type of holidaymaker looking for a bargain and unforgettable holiday experiences. Cheap holidays for 7 nights in the Canaries come with all the trappings of a great holiday, including the must-have 7nt getaway, an all-inclusive hotel and flights!
