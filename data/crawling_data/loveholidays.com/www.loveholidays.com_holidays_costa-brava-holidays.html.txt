The Charming Costa Brava 2018 / 2019

Whether you want to let your hair down until the early hours or admire rugged coastlines, forest-covered mountains and deep blue waters then a holiday on the Costa Brava in
Spain
might just be for you.

One of the first Spanish coastal areas to become popular with British tourists, the Costa Brava is a superb ‘home from home’, with year-round favourable weather shining down on familiar surroundings of lively bars, clubs and restaurants. In recent years however, visitors have come from far and wide to marvel at the Costa Brava’s stunning natural sights and rich heritage.

Here, in the province of the magnificent
Girona
- where your flights into the Costa Brava will land, but also worth checking out itself - you’ll find medieval walled towns alongside stylish resorts popular with
Barcelona
’s stylish weekend trippers, nature reserves, museums and remote beaches. There’s plenty waiting to be discovered on a Costa Brava holiday in 2018 / 2019.

Top Attractions






Encompassed by the region of
Girona
, the southern part of the Costa Brava is home to its most popular resorts. The stretch of coastline from
Blanes
in the south to
Tossa de Mar
in the north attracts most of the tourists. Expect amazing beaches, bustling resorts and a laid-back atmosphere.

The top resorts on the Costa Brava include the fantastic
Lloret de Mar,
also located to the south of Girona. Lloret de Mar a popular tourist destination as it ticks all the boxes, including a host of all inclusive hotels

Platja d'Aro
, a once hidden fishing-village now turned popular coastal resort, is home to fantastic beaches and a laid-back lifestyle. Just north of
Tossa de Mar
, Platja d'Aro is 30 mins drive from Girona airport and 30 mins drive from Tossa de Mar.

Blanes
in the south is ideal for exploring other nearby resorts if you want to escape the bustle of Barcelona or Lloret de Mar. Blanes is a quiet resort perfect for
family holidays
.

Malgrat de Mar
, a beachy resort just an hours train journey from
Barcelona
, is located between Callela and Lloret de Mar. In Malgrat de Mar expect a mix of history and modern hotels which have sprung up along the seafront.

Wine and Dine






Sun, sea and Sangria are very much the order of the day on a Costa Brava holiday, however there’s far more to explore from a culinary point of view. From gourmet restaurants in
Girona
, to local favourites in
Tossa de Mar
, to something more traditional in
Platja d'Aro
, the Costa Brava has a culinary favourite. There’s everything here from Michelin-starred restaurants to the simplest of beach cafes. The most important thing is that great food here is excellent value for money.

Catalan cooking consists of whatever can be sourced locally and fresh, so expect to feast on fish stews, Iberico ham and delicious tapas. Typical Spanish dishes such as paella are plentiful here, as is local wine and beer to wash it all down with.

For Families






Costa Brava holidays are great for
family holidays
, with plenty to see and do to suit all tastes and ages. From days spent swimming and snorkelling at the beach to exploring hidden rocky villages, botanical gardens and water parks, there’s fun to be had for the whole family. They’ll love the
Salvador Dali House Museum
, once home to the famous Spanish artist and full of weird and wonderful artefacts.

At Cap Roig you can find amazing cascading terraces that extend from the castle to beach, plus a cactus garden and even an annual open-air music festival. Or for a great family day by the seaside head to
Cala de Aiguafreda
where you can rent boats or have a Spanish picnic in the designated stone bench areas under the shade of giant pine trees.

Other top family resorts incude
Tossa de Mar
, which isn't far from Lloret de Mar, Platja d'Aro and its fashionable beachfront and Malgrat de Mar, a well-serviced resort with beaches and restaurants.

Action and Adventure






Hoverboarding? Skydiving? Zip lining? The Costa Brava is the place to come for a spot of action and adventure by the Med. Navigate rope bridges, swing through the trees and scale obstacles at
Costa Brava Parc d’Aventura
. Be propelled across the sea off the coast at
Figueres
on a state of the art hoverboard or admire the incredible coastal landscapes as you free fall sky dive from 3800 metres up. For something a little more conventional there’s all manner of cycling, hiking and fishing adventures to be had, atop the region’s incredible cliffs and mountains or out on the blue Mediterranean waters.

Life's a Beach






Costa Brava translates as
rugged coast
and whilst the region is home to some of the most striking and rocky seafront in the Mediterranean, it’s also a place where you’ll find some amazing sandy beaches and excellent beach resorts. All easily accessible from
Girona Airport
, and with our deals on flights and hotels, you can make your beach dreams a reality.

Empuriabrava
is around a mile long and nearly 100 metres wide at low tide, a vast expanse of sand that’s great for relaxing on and admiring the view of the bay of Roses, a day of volleyball with the kids or a dip in the sea. The
Platja Gran
beach at
Platja d'Aro
is a top pick for families, it's a massive sandy stretch well-stocked with restaurants and hotels.

Tamariu
is a little more secluded, backed by a lovely whitewashed village with green trees and adorned with facilities including kayak hire, diving school, sailing club and plenty of beachfront restaurants. And for turquoise waters hemmed in by a rocky outcrop close to
Lloret De Mar
then head to
Sa Caleta
. It’s great for snorkelling, jumping off the rocks and admiring the castle that overlooks it!




Read More about Life's a Beach





Nightlife






The Costa Brava is famed for its nightlife, much of it centred on the lively resort of
Lloret De Mar
. There’s classy cocktail bars, late night pubs and clubs and terrace-topped hangouts aplenty waiting to show you a great time. Places such as Revolution, Disco Salero and Hollywood Dance Club come recommended, but you’ll probably find that you just go with the crowd.  In places such as Cadaques and
Callela
you’ll come across the likes of the Terrace at Can Gelpi that looks out directly onto the beach with the sound of crashing waves. Try a
cremat
, a concoction of dark rum, coffee and spices. Both resorts have bustling streets and lots of bars.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






There’s so many hidden coves, romantic lookouts and idyllic town square restaurants on the Costa Brava that make it such a great place for a
couples’ holiday
.
Barcelona
is at the heart of the Costa Brava and is one of the best summer holiday destinations for a romantic getaway.

El Golfet
is a honeymooner’s paradise with a tiny beach sheltered from the outside world by imposing pine trees and jagged granite rocks, the ideal sunset swim spot. The old town at
Tossa de Mar
is all about quiet cobbled backstreets, old world Moorish architecture and intricate sculptures, the epitome of Mediterranean romance. And for sportier types there’s the opportunity to rent a kayak together at
Cala Llorell
and paddle around the rocky coves.

For a spot of wet and wild entertainment you can’t go far wrong at the A
qua Brava Water Park
. It’s home to a 250-yard raft ride through a tunnel, Europe’s largest wave pool and beautiful gardens, mazes and towers. Or why not get away from the madness at the relatively un-touristy medieval town of
Begur
? Here you’ll find ancient multi-coloured stone buildings, car-free streets and lovely hidden bars and restaurants, all set into a tree-covered hilltop.


Read More about For Couples





Culture






The Costa Brava is dotted with Roman ruins, walled villages, art galleries and countryside villas hosting cultural events such as music and dance festivals. The influence of Salvador Dali on the local culture cannot be underestimated, whilst the historical legacy of the Roman Empire lies all around. From the castles and hill forts of old, (Sant Joan, Mataplana, Bufalaranya etc.) through to modernist creations such as Casa Mallol and the Vichy Catalan Spa (thermal baths aplenty), the region’s culture has evolved through the ages and invites you to explore its incredible development for yourself.

For a day of culture on your holiday on the Costa Brava, take a trip firstly to the
Dali Theatre Museum
in Figueres, for eccentrically weird and wonderful artistic installations (get ready to queue). Then take a short walk up the hill to
Sant Ferran castle
, a vast 18
th
century fortress with incredible views over the surrounding countryside and coastline. Book a dinghy-ride through the vast network of underground canals in advance!
