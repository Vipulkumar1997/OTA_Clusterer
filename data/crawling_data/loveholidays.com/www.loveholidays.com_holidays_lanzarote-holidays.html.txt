Top Attractions






With its volcanic backdrop and a wealth of beaches to choose from, Lanzarote’s attractions are focused on the stark beauty of its surroundings. This
Canary Island
boasts undulating mountains and endless hidden coves, complimented by the distinct architecture of local Lanzarote artist, Cesar Manrique. The
Cesar Manrique House Museum
is an unmissable top attraction, built into rocky boulders and filled to the brim with artwork, not far from the village of Arrieta.

If you fancy venturing out on a hike, you can also enjoy the unique natural beauty of
Timanfaya National Park
, formed from rock formations and covering 51 square km in the Yaiza and Tinaja regions.
Cueva de Los Verde
s, located in the Haria municipality and in the protected area
Monumento Natural del Malpaís de La Corona
, is also worth the 45-minute tour that leads you down two chasms along a lava tube five miles long, formed by the volcano 5,000 years ago.

Shopaholics looking for unique souvenirs must take a trip to
Teguise
Market, the largest outdoor market on Lanzarote, and the largest in the Canary Islands. Canarian lacework, hand-crafted leather and locally-made jewellery are all available to buy and take home, but Teguise Market is worth exploring as an attraction in itself. Once you’ve browsed the stalls, take a stroll through Costa Teguise past one of the many cafes to enjoy the views, as well as the delicious local doughnuts.

Top resorts in Lanzarote to use as your base or just for a day trip include the popular Costa Teguise,
Playa de Los Pocillos
and of course, the capital,
Arrecife
.

Wine and Dine






Savour the flavours of Canaria in Lanzarote, which is often served up with a side of "
mojo
" sauce blended with spices, lemon, coriander and red chilli. There's an abundance of Spanish tapas restaurants and bars as well as local fish and seafood restaurants across Lanzarote, mostly in the capital, Arrecife. Non-traditional eateries featuring Greek, Chinese, Indian and vegetarian food are also available in resort towns like
Puerto Del Carmen
and
Playa Blanca
if you are looking for a variety of cuisines.

You can enjoy your meal to the sounds of live music while you eat in one of the charming restaurants lining the cities cobbled streets.
Costa Teguise
has a little something for the most complicated food-lover to those that just love a simple treat. Family-run restaurants in Playa de la Pocillos make it a great place to try out some different cuisines.

The laid-back
El Amanecer
is family-run and next to
La Garita
beach on the northeast coast of the island and ideal for fresh fish enjoyed on the waterside terraces. Another popular family-friendly restaurant is
Mesón La Frontera
in Haría which has a play area to occupy the children.

beach, close to the town of
Arrieta
, features a gentle slope into the sea and a children’s play area. Other resorts with beaches suitable for children include
Playa de Los Pocillos
and Matagorda, both close to the popular resort, Puerto del Carmen.

Rancho Texas Park

Action and Adventure






Unsurprisingly, Lanzarote is the ultimate choice for those looking for a holiday full of action and adventure. With its iconic volcanic terrane, Lanzarote is perfect for the mountainous climbs. The ever popular and ever stunning
Timanfaya National Park
is a good place to start. Similarly, the clear waters of the Atlantic ocean that surround the island make for the perfect swimming conditions.
Playa Blanca
in the municipality of
Yaiza
offers long beaches ideal for sports and swimming.

Boardsports are particularly popular on the island, as the high winds are ideal for windsurfing and kite-boarding. Surfing and paddle boarding are also great sports to try out here. In
Arrecife,
you'll find all sorts of tour guides and boards offering information on what to check out. The cruise from
Puerto Calero
offers stunning views of Fuerteventura.

Life's a Beach






If you want to relax and enjoy the sunshine, Lanzarote’s beaches have it all. While the main resorts on Lanzarote island host beautiful sandy coastlines, you’ll want to head to the pristine shores of
Papagayo Beach
in
Playa Blanca
, located on the southern coast. The former fishing village is a hive of activity with life around its port.
Papagayo Beach
is one of the most popular beaches in Lanzarote because of its emerald waters and tranquil setting.

On the north coast of Lanzarote is the collection of attractive coves of
Caletón Blanco
. The white sandy beaches that join together, along with warm rock pools near
Órzola
boast clear sapphire water making it ideal for snorkelling. The tranquil fishing village of
Arrieta
is another north coast gem, it's beautiful beach
Playa La Garita
a favourite with the locals of the island.

For the thrill-seeker in you, head to
Famara
beach on the northwest coast of Lanzarote. Away from the resorts, the curved bay is popular with surfers, windsurfers and kiteboarders. The backdrop of pink cliffs is also popular with hang-gliders.

For a touch of the iconic Lanzarote holiday lifestyle, head to Playa de Los Pocillos, one of the most popular beaches on Lanzarote. Another star is
Puerto del Carmen
, which boasts two beautiful beaches. Just up the coast from Puerto del Carmen lies the popular, smaller resorts of
Matagorda
and
Playa de Los Pocillos
. With Blue Flag beaches and a little more peace than Puerto del Carmen, Matagorda is a good choice for families. Playa de Los Pocillos has great beaches, too, plus this modern resort has an intimate feel.

Nightlife






If you are after a lively atmosphere and buzzing nightlife whilst on Lanzarote, head down to the bustling harbour town of
Puerto Del Carmen
, which is ideal for the party animal. Puerto del Carmen has the busiest nightlife on Lanzarote, with lots of live music and disco bars. The main centres of Centro Atlantico on the main strip of
Avenida de las Playas
have the most clubs, as well as the Old Town near the harbour. Club 18-30 is also in the town and has enhanced Puerto del Carmen's lively reputation.

Playa Blanca
has the lively area of Centro Comercial Papagayo and the Centro Comercial Punto Limones next to the port. If you are in need of some sophistication, take a trip to
Centro Comercial La Mulata
and the Marina Rubicon for some up-market cocktails.

There are a variety of Irish bars in
Costa Teguise
in the area of Pueblo Marinero. There is also a selection of clubs and bars on the Avenida de Jabillo. To truly experience a taste of Spanish nightlife, with a distinct Lanzarote flavour, then visit Arrecife. Both the Playa del Reducto and Calle Jose Antonio are the best places to spend the night enjoying typical Spanish music and entertainment in Arrecife.

For Couples






Lanzarote is a true paradise for a couple’s holiday where you can both expect to enjoy peace, tranquillity and a whole lot of fun exploring the island. Start your journey in
Arrecife
, explore
Timanfaya national park
, and head to the ever popular
Costa Teguise
. Lanzarote has a lot to offer.

If you want some alone time with your loved one, then a day at the spa at your Lanzarote hotel is a great place to start. Unwind and relax at the Spa and Wellness at
Arrecife Gran Hotel
, which is a luxury oasis of calm that offers couples treatments for the ultimate pamper session.

For an adults-only trip, book a trip on
Catlanza
, Lanzarote’s famous catamaran, which sails from
Puerto Calero
twice a day. Make the most of the Platinum cruise, which includes lunch, snorkelling, and a Jet Ski ride.
Puerto Calero
itself is a nice spot, and you can enjoy the views of the neighbour Canary Island, Fuerteventura, before the ride.

To experience Lanzarote’s legendary sunsets, find a beach and settle down on the sand or a beachfront bar.
Famara
and
Playa Blanca
both provide excellent views, however watching the sun go down at
El Golfo
is by far the best.

Culture






As the second eldest island in the Canaria archipelago after
Fuerteventura
, Lanzarote rose from the sea during a massive volcanic eruption, around 15 million years ago. Historians theorise that Lanzarote was one of the first Canary Islands to be settled by the Phoenicians in 1100 BC.

For a brief history lesson, head to the Northern tip of the island where you’ll discover Lanzarote’s traditional side. Begin at the
Cueva de Los Verdes
, where passages and natural stairways lead to an impressive auditorium, before visiting Cesar Manrique’s legendary
Jameos Del Agua
- a volcanic cavern with rock gardens, a shimmering lake and a restaurant. Another Manrique creation is the
Mirador del Rio
, an attractively-designed observation point built into a volcanic lava rock cliff, which is now home to a chic bar and café.

Lanzarote is famed for being very relaxed and so during the hours of two until five the siesta is still observed in many places, with shops and banks often taking a well-earned break. So go with the flow and take it easy Lanzarote-style, you’re on holiday after all!
