Charming Costa del Sol Holidays 2018 / 2019

The Costa del Sol, translated literally to the
Coast of the Sun
, is one of the world's most renowned holiday destinations. Located in the south of
Spain
, the Costa del Sol lies inside the region of
Andalucia
and incorporates the province of
Malaga
, which includes the eponymous city of Malaga and a dozen seaside resorts, including the popular
Benalmadena, Torremolinos and Puerto Banus
.

With a perfect balance of sandy beaches, glitzy resorts and luxury
all inclusive
hotels, the Costa del Sol makes an excellent year-round holiday destination thanks to its impressive
325
days of sunshine a year. The Brits have a special relationship with the Costa del Sol - over 300,000 expats call the region home, and thanks to the cheap flights and deals on hotels, it doesn't take much for you to find out why.

Top Attractions






There are a
lot
of resorts in the Costa del Sol. We're going to have keep it short and snappy to fit them all in. Here goes.

First on the list in
Benalmadena
. Home to the
Tivoli World Theme Park
, the fancy
Puerto Marina
and over 6 miles of beaches to choose from, plus just a short journey from Malaga airport, it's really no surprise that Benalmadena is such a popular spot. Benalmadena is the best pick for a
family holiday
.

Next is
Torremolinos
, which lies just west of the city of
Malaga
and north of
Benalmadena
. Known for the sandy beaches
El Bajondillo
and
La Carihuela
, Torremolinos has grown into an attractive, clean and family-friendly resort with plenty of hotels, restaurants and beachfront
chiringuitos
still serving fresh fish from the days of its sleepy fishing village past.

Puerto Banus is the most glamorous spot on the whole Costa del Sol, home to
Marbella's
millionaires, casinos and mega-yachts. Think cocktails, designer shops and champagne parties on the beach and you'll be close to the level of luxury on show in
Puerto Banus
. It's easy to get caught up, but for a taste of the more traditional, head to
Mistral Beach
.

You'll start to notice a trend with
Fuengirola
. Another stunning stretch of beaches, 5 miles in total, stretches along the front of this buzzing, cosmopolitan resort north of
Marbella
and south of
Torremolinos
. Fuengirola has more of a Mediterannean vibe than its neighbours, and the tradtional square and surrounding streets gives you a glimpse of the past.

Wine and Dine






The Costa del Sol is home to many chiringuitos, authentic fish bars and a cuisine that takes its influence from a complex history of Mediterranean, Spanish and Moorish cuisine. From luxury dinners in
Puerto Banus
to authentic Spanish tapas in Malaga, the Costa del Sol holidays are a culinary delight.

In the international resorts, places like Benalmadena, Torremolinos and even the smaller
Mijas
and the Mijas Costas, you'll find a range of cuisine from all over the world. English breakfast will live right next to Asian cuisine, whilst next door there'll be a Mediterranean tapas bar. Mijas is a popular family destination, too, so expect family-friendly restaurants who are ready and willing to make your holiday to the Costa del Sol spectacular.

In
Estepona
you'll find a real Andalusian vibe with flamenco and tapas restaurants alongside sophisticated restaurants. Fuengirola has a buzzing nightlife with a range of Irish pubs and wineries catering to the British tourist. However, around
Fuengirola's
main square, the
Plaza del Constitucion
, you'll find something more tradtional.

For Families






Costa del Sol is one of the best family holiday destinations in Europe. With a seemingly endless stretch of 100 miles of generally family-friendly restaurants, over 60 years of catering for British families and a number of brilliant family hotels, the Costa del Sol could be the perfect pick for your 2018 / 2019
family holiday
.

Arguably one of the best beaches can be found at
Estepona
in the form of
El Cristo beach
. The shallow waters here make it the perfect spot for fun for the kids and relaxation for the parents.
There are two water parks in the Costa del Sol, with the best based in
Torremolinos
. The aptly named
Aqualand
boasts numerous pools and slides, providing an enjoyable day of swimming, bathing and sliding. If the kids are craving an amusement park fix, look no further than
Tivoli World
in
Benalmadena
. The park is full of thrilling rides and slides that may even get mum and dad’s hearts racing.

Other popular resorts for families include
Mijas
, with its safe beaches in nearby
Fuengirola
and along the Mijas Costas, plus local shops, bars and restaurants in the
Mijas Pueblo
.
Nerja
provides something a bit more traditional and an excellent beach, the
Playa Burriana
.

Action and Adventure






Watersports are available along the coast at all the top resorts, from
Torremolinos
to
Estepona
. The 100 miles of coastline menas you can pretty much try any water-based activity you want, from boating to diving.

The Costa del Sol’s attractions aren’t all necessarily based around the water. The peaks around
Mijas
provide some great walking trails and mountain biking opportunities, while rock climbers will find satisfaction in the challenges around
Mijas Pueblo
.

The Costa del Sol is also an extremely popular golfing destination, with various golf breaks and holidays extremely easy to book in advance and also after you land in Spain. Golf4u Spain is a well-renowned company based around
Mijas
, an area that boasts no less than seven courses.

Life's a Beach






Gorgeous sandy beaches are the hallmark of a Costa del Sol holiday. We'll work our way through some of our favourites.

Carvajal Beach
in
Benalmadena
is a favourite for a family day out on the sand and is generally pretty busy. Luckily, rather than being a nuisance, this thriving beach has a magic atmosphere. Dominating high-rise buildings, so many restaurants you'll find it hard to pick and watersports facilities galore.
Malapesquera Beach
is right next to the
Benalmadena Marina
and is where the
Festival of the 'Virgen del Carmen'
is held each July (holiday planning idea?). Both beaches have been awarded the Blue Flag.

Further north, past Malaga and
Torre del Mar
, lies the rugged
Nerja
. Characterised by rocky outcroppings,
El Playazo Beach
is over a mile long and because of its size, and distance from
Malaga
, means this beach stays quiet even in peak summer months.
La Torrecilla
is a smaller beach on the western end of Nerja which is accessible by foot. Both beaches have been awarded the Blue Flag.

Estepona is located south of Marbella and offers a staggering 17 beaches over a stretch of 12 miles of coastline. With a mix of sandy, golden and volcanic beaches,
Estepona
is one of the top picks for a beach holiday in the Costa del Sol. The main beach is located just outside of the town of Estepona and is called
Playa el Cristo.
Located in a sheltered cove the beach is great for children, Playa el Cristo also offers two beachfront restaurants (
chiringuitos
) and of course, a Blue Flag award.

That's just a sample of the beaches on offer on a Costa del Sol holiday. All of the resorts, from Fuengirola to
Torremolinos
, offer stunning beaches.
All 100 miles of them.

Nightlife






The Costa del Sol is known for its buzzing nightlife. From glitzy cocktails bars in
Puerto Banus
and
Malaga
, to the heaving nightlife in
Marbella
,
Benalmadena
and
Fuengirola
, you can find nightlife to suit any palette.

Most of Marbella's bars and nightclubs can be found in the
Puerto Banus
area, where the classy beachside daytime fun turns into a swish, sophisticated nightlife scene. The clubs here are open late.

Benalmadena
caters to the huge number of British tourists and expats, so expect some familiar sights: Irish pubs and English sports bars. There'll be sport on the televisions, bar games like pool and darts, and definitely a pint of Guinness or two.

Fuengirola
tends to have the most diverse and rowdy nightlife. There are some more sedate bars towards the centre of town, while the clubs along the beachfront tend to perk up around midnight, continuing to thrive well into the next morning. The biggest clubs are
Millennium and Funk Club
.



Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






The Costa del Sol is an inherently romantic place, maybe it's the sunshine, maybe it's the glorious, sandy beaches, or maybe it's just the warm atmosphere provided by Andalusian charm and friendly locals.
Puerto Banus
, the glitziest resort, is the perfect place to sample some luxury, whereas
Nerja
provides a flavour of tradtional Costa del Sol.

Marbella boasts an impressive Old Town full of romance with restaurants serving artisan food, winding streets and history oozing from the walls of the medieval buildings. Whitewashed squares, shady spots and two historical quarters to choose from,
Barrio Alto
and
Barrio Nuevo
, make
Marbella
an excellent spot to pair lush beach lounging with romantic wandering.

Other picks for a
couples holiday
to the Costa del Sol include
Estepona
, which has its own lovely old town,
Mijas
with its
Mijas Pueblo
(a historical, inland mountain village) and gorgeous setting, or one of the top resorts
Benalmadena
or
Torremolinos
if you're looking for a high octane holiday.


Read More about For Couples





Culture






Religious festivals are big in the Costa del Sol and Easter is a big festivity, Passion Week from 9-16th April is a big festivity with processions taking place in the town of
Ronda
particularly. Easter processions are held all over the Costa del Sol with spectacular iconography and celebrations. If you are travelling in February, the town of
Tolox
has a fun festival consisting of throwing powder over each other until you are completely covered! The tradition apparently started when local baker boys would throw flour over the girl they liked to show their affection!

For something else a little whacky, the town of
El Burgo
holds a 19th century reenactment festival, visitors are encouraged to take part in the reenactment which includes bandits and heroes.

The Costa del Sol's history is spread out over centuries of mixed rule, from the Moors to tradtional Andalusian heritage. Visit the old towns in Mijas,
Marbella
or Estepona for a taste of this cultural mish-mash.
