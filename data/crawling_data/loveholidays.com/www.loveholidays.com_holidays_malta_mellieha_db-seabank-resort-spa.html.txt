All 492 rooms are decorated in a calming nautical style, and each comes equipped with flat-screen TV, free WiFi, fridge, tea & coffee making facilities, and a safety deposit box. Depending on your preferences, your room can overlook the sea, the pool, or the beautiful Maltese countryside.

The resort boasts a world-class range of facilities, including 7 restaurants, 2 pools, a fitness centre and an entertainment programme. The large outdoor pool provides 1400m2 of swimming space, a section of which is reserved for adults only. The kids aren’t left out though – they get their own shallow splash pool, as well as a varied entertainment programme. There’s an indoor swimming pool too, which has spectacular views of the surrounding countryside.

Now, about those seven restaurants we mentioned. Aside from the buffet-style restaurant, where you can enjoy breakfast, lunch and dinner, there’s a gorgeous Oriental restaurant with food prepared in front of the guests, a Mediterranean grill buffet and a Brazilian meat restaurant. The Jungle Restaurant serves all-American dishes, while La Pellicola is a winner among lovers of Italian cuisine. Finally, there’s a café-bistro that offers some lovely views of the beach. The rich diversity of places to wine and dine in is matched only by the long list of wellness facilities, including a sauna and a steam room, as well as a rich choice of massage treatments.

For all bookings, your contract will be with the applicable Service Provider of your chosen Arrangement (who may be the principal or the agent of the principal) and loveholidays acts only as an agent on their behalf. We do not create or organise package holidays. All package holidays available through us are organised by third-party Service Providers on whose behalf we act as agent and where flights are included, protected under their ATOL. Where you book certain flights or a flight and hotel product, it is protected under our ATOL (10989) but we still act as an agent on behalf of the applicable Service Provider. All the Arrangements are priced independent of any other Arrangements booked at the same time and creates separate contracts directly between you and the principal of each Arrangement. Please see our
Agency terms and conditions
for more information.
