Are towels provided for around the pool area ?

3 Answers













Pool towels are available from reception - you have to leave a deposit (in euros) and they will refund this when you leave. You can renew them during your holiday if they need replacing for a clean towel.

Answer








yes but does the all inc drinks finish @23.00 or as reviews say 22.00

1 Answer













Hello,

As it stands, we're in no position to guarantee that the bar will be open till 11pm, as it remains at the discretion of the hotel. We can say that it is more than likely that it will stay open till 11pm, serving all-inclusive drinks. We try to represent each hotel as accurately as we can, and if the hotel states that its all-inclusive drinks end at 11pm then we assume that it's correct information.

Another suggestion is that the reviews you are looking at may be outdated. It's best to check the date when skimming reviews, often hotel policy changes overtime, and it might be that the hotel bar used to close at 10pm, but now stays open till 11pm.

I hope this helps, if you want further confirmation or any other help, let us know.

Harry.
