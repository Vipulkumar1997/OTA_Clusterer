Life's a Beach






After the endless fuss of a wedding, nothing quite beats the relief of dipping your toes in the sands of blissful honeymoon destinations. Indulge your
Caribbean
dream of cocktails and hammocks with a trip to the
Dominican Republic
– perfect for sand, sun and sea worshippers. Located in the Caribbean Sea, the charming island of Barbados is also a favourite for those newly-hitched – perhaps due to its eclectic culture and irresistible sand-swept beaches.

Other honeymoon holiday favourites in the Caribbean include
St. Lucia
, Antigua & Barbuda and
Jamaica
. On St. Lucia you'll find luxury hotels around Castries and volcanic sands. On Antigua & Barbuda you'll find more of those quintessentially beautiful Caribbean beaches, but also a fair share of history, culture and all inclusive luxury. Jamaica is known for its laid-back lifestyle, and it makes for the perfect relaxing holiday. From all inclusive to a laid back beach bum hotel, there's really something for every type of honey moon. With a wonderful choice of resorts on all of these Caribbean islands, you've got the opportunity to pick the right honeymoon destination for you.

Honeymoon islands






If cobbled streets and concrete don’t float your boat, there are plenty of honeymoon holidays that offer paradisiacal island settings. White sands and glittering seas await you in
Thailand
, alongside a vibrant culture and history. Perfect for luxury holidays, you’ll find the perfect concoction of world-class cuisine and spectacular surroundings that make holidays to this vibrant destination worthwhile.

Far-flung destinations like
Mauritius
are well worth the wait – some of the most beautiful beaches in the world can be found on Mauritius and with its tropical climate that sees an abundance of sunshine, you’ll have plenty of time to top up your tan. Mauritius is one of the few very quintessential honeymoon destinations. If it’s a unique combination of adventure and relaxation that you’re craving in a honeymoon destination,
Cuba
is the perfect place to visit. Laid-back couples might like to spend their time feasting on tropical dishes and admiring the scenery, while those with a sense of adventure should step into their wetsuits to explore the spectacular scuba-diving scene that awaits.

Venice for couples






A minimoon is a great way of celebrating your wedding, or taking the time out of your busy, wedded schedules to experience something romantic. If you’re the type of couple that would rather swap a break at the beach for a trip around an art gallery, a culture-crammed city break to
Italy
is an ideal honeymoon destination. Of all the honeymoon destinations, Europe includes some of the most charming places to visit. With a range of cheap flights and deals on holidays, it doesn't have to break the bank either.

There is nothing more idyllic than visiting Italy as a newly-wed pair – the meandering canals of
Venice
, the heart-wrenching romance of Shakespeare’s Verona and the most mouth-watering pizza and pasta dishes in the world await you when you’re whisked away on honeymoons to Italy. Discover the majestic Colosseum and Pantheon in Rome or head to the hills for a romantic Italian escape.

American honeymoon






If you fancy having your honeymoon breakfast in America, there are several destinations to have you feeling inspired. City slickers should take a huge bite out of the Big Apple with a trip to
New York
, while those seeking something less rushed will enjoy the endless magic of Miami. If you manage to leave your hotel room, don’t miss the parties on South Beach or experience a sunset over the city’s spectacular skyline. Combining your USA trip with a short break to Mexico is an ideal way to make your honeymoon holidays last longer. Take the short jaunt across the ocean to the vibrant destination of Cancun for its sugar-white sands to fulfil all your desert island fantasies.
