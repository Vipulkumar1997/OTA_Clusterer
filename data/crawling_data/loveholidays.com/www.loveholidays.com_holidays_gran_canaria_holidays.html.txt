Top Attractions






Home to some of the best natural landscapes in the Canaries, Gran Canaria offers the
Roque Nublo
, an enormous 80m rock, the painted
Cave of Galdar
, one of the most important historical sites in the Canaries, and the historic capital
Las Palmas
, Columbus' stopping point as he returned from the Americas.

If you're here for the beaches, Gran Canaria has plenty. Amble across the never-ending expanse of golden sand at Dunas de
Maspalomas
, close to the resort area of
Meloneras
, a sort of desert-by-the-beach with stunning views of the Atlantic Ocean beyond.

Tucked in between
Puerto Rico
and
Playa Mogan
is the subtler beauty of Taurito.
Playa Taurito
was designed for the ultimate Gran Canaria holiday experience, with a range of fantastic hotels, luxury facilities and the fantastic Playa Taurito beach.

And for something a little livelier make your way to
Playa de Las Canteras
, a bustling surfer’s beach at
Las Palmas
and stone’s throw from bars, restaurants and shops of the island’s eccentric capital.

Wine and Dine






When you think of the kind of food and drink you’ll be enjoying while on holiday in Gran Canaria, you probably picture little plates of fried fish, a cold beer and an ocean view. Well, you’d be right. Top resorts like
Playa del Ingles
,
Meloneras
and
Maspalomas
all have an excellent choice of restaurants. Plus, the seafront eateries at
Playa Amadores
serve some delicious seafood.

However there’s so much more to the island’s culinary scene than meets the eye...our top tip is to book an all-inclusive Gran Canaria hotel at one of the top resorts and ask the chef for the local cuisine, the staff will love you and you'll get to try some real Canarian treats.

Unearth the incredible rum of the town of
Arucas
, the amazingly sweet sponge cakes of
Moya
, cheeses of
Santa Maria de Guia
and sumptuous stews at
Artenara
. The tuna that is brought ashore at
Puerto de Mogan
is so fresh and unlike anything you’ve tried before, so head down there for an evening and tuck into a plate of seafood, washed down with some local wine or beer of course. There are many dining options catering to a wide variety of international tastes, so even the fussiest kids will love the food that Gran Canaria offers.

For Families






For such a small island, the resorts on Gran Canaria really do have something for every family. You might just want to relax on the beach (the well serviced
Amadores beach
is an excellent choice) and that’s fine, this is what all-inclusive hotels were designed for! With a choice of family-friendly resorts ranging from
Meloneras
to P
laya del Ingles
, there's a multitude to choose from whilst booking your 2018/2019 holiday.

Fun is free on this beautiful island destination. There are sandy stretches across all of the resorts for swimming, sunbathing and snorkelling, the perfect cheap family holiday activities. You may fancy exploring the unique landscapes of
Roque Nublo
, where the kids can pretend they’re walking across the surface of the moon. For something a bit more adventurous, you can go on camel rides, on submarines, head out to sea in search of dolphins, or hurtle down a waterslide at Aqualand
Maspalomas
. With a go-kart track, botanical gardens and crocodile reserve on offer as well, families will struggle to get bored on Gran Canaria.


Read More about For Families





Action and Adventure






Gran Canaria holidays provide opportunities for a whole host of adventurous activities, including rock climbing, hiking, cycling, quad biking and kite surfing. You can go trekking through the rocky canyons of
Guayadeque
, whale and dolphin watching off the coast of
Puerto Rico
or even abseil down volcanic ravines.

And for the most adventurous amongst you, there’s even a spot of paragliding on offer, a chance to swoop down from mountains into valleys, admiring the incredible views all around. Almost all of the main coastal resorts offer watersports, but we particularly recommend windsurfing in
Maspalomas
with a backdrop of its Canarian beauty. If you’re struggling to find a place to start (we don’t blame you) then the concierge at the desk of your hotel will steer you in the right direction.

Life's a Beach






Gran Canaria’s offering of beaches and resorts is as varied as the island itself. With an average temperature of around 24 degrees Celsius, all year round, a holiday in Gran Canaria is all about long days spent on the beach. You would've heard of the great beaches on Fuerteventura, Lanzarote and
Tenerife
, and Gran Canaria more than holds its own.

Family time on the vast Gran Canaria sandy beaches at
Maspalomas
,
Meloneras
or
Playa del Ingles
is time well spent, with opportunities for walks to historic lighthouses, bird watching, relaxing in the sun and swimming in the sea. You won’t want to return to the hustle and bustle of the real world after unwinding down at
Playa Amadores
beach in
Las Palmas
, Playa Amadores is a quiet palm tree-backed place with peaceful beach restaurants and calm seas to dip in.

The waves roll in at
Playa del Ingles
and whilst its huge golden-sanded beach is a great place for kids to play, it’s also the place for lovers of the surf. One of the top beach resorts in Gran Canaria! Choose from a number of resorts along the coast, with a range of accommodation options from self-catering to full-board, many offering a private beachfront.

Meloneras
is a sophisticated resort located on the south coast, located close to both
Maspalomas
and
Playa del Ingles
, not far from
Puerto Rico
. The
Playa de Meloneras
runs along the front of the resort and is home to restaurants, bars and all-inclusive hotels.

Nightlife






All across Gran Canaria, there are numerous of late night bars and clubs to let your hair down across various resorts, but most popular for a night out is
Playa del Ingles
. Alternatively, in the island’s capital, you’ll find a nightlife scene with a difference. In Las Palmas, there are bars that play live rock, jazz and blues music from all week long, and the town also boasts a huge
Casino
, ideal for getting dressed up and having a flutter at the tables. Alternatively,
Puerto Rico
is also known for its busy nightlife centred around cocktails and karaoke.

Dunes & Tunes
in
Maspalomas
is a raucous Irish bar where live music, Guinness on tap and a hearty welcome are the norms.
Puerto de Mogan
is quieter than its raucous neighbours, but here the late night eating and cafe culture of the Spanish and Canary Island's comes to the fore. And for something a bit different the
Auditorio Alfredo Kraus
is a theatre constructed from volcanic rock, with a huge window and sweeping ocean views, the islands' summer jazz festival is held here. Don’t forget, your all-inclusive hotel is likely to have nighttime entertainment!

For Couples






Glamorous luxury hotels, golden sand dunes stretching as far as the eye can see, quaint fishing villages, sunset outcrops: what’s not to love about Gran Canaria for couples? For exclusivity and an upmarket lifestyle, try
Meloneras
. This chic resort is not far from the popular
Playa del Ingles,
a fantastic party spot.

On the coast, you’ll find plenty of secluded beaches, especially in
Puerto de Mogan
, restaurants to relax in while enjoying some romantic food and drink, plus unique shops to browse and buy special mementoes of your holiday.
Playa Amadores
has a laid-back vibe and a lovely promenade along the picture-perfect beach, in the evening you can make your way from
Playa Amadores
to Puerto Rico for its awesome nightlife.

Inland there are opportunities for remote hikes, to explore ancient towns and villages, go on bike rides together and indulge in cookery courses. The rich experiences of Gran Canaria are ones that will last a lifetime and it is the ideal place for couples to make lasting memories. For the ultimate luxurious experience, book an all-inclusive in one of the top resorts, like
Playa Taurito
, and let us and the concierge take care of your holiday worries.

Culture






People from all over the world have visited or settled in Gran Canaria for centuries, from the original tribes to today's' holidaymakers. Its location in the Atlantic made it a stop off point for intrepid adventurers from both east and west and the cultural influences of those who stayed can still be felt today.

Now, with cheap flights from the UK and a superb range of all-inclusive hotels, Gran Canaria is known for its tourist draw. A trip to
Vegueta
in
Las Palmas
is recommended for its ancient cobbled streets and magnificent Hispanic architecture dating back to the 15th century. You’ll discover stone churches, beautifully carved monuments and statues that speak of a distant time.
La Cueva Pintada
, or the painted cave, offers an insight into indigenous island artwork and a mysterious glimpse of ancient rituals and proceedings.

The modern day has given birth to festivals and events aplenty, including the
Fiesta de San Juan
. This homage to the city’s patron saint sees spectacular firework displays, colourful parades and musical performances and is highly recommended as an atmospheric way to round off your 2018/2019 holiday to Gran Canaria.
