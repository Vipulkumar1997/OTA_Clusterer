Top Attractions






The highlight of all Los Cristianos attractions has to be the gloriously sandy beach that has seen Los Cristianos become one of the most popular holiday destinations in south Tenerife. Playa de Los Cristianos is a long stretch of golden sand which also has the added appeal of being adjacent to the harbour, should you wish to take a cruise around the bays or head out further to one of the neighbouring islands such as
La Gomera
. Ideal for catching some rays while relaxing on the shore and perfect for enjoying the ample water sport opportunities for some fun in the sun, the beach of this fantastic resort is a must-visit.

Los Cristianos is not all about the beach though, if you like walking and countryside then Tenerife has some of the best walking areas. There are a number of hiking routes that take you through lush countryside and are an excellent way to see the natural surroundings in peace and quiet. Take a picnic and make a day of it.

Shining in the sun, the white church in the town acts as a focal point for fiestas and concerts which provide a good dose of bright colours to the already vibrant greens, blues and gold of the beach and surrounding areas if you fancy spicing things up. Day trips to La Gomera are home to some stunning natural scenery landscapes as well, with the crown jewel found in the form of the Garajonay National Park – a perfect place for nature lovers to trek around. The island is also home to some wonderful beaches, all of which see smaller crowds than those on Tenerife and
Gran Canaria
. When back at your resort, if the sun has set, head out into the bustling nightlife enjoyed in Los Cristianos after enjoying hearty seafood paella around the marina.

For something a little more sedate on your Los Cristianos holidays, strolling around the harbour and marina will welcome you to some charming bars and alluring eateries, serving up cool drinks and traditional cuisine. Others will find enough joy in relaxing on the sand, with Playa de las Vistas arguably the most attractive strip of sand in the area, while the beaches of nearby Playa de las Americas will also serve beach bums well.

Wine and Dine






Having been adapted for mass tourism, it comes as no surprise Tenerife offers a wide variety of foods from different cultures and countries, from traditional English food to Lebanese cuisine, there’s not much you can’t find in Los Cristianos. Unsurprisingly, fresh seafood is pretty common among the waterfront restaurants and cafés that line the promenade, but if you’re up to venturing a little further from the beach you’ll be ecstatic to find European, Asian and African style foods all within walking distance from the shores. Pubs and bars are equally prominent in the area, although they are still just as diverse, with everything from Irish pubs to traditional tapas bars.

For Families






The great thing about Tenerife is that there’s plenty of scope to explore and discover the various areas and hidden gems that the island withholds, making for an exciting holiday that will keep the whole family entertained. Los Cristianos things to do will include sunbathing on the beach or joining in with the numerous activities the shoreline has to offer, but heading inland will give you a change of scenery. Families will find a great deal of joy from spending their holidays in Los Cristianos.

There are countless wonderful and comfortable hotels from 4-star resorts to large apartments to host families and couples.

Those with young kids, as well as the young at heart, should head to Siam Park, a fantastic themed waterpark. Meanwhile, Monkey Park is a great and informative zoo that’s home to many friendly and interesting primates.

Castillo San Miguel is another great family attraction, hosting medieval shows. A stay in Los Cristianos also gives holidaymakers the opportunity to hop on a ferry and explore some more of the Canary Islands, among them La Gomera.

Action and Adventure






There are plenty of things to do in Los Cristianos and with humble beginnings as an old fishing village; you’ll find that a lot of the attractions and tours aren’t far from the beach or harbour. Luxury can be found upon the pleasure cruises that run frequently around the island, or for a more family oriented feel, glass bottom boats offer a window overlooking the coral and sea life below.

However, if you’d prefer to get up close and personal you can always head off on a scuba diving excursion to truly explore the crystal clear waters you’ll undoubtedly come to love. There’s plenty of excitement and adventure found on and around the coastal beauty of Los Cristianos, as well as the relaxation of lounging on the soft sand.

Those that thrive on adding an active element to their trip will find plenty of things to get their pulses racing, with a myriad of water sports available. From diving and snorkelling to sailing and jet skiing, Los Cristianos and the neighbouring resort of Costa Adeje will have you occupied from the moment you arrive.

A series of boat trip options can also provide a sedate atmosphere to your trip - some of the most exhilarating include dolphin and whale watching adventures.

Life's a Beach






Los Cristianos and its surrounding area have become famous for the wonderful golden sand beaches found here, as well as the crystal clear waters. The main beach is Playa de Los Cristianos, however Playa de Los Tarajales and Playa de Las Vistas are also nearby and easily reachable. Naturally they attract many visitors here each year, which has resulted in many souvenir shops, as well as beach bars where you can relax and enjoy a drink to the soothing sound of the ocean. The amazing water clarity also provides great snorkelling opportunities.

Besides the lovely beaches, you'll find the Las Canadadas del Teide National Park located nearby, offering spectacular views and amazing examples of the unique flora and fauna found on the
Canary Islands.

Nightlife






After experiencing one of the many treatments in Mare Nostrum Spa, you should probably check out the bustling nightlife while you are there. Although the list of Los Cristianos attractions includes numerous bars and pubs for you to enjoy a drink in, there isn’t quite the party atmosphere that you’ll find in this neighbouring resort of Playa de las Americas. Magic Lounge Bar and Tramps will get the heart racing and feet a-moving while playing some of the best club anthems around, while Soul Suite and Sax Bar introduce live acts into their domain for a more personal approach; either way, you’ll be able to throw some shapes and dance the night away.

For Couples






Los Cristianos is a fabulous holiday destination for couples, offering an abundance of activities for the two of you to enjoy. Enjoy a romantic stroll along the town’s port, or a romantic moon lit walk along the beach. Perhaps you might also enjoy picking up some takeaway food with a bottle of wine for a picnic on the beach.

Visit one of the many spas found in Los Cristianos and have a well deserved day of relaxation and blissfulness; which will make all your troubles simply melt away. Most spas offer couples massage and you can follow this with a tea or a meal in beautiful settings at one of spa locations.

More active couples can enjoy stand-up paddle boarding or surfing, with schools available at different beaches. Or try snorkelling and witnessing the beautiful underwater world for some romantic memories of your time in Tenerife.

Culture






Tenerife and Los Cristianos has a culture which has been influenced by Spain since the end of the 15
th
century. However, due to the large distance between it and mainland Spain, a unique heritage and culture has evolved here which visitors will be keen to explore. Take a day trip to Santa Cruz and visit the museums and art galleries to learn about the local history and traditions.

Several cultural holidays have been adopted from Spain such as Semana Santa, a holy week which takes place the week before Easter. Romerias are also common here; special days where locals honour their patron saint. Religious holidays are usually marked with great occasion with processions and feasts and street entertainment that everyone is welcome to join in on.

Renting a car and driving around the quaint and rustic mountain villages is also a rewarding cultural experience, as you'll encounter many old churches and friendly locals.
