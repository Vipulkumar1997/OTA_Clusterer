How to get there

Driving to Bristol Airport? The postcode to use for your Sat Nav is BS48 3D (use BS48 3DP for the Silverzone car park) – the airport is only 8 miles south of Bristol city centre, benefiting from great transport links making it incredibly easy to get to and from anywhere in the South West!

Travelling by bus or coach is even easier. Airport Flyer Express quickly connects Bristol Airport with Bristol Temple Meads station and Bristol Bus & Coach Station. Especially convenient, since the Bus & Coach station is located right in the city centre and just a stone’s throw from Cabot Circus! The service’s route goes through Bedminster to Bristol Temple Meads, before continuing a circular route through the city centre, calling at Old Market (for Cabot Circus), the Bus & Coach Station, Colston Avenue and Victoria Street. Operating 24/7, the Airport Flyer Express is one of the fastest ways to get to and from the airport – plus, you can pay directly to the driver on board.

Since there isn’t a train station on the actual airport, this fast connection (30 minutes on Flyer Express) to Bristol Temple Meads allows you to quickly access the extensive rail network. There are regular train services running from Bristol to different UK cities, including very frequent services to Bath, South Wales and London.

There are also regular National Express coach services connecting Bristol Airport with Cardiff and South Wales. Then, there is the Bath Bus Company operating a service between Bath and Bristol Airport, running every 30 minutes. Alternatively, once you get to Bristol Bus & Coach Station on Marlborough Street, you can choose from a larger selection of National Express coaches – operating from here to a long list of major cities across the UK.
