Transforming from a quiet fishing village into an international tourism hotspot over the last 30 years, San Antonio holidays have become a key part of the worldwide clubbing scene that has developed in
Ibiza
. A staple in the European music scene, this beautiful area boasts a sandy, man-made beach, palm tree promenades and, of course, world renowned nightclubs. As one of the biggest nightlife resorts on the island, San Antonio hosts the affectionately titled West End strip of bars; yet is also an ideal getaway for families and couples with plenty in store aside from clubbing. Although its clubbing is the most famous thing about San Antonio, its natural beauty is just as deserving, and you can very easily have a wonderful family holiday or romantic getaway here without setting foot in a nightclub at all.

Top Attractions






Take your pick from a wide variety of nightlife options, whether you’re looking for live jazz or the bouncing rhythm of top DJs; San Antonio has you covered. If you are looking to visit the world famous clubs of Pascha or Amnesia, you’ll find them just a short drive away, with a regular bus service taking party goers back and forth.

If you’re looking to party, you’ll have no problem meeting like-minded people. Take part in one of the famous pool parties during the day, foam parties by night or even boat parties on the glittering ocean.

A more diverse location than Ibiza Town, San Antonio holidays suit those who enjoy some variety. While you can certainly take advantage of the island’s nightlife, you can also enjoy the many other fantastic things to do, because San Antonio is about more than just clubbing.

Spend time shopping in the colourful markets, take the kids go-karting or make a splash with the abundance of water sports on offer at the beach. If you're after total relaxation, you could try the nearby resort of Port D'es Torrent with sheltered beaches and great shopping.

Wine and Dine






The culinary scene in San Antonio is varied so you can choose to enjoy a meal in a vine-covered restaurant among the lush landscape, an old converted church or accompanied by live music.
Mealtimes are longer and later than you’re probably used to - grab lunch in a restaurant until as late as 4pm, with dinner being served until very late in the evening.
Café culture is very much part of life here, and you’ll find cafés all over San Antonio serving drinks and snacks, as well as bars where you can relax with some sangria for a long, lazy afternoon. If you want to sample a really authentic drink, ask for the hierbas ibicencas or horchatas.
Typical food menus in San Antonio include a lot of fish and other seafood, as well as tapas and very sweet desserts.

For Families






It’s not all clubbing in San Antonio, and you can have a great family holiday here too.
The Aquarium cap Blanc is full of turtles and fish to feed, and is set in a natural cave. For the grown-ups there’s a small bar as well, and a terrace to relax on.

By the main beach you’ll find a miniature fairground that kids will love, but if you want something more spectacular, there’s the inflatable obstacle course of Ocean Mania where the whole family can have fun splashing around.
The Sirenis Aquagames Water Park is full of slides, pools and tubes, as well as on-site refreshments so you can easily stay there all day.
For getting around and exploring Ibiza, there’s a tourist train that leaves San Antonio for a 2-hour guided trip that even kids will find entertaining.

To take a look at the underwater life in San Antonio, you can try scuba diving, and there are lots of water sports available too.
Hire scooters or go hiking to get around, and you can even play a game of paintball. Go-karting, golf, parasailing, horse riding and quad biking are also waiting for you in San Antonio if it’s an action and adventure holiday you’re looking for.

Nightlife






The nightlife in San Antonio is lively and very varied, with easy access to some of the world’s best and most famous clubs.
You can find clubs with pools, seafront locations and all-night licences without just a few minutes of your hotel, both in San Antonio and surrounding areas. It’s not just holidaymakers who venture out to go clubbing here, but also the locals, so the evening is a great time to meet and socialise.
There are clubs on the shoreline and throughout the famous West End of San Antonio, as well as the Sunset Strip. Music comes from famous DJs, but there are also places to enjoy live music, rock music, and more laid back evenings in bars and late night cafes.
For a really memorable night, you need to find your way into one of the boat parties that depart each night from San Antonio, packed with plenty of other people who want to dance into the night.

For Couples






With its incredible views and secluded places to enjoy them, Ibiza is just perfect for a couples’ holiday.
For a romantic evening, choose one of the restaurants that overlook the sparkling sea. Here you can dine out on the finest tapas, sushi and European cuisine ‘til the sun goes down. An evening meal at Hostal la Torre gives you famous sunset views from tables on the cliffs, while a visit to Hacienda Na Xamena with its clifftop views will take your breath away.
Take a boat ride on the Chilli Pepper Charters for one of their beautiful sunset excursions, with drinks provided and the opportunity to stop for a snorkeling break if you like.
Head for the highest point in Ibiza, Sa Talaia, to see the stunning views, and maybe take a romantic picnic with you so you can make the most of your scenic location.

Culture






Ibiza is usually thought of as a clubbing destination above all other things, but there’s much more to the culture here than simply its excellent and world famous nightlife.
The natural beauty of Ibiza has to be seen to be believed, and among the sights you can see during your holiday in San Antonio is the island of Es Vedra. Take a boat over and find out about the many myths and legends that surround this magical location.
For more history, head to Elvissa Castle, the cathedral, or the Museum of Archaeology.
Wine tasting is an excellent way to absorb some of the flavour of Ibiza, and you can explore some of the vineyards that produce some of the excellent wine on the island.
Find authentic gifts to take home at one of the craft markets, and see what else local artists have produced by visiting the Contemporary Art Museum of Ibiza.
