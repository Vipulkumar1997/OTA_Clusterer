As well as the beautiful beaches and lively resorts, Dalaman is home to ancient sites such as the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Kaunos and the fortified city of Tlos. There are
hot springs
, natural
mud baths
,
enchanting islands
, and several magnificent protected
nature reserves
including the
Marmaris
National Park and the heavenly
blue lagoon
in
Olu Deniz
.

We've got a great range of all-inclusive hotels,
low deposits
and

Why love Dalaman?




You are now staying in
Dalaman
, you have obviously gone straight to the beach hoping to work on your tan all day long while lounging around on those powdery white sands. What’s next? You are lucky because Dalaman is one of the top paragliding destinations in the whole world ...

Top Attractions






The heavenly beaches and coves are the main attraction of the
Dalaman Coast
, which is one of the most beautiful and unspoilt to be found along the
Mediterranean
. One of the best ways to explore this coastline is to take a cruise in a gulet, a traditional Turkish sailing boat. The bustling resorts are well-equipped and inviting, with fantastic amenities and a wide array of water sports including snorkelling and diving.

Other unmissable attractions including the breath taking Blue Lagoon in
Olu Deniz
and the wonderful thermal springs and mud-baths, which have drawn visitors for two millennia, at Dalyan. The UNESCO World Heritage Site of
Kaunos
, the fortified city of Tlos, and the ruins of Hellenic cities such as
Physkos
and
Amos
(both set in the Marmaris National Park) all attest to the importance of this region in ancient times. Visit
Pamukkale
, which means ‘Cotton City’, to admire the ruins of the ancient Greco-Roman city and wallow in the hot springs.

For your typical tourist friendly beach holiday, the must visit resorts include Marmaris, Iclemer,
Fethiye
and Sarigerme.

Wine and Dine






There are restaurants and cafés to suit every palate along the Dalaman Coast, where the resorts are well practised at catering to the tastes of international travellers. There is a fantastic choice of eateries, which range from international chains to simple, family run taverns and award-winning restaurants run by celebrated chefs. Many also offer traditional
Turkish
music and dance.

The wonderful
meze
is a collection of small dishes usually served as a starter: they might include
dolma
(stuffed vegetables), fried
mussels or squid
, marinated fish, fried
pastries
,
greens
in a tasty
yogurt and garlic

sauce
. Main courses are typically
grilled seafood or meat
. Other traditional favourites include
taze fasulye
, green beans with tomato and onion,
kebaps
(skewered lamb, beef or chicken),
kofte
(meatballs),
manti
(dumplings) and
lahmacun
(a pizza-like dish topped with meat and onions).

For Families






The Dalaman region’s fantastic beaches are, of course, a huge part of its appeal. Families are particularly drawn to
Calis Beach
, which has plenty of facilities but remains quiet and laid-back.
Olu Deniz
is another fantastic option for families: the
Blue Lagoon
is exquisitely beautiful, and the waters are calm enough for even the youngest children. Older kids and teenagers will love the enormous range of
water sports
on offer, particularly the wind-surfing and kite-surfing, and energetic kids will enjoy
tramping
through the forested mountains inland in search of
waterfalls and natural swimming pools
. Many of the
ancient sites
, particularly
Pamukkale
and
Kaunos
, will capture the imaginations of children. There are
waterparks
at Marmaris and Olu Deniz with plenty of white-knuckle rides, and kids will also enjoy the
gulet
(traditional Turkish boat) cruises
between the islands. Don’t miss Turtle Beach if you have animal-mad kids – come during nesting season to see the little hatchlings make their way to the water.


Read More about For Families





Action and Adventure






There is action and adventure at every turn in the Dalaman region. One of the most unforgettable things to do is
paraglide from the top of Babadag mountain
all the day down to the beach: the views over
Olu Deniz
and the Blue Lagoon are spectacular. You could also trek along a section of the
Lycian Way
, a magnificent long-distance hiking trail that runs for 540 kilometres between
Fethiye
and Antalya.  The Lycian mountains are also full of fantastic
mountain-biking trails
, which suit cyclists of all levels. And of course you can try your hand at all kinds of
water sports
, from kite-surfing to sea kayaking.


Read More about Action and Adventure







Life's a Beach






There are scores of breathtaking beaches all along the Dalaman Coast, including those in all the main resorts of
Marmaris
, Olu Deniz, Icmeler, Fethiye,
Hisaronu
, Calis Beach, and Sarigerme. Many of them have been awarded Blue Flag status – Icmeler, for example, has no less than three Blue Flag beaches. But the most attractive of them all – perhaps the most beautiful in all Turkey – are the stunning beaches of the
Blue Lagoon
in
Olu Deniz
. All of the resort beaches boast plenty of amenities and great facilities for water sports. Other beaches that are worth a visit include
Iztuzu Beach
(also known as
Turtle Beach
)
,
which is 13 kilometres from Dalyan. These vast, wide strands are beautiful and rarely crowded, and, best of all, are home to endangered loggerhead turtles
(
carretta carretta
).
Sarigerme beach
, located 5 kilometres southwest of Dalaman, is particularly charming and well-kept, and is comparatively uncrowded.

Nightlife






There are plenty of all-inclusive hotels along the Dalaman Coast, which offer all kinds of fantastic entertainment, from
live music

and traditional dance
to bars and nightclubs. If you’re looking for lively nights with plenty of
bars and clubs
, then head to Icmeler,
Fethiye
and neighbouring
Hisaronu
or Marmaris. Bar Street in Marmaris lives up to its name, and is chock-a-block with popular nightspots. If you prefer something quieter and more laid-back, then
Dalyan
is for you. It has plenty of places to enjoy a drink but the nightlife is considerably less intense than in other resorts.
Calis Beach
is also a good option if you’re looking for relaxation and low-key entertainment.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






The Dalaman region is the perfect destination for a romantic holiday. The stunning coastline and
exquisite beaches
are the ideal backdrop for romance, particularly the truly breathtaking Blue Lagoon. You could take a
gulet
(traditional Turkish boat) cruises, and hop between the islands in search of a secluded cove. You can take your pick among dozens of atmospheric
beach clubs
, where you could sip a romantic cocktail at sunset, then follow it up with a
candle-lit dinner
, perhaps with some local music or dancing.
Marmaris
is full of lively clubs if you want to
dance
all night long, or you could enjoy a mud bath or a dip in the natural hot springs at
Pamukkale.

Culture






The Dalaman area is home to two superb UNESCO-designated World Heritage Sites:
Kaunos
, an ancient city which dates back to the 9
th
century BC, and Pamukkale, a spectacularly beautiful Greco-Roman settlement.
Pamukkale
, which is nicknamed ‘Cotton Castle’ in Turkish, is famous for its brilliant white terraces and pools which spill down the side of a steep valley. It is now one of the most visited attractions in Turkey. Both sites are set in extraordinarily beautiful natural settings, and shouldn’t be missed. These are just two of the highlights of a slew of remarkable ancient sites that are found across this region, including magnificent
rock tombs
and
Byzantine ruins
. Many of the resorts and towns, including
Fethiye
, host
traditional markets
where you can admire local crafts and pick up souvenirs.
