How to get there?

Getting to and from Cardiff Airport is simple and straightforward, especially thanks to the excellent public transport links between the airport and Cardiff city centre. If you’re travelling by public transport then you have a wide range of options including the T9 Cardiff Airport Express Bus Service which leaves the city centre every half hour on a daily basis and the 905 bus which runs between Rhoose Rails Interchange, St Athan and Cardiff Airport every day. Travelling by train is also easy and fast; trains run hourly from Cardiff city centre to the airport (once every two hours on Sunday). Once you arrive, there is a cheap shuttle bus service between the station and the airport which takes just ten minutes. Public transport is even simple if you’re travelling from parts of the UK outside of Wales; most major towns and cities are serviced by coach services which will take you to and from Cardiff Airport.

Driving to the airport is equally easy. Just take the exit at junction 33 on the M4 and follow the clear signs along the A4232, A4050, and A4226 which will direct you to the airport. There is a free drop off centre outside the airport, as well as a short stay car park.
