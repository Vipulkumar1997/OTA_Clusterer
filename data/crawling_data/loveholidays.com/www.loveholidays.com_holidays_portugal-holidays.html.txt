Top Attractions






There are plenty of water parks located in and around the coastal resorts of the
Algarve
; head to the Aqualand water park near
Lagos
and let the kids run wild. Portugal is well known for its fantastic golf courses, especially the
Algarve
. What better way to improve your handicap than playing in stunning surroundings and glorious weather? Take the kids to the
Zoomarine
in
Albufeira
where they can see a dolphin show and a sea lion show as well.

Why not take a river cruise in
Porto
, a city steeped in history, here you will be able to visit a Port wine lodge and the beautiful churches set in stunning scenery. Set along a river and the coast, Porto displays its medieval prowess with flair.
Lisbon
, the magical capital of Portugal, is home to winding streets and trundling funiculars, whereas the island of Madeira retains an old world charm and boasts the excellent city of
Funchal
.

Why not head to the Loule Market in
Faro
in the
Algarve
and hunt for some souvenirs and crafts? The market is a tourist hotbed due to its lively atmosphere and market stalls.

Wine and Dine






As you’d rightly expect, Portugal’s cuisine is a traditional feast of sun-ripened fresh vegetables and catch of the day fish from the
Algarve
. Meat features in the form of rich stews and casseroles. Salted cod is a bit of a delicacy, but it can be an acquired taste! For something out of this world, seek out a wild boar ragu or a hunk of crisp spit-roasted pig. Sardines fresh from the fishermen’s nets are another highlight.

Portugal also makes a wide variety of wine, as well as the famous Port and Madeira. It’d be rude not to sample a glass of each of these, but you should also sup a bottle or two of some local Portuguese wines. Reds from the Douro and Dão regions, and whites from
Alentejo
and Minho and particularly worth looking out for. Local beers include Super Bock and Sagres.

For Families






Fancying a family holiday in the sunshine, but after something a little more exotic than Spain’s sunny shores? Why not just hop over the border and into Portugal? From the capital
Lisbon
and the city of Porto to the sun-drenched beaches of the
Algarve
, there’s a whole host of activities, restaurants, places to see, and family-friendly accommodation that will keep every age group happy. Flights to
Faro,
the capital of the Algarve
,
are often cheap, too, which means the whole family can get away without destroying the savings.

Blue Flag beaches dot the Portuguese coastline (why not try the beaches in Vilamoura or
Albufeira
?) and there are plenty of water parks to treat the kids to: Aqualand, Slide and Splash, and Aquashow are three of the best. For slightly older children, a boat trip to the stunning
Azores
- Sao Miguel being the largest. Alternatively,
Funchal
in
Madeira
is an exotic city break with beaches, stunning Portuguese history and excellent hotels.

Action and Adventure






Holidays to Portugal welcome you to some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. Revel in its glorious beaches, explore its crystal clear waters or explore its vast landscapes. The island of
Madeira
is a holiday hotspot for many and boasts a unique blend of vibrant flora and fauna and dainty cobbled streets leading to elegant mansions and striking architecture. Of course, with all this spectacular scenery on display, it would be a shame not to explore picturesque Madeira.

Whether you want to wander the well-worn paths of Portugal by foot or discover its rocky trails on a mountain bike you’ll find plenty of opportunities to traverse the area. With its clear waters and vast marine life, it is no surprise that Portugal is a favourite among divers. Zip yourself into your wetsuit and head deep beneath the sea for an underwater adventure crammed full of colourful fish and stunning reefs.
