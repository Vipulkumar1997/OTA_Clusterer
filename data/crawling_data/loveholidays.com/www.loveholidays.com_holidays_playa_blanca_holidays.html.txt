Top Attractions






Whether you’re looking to spend your days on the sands or at the shops, there is something to make your Playa Blanca holidays memorable.

For Canarian souvenirs, head to Rubicon Marina. With a selection of boutiques, art galleries and markets, you can pick up locally made gifts like pottery, tablecloths and jewellery made from the island’s gemstone, peridot. For even more authentic wares, head to the marina – the artisan markets on Wednesdays and Sundays are your best bet.

If you’d rather feel the sand beneath your toes, take a visit to Playa Dorada – Playa Blanca’s most popular beach. Stretching 300 metres of warm sand, the beach itself is set in a sheltered lagoon that makes it an ideal place for children to play in.For those with an adventurous streak, there is a wealth of water sports to keep you occupied – from jet-skis to banana rides.

After a tough day at the beach, there is nothing better than indulging in some authentic Canarian fare. Take a trip down to the marina for great tapas restaurants and independent bars selling jugs of Sangria – perfect for drinking at the beachside while the sun goes down.

Whether you’re looking to roam its volcanic landscape or explore the multitude of marine life that exists beneath the island’s waters, holidays in Playa Blanca offer inspiration and fun. While the beachfront is home to a number of diving schools, the best way to catch a glimpse of what lies beneath the sea is by climbing aboard a Submarine Safari. Here, you’ll encounter a world only intended for scuba divers as you delve 30 metres under the sea, witnessing rusty shipwrecks and a myriad of fish – ideal for inquisitive little ones.

Those looking to explore Playa Blanca’s history as well as viewing some stunning natural wonders will enjoy a trip to the Green Caves, formed 3000 years ago during the eruptions of a volcano. Experience the 6 km-long winding tunnels and dark crevices while learning about the local population that once hid from pirates in the centre of these enchanting caves.

Wine and Dine






Venture along Playa Blanca’s promenade and you’ll find a wealth of places to eat and drink. Sample the local speciality, delicious Canarian salted potatoes served with either red or green spicy ‘Mojo’ sauce, before being blended with coriander and chilli.

As a popular tourist resort, Playa Blanca also has many international eateries, offering up fare from Greek to Chinese, as well as a whole host of traditional Spanish tapas restaurants. For those that enjoy a tipple, there are a variety of bars serving chilled jugs of sangria, perfect for sipping on the seafront.

For Families






Beaches, national parks and child-friendly resorts mean that Playa Blanca is great for the entire family. Beaches are a popular option for most, allowing adults to kick back and relax whilst their children enjoy the sunshine and sand. Playa Flamingo is a favourite for those with little ones due to its calm and shallow waters.

If you’re looking for more Playa Blanca attractions, fun for all the family can be found in the Marina Rubicon. This harbour can be found in the heart of Playa Blanca and offers a range of activities and sports facilities for all to enjoy.

Action and Adventure






Home to a large yacht marina, Playa Blanca is the ideal spot for some sea fishing and is an even better place to top up your tan. Why not join one of the many excursions that leave the old harbour and enjoy a relaxing day on the open waves? Alternatively, take a scuba diving trip and view the beautiful marine life that inhabits the ocean surrounding the island. As well as deep sea diving, another of Playa Blanca’s attractions are the submarines that take visitors deep into the ocean. With a menagerie of fish and sea life in their natural habitat, journeying 200 metres beneath the sea will most certainly reward you with some phenomenal sights – can you really think of anything more breath-taking?

Life's a Beach






For spectacular sea views and beachside relaxation, look no further than Playa Blanca holidays. The main strip alongside Papagayo Beach is home to many luxury hotels, boasting swimming pools, Jacuzzis and spa facilities for your leisure – ideal for couples looking for a quiet retreat. If you’re seeking an action-packed break, you’ll love staying at the centre of the action with immediate access to the wealth of water sports available.

Meanwhile, families will relish some of the great accommodation on offer – with on-site kids’ clubs dedicated to entertaining the little ones while you settle yourself by the pool with a well-deserved drink. As well as the obvious attraction of quiet beaches and year-round sunshine, Playa Blanca lends itself well to rest and relaxation.

The natural beauty of the town is great for meditation and mindfulness and there are many modern spas to be enjoyed. Alternatively, take a ferry to the secluded beaches of Graciosa, a small, neighbouring island. This spot is a hit with tourists for its tranquil and untouched feel. Explore by foot or hire a bicycle to make your way around the island – it truly is a perfect way to complete an unforgettable day exploring one of
Spain
’s most stunning corners. If you’re looking for some of the top things to do in Lanzarote, discovering its inherent beauty is simply a must.

Nightlife






Playa Blanca is the quieter of the resorts in Lanzarote but there is still plenty to do when the sun goes down. There are lots of bars that spill out onto the beach and offer food and drink late into the night. At the Marina Rubicon you will find lots of restaurants and bars all close together and the promenade is lined with eating and drinking establishments. Marina Rubicon is also where you will find up-market parties, look around for glamorous yacht parties. This is also where the famous Café Del Mar is, known for it’s excellent DJ’s and chilled out vibe.

In Punta Limones you will find some more of the touristy end of nightlife with karaoke bars and Irish pubs as well as a disco for some cheesy dancing!

For Couples






Spend your days sipping cocktails on the beautiful white sandy beach, or swim in the crystal clear waters found here.

Enjoy a walk up Montana Roja; which might look daunting from sea level but is in fact a very steady walk, rewarding the both of you with stunning views of surrounding areas.

Take a stroll over to Marina Rubicon along the town’s promenade, where twice a week a market takes place in the morning. If you go early enough, you'll be able to see the sunrise. Everything from handmade souvenirs to local wines can be purchased at the market, and it’s a great way to experience the local way of life.

Culture






The culture of Lanzarotte (and also that of Playa Blanca) has been largely influenced by prolonged contact with Spain. Locals have adopted many traditions from Spain, as well as much of its cuisine. However, the inhabitants of the Canary Islands speak a unique dialect of Spanish. Lucha Canaria is a unique local sport found across the Canary Islands; it’s similar to sumo wrestling, as contestants try to throw each other to the ground inside a ring.

An old watchtower built in the 1700's, Castillo de las Coloradas stands on the headland of Punta del Aquilla. Not far from Playa Blanca and just a couple of hundred meters to the east of Marina Rubicon, it’s definitely worth a visit. Also, be sure to take a look at the Nuestra Senora del Carmen, the Catholic Church in the town of Playa Blanca.
