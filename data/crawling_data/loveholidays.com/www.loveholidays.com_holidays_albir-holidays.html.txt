Seeking a peaceful beach destination for your 2018 holiday? Take a trip to Albir and you’ll find plenty of ways to kick back and relax; it’s got everything from its scenic surroundings to its alluring national parks. While bustling
Benidorm
is just around the corner, Albir offers a glimpse at
Spain
’s quieter side. Its iconic neighbour might be jam-packed with neon-lit bars and endless water sports, but it’s Albir that has managed to retain much of its old-world charm, making it a firm favourite for a family getaway.

If you’d rather embrace a quieter setting by day and an all-night party vibe come sundown, Albir is the ideal destination. While the small-town feel of this stunning resort serves as the ultimate chance to unwind, it’s easy to get a taxi to Benidorm’s busy centre when you’re in search of drinks and dancing. It’s unsurprising then, that Albir appeals to everyone from young families to older couples and those seeking group getaways. Whether you’re heading off on a quiet trip with your little ones, or looking for a beach holiday that gives you the best of both worlds, a 2018 holiday in Albir should be top of your list.

Top Attractions






Aside from its beautifully bright-coloured buildings and stunning vistas, Albir offers plenty to keep everyone entertained. The main town, L’Alfas del Pi, is set inland from the beach and stretches along the coast. Take a leisurely stroll and you’ll find a great mixture of shops, restaurants and bars. Further out, you’ll discover scenic olive groves and hamlets, set against the backdrop of the magnificent hills that lead through to the nearby town of Alta.

If you’re looking to embrace nature on your getaway, head straight for the nature park adjacent to Albir’s beach. Based around the mountain of Sierra Helda, this spot is ideal for hikers and bikers seeking out Spain’s native wildlife as well as a spot of exercise. Follow the clifftop trail to the old lighthouse and when you’ve arrived at the top, you’ll be rewarded with views of the town’s multi-coloured boats bobbing along the water.

Wine and Dine






Alicante’s cuisine is varied and delicious, and Albir itself is no different. Influenced by neighbouring areas, you’ll experience an enticing mix of international dishes, including fresh fish and seafood, as well as heartier local dishes. Tasty homemade stews and soups feature highly on most menus, and in some of Albir’s tucked-away restaurants you’ll sample some of the most authentic Spanish offerings.

Of course, a trip to this part of Spain is incomplete without tasting the area’s delicious tapas dishes. You’ll find a number of traditional bars in Albir’s main town, boasting everything from chorizo sausage dishes to sizzling garlic prawns. Tapas Alley in nearby Benidorm is well worth a visit, with plenty of flavours to sample.

During a holiday in Albir, you’ll never fail to find something sweet. While a range of desserts can be found on most menus, the area is most famed for its excellent nougat. Visit one of the many souvenir shops near the beachfront to get your fill of the sticky-sweet treat, as well an opportunity to bag some take-home souvenirs.

For Families






Albir’s beautiful beach is a real pull-factor for families with little ones looking to enjoy long lazy days on the coast. But when the kids are bored of building sandcastles, paddling in the sea and making the most of its range of water sports, there are more than enough places to visit in the surrounding area.

Terra Mitica, one of Europe’s biggest theme parks, is just a short drive away and makes for an excellent day trip for the entire family. Inspired by the five civilisations of the Mediterranean, kids will have great fun as they navigate the exciting rides. Big kids in particular can enjoy the thrill-inducing scares of the Roman-inspired ‘Flight of the Phoenix’, while the hair-raising ‘Falls of the Nile’ is a water ride guaranteed to get the whole family soaked! If your little ones have a real passion for waterparks, visit nearby Aqualandia for a welcome break from the sunshine. Then, the next day why experience Spain’s answer to SeaWorld?

Action and Adventure






Albir holidays offer the perfect opportunity to enjoy the Spanish sunshine while trying out some exciting sporting activities. If its water sports you’re after, Albir’s beach is the best place to head for. Whether you’re a seasoned pro at sailing, kayaking and parasailing, or you just fancy a go, there’s more than enough to keep you occupied here.


Those on holiday with kids might like to try some adrenalin-fuelled go-karting one afternoon. There are two different trails to be found near resort, sure to entice the competitive families! Alternatively, take the short trip to Benidorm and you’ll find even more activities to choose from. Try horse riding, scuba-diving or waterskiing (although not all at the same time), and take home some lifelong memories.

Life's a Beach






Albir’s main draw is its golden sandy beach, a scenic stretch that offers the perfect spot for sunbathing, swimming and relaxing. Awarded Blue Flag Status, it’s no surprise that visitors flock to its safe shores. You’ll find sun loungers dotted around, as well as a number of activities to keep everyone entertained. There’s a designated water sports centre on the beach, offering lessons on everything from parasailing and ocean-kayaking to waterskiing and doughnut-riding. Whether you’re a seasoned professional or a beginner with bags on enthusiasm, there’s a wealth of activities waiting for you.

Beyond Albir you’ll find some of
Alicante
’s top beach spots, including a bustling sandy stretch situated down the road in Benidorm. Things are likely to be busier here, with plenty of beachside attractions and bars serving up refreshing drinks alongside live music in the evening.

Nightlife






Perfect for those looking for the best of both worlds, Albir’s proximity to Benidorm is great for laid-back evenings and all-night parties. This small resort town might be quiet, but it has its fair share of restaurants and bars, offering an idyllic spot for a quiet drink or a romantic meal. If you’re lucky, you might even stumble across some live music in one of the seafront bars. The town really livens up during festival season, especially on the first weekend of May, when the Fiesta de la Crueta takes place. Expect live acts, bustling streets and plenty of food and drinks.

For those looking to up the ante, Benidorm is just ten minutes away by taxi. When it comes to bars, restaurants and clubs, you’ll be spoilt for choice too. Head down to the beach bars for laid-back entertainment and long drinks, or head to the ever-popular Benidorm Square, where you’ll experience the best in lively pubs and disco clubs. Many of the clubs stay open until late, with one closing its doors at 7am – leaving you just enough time to get a taxi back to Albir and enjoy a hotel breakfast.

For Couples






If you fancy keeping things low-key, or crave a quiet place away from the bigger and brasher resorts of Alicante, a holiday in Albir should be at the top of your list. Its quiet shorelines and photo-worthy landscapes make for a particularly romantic backdrop, while its excellent restaurants provide plenty in the way of authentic cuisine.

With surroundings that speak for themselves, there’s nothing more romantic than a leisurely walk. Take the trail up to the Old Lighthouse – at a gentle pace. It’ll take you around an hour but you’ll be rewarded with pretty coastal views as you walk. If you fancy venturing out further, the small town of Altea isn’t too far away. There’s a swathe of golden sand to land your beach towel, as well the cobbled streets of the old town that lead to a beautiful domed church – great for a quiet day away from the resort.

Culture






A holiday to Albir wouldn’t be complete without a dose of culture. Although you won’t find a wealth of ancient ruins and historical attractions to uncover in this part of Alicante, Albir has its own glamorous heritage that’s waiting to be explored. Take a stroll along the promenade and you’ll see that it is adorned with stars depicting the names of Spain’s biggest film stars. It is Spain’s homage to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, so make sure not to miss a stroll along the star-studded walkway.

The town of L’Alfas del Pi, just a ten minute drive away, hosts its own film festival each summer. Big names in Spanish cinema descend on the town, as well as numerous film fanatics. You'll enjoy film screenings and plenty of pop-up food and drink stalls at Spain’s version of Cannes Film Festival. It’s a must for any movie-lover, offering the perfect excuse to head off on holiday to Albir this year.
