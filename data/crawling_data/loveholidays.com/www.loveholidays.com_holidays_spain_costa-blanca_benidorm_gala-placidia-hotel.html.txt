If location is one of the key criteria for picking your holiday accommodation then the Gala Placidia Hotel places you perfectly to enjoy Britain’s favourite Spanish resort. It’s 500m from the famous Levante Beach and around 1km from the epicentre of the resort. Popular with both couples, families, and groups, Gala Placidia Hotel is fantastic value, especially if you go all-inclusive.

The Gala Placidia Hotel has 135 twin rooms for up to four guests, all with air conditioning, en-suite bathrooms, satellite TV, and extra security, soundproofing, Wi-Fi, or balcony views among the extras available.

All-inclusive packages include buffet or restaurant dining with drinks for all your meals; snacks throughout the day; and a bar from 10am to midnight. Deals also include access to the hotel’s spa.

To entertain you on site you’ll find games – pool, darts, ping pong – and a pool. Each night there is entertainment to get you into the Costa spirit.

Levante beach is just down the road. There you’ll find a famously lively crowd enjoying the sun or excellent water sports and entertainment. If you fancy something more tranquil, that’s easily found simply by walking a little further along the coast to Poniente beach, which opens up into a wilder and more secluded coast line.

There’s lots of choice in the town too. The centre is famous for its fantastic nightlife and internationally recognised clubbing. But there’s also a beautiful old town up on the hill with beautiful views and some wonderful traditional dining and drinking.

Benidorm is family friendly too, with the massive Terra Mitica and Paramount Pleasure Park theme parks just the latest of the kid-friendly attractions that can throw some adventure and adrenaline into your sunshine break.

The Gala Placidia Hotel puts you in just the right place to explore and enjoy every aspect of this – and the tour desk will help you book your excursions – at fantastic value prices.
