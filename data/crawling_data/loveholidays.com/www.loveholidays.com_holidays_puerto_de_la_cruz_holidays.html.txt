If you’re looking for that idyllic combination of old and new or bustling and peaceful then look no further than holidays to Puerto de La Cruz. This is by far the most popular holiday hotspot in the whole of
Tenerife
and yet much of the resort town, as well as its surrounding area, has managed to hold on to its traditional charm.

In addition to being the number one destination in Tenerife, this northern coastal town is also considered to be one of the most beautiful and best places to visit in the whole of the
Canary Islands
. The secret to Puerto de La Cruz’s success is its ability to appeal to every type of holidaymaker, from families to young nightlife lovers.

The island of Tenerife is synonymous with idyllic beach getaways, blessing visitors with the presence of stunning strips of volcanic sands and mesmerising blue waters, all backed by modernised and luxurious resorts, something you only come to know during your Puerto de la Cruz holidays. You’ll encounter fun-filled activities and ultimate romance on the island of Tenerife, with water sports opportunities found throughout the day, and waterfront dining enjoyed in the evening.

While the islands of
Spain
are well regarded as action-packed, party havens, you’ll find it easy to escape to your own slice of serenity and relaxation during your holidays to Puerto de la Cruz, whether this means relaxing on the soft sand with a good book, sipping cocktails as the sun sets, or meandering around the resort’s beautiful botanical gardens.

Top Attractions






You won’t find all the water-based thrills designated to the ocean, in the old town of Puerto de la Cruz you will find the impressive natural salt water swimming pools designed by the famous architect/landscaper Cesar Manrique. The breath-taking Lido Martianez includes seven pools, changing facilities, subtropical trees and plants, a huge fountain, a Jacuzzi, playground equipment, restaurants, and even an underground dance hall and casino – proving to be the ideal setting for a family day out, particularly if you need a break from the sand during your holidays in Puerto de la Cruz.

For a little more action during your time in the resort, those that are accustomed to trying to catch the surf during their beach breaks will do well in visiting the petty little beach of Playa Jardin. In addition to decent waves, there are also numerous palm trees here providing shade in which to relax. Beach bums will never run out of things to do around Puerto de la Cruz, just make sure you indulge in all of the area’s many stunning beaches, among them Bollullo and Jardin Beach, while more lovely strips of sand can be found in neighbouring Santa Ursula.

While on your holidays to Puerto de la Cruz, bear in mind that the nearby town of Orotava is a delight for culture vultures, while the surrounding countryside, in particular the Orotava Valley, is a real sight for sore eyes and is great for hiking.

End your day by visiting the old port area of Puerto de la Cruz and ducking into one of the many excellent restaurants on offer – the seafood is our recommendation. Also known as Lido Martianez, this complex of lakes and pools is one of the most popular days out in Puerto de la Cruz. It is great value at around €3 and you can easily spend the whole day here, with its wide range of swimming areas, cafés, bars and nightlife. The whole complex is lit up at night and makes a great place for dinner al fresco. There is even a casino here that is under the lake.

Wine and Dine






Puerto de la Cruz has a large array of highly rated local Spanish and Canary restaurants located throughout town, especially in the old town. Local specialities include Papas Arrugadas; potatoes boiled in salt water and served with mojo picon (spicy sauce) and mojo verde (green sauce).

Seafood is commonly encountered, due to the close proximity to the coastline. This can range from a simple meal consisting of grilled fish garnished with lemon, to more elaborate local dishes such as Caldereta and Sanocho Canario.

Be sure to try out Bienmesabe; a local dessert which consists of almond cream mixed with honey, eggs and rum.

Due to a well established tourism industry in Puerto de la Cruz, you will find several international restaurants, usually run by ex-pats. This is always a good alternative if you feel yourself getting tired of local dishes!

For Families






When you get tired of the beaches as a family, there are plenty of activities and day trips that will keep you and the children occupied. Loro Parque is definitely worth a visit if you are a fan of zoos.

Children and adults alike will enjoy the huge wildlife park that has daily dolphin and orca shows in one of the largest aquariums in Europe, parrot and bird of prey shows, and mountain gorillas. This is a truly unique day out where you will also see one of the largest populations of penguins outside the Antarctic!

Visit the tiny town of Pueblo Chico which is a miniature version of the Canary Islands in fantastic detail, guaranteed to entertain everyone. Near the miniature village you will find Oasis del Valle, an animal sanctury with goats, donkeys, llamas and even camels. Lago Martianez and Plaza Charco are water parks with slides and swimming pools.

Action and Adventure






Truly one of the most exciting things to do is to rent a motorbike or scooter and drive around the magical coastal roads; rewarding you with breathtaking views of the surrounding scenery. Car hire is available in Puerto de la Cruz if you don't feel comfortable with the notion of riding a motorcycle.

Enjoy an adventurous walk through the Otorava valley, not far out of town. This beautiful natural wonder attracts visitors from far and wide and is a must see for anybody into hiking or walking.

Perhaps you want to try something new? You can book a Segway tour through Puerto de la Cruz, which will also take you around the surrounding areas.

Spend a day at Costa Martinez; a wonderful local water park with plenty of open space for sunbathing and several pools for a refreshing escape from the sun!

Why not visit Loro Parque? This large zoo features shows put on by many of its diverse inhabitants, and is always a fun day out.

Life's a Beach






Colourful, filled with character and always soaked in sunlight, Puerto de La Cruz has a huge selection of beaches for guests to enjoy. Ranging from secluded little coves to busy bays brimming with water sports, you can rest assured that you’ll find your ideal bay here.

For breathtaking views, opt for Playa Jardin and its surrounding sub-tropical scenery. If it's peace and quiet you’re after, spend the day and the dramatically rugged Playa Bullillo - you won’t find many tourists at this rocky shore.

Playa Martianez is your best bet for fun filled action and water sports as well as tourist facilities. It’s not just beach bunnies who are perfectly catered to in Puerto de La Cruz.

Nightlife






The town is known to really come to life by night, when an eclectic selection of clubs, bars and pubs open up and welcome in a blended crowd of holidaymakers and locals. One of the best ways to start of the evening is to have a drink in one of the bars that line the central square and watch people go by on a terrace. Calle Agustin de Bethencourt is a good area for local bars and places where you can get a drink and tapas. Listen to live music at the Irish bar or some jazz at Abaco which is housed in an 18
th
century mansion. Lots of bars stay open late and locals won’t head to them until after midnightfor cocktails, DJ’s and salsa. For clubbing, Vampis is the most popular but there is plenty of choice for partying until 3am.

For Couples






Your romantic holiday to Puerto de la Cruz will incorporate a large variety of activities, from lounging around on the beach to exploring the surrounding natural beauty. Check out the many rustic and quaint local restaurants and taverns for unforgettable dinner dates. Enjoy a moonlight walk along the beach, or rent a car to drive along the coast for breathtaking views of the magnificent coastline.

Take a visit to Lago Martianez; a wonderful post-modern swimming and sunbathing complex, which was designed by the famous Lanzarotte architect Cesar Manrique. This magical spot is an ideal place to relax and is only made better by the fact that it doesn't cost much to get in. Parasols and sun beds are included in the price.

Make sure to visit the famous Botanical gardens, which are a must-see to anyone interested in landscaped gardens and exotic fauna.

Culture






Carnaval, as the locals know it, is the annual spectacular that happens to celebrate the beginning of Lent. The amazing street parades and parties are not to be missed if you are on holiday in Tenerife at the right time. You will see all sorts of weird and wonderful traditions including the drag queen race and the burning of the sardine!

Fiesta de Cacharrosis s gloriously anarchic and fun event where all the children of the town drag pots and pans through the streets to make as much noise as they possibly can! Another child centred event is the toboggan run where children ride wooden sledges down steep streets into a pile of old tires at the bottom!

Midsummer is celebrated here with the festival of San Juan, huge bonfires are lit as well as fireworks.
