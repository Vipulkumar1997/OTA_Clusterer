For Couples






Holidays in Malta are perfect for romance: the historic towns of Valletta and

Active types will enjoy hiking, particularly in beauty spots like the
Delimara Peninsula
, where you can take a dip in the refreshing water of the
St Peter's Pool
. Why not explore the island's underwater treasures together?
Gozo island
is famed for its gorgeous marine life while neighbouring
Comino
is home to the Blue Lagoon. You can get the ferry from

Waves of settlers on Malta over many centuries have bequeathed a host of cultural treasures, from the beautifully preserved historic towns like the capital
Valletta
to a slew of ancient burial sites. Most romantic of these are the
Hagar Qim
and
Mnajdra temples
, set on a remote clifftop and surrounded by carpets of wildflowers.

If you are looking for dancing and nightlife on your Malta holiday, there's so much to keep you occupied in
St Julian's

Culture






The Maltese islands are home to the
Hal Saflieni Hypogeum
, a labyrinthine necropolis which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the most extraordinary archaeological sites in the world. The magnificent megalithic ruins, scattered across the islands, also enjoy World Heritage status and include the oldest free-standing monuments in the world, the Ggantija on
Gozo
.

Waves of settlers have left their mark on Malta over the centuries, notably in the perfectly preserved capital
Valletta
, built by the Knights of St John and still ringed by the defensive walls. The fortress city of
Mdina
, now almost swallowed up by
Rabat
, was built by the Arabs and remains an alluring time-capsule full of handsome palaces and delightful squares. On Gozo, the capital
Victoria
is home to a mishmash of cultures, and there's plenty of towers, fortresses and chapels spread out over the island too.

Malta plays host to a series of vibrant festivals and events throughout the year. Highlights include the spectacular Malta Fireworks Festival (late April), the Malta Jazz Festival, held in
Valletta
's picturesque Grand Harbour in July, and the island-wide Malta Arts Festival, which takes place in late June/early July.
