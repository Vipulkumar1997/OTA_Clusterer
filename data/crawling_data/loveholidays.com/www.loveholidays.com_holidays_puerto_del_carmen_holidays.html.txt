Puerto del Carmen Holidays 2018 / 2019

Located on the southeast coast of
Lanzarote
, Puerto del Carmen blends traditional charm with modern
all inclusive
hotels and amenities, ideal for a holiday in 2018 / 2019. Set amongst crystal clear waters next to stunning golden beaches with a backdrop of striking volcanic hills, Puerto del Carmen is a permanent hit with holidaymakers of all ages, and a great alternative to the popular
Costa Teguise
.

From laid back beach days to discovering incredible national parks, the year round sunshine in Lanzarote and Puerto del Carmen means you can enjoy all the resort has to offer. Puerto del Carmen is a former fishing village which is still home to the
El Varadero
harbour where you can enjoy uninterrupted sea views, alongside bobbing boats. Aside from the old town that has authentic eateries, the rest of the town has been transformed into a purpose-built holiday resort, meaning you can make the most of the restaurants and bars on the Avenida de las Playas, the main street which hugs the beach.

With a trio of clean and quiet Blue Flag beaches to chill out on, 2018 / 2019 holidays to Puerto del Carmen are made for sun worshipers. The crystal clear waters and plenty of small coves will also open your eyes to a range of water sports on offer here.

Top Attractions






From beautiful traditional architecture to award winning beaches, Puerto del Carmen holidays have a lot to offer you. More than just a sight-seeing and sunbathing destination, this resort has the best of the outdoors and shopping. Whether you're exploring Timanfaya National Park, roaming further afield to nearby Costa Teguise, or simply relaxing on Puerto del Carmen's all inclusive hotel sun loungers, there's plenty to see and do in this popular Lanzarote resort.

If you want to do some shopping and find some authentic
Canary Island
products, head to the
Plaza Varadero
near the old harbour. Each Friday a vibrant street market descends on the square, offering around 100 stalls featuring locally sourced fruit, vegetables and flowers, as well as handmade craft items, jewellery and clothes.

For music lovers, plan your holiday to Puerto del Carmen at the end of July to watch the vibrant
Fiesta de Carmen
which has folklore performances, plus singing and dancing. Or visit the legendary Music Hall Tavern which hosts shows every night, including a drag show.

Lanzarote Golf offers you the chance to tee off on a splendid 18 hole course. Close to Puerto del Carmen, the American designed golf course is flanked by lush greens, palm trees and lake, set with the dramatic backdrop of volcanoes and the Atlantic Ocean.

Wine and Dine






The cuisine of Puerto del Carmen is like many of the other Canary Islands, combining Spanish dishes with Latin American and African influences. Tapas is popular in most restaurants and Lanzarote staples like Las Torrijas which consists of sweet maize fritters with honey and aniseed are speciality desserts.

The local Puerto del Carmen and Lanzarote wines made with grapes cultivated on the volcanic grounds are delicious accompaniments to your meal.

For the most authentic meal, feast in Puerto del Carmen's Old Town and enjoy views of the
Los Ajaches Mountains
. As one of the best restaurants on the island, Tegala serves traditional Canarian cuisine with a twist. Also in Old Town, near the harbour is
Los Marineros
which specialises in Spanish cuisine and hosts a nightly barbeque.

Casa Roja’s waterfront location means that fish is definitely on the menu and you can also enjoy your meal in an atmospheric setting. Still in the harbour, Puerto Bahia has brilliant views across to the neighbouring island of
Fuerteventura
, with modern interpretation of classic Spanish dishes on the menu.

For Families






Both the adults and children will lap up the Puerto del Carmen family attractions. From the huge theme park of
Rancho Texas
with its diverse wildlife and wild west theme, to go-karting on the nearby track, this resort will suit all ages.

If you fancy taking a family hike, only 15 minutes away is the Lanzarote natural wonder of Timanfaya National Park, formed from volcanic ridges and rock formations. Or if you want a unique experience, take a camel ride through the lava fields of the Timanfaya National Park to see why they’re known as the Fire Mountains.

If everyone in your family is over the age of eight then they can walk underwater. Sea Trek allows you to see the wonderful sea life without getting your hair wet. All you have to do is but on a futuristic helmet and go on a 45 minute underwater tour.

Action and Adventure






Puerto del Carmen is an adventurers dream, and there's plenty to see on the rest of Lanzarote, too. With high volcanic peaks in
Timanfaya National Park
and deep waters with an abundance of marine life, there is lots for you to explore.

Because the sea has remarkable visibility in Puerto del Carmen, scuba diving is very popular. Get close-up to moray eels, rays and groupers, whilst you explore the reefs in the shallows before diving down to underwater canyons as well as the wrecks of Los Erizos.

If you’d rather fly high, then go hang gliding or paragliding off the beach, or from the peaks in Timanfaya. You’ll enjoy views of Lanzarote as you’re carried by the wind from all directions.

As every year Puerto Del Carmen hosts the Lanzarote IronMan triathlon, many holidaymakers get into the event’s spirit and hire mountain bikes or hike the international course.

Life's a Beach






The resort is famed for its Blue Flag beaches, so you can relax on clean golden sands on your Puerto del Carmen holiday. With over six kilometres of beaches and plenty of sun loungers and parasols, you can enjoy the beach in comfort.

As the largest beach in the area,
Playa Grande
is equipped with lifeguards, along with restaurants and shops on the waterfront. To the east,
Los Pocillos
is exposed to the elements, making it the ideal spot for windsurfing.

For a quieter setting,
Matagorda beach
is ideal for sunbathing and playing in the sand with little ones, and also offers bike hire. Also ideal for soaking up the sun, El Barranquillo is a small sheltered, picturesque beach.

Ten minutes away from Puerto del Carmen in the old town is Playa Chica which is much more secluded and peaceful. There’s a dive centre making it popular with snorkellers and scuba divers.

Nightlife






Puerto del Carmen comes to life by night with bars, nightclubs and casinos to keep you entertained into the late hours. The resort has the busiest nightlife on Lanzarote with lots of live music and disco bars.

The main centres of Centro Atlantico on the main strip of Avenida de las Playas have the greatest amount of clubs, as well as the Old Town near the harbour. Club 18-30 is also in the town, enhancing Puerto del Carmen's lively reputation.

Take a walk down The Strip to see what Puerto del Carmen has to offer after hours. Dance the night away at the Rumm disco or rock out at Route 66. You'll soon see why Puerto del Carmen beats off rivals - like Costa Teguise - to be the best place for nightlife on Lanzarote.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






Lanzarote is an island where the sun shines all year, which will make your couples holiday to Puerto del Carmen unforgettable. It is no wonder that many proposals, weddings and honeymoons occur on
Lanzarote
beaches.

You will both enjoy a trip to the
Jardin de Cactus
, 20 minutes outside of Puerto del Carmen. This cactus garden, located in a disused mine, is designed by artist Cesar Manrique where you will find 10,000 cacti from all over the world on display. You could also roam the
Timanfaya National Park
and look down on spectacular views of Lanzarote.

Culture






Puerto del Carmen has a packed calendar full of holy days, festivals and carnivals known across Lanzarote. If you're planning a holiday in late February, revel at the Carnival, or if you’re visiting in July, then don’t miss the folk singing, dancing and vibrant processions at the Feast of St Carmen, patron saint of the city and fishermen.

Iglesia de Nuestra Señora del Carmen is a stunning piece of architecture built in a typical Spanish ecclesiastic style that sits in harbour of the old town.

Nearby and new to the area is the Museum of Canarian Whales and Dolphins at Puerto Calero. The small museum is free to enter, as is the art gallery next door.
