Stylish, comfortable and located in the heart of buzzing Playa de las Americas, the 3-star Las Piramides hotel is a great choice for a fun-packed holiday in Tenerife. From the moment you step inside, you know you’re in for a treat – the chic, modern interiors really make Las Piramides stand out.

Rooms at Las Piramides are spacious and fitted with every convenience you’ll need for a relaxing stay, including kitchenettes, en-suite bathrooms and satellite TV. The buffet restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, and features cooking stations where you can get up close to the culinary action. Drinks, lunch and snacks are available from the pool bar, so you don’t have to give up your sun lounger when you fancy an ice cream.

With two outdoor pools and one for the kids, there’s ample space for swimming and sunbathing. But what makes Las Piramides so fantastic is its location, as it's just a short walk to the centre of Playa de las Americas, Tenerife's most popular resort. Sun-lovers and sports enthusiasts alike will adore the beaches, with their golden sands and watersports facilities. There's a wealth of bars and clubs to keep night owls happy, and it's just a short drive from Las Piramides to Siam Park - one of the world's best waterparks.
