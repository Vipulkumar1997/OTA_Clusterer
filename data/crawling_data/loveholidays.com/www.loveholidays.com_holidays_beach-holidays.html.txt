Spain






We’ve talked about the Canaries and the Balearics, all technically Spanish, but mainland Spain offers even more for your beach holidays 2018 / 2019. You can choose from the fantastic Costa Blanca, the dazzling
Costa Brava
and the eternally sunny Costa del Sol.

The famed Costa Blanca and the iconic resort of
Benidorm
has long been a favourite beach holiday destination. Because of cheap flights, good deals on hotels and a range of all inclusive hotels to pick from, Benidorm has remained immensely popular for holidays, including the elusive beach
city breaks holidays
.

There’s three top seaside destinations in
Costa Blanca
but we'll focus around
Benidorm
. First is
Playa de Levante
, the sandy heart of Benidorm. Perfect for families, Levante is a Blue Flag beach, staffed by a team of lifeguards and boasting perfect sandcastle sand. At night, the
playa
comes alive, and the bars, cafes, restaurants and shops teem with activity.

Poniente Beach
is enormous, and lies just west of old town. You’re bound to find a spot to relax in 2019, as Poniente Beach is generally less crowded than its Costa Blanca neighbours. With all the usual facilities and sunbeds, Poniente has spotless sands and caters perfectly to all age groups. At night, Poniente is a little more quiet than Levante, but still boasts its fair share of restaurants and cafes.

Malpas Beach
is a smaller, slightly different beach to the other Benidorm Costa Blanca beaches. Just next to the harbour, below the cliffs, Malpas Beach is a small and delightful playa and is usually not as crowded as its neighbours. Perfect for relaxing beach holidays.

However, if Benidorm isn't your cup of tea, or if you've been before, what about
Torremolinos
along the Costa del Sol in 2018 / 2019?
Lloret de Mar
is in the heart of Costa Brava and a firm family favourite. Keep searching for your perfect
playa
holiday!

Balearic Islands






The Balearics are all about the beaches for your 2018 / 2019 holidays and are immensely popular for Brits looking for the best beach holidays. These spanish islands' popularity might be something to do with the wide range of resorts and all inclusive hotels available, or the tempting deals available whilst booking a beachfront hotel. Don't forget the cheap flights and packages for 7 nights holidays!

Majorca is an all-time holiday favourite and its waiting for your 2018 / 2019 holidays! From the quiet holidays in
Alcudia
(Alcanada comes to mind) to the bustling
Playa de Cala Mayor
close to the capital city of
Palma
,
Majorca
has a beach that’ll suit your holiday desires. Majorca has all inclusive luxury, beach siestas and beachfront hotels. We’d say look no further for your 2018 / 2019 beach holiday, but we have so much more to tell you.

Ibiza and Menorca make are great Balearics alternatives.
Ibiza
is the queen of party nights, and Menorca is the complete opposite. From stamping feet on Ibiza beaches to the secluded coastal rambling on
Menorca
, we like to think that Majorca finds the middle-ground between the three islands.

With this range of choice, and cheap flights, the
Balearics
are a superior destination for a truly unforgettable beach holiday.

Portugal & The Algarve






Holidays to Spain might seem appealing right now, but don't forget about
Portugal
in 2018 / 2019. Although there are some amazing coasts on offer around the worls, it’ll take a lot to beat some of the sandy spots along the
Algarve
in Portugal, plus the deals on cheap flights and all inclusive coastal resorts make Portugal pretty irrestible for your next beach holidays.

From
Lagos
in the west, all the way along the 200km stretch of coastline to
Olhao
in the East, the Algarve sports some of the finest beaches in the world, making it one of our favourite seaside holidays. We like to compare it to the
Costa del Sol
, although each
praia
on the Algarve retains its own, unique charm.

Central Algarve is the most popular because of its concentration of fantastic beaches and excellent all inclusive beachfront hotels, plus flights into Faro are often stunningly cheap.
Albufeira
is queen and the coastline here is breathtaking. Our top picks of the bunch are
Praia dos Pescadores
and
Praia da Oura
, right in the heart of Albufeira. This is one of the most bustling beaches, and along the seafront promenade, you’ll find restaurants, bars and the hubbub of the Algarve.

Don’t worry. The magic is the fact that you can get away from the crowds relatively easily. With so many beaches that are hard to reach, far from the beach hotels, there are plenty of opportunities for a moment of seclusion.
Falesia Beach
is a classic, and the striking landscape is just beautiful. Although not completely deserted, it’s quieter than the resort areas. For a moment of real peace (ideal for a romantic stroll) you’ve got to visit
Praia do Barranco das Belharucas
, just next to Falesia Beach.

Canary Islands






Just like their Balearic cousins, beach holidays to the
Canary Islands
boast some of the finest beaches in Spain. Again, the variety in the Canaries is stunning.

From the bustling nights of Lanzarote, to the quiet beaches of Fuerteventura, these islands off the coast of africa have everything you need for the ideal 2018 / 2019 beach holiday. Booking a hotel that fits your holiday needs isn't tricky. From 7 nights of all inclusive luxury along one of Lanzarote's beaches, to a self-catering culinary adventure in Gran Canaria, the Canaries have something for you.

Tenerife is the largest of the Canary Islands. The top resorts, like
Los Cristianos
and
Playa de las Americas
offer up some of the busier beaches and hang-outs, whereas you can find a quiet spot or two in
Costa Adeje
. With hotels ranging from quaint family run apartments to beachfront all inclusive hotels with their own private beachfront, Tenerife has something for every type of beach holiday.

We can’t forget about
Lanzarote
or Gran Canaria. Even the smaller islands, like La Gomera, have beaches to please even the most seasoned beachbum. We can’t possibly list them all here, but we recommend
Corralejo Viejo
in Fuerteventura,
Playa del Ingles
in Gran Canaria and
Flamingo Beach
in Lanzarote.
