Whether you’re looking for an unforgettable family holiday, or are simply a big kid at heart, Los Patos Park Hotel is the ideal choice for a fun-filled break in Spain.

The star of the show here is the on-site waterpark – there’s four outdoor swimming pools, including a shallow pool for little ones, with slides, games, a mushroom shower and even a pirate galleon. Sun loungers and parasols surround the pools, so there’s plenty of space for sunbathing, and the pool bar means a cold drink is never far away. There’s entertainment throughout the day, and in the evenings, you can enjoy cabaret and flamenco shows.

Rooms at Los Patos Park are modern and comfortable, and all have air-conditioning, satellite TV, hairdryer, phone, fully-equipped bathrooms and a terrace or balcony as standard.  The hotel restaurant serves an international buffet and is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It’s just a short walk to the beach, so if you feel like exploring further, you’ll find a range of bars and restaurants right on your doorstep.

When you’ve had your fill of swimming, sliding and splashing, take the 10-minute drive to Puerto Marina – one of the best marinas in the world. Here, you can make friends with the fish at SeaLife Benalmadena, browse the shops, dine at a variety of excellent restaurants or simply wander round the marina, soaking up the atmosphere.
