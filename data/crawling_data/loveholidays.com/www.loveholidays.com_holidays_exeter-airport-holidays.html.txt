south-west England
. Handily located just
6 miles from the centre of Exeter
, and only
a 5-minute drive from the M5
, the airport links the region with
more than 40 destinations
across the UK and Europe. You could be strolling along the gorgeous seafront promenade in
Alicante
or tucking into tapas in
Malaga
in just a few hours! Perhaps you’d rather sun yourself on the gorgeous beaches of
Paphos
or soak up the nightlife in
Larnaca
. Or then there are the perennially popular
Balearic Islands
and
Canary Islands
, which offer fun in the sun, plenty of outdoor adventures and gorgeous landscapes.

All these destinations and more are served from
Exeter Airport
.
The airport is
compact
and
easy to navigate
, so you won’t be dashing to find your gate. And there is a range of
shops and services
available, if you want to make some last-minute purchases or tuck into something to eat and drink before you jet off on holiday.
Convenient public transport links
by bus and train, plenty of
parking
, and extras such as a
fast track security service
and an
executive lounge
make
Exeter Airport
ideal for your
2018/2019 holidays
.

How to get there?

Situated only 5 miles from Exeter city centre, it is quite easy to get to the Exeter International Airport. Bus Service 56 is a pretty regular service operated by Stagecoach following the route Exeter St. Davids Station - Bus Station - Airport – Exmouth.

If you are arriving from a place outside of Exeter, you should keep in mind that there isn’t a railway station on the airport. However, you can travel to Exeter St. Davids or Exeter Central and use the bus service from the rail station to Exeter Airport. If you are travelling from London, both London Paddington and Waterloo have regular train services to Exeter.

Travelling by car is another very convenient option – Exeter Airport’s postcode is EX5 2BD, so put that into your satnav system and follow the directions (the airport is approximately 5 minutes from the M5 motorway). When you are just picking up or dropping off someone at the airport you can pay as little as £1 (for up to a 30 minute stay) – thankfully, the Terminal’s entry is only 50 yards from Short Stay Car Park 1. As for taxis, Apple Central Taxis are the official airport authorised taxi company and they operate from the taxi stand outside the Arrivals building!
