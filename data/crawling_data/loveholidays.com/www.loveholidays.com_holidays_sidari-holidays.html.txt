Known throughout Europe as one of the best Greek islands to holiday in, Cordu has many resorts worth visiting. But top of the pile for most people when picking a resort which is as lively as it is breathtakingly beautiful, is Sidari. As perhaps the most famous destination on the island, Sidari is a popular choice for holidaymakers and with its dual personalities as both a night owl and a peace-seeking sunbather, it’s easy to see why.

Beaches and bars adorn the whole of this vibrant resort and there truly is something for everyone when visiting here. Whether you want to get the blood pumping with water-sports and activities, discover the best authentic cuisine and nightlife or even just to chill out and soak up the rays, Sidari is the right choice for you.

Top Attractions






When visiting Sidari you’d be forgiven for never leaving the amazing beaches, but if you fancy a little something else to break up your stay then there are also a number of amazing alternatives. A little bit away from the centre of the resort is Canal D’Amour. This lovely little cove has the clear ocean trickling down into it to make it a peaceful setpiece. The rocky surroundings and amazing vistas provide some lovely solace and give visitors an opportunity to escape any crowds. The area also has a number of restaurants and bars surrounding it meaning that you can spend the whole day there without much worry.

There are also countless opportunities to have fun in the water around Sidari with an amazing waterpark, a plethora of diving centres and of course an abundance of water-sports. Alternatively if you’re looking for something a bit different to do then you can grab a coach ticket and visit the amazingly traditional
Corfu Town
less than an hour’s drive away. Many companies offer door to door service and here you can see the hub of life on the island and get a real sense of its character.

Wine and Dine






As it is in most of Greece, eating in Corfu is always a pleasure. Whether dining at a local taverna or restaurant, there are hundreds of cosy venues with exquisite food on offer. The native cuisine is delightfully simple and quite different from what's found in Greek restaurants abroad. Most of the cooking relies on simple seasonings, fresh meat and an abundance of delicious vegetables.

As any previous visitor to
Greece
knows, it's common for Greeks to make a meal of smaller tapas-like dishes called mezze. Typical dishes in these types of meals include fried meatballs, octopus, shrimp, squid, cheese, olives and stuffed vine leaves. If you’re done with sharing you can also find some sizable and delicious mains in moussaka, kebabs, pastitsio, stifado and paidakia. And when you’re finished with these taste sensations, wash it down with some traditional ouzo to clean the palate.

For Families






Sidari and the island of Corfu is an excellent choice for visiting families. The main stretch of sand at Sidari Beach possesses some of the calmest waters across all the Greek islands, meaning that teaching the little ones to swim becomes an even easier task, while also reducing the worry when they are in the water alone.

In addition to the amazing beaches, Sidari is also home to the tremendously fun Sidari Water Park. With slides and flumes aplenty, this wonderful water park is a great place to spend a day with the family. Parents can lounge around on sunbeds as the children chuck themselves down a number of thrill-inducing rides. While parents can indulge in an amazing dose of fitness and fun with underwater Zumba classes.

Action and Adventure






Action and adventure is perhaps best found in and on the beautiful waters surrounding Sidari. With a number of diving centres dotted around the resort, this is a great opportunity to do some underwater exploring. If you’ve never tried your hand at diving before, the experienced professionals will guide you every step of the way, gently encouraging you from closed water practice in pools before you get unleashed on the amazing underwater kingdom surrounding Sidari.

Alternative water-based options around come in the shape of many amazing water-sports, but also in the form of some amazing daytrips and tours, so if diving isn’t your bag then you still have more choice. Taking a boat tour out into open water gives you a chance to take in Sidari’s splendid cliffs and even visit some more secluded spots like the previously mentioned Drasti Beach. If you’re looking for action outside of the water then Sidari is also home to an amazing Go-Kart track and it also has a wonderful bowling alley for when you want to get a little competitive.

Life's a Beach






A huge selling point for anyone visiting Sidari are the amazing beaches. Sidari’s main beach is a 500-metre stretch of Blue Flag sand and shingle, sure to please the pickiest of visitors. The waters here are calm and shallow, perfect for any small children who are perhaps learning to swim. Throughout the beaches there is also a great line-up of water-sports including parasailing and diving. You’ll also get all the food and drink you could ever possibly need from the beachfront shops and restaurants.

The resort also boasts some other beaches in addition to the popular Sidari Beach. Agios Ioannis beach is situated on the eastern side of Sidari and its tranquil sandy shore runs into some beautiful olive groves and a picturesque monastery. This calmer alternative is a perfect option for those seeking some quiet time. And if complete seclusion is something you’re after then you should head a little further out to Drasti Beach. Considered by many as the most beautiful spot in the north of Corfu, this isolated beach is best reached by boat.

Nightlife






Resorts in Corfu are geared up for visitors expecting a vibrant nightlife and even though Sidari is smaller than some of the resorts it is no exception. Shops and café’s open late anyway so that your daytime activities will spill into the evening and the warm weather and late sunsets will mean that your days are long. Karaoke bars are popular in Sidari and make for an excellent night out for groups of friends. Cocktail bars are also the thing here and Mojitos or the Vintage Cocktail bar are recommended spots for some fantastic cocktails to drink as the sun goes down. An authentic way to spend an evening would be to head to one of the beach side bars such as Calypso Bar to eat and then have a drink as DJ’s take over for the evening.

For Couples






With a picturesque setting and picture-perfect beach, Sidari is a number one choice for any couples looking to find a romantic getaway. The previously mentioned Canal D’Amour was named specifically to attract lovers here and it is easy to see why. With beautiful surroundings covered in serenity, this gorgeous attraction offers the perfect opportunity to reconnect with your partner.

Those seeking some fun in the evening will also not be disappointed by Sidari’s amazing nightlife. This vibrant resort doesn’t quite come alive at night because that would imply there is nothing happening during the day, but it does certainly evolve. Bars and restaurants stay open into the early hours of the morning and are ready on hand to serve you the perfect night whether that ends before or after midnight.

Culture






Although lots of the entertainment in Sidari will be tourist and summer based, you can still find traditional customs in Greek dancing and old ways of life in the Old Town. All over Corfu there are religious festivals throughout the year with music and processions. From Sidari you can easily take a day trip to nearby
Roda
or other towns with spectacular medieval buildings and old Greek architecture.
