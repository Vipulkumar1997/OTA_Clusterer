Culture






Two of the most popular cultural attractions in Majorca are located close to
Cales de Mallorca
: the
Cuevas del Drach
and the
Cuevas del Ham
. Both feature spectacular stalactites and stalagmites, and the entrance to the Cuevas del Drach includes a short classical music concert, with candle-light shimmering against the cavern walls. You could also drive to the spectacular
Sant Salvador sanctuary
, a place of pilgrimage for locals, which is located near
Felanitx
. Sitting on top of a 500-metre-high hill, this 14th-century monastery affords amazing views, and you can visit the monks' cells and refectory. Most of the island's best
museums and historic sights
are concentrated in
Palma
, the island capital, which is about an hour's drive away. It's an enchanting city, and perfect for a fantastic day out.
