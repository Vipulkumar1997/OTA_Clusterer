Top Attractions






Faliraki’s number one attraction is its fabulous 5-kilometre-long
beach
, a broad swathe of golden sand that has been awarded
Blue Flag status
. You’ll find every imaginable facility and amenity, including parasols and sun loungers for rents, scores of beach bars, and a host of water sports. The resort’s
nightlife
has long been a big draw, with most of the bars and clubs located on the aptly named Bar Street and Club Street. You can take a
boat trip
along the coast to explore the adjoining bays (including
Anthony Quinn Bay
, where
The Guns of Navarone
was filmed), or visit the historic city of
Rhodes Town
.
A UNESCO World Heritage Site,
Rhodes Town
is a beautifully preserved medieval town dominated by the
palace of the Grand Masters of the Knights of Rhodes
.

Wine and Dine






Faliraki has a huge choice of restaurants, which cater to every possible taste. There is cuisine from around the globe – pizza, Chinese, Indian, Thai – along with tavernas offering delicious local Greek cuisine. Start with a selection of mezethes, such as
dolmades
(stuffed vine leaves) or
meliasti
(feta cheese wrapped in filo pastry and drizzled with honey).
Seafood
features prominently on Rhodian menus, and you can try everything from
gemisti supia
(stuffed squid), to to
makaronatha me Thalasina
, a tasty pasta dish with prawns, mussels and squid. Or you could try the grilled meats, usually lamb, pork or beef. For dessert, don’t miss the delicious
loukoumades
– donut-like strips of fried dough topped with honey and sesame seeds. Wine has been produced on the island for millennia, and you can enjoy the local vintages with your meal. Finish up with an
ouzo
, the classic Greek spirit.

For Families






The main
beach in Faliraki
is a huge draw for families, and its shallow waters are ideal for even the youngest children. There are lots of child-friendly facilities, including a playground, and older kids will enjoy the
banana boats
,
jet skis
and other aquatic attractions. There are also plenty of beach cafés and a good choice of places to eat and drink within easy reach. Faliraki also boasts one of the
biggest water parks in Europe
, with thrilling slides, wave pools and attractions for kids of all ages. If your kids like knights in shining armour, take them to the beautifully preserved medieval heart of
Rhodes Town
where they can scramble around the castle built for the Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes.

Action and Adventure






Faliraki has plenty of options for getting your adrenaline pumping:
bungee jumping
,
parasailing
,
wakeboarding
,
water skiing
,
windsurfing
and
jet skiing
are just some of them.  You could rent a
kayak
to explore the little bays and coves that dot the coastline, or go
diving or snorkelling
to explore the underwater caves. Inland, there is
horse-riding
,
mountain-biking
and
off-road adventures
in 4x4 jeeps. The beautiful forested interior is criss-crossed with some wonderful
hiking trails
, including treks around
Attavyros
, the highest peak in Rhodes.

Life's a Beach






The stunning
5-kilometre-long beach in Faliraki
is the town’s biggest attraction. Wide and sandy, with a gentle slope that makes it ideal for young children, this beach is the focal point of local life. You’ll find plenty of options for water sports, including water skiing and jet skiing, as well as beach bars and cafés. There are also lots of wonderful restaurants and tavernas within a short stroll. The pebbly little beach at
Kathara Bay
, on the quieter side of the harbour, provides some respite from the crowds. There are several less developed beaches around Faliraki, including
Antony Quinn Bay
(also known as
Ladiko Beach
), which is small, but enjoys a beautiful setting.

Nightlife






Faliraki has long been one of the biggest nightlife destinations in the
Greek Islands
. You’ll find everything from
beach clubs
and
cocktails bars
to
Irish theme pubs
and
karaoke bars
. Most of the main bars and clubs are concentrated along two main streets – conveniently nicknamed ‘Bar Street’ and ‘Club Street’ – where the party can carry on until dawn in the height of the summer season. Most have live gigs, quiz nights and other events on most nights, and you could also go for a
bar crawl
or a
party cruise
. Note that many of the
all-inclusive hotels
in the resort offer fantastic entertainment, along with their own bars and club nights. If you’re not feeling hedonistic, there are plenty of quieter options elsewhere in the resort where you can kick back and relax.

For Couples






Bring your partner to Faliraki if you want to enjoy a laid-back holiday with plenty of
sunshine
, a gorgeous
beach
and lively
nightlife
. If you want to find a little corner of paradise just for the two of you, head over to
Anthony Quinn Bay
(also known as Ladiko Beach). These delightful coves are less hectic than the main town beach, and perfect for relaxing with your partner. Faliraki offers lots of great
beach bars
for enjoying a drink as the sun goes down with your feet in the sand, or you could even take a
sunset cruise
around the bay. The historic capital of
Rhodes Town
is a delight to stroll around, and you can explore its cobbled streets hand-in-hand.


Read More about For Couples





Culture






Falirakis is just a 20-minute drive or a quick ferry ride from
Rhodes Old Town
, an exquisitely preserved medieval town which is a
UNESCO World Heritage Site
. The cobbled maze of narrow streets is deeply atmospheric, and is home to remarkable buildings such as the
Palace of the Grand Masters of the Knights of Rhodes
. While on Rhodes, you shouldn’t miss the chance to visit spectacular ancient ruins, such as the impressive acropolis of
Lindos
,
the ancient city of Ialysos, which dates back to the 3rd millennium BC, or the even older city of
Kamiros
, which was founded in the 5th millennium BC.
