Girls Weekend Away Holidays to the Costa Blanca






Benidorm
on the
Costa Blanca
is a perennial favourite for groups of friends looking for a sunny getaway with plenty of shopping and nightlife thrown in. You’ll be dazzled by the choices when it comes to eating and drinking, and there are hundreds of shows, bars and clubs to suit all ages and tastes – you’ll certainly never be bored! For shopping, you can head to a mall to find all the famous Spanish brands, take a stroll around the markets or visit the upmarket boutiques along Avenida Uno.  For something a little more relaxed, try
Jávea
, which has gorgeous beaches, a lovely little old town, and a picturesque port with plenty of places to eat and drink al fresco.

Girls Weekend Away Holidays to the Balearic Islands






The
Balearic Islands
really do cater to all tastes. On
Majorca
, you could indulge in a girls’ spa break in the lovely island capital of
Palma
, or head to the all-out party town of
Magaluf
for a weekend of hedonism. Dreamy
Menorca
is a great bet for a relaxing break in beautiful surroundings: in popular resorts like
Cala’n Bosch
, you can work on the tan during the day, and soak up the nightlife once the sun has gone down. Lively
Ibiza
features everything from Europe’s top mega-clubs to secret bays where you can sip cocktails at sunset, and its pretty whitewashed capital,
Ibiza Town
, is full of enticing shops and bars.

Girls Weekend Away Holidays to the Canary Islands






The
Canary Islands
, just off the African coast, are a fantastic destination at any time of the year, thanks to the balmy temperatures and year-round sunshine. The appealing combination of long, sandy beaches, along with top restaurants, bars and clubs, is hard to resist, but the islands also offer plenty for the active and adventurous. Much of
Lanzarote
is covered by the Timanfaya National Park, where you can hike, bike, and explores forests full of wildlife. And
Tenerife
is dominated by Teide, an active volcano which is Spain’s highest peak. If partying is more your thing, hit the cocktail bars in vibrant resorts like
Playa del Carmen
in
Lanzarote
or
Costa Adeje
in
Tenerife
.

Girls Weekend Away Holidays to Portugal






The
Algarve
’s gorgeous coastline and lively resorts make it the perfect place to enjoy a weekend break with the girls.
Albufeira
has some of the loveliest beaches in the region, as well as a charming Old Town, spilling over with outdoor cafés and restaurants. If you want to party hard, hit the infamous ‘Strip’ and have a blast. If you’re hoping to chill, head to the eastern
Algarve
, where seaside villages like
Tavira
have kept much of their original charm and you can take a little ferry across to blissfully unspoilt beaches.
