Top Attractions






Costa Adeje on the island of Tenerife offers the best of both worlds. The must-visit middle of bustling Playa de las Americas and family-orientated Los Cristianos, Costa Adeje is the perfect blend of family-friendly beaches and glamorous, sophisticated bars along the seafront. With authentic black-sand beaches, as well as those with more golden hues (they do import sand from the Sahara Desert, after all) you’ve got your pick from those that boast the true beauty of this popular Canary Island resort to those that are perfect for stretching out upon and catching the rays.

From water sports and sunbathing to hiking the surrounding rugged scenery, there are plenty of things to do if you’re after endless fun during your Costa Adeje holidays. The weather in Tenerife is warm all year round, reaching its hottest points from June to September, so summer holidays here are sizzling. Winter sun seekers, however, will also love the temperatures that grace the island during the cooler months – we’re still looking at highs of around 20C, which doesn’t sound too shabby if you ask us!

Wine and Dine






Food and drink is, of course, one of the top Costa Adeje attractions, but then again, where is it not? This sophisticated resort is all about upmarket wining and dining, and offers a plethora of brilliant boutiques and traditional premises that are sure to leave your taste buds tantalised. From beachfront bars such as Kuala Lumpur Beach Bar and Moonlight which boasts karaoke and a great menu, to cocktail and wine bars, there’s a whole host of places to let your hair down and indulge. Top off your night with a visit to one of the many restaurants on offer. From the mouth-watering American fare served at Tony Romas to the superb French cuisine plated up at La Villa Chez Damien, there is plenty to fill your stomachs with.

As one of the most popular of the
Canary Islands
, Tenerife is home to some great restaurants and bars, and Costa Adeje, as one of its most upmarket resorts, boasts some of the best. Serving a range of cuisines from authentic Spanish tapas to British, American and Mexican, there’s something for even the fussiest of taste buds. Cocktails are also a must in this stylish resort - sipping a delicious, fruity drink as you watch a golden sun set behind the horizon – it doesn’t get more idyllic than that.

For Families






The area boasts the dizzying heights of Siam Park, and with its range of exhilarating water slides, heated pools and a man-made beach, it’s a great choice for families and groups looking for a thrilling day out. With rides named ‘The Dragon’ and ‘Tower of Power’, you know you’ll be in for a good few, hearty screams.

Action and Adventure






Overlooked by the imposing Mount Teide, Costa Adeje is ideal for those looking to combine utter relaxation with some adrenaline-pumping fun. From hiking mountains and rolling hills to whizzing down water slides at Siam Park, Costa Adeje and the surrounding island has plenty to off activity lovers. Head to the Mount Teide National Park for beautiful views and thrilling hikes or exhilarating bike rides that sport enthusiasts will not want to miss out on. Alternatively, grab a helicopter tour of the island and indulge in mesmerising views from a bird’s perspective. No matter how many things to do in Costa Adeje you take advantage of, there’ll always be more for you to discover!

Life's a Beach






Costa Adeje is ideal for both couples and families looking for an unforgettable break in the Canary Islands. Overlapping with
Playa de las Americas
, Costa Adeje boasts three Blue Flag beaches, sheltered bays and calm water, making it perfect for children or those looking to escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. For a beach scene with a little more action, you’ll find a great deal of satisfaction in a daytrip to
Los Cristianos
.

Stay along the coastline near Playa Fanabe if you’d like something truly romantic and serene. This beautiful beach has sand imported straight from the Sahara Desert and boasts incandescent waters, as well as Blue Flag status. From 5-star, all-inclusive luxury to something a little cheaper but just as comfortable, holidays to Costa Adeje boast all the comfort-heavy hotels you could want for a pampered stay in Tenerife.

Nightlife






Although somewhat quieter than neighbouring Playa de las Americas, there are still many things to do in Costa Adeje that involve enjoying a few drinks overlooking a gorgeous view. Cocktail bars and wine bars are in abundance in this luxurious resort, whilst beat-pumping clubs are less common. Although the evening entertainment is somewhat low key, it certainly doesn’t lack in charisma. Head to San Eugenio for some of the area’s best bars – offering live shows for families as well as the odd dancefloor for those who like to make some serious shapes, it has something for everyone. El Faro Chill Art is a must visit for those who like to party as it is one of the most popular places to visit for locals and tourists alike. For a slice of rock ‘n’ roll, look no further than the In and Out Bar in Playa de Torviscas where live music and plenty of atmosphere can be found in abundance.

For Couples






Although a great choice for both couples and families, we reckon Costa Adeje should be visited by all lovebirds that want to experience the best of the Canary Islands. With a great range of shops, bars and restaurants tailored towards the adult market, stunning panoramas of the Atlantic Ocean and a real classy vibe, this seaside resort has a lot to offer couples. From Segway tours for two to musicals, boat trips and dolphin-watching opportunities, it’s the perfect location for a little Spanish loving. Indulge in fine dining along the seafront coupled with a delicious, fruit cocktail before watching the sun set behind the horizon. From spa breaks to days spent lounging around the beautiful beaches, there’s endless opportunity for you to fall in love with each other all over again. There are plenty of Costa Adeje attractions that are ideal for couples – all you need to do now is discover them for yourself!

Culture






For an unforgettable experience within the Canary Islands’ rugged natural landscapes, taking a trip to the island of La Gomera will appease nature lovers, especially with a visit to the stunning Garajonay National Park.

From 5-star hotels with spas to endless stretches of sand and beautiful golf courses, there is no shortage of relaxing things to do in Costa Adeje. Take your pick from black sand and golden sand beaches, and maybe take a dip or two in the cool, shimmering ocean. If snorkelling floats you relaxation boat, you won’t be disappointed with the wonders that lie beneath the water’s surface. For something extra special, nothing beats booking a spa hotel that comes equipped with the likes of saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and treatment rooms. If you fancy completing your days with a deep tissue massage or a facial, then this is most definitely the way to do it. Alternatively, if golf brings out the calmer you, you won’t be disappointed with the range of golf courses in and around Costa Adeje. Work on your swing, let out your tension and enjoy one of the world’s favourite sports under the Canary Island sun.
