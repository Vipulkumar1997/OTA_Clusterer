Balearic Island Couples






It’s not all partying in the traditional clubbing holiday hotspots although if you are that kind of couple you’ll feel right at home here. The Canary and
Balearic Islands
, are a diverse little set with something to suit every couple.

Majorca
, largest of the Balearic Islands, is a haven for couples looking for some sun, sea, and quality time together.
Alcudia
is a firm favourite and where you should start your search. 262 beaches dot this island paradise, giving you plenty of options for secluded days on golden sand. The stunning Serra de Tramuntana mountain range is a gift to couples who like to hike, while the more sedate can enjoy a romantic picnic in one of Majorca’s stunning vineyards.

Menorca
, as the quietest of the Balearics, is a fantastic escape for couples who want peace and tranquility. There are some fantastic historical sites and wonderful trails for romantic walks, cycles or horseback rides. Food in Menorca is particularly divine, especially their seafood, making it the ideal place to splash out on a lobster dinner. And while we mention the sea, it would be wrong not to point out the Menorca hosts some stunning pink sandy beaches which, thanks to the peaceful nature of the island, are rarely crowded.

If you’re the kind of couple that likes to party the night away, you can’t do better than the clubbing capital
Ibiza
. Treat yourselves to an
all inclusive
spa break in Playa d’en Bossa for all night partying and all day pampering. Ibiza is an island of two halves, you can balance relaxation and action with a cocktail in one hand and the sun tan lotion in the other.

Whatever kind of couple you are, the Balearic Islands offer the perfect setting for any pair of lovebirds.

Portugal Couples






Lisbon
is fast climbing the rankings of world’s most stunning cities, making it a fantastic coastal city break for any couple craving sun, sea and urban buzz. However, for couples seeking beautiful beaches, striking coastlines, and the romantic authenticity of Portugal’s rural culture, it has to be the Algarve.

Stroll among cork and olive groves, the
Algarve
region is famous for its olive oil and cork goods. Indulge in the prestigious local wines and fresh local foods, perfect for candlelit dinners on the beach or in local tavernas. Explore the secret coves, hidden lagoons, and wild natural parks with your other half. Begin your search in Albufeira, the regions capital and most popular resort.

If you are an adventurous couple, the Algarve is well known for its variety of watersports and inland safari tours. The more sedate can simply bathe on stunning beaches, many like
Praia de São Rafael
and Praia do Carvalho complete with secretive sea caves, or enjoy a luxurious spa treatment at one of the Algarve’s coastal resorts. Whatever the two of you are into, the Algarve is a fantastic couples’ destination.

Canary Island Couples






Year-round sun, stunning beaches, and a dramatic landscape make
The Canary Islands
a perfect destination for couples, whatever time of year you want to treat your other half.

Tenerife
, the Canary Island’s giant, has it all when it comes to romantic breaks. Fantastic beaches, tropical wilderness, and top class luxury resorts, Tenerife leaves no box unticked. One of the most popular destinations for couples is
Costa Adeje
, known for its fresh and chic atmosphere.The capital Santa Cruz is an ideal base for combining all the best the island has to offer. A bustling cosmopolitan city with stunning historical architecture,
Santa Cruz
also boasts the pristine white sands of Playa de Las Teresitas beach and is protected by the lush Anaga Mountains. All the luxury of a modern urban hub, the romance of historical architecture, and the beauty of nature rolled into a couples dream holiday destination. While you’re in Tenerife make sure you explore. Whether you hike or take a mountain car, visiting the peak of Mount Teide is a must. As Spain’s highest summit, the volcanic mount lies at the heart of Teide national park and makes for an exhilarating, stunning and romantic viewpoint.

If Tenerife is too much of a cliché, set your couples break in
Lanzarote
. Lanzarote is virtually a work of art, it’s architecture and attractions having largely been designed by renowned artist César Manrique, offering a unique blend of nature and design. Base yourself in
Costa Teguise
for an all inclusive beach break just 15 minutes from the cosmopolitan capital Arrecife, the ideal spot for top shopping and fine dining. Hire a car and explore Lanzarote’s luna landscape. Wander through the unique César Manrique cactus garden in Guatiza, enjoy dinner in the enchanting volcanic cave of Jameos del Agua, and take a salacious dip in the La Charca de La Larca lagoon. Lanzarote is an island full of mysteries to be discovered together. With some fantastic all inclusive luxury hotels dotted across the island, you’re spoilt for choice in how you treat your other half.

Jamaica Couples






For a couples break that really makes a statement, the tropical paradise of
Jamaica
hits the jackpot. Whether you want to dance till dawn on tropical beaches, pamper yourselves in luxury spa’s, or lose yourselves on a natural island paradise, couples holidays to Jamaica are the perfect way to show your one love exactly how you feel.

When you’re looking to stir it up head to Kingston, Jamaica’s buzzing nightlife capital. Alive with live music venues, vibrant bars, and fantastic clubs, Reggaes spiritual home is a great place for any couple that likes to hit the dancefloor together.

If you're looking to spend quality time together while the sun’s up, Jamaica is equally proficient. Take romantic strolls up Seven Mile Beach, dip in the secluded lagoons and snorkel among the vibrant tropical reefs. Treat your other half to a shopping trip in the quaint
Negril bay
markets, splash out on a romantic dinner in the scenic
Montego Bay
or a luxury spa treatment at your resort. “Is this love?” we hear you ask, a couples holiday in Jamaica will leave you in no doubt.

When it’s time to turn the lights down low, Jamaica’s phenomenal array of boutique, luxury and
all inclusive hotels
offer an unrivalled setting for couples in love. With stunning coastal, urban and forested locations available, exquisite design, and first class service, Jamaican couples hotels are the perfect “holiday for two” choice.
