Top Attractions






Menorca is the second largest of the
Balearic Islands
and is situated to the north-east of
Majorca
. It is considered to be the most tranquil of the islands, however there is a wonderful range of activities to experience on your holiday to Menorca. The capital, Mahon, is thought to be the second largest natural deepwater port in the world. The largest is Pearl Harbor. In addition to the many bars and restaurants situated around the port, it’s also home to some of the last turtles which exist in the
Mediterranean
. It is an environmentally protected area, and is also home to many species of birds and other animals. Mahon is also home to Claustre del Carme market. The market is based in a beautiful former monastery and sells local specialities such as cured sausages and cheese. Menorca is highly famed for its cheeses and even has its very own cheese Museum – perfect for lovers of this dairy delight. Just a few miles from the capital is a beautifully quaint fishing village called Binibeca. The village was artificially created in 1972 by a notable Spanish architect. It was built to resemble a traditional Moorish town and incorporates a stark mix of whitewashed houses and natural dark woods.

Wine and Dine






Menorca's position in the heart of the Mediterranean provides the perfect platform for a mixture of delicious cuisines. Seafood is an integral part of any Spanish menu and Cala'n Bosch is no exception to this delicious rule. A favourite among locals is the spicy lobster stew. Served with a slice of fine toast this dish is made from the small blue lobster which is caught in the water just offshore. It is also claimed that mayonnaise was invented here. While some dispute this claim, why not tuck into this popular condiment, which is served with many of the dishes and decide for yourself? Dairy produce is prolific on the island. Known for its production of butter, milk and cheeses, these ingredients form an integral part of the local cuisine. Cala'n Bosch is packed with cafés and restaurants, and you won't struggle for choice. Some of the best to check out are Avanti, Asador On Egin – which is great for seafood – and La Marina Restaurant. Most restaurants remain locally run and thus serve authentic and reasonably priced dishes. A great tip for picking a fabulous eaterie is looking for one which is packed full of locals enjoying their evening meal.

For Families






We know that travelling with children can be tricky, but luckily Menorca is packed full of fantastic child-friendly activities. The beach is an excellent place to start, and many of them, including Cala'n Bosch, are great for the kids. When you've had your fill of the beach, if that's even possible, it's time to take advantage of one of the other fantastic pastimes. Make a splash of one of the two water parks in Menorca. One is located in the vicinity of Cala'n Bosch and the other is situated in Cala Blanes. Both are well maintained and suitable for younger children. However, Aqua Rock, in Cala'n Bosch comes with the added bonus of a go-karting track nearby.

Action and Adventure






If all that sunbathing has exhausted you then why not partake in a little action and adventure? The beach provides facilities for those who would like to try watersports such as paddle boarding and snorkelling. The warm Mediterranean waters are also ideal for swimming. Head inland for some beautiful trekking opportunities perfect for those who like to don their walking boots and see this beautiful region from a different perspective. There are also two water parks on the island and, while aimed at children, they're perfectly suitable for adults that want to splash around and get their adrenaline pumping.

Life's a Beach






Cala'n Bosch is one of the most superb beaches on the island. The shallow cove means it is an excellent place to swim, especially for those travelling with young children. The beach is manned by a Red Cross lifeguard and has a range of amenities including pedlo and sunbed hire, and parasols to keep you shaded from the hot Spanish sun. The range of amenities at the beach includes bars and restaurants offering drinks and snacks. There are several other notable beaches which are well worth exploring – these include Binibeca beach,
Son Bou
beach and
Cala Galdana
beach. The warm Mediterranean waters which surround the island of Menorca make for ideal swimming conditions. Many of the beaches are also backed by a lush vegetation where you can grab some shade while taking in the stunning views on offer. If you want to explore the marine life surrounding the island, Ben Carla Coves are an excellent place to start. These small pebble beaches, which can be found on the south coast of Menorca, have excellent facilities particularly for snorkelling but also for those who enjoy scuba diving.

Nightlife






Cala'n Bosch is a relatively sedate destination and you won't find any clubs in the nearby vicinity. However, most people visiting Cala’n Bosch for a holiday are seeking serenity and relaxation. There are venues aplenty where you can relax for the evening with a cocktail or an ice-cold beer. Tom's Bar is one of the few establishments which caters specifically for those looking to have a drink. It’s a cosy venue which serves great cocktails and there’s a casual vibe. It’s common to have several drinks with your dinner in
Spain
and mealtimes often span several hours. Almost all of the eateries you'll find in Menorca will serve alcohol. If you're looking for an evening drink in Cala'n Bosch you can either head to the beach to sample a tipple at one of its many waterside restaurants, or head into the town centre and enjoy the traditional surroundings. If you're looking for something a little more high-octane, the capital is only a short taxi ride away. Here you'll find boutique music venues, bars and cafés with a more trendy vibe and the occasional theatre performance.

For Couples






Couples looking for a relaxing escape will be in their element here. The laid-back, sedate and easy-going charm of Menorca will suit those looking for some respite away from the stresses of the every day. The beach is the principal activity in Menorca and Cala'n Bosch is one of the most supreme on the island. Its cove-like appearance gives the beach a blissful feel and once the sun sets it provides the perfect setting for a romantic meal in the warm Spanish sunshine. Sightseeing in the capital is a little low-key but perfectly ample for those who want to partake in a little historical activity. You can discover the island's Moorish past at the buildings and monuments which pepper the ancient town of Mahon. In between soaking up the sunshine, you can take to the waters for a spot of paddle boarding, sailing or you can even take a boat to see the island from the waters, giving you a truly unique perspective of this Spanish gem. Though the island is relatively small, if you want to explore it to its extremities it is best to hire a car. You can drive around the island stopping off at several remote and uninhabited pockets before returning to your resort to have a sumptuous Spanish meal.


Read More about For Couples





Culture






Much of the cultural activity takes place in the island's historic centre of Mahon. For those who like a drop of gin, the city is home to an ancient gin distillery which was constructed during the 19
th
century. Not only can you see how the gin is produced but you can also sample some of the end product. The ancient harbour is the second largest natural deepwater port in the world. Relax with some tapas or a glass of wine and you might just spot one of the few remaining turtles which still live in Mediterranean waters.
