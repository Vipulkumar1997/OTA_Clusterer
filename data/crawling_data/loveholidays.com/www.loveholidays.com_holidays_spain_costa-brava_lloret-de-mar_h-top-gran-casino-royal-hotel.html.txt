The H.Top Gran Casino Hotel offers great value 3 star accommodation close to some of the liveliest attractions on the Costa Brava. There's a large outdoor pool, gardens and quick access to the beach.

You’ll be staying just 400m from the blue flag beaches at Lloret de Mar, which means they have passed the quality that guarantees clean, unspoiled sands. This gives you chance to grab the best possible sunbathing spot.

Rooms at the H.Top Gran Casino Hotel are bright, with pastel decor and comfortable furnishings. Each room has either a private balcony or terrace, an en-suite bathroom, satellite TV and cool tiled floors. Choose from single, twin, triple or quadruple rooms, depending on your needs, making the hotel particularly popular for groups of friends on holiday together.

The hotel has several bars and dining options so you can experience plenty of variety without setting foot out of the door. When you do decide to venture out, you can also have a big night out in the bars and clubs nearby. Kids have their own playground, and activities on-site for adults include billiards and a games room, plus daytime and evening entertainment.

During the day, you can stay around the hotel’s outdoor pool and garden, or visit the tour desk to choose an excursion. The Marine land and Water World Park is a popular nearby destination for visitors, and you can also hire a bike or quadricycle to venture further from the hotel if you want to.

The H.Top Gran Casino will give you an excellent base to discover Lloret de Mar and the Costa Brava for yourself, book now with loveholidays.com.
