With its historic landmarks, exotic beaches and superb range of day trips and sports on offer, Bulgaria is the perfect 2018and 2019 holiday destination. Whether you’re looking for a relaxing holiday in the sun or an adventurous experience, you will find it in Bulgaria.

Take in the azure ocean and golden sands of Varna or experience the fascinating culture of
Sofia
, Bulgaria's capital city. Why not head to the port of Sveti Vlas Village, hire a yacht for the day and let your worries float away as you boat around the Black Sea.

Once you are back on land, visit
Nessebar
, a prominent seaside destination that combines old world beauty with modern glamorous beaches. A UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983, Nessebar is a beautiful city to visit for a day or an entire trip.

If you can pull yourself away from the coastline, make your way into the heart of Bulgaria to Central Balkan National Park. Situated in the Balkan Mountains, the park contains rare and endangered animals to see as you trek over the countryside.

Top Attractions






Bulgaria is a vibrant and fascinating country that is becoming more and more popular for couples, families and groups going on holiday. The country has so much to offer in terms of sweeping landscapes, mountains, coastlines and vibrant culture and cuisine. It is the perfect location for your next budget holiday in the sun.

For those looking for a touch of ancient history and culture, Nessebar has much to offer. The town has many ancient ruins dating back to the 11th century. Its cobbled streets will lead you through the town's amazing architecture and history.

View Bulgaria's largest monastery, Rila Monastery, when you travel deep in to the Rilska River Valley. Established in the 10
th
century, the secluded religious structure is a blast from the past.

If you want to be rejuvenated on your holiday, visit the St. Konstantin mineral springs. The beautiful baths come from deep springs and are always between 40 – 60
o
c, the perfect temperature for pure relaxation.

Wine and Dine






Bulgarian cuisine mixes Slavic, Greek and Turkish traditional foods. Yet, the country also has more modern influences helping to give Bulgaria its own distinct tastes.

Soups are popular in Bulgaria and eating at a traditional restaurant, you will find plenty of delicious soups on the menu. Many of the recipes have been passed down by generations, though more modern, chic Bulgarian restaurants are coming up with their own ideas.

When the Bulgarian beaches get too warm, you should cool down with a tarator soup. The yoghurt and cucumber recipe is a way to chill before heading back into the surf. If you are looking for a meaty dinner the meshana skara mix grill is a fulfilling combination of flavours.

Bulgarians love their cheeses and will eat slices of gorgeous white cheese during meals. To drink, try the boza, a traditional fermented malt drink made from maize and wheat.

For Families






The old town of Nessebar offers families a wealth of history on a Bulgarian holiday. Of course, there is the fantastic beach, but the town is more than 3,000 years old and its ancient buildings have helped it achieve UNESCO World Heritage Site certification. Roman baths, historical churches and much more are available for an educational family trip.

After packing in the historical sites, head to the Central Balkan National Park for a chance to see endangered wildlife. The park is a fantastic day trip for families and its mountains provide your legs a challenging walk.

If you want more water fun than you can get at the beaches, Bulgaria has two major water parks the kids will love. Aqua Paradise and Action Aquapark. Both have plenty of great pools and slides to enjoy on a family day out.

Action and Adventure






One of Bulgaria's coolest places to visit is Buzludzha, a futuristic building built in the Central Balkan Mountains. Built in 1974, the structure was dedicated to Bulgaria's Communist Party, although it wasn't opened until 1981. The UFO-like building was abandoned after the fall of communism and today lays in ruin.

The Rila Mountains offer great trekking and a chance to see the seven Rila Lakes. Beautiful to view, the lakes are easy to access when hiking, so pack those trekking boots for a day in the mountains. Bulgaria is a very mountainous country and there are over 40 mountains in Bulgaria to take some stunning photos of and climb or hike over.

Thanks to the mountains, winter time is perfect for skiing. Bulgaria offers great skiing for less than many western European countries. Bansko is one of the most popular places to ski and whether you are an expert or a novice, you will be heading down the slopes in no time.

Life's a Beach






Finding a blissful beach on your summer holiday to Bulgaria isn't difficult. One of Bulgaria's best beaches is Golden Sands. Backed by a forest covered hillside, the slopes give way to a beautiful beach that meets the Black Sea. The Bulgarian coastline offers miles of crisp white beach sands, perfect for topping up that tan, but don't forget you sun cream.

Visitors to Nessebar will find Sunny Beach not far away. The shoreline provides guests with wide open sands that welcome visitors from all over the world. The beach gets rather busy, and when it does, the local bars and restaurants offer a retreat from the crowds. Nessebar combines history and beach life well; and is a great destination during a Bulgarian break.

Albena is another beautiful Bulgarian beach and tourists flock to the five-kilometre-long shoreline. The crystal clear waters are perfect for water sports or just splashing about as you relax on your Bulgarian beach break.

Nightlife






Nightlife begins and ends with the country's capital Sofia. Parties happen at all times of night as Bulgaria's alcohol licensing laws allow it to be served whenever. Clubs and bars may stay open until the sun comes up, giving you the chance to dance the night away. If you are hungry after finishing at a Sofia disco, plenty of local restaurants stay open until the wee hours serving breakfast.

Varna
is another Bulgarian nightlife hotspot where you can stay up late and relieve your hangover with a hot coffee and warm Black Sea swim. The city is absolutely vibrant once the sun goes down and many of the local bars and clubs will have DJs spinning throughout the evening.

If you prefer a quieter evening out in Bulgaria, there are a number of great restaurants in both Sofia and Varna. Have a nightcap at a quiet pub or sip a coffee at an outside café as you watch the world go by.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






Nessebar is a must see town when going to Bulgaria as a couple. The cobbled streets of the old town, the quaint atmosphere at dusk and the little cafés and bars ooze romance. Enjoy an evening out at one of the fine restaurants in the old town followed by a morning at the beach for a truly romantic holiday.

If you find yourself in the countryside, you will see kilometres of golden fields as sunflowers grow across the country. Running from Serbia to the Black Sea, the view of field upon field of golden flowers is the perfect backdrop to a picnic or trek through the Bulgarian countryside.

Head into Sofia for a laidback experience as the often overlooked capital is full of great historical buildings and churches to view. When you have tired of walking, head to a romantic spot on the Iskar River to watch the sunset.

Culture






From ancient times to communism, Bulgaria is full of culture. Thracian Tomb is located in northeastern Bulgaria and dates back to the 3
rd
century BC. The site's carvings are extremely unique and provide visitors with a glimpse into Europe's ancient past.

Perperikon is a Thracian sanctuary that wasn't discovered until 2000. Considered the largest megalithic structure in southeastern Europe, Perperikon overlooks Gorna Krepost in the Rhodope Mountains.

While in the Rhodope Mountains a visit to Shiroka Laka is a cultural experience like no other. The old architecture is a true view into the lives and history of the Rhodopian people. You can experience traditional food and music in the village as you take in a world very different than Sofia or Varna.

Once back in Sofia, the National Palace of Culture is a must-see. Built during communist rule, the building is a chance to see a time that is quickly becoming forgotten in Bulgaria.
