Situated on the Aegean Sea is the beautiful Turquoise Coast. Fethiye is one of the most popular destinations here, mainly due to its wonderful beaches and rich heritage. Calis is the main beach in the area which is known for being one of the most eco-friendly in the whole of the country. You will not only be treated to crystal clear waters and golden sand but also excellent views of the Taurus Mountains. There are a few other beaches located a few kilometres away from the town which are less frequented by tourists and have more of a local feel.

Away from the beach you'll discover a delicious array of food and drink. The country is known for its Turkish delight and donna kebabs but there is much more to its cuisine besides these stereotypical, albeit delicious, examples. Cafés line the beaches and there are several venues in the town centre where you can dance the night away until the early hours. If you're looking for a little action and adventure, then there are opportunities to swim and parasail which will keep the adrenalin junkies entertained. Could a Fethiye holiday in 2018 have your name on it?

Top Attractions






Fethiye is the ideal place to start your exploration of the beautiful Turquoise Coast in
Turkey
. Its port side location means it is in a prime position for getting to the surrounding beaches or heading to the ancient remnants of the region which are located inland. First, head to the Lycian ruins which date back to 200 BC. There are numerous monuments throughout the town, the most famous of which is the two of Amyntas. The Roman Theatre is another must visit structure originally seating up to 6000 spectators. You can climb to the top tier of the seats and enjoy great views across the town. If you want to learn a little more about the history the region, then head to the Fethiye Museum. It will provide you with a basic introduction to the heritage of the area, they also have a impressive collection of exhibits including jewellery and pottery.  Fethiye is also home to a local farmer's market which takes place every Tuesday. They sell lots of trinkets, but keep an eye out of the local delicacies; you simply must sample some baklava with a Turkish coffee.

Wine and Dine






Turkish food is known for its use of fresh ingredients and delicious Middle Eastern flavours. Favourites include the kebab, pilaf and of course Turkish delight. Being a coastal town, a holiday in Fethiye, will involve an abundance of excellent seafood which can be sampled at the local restaurants. Deep Blue Bar in the Old Town is known for its great Turkish coffees and, to top it all off, it also plays live music. Another favourite is the Aroma Lounge Bar. Its sun-kissed terrace and great views of the marina make for the ideal place to enjoy a long evening meal with a glass of wine. If you're looking for something a little less formal than there are many street food stands all around the area. They serve kebabs and other casual snacks for a few lira and are perfect if you're in a rush or don't want to sit down for a lengthy meal.

For Families






If you're travelling with children, then you probably want to spend much of your time on one of the many exotic beaches. The shallow waters are perfect for swimming and the sandy beaches are great for letting the kids play while you kick back with a book and a glass of wine. There are lots of beach activities in the area including parasailing and paragliding.  It’s also possible to rent canoes and sail along the azure-blue waters. If your kids are into history then there are a range of sites and attractions which are well worth visiting. Show them around the Roman theatre, the ancient tombs and the Lycian sarcophagus for a fascinating history lesson outside of the classroom. The wider area is also home to a few water parks. Not all of them are open all year round but if you visit in the summer months you can head to the one of your choice for an afternoon of wet and wild fun.

Action and Adventure






Despite Turkey's reputation as being primarily a beach destination, there are plenty of other activities to keep you busy while on holiday in Fethiye. Canoeing, swimming and parasailing are all popular and most of the beaches have warm water all year round. When it comes to hiking Fethiye won’t disappoint, because it marks the start of the geographically stunning Lycian Way. The 500 km trail goes all the way to
Antalya
but you can walk a small section of it in a few hours while you take in the stunning scenery. There are a few islands situated just off the coast which can be explored by a day cruise should you want to explore the area by sea. A range of boats, in a variety sizes, leave the harbour each day and set sail for the Aegean Sea. Most of the tours will include lunch and return you to the shore around early evening, in time for a delicious Turkish meal.

Life's a Beach






Calis Beach is not only one of the most beautiful in the Fethiye area, but it is also one of the most eco-friendly beaches in the whole of Turkey. The crystal clear waters of the Aegean Sea mean that is perfect for swimming and from here you also enjoy panoramic views of the Taurus Mountains. The most popular beach here is Oludeniz. The entire vicinity is actually a national park and has even been dubbed the most beautiful place on earth. Its secluded location means that the waters are always calm and the waters are warm even in the winter months. If you're looking for a beach with a little more of the tropical feel then Kabaque Beach is a perfect choice. Also known as Paradise Beach, it is famed for its steep hills covered with vegetation which surround the secluded bay. Other beaches which are a little further afield, but well worth the journey are Kidrak, Karot and Katranci.

Nightlife






Beer is the drink of choice in Turkey. There is a wide selection of venues here from small cafés to large-scale nightclubs where you can sample all the local varieties. Cemetery Bar is a combination of a bar and a club where fresh cocktails and beers are readily available while you party the night away. They also have a chill out room with lots of cushions and several funky outside areas. Club Bananas plays a mix of Western and Turkish music while the small admission fee includes a couple of complimentary drinks. Looking for classic cocktails? Then head to George's Cocktail Bar. The surprisingly affordable drinks are of an incredibly high standard and you’ll find a combination of both tourists and locals here. Most of the restaurants in Turkey will also serve alcohol and it is common to go for a dinner for several hours and stay on afterwards for drinks, meaning you don't necessarily have to head to a bar after.

For Couples






A Fethiye holiday is a great destination for couples, both young and old, who are looking for a mix of activity and relaxation. You can easily spend the whole of your holiday at one of the many beaches in the area simply chilling out. However, if you want to escape the crowds then you can head a little out of town for more privacy. You won’t be hard pressed to find a spot for a lengthy romantic meal under the stars, then try a local bar for a night cap before heading back to the hotel. If you’d like to indulge in a little pampering on holiday in Fethiye then head to the five-star sanctuary spa and Turkish bath. Turkish spas are well known for their healing properties and it presents the perfect recharge your batteries before boarding the flight back to reality. You deserve it after all.

Culture






Turkey is often touted as the confluence of eastern and western cultures. Situated in the mountains which surround Fethiye is the area of Tlos. This is one of the many city ruins and is considered to be one of the most stunning. Xanthos was the former capital of the Lycia empire and has been referred to as one of the oldest republics in the world. The site is now protected by UNESCO and hosts some well-preserved remnants. These include the Roman theatre and the old city gate which are thought to date back to the third century BC. The ancient area of Kayakoy is located only around 8 km from Fethiye, where a mix of Greeks and Turks lived side-by-side for centuries. Many of the buildings are quite dilapidated these days but you can spend an afternoon winding your way up the hillside to find the amazing stone villages. Many of them still boast beautiful decorations inside.
