Thailand Holidays in 2018 / 2019

A Thailand holiday in 2019 will transport you to the stunning region of Southeast Asia, into a mystic country blessed with captivating culture and history, golden beaches on idyllic islands, and a fascinating culinary scene. If you're looking for something exotic and potentially luxurious in 2019, why are you waiting to book those flights? Thailand has it all!

Many visitors on holidays to Thailand will choose to base themselves in an all inclusive hotel, right in the centre of the culture and chaos of the cities, like the capital
Bangkok

or the beautiful old city of
Chiang Mai
. Others will flee the city streets for all inclusive island escapes, absorbing the tranquil surroundings of
Phuket
or Koh Samui
, while some will seek a flavour of ancient history at the ruins of
Sukhothai
or
Ayutthaya
. Wherever you choose to go for your break, you’re sure to be hypnotised by this country’s unique appeal.

Top Attractions






There are endless things to do on a 2019 Thailand holiday, a country that continues to thrive on its strong tourist draw, quickly becoming one of the most popular holiday destinations on the planet. From all inclusive Thailand holidays in
Phuket
to backpacking hostels in
Bangkok
, Thailand holidays have a wide range of hotels and destinations to choose from.

A cultural haven awaits you when you book your holiday to Thailand. The country is full of
captivating temples and ancient sites
, transporting visitors to a bygone era full of mystery and vibrancy. Temple lovers will never run out of things to do in Thailand, especially in Bangkok and
Chiang Mai
. The cities are adorned with temples and palaces, with
Wat Arun
and
Wat Pho
the most breath-taking in the capital, while in Chiang Mai you cannot miss
Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep
– try saying that after a Thai whiskey or two! It is certainly worth visiting one of the country’s ancient capital ruins.

The two most famous and impressive sites are
Sukhothai and Ayutthaya
– the former is best explored by bike. Heading to the river town of
Kanchanaburi
will transport you to one of the focal points of WWII. The town is home to the bridge over the River Kwai as well as Commonwealth cemeteries. Thailand’s wildlife is another captivating lure, with
elephants, tigers and monkeys
lurking in the beautiful and diverse landscapes that make up this wonderful country.

Wine and Dine






One of the most indulgent Thailand attractions is the country’s
mouth-watering culinary scene
. Such is the reputation of Thai food you’ll be likely to stroll past one or two Thai restaurants in your local town. But there’s no better place to tuck into some of the country’s most famous dishes than in the restaurants or street food stands that adorn the
capital city
Bangkok
. Whether you go for
pad thai
,
phat thai kung
or
kuay tiew
, you’ll be spoilt for choice for dining locations in the capital. From the upper-class restaurants serving authentic meals, to
street food areas like Ratchawat Market and Sukhumvit Street.

All inclusive
Thailand holidays always have a big focus on food and no two holidays to Thailand will be the same in terms of culinary experience. On Thailand's islands - like
Koh Samui and Phuket
- you'll find a range of
seafood with a Thai twist
.

For Couples






Mainly down to the stunning scenery, coastal beauty and its vibrancy and culture, Thailand is a romantic place. Among the most endearing Thailand attractions are the
beaches
– a real magnet for couples. Around
Phuket
you’ll discover wonderful strips of sand backed by
fine dining, spa treatments and luxury all inclusive hotels
, making Phuket the perfect getaway for loved ones.

Around
Krabi
, couples will find much of the same, but it is the mesmerising boat trips that make this destination particularly romantic. Bobbing along between
karst islands
, finding
hidden lagoons and deserted coves
– roaming around Krabi is like like living out your very own secret love story. Even around
Bangkok
you can find this sort of romance in close quarters – escaping to the
beach resort of Hua Hin
will provide ample respite from the city chaos for lovers.

The northern retreat of
Pai
is situated in a
picturesque valley near
Chiang Mai
and has become a popular retreat for hippies, drawing to a contagious bohemian atmosphere. The surrounding countryside is the area’s main draw, boasting
waterfalls, mountainous vistas and gushing rivers
.

For an unprecedented
Thai national park
experience, look no further than the stunning
Khao Sok National Park
, arguably the country’s most beautiful wildlife reserve. Home to stunning flora and snaking rivers, an adventure around Khao Sok during holidays in Thailand will give you the chance of spotting
tigers, elephants and gibbons
in their natural habitat.

Life's a Beach






Thailand holidays give you the choice of two stunning coastlines, both dotted with paradisiacal islands, lined by perfect beaches and all inclusive hotels. The country is a dream for island hoppers, with the backpacker-friendly havens of
Koh Tao, Koh Phangan and Koh Samui
adorn the east coast, while to the west you’ll discover
Phi Phi Island
and many beautiful islets located off Krabi. The province of
Krabi
itself is home to some stunning beaches and a lively rock climbing scene, and just to the west the beaches of
Phuket
are equally alluring, especially the buzzing
Patong
with its nightclubs and go-go bars. On the west coast you'll find
Khao Lak
, what was once a series of simple fishing villages now turned into a tourist beach haven. With all inclusive resorts and smaller hotels,
Khao Lak
is ideal for those seeking a
beach holiday in 2019
, a little different from the typical favourites.

Nightlife






Thailand has long been a hangout for the young, backpacker crowd and with this is a heavy focus on creating a vibrant nightlife scene for tourists. You’ll find this ethos embedded in most major tourism destinations, including both the islands, like
Koh Samui
, and cities.
Bangkok’s
Khao San Road
is perhaps the most notorious night spot in the country, offering
cheap drinks and cheap thrills
every night of the year.

The scene doesn’t diminish on the isolated islands, with
Phi Phi Island
and those situated off the east coast synonymous with partying.
Koh Pha Ngan
(or Koh Phangan) has become very famous for its raunchy and lively
Full Moon Party
. Koh Pha Ngan is the location, hosting a massive backpacker party on the full moon of every month – expect carnage, but fun carnage.

Another popular spot with partymakers in Thailand is
Patong, on the coast of
Phuket
and boasting a sort of Mediterannean
beach-party vibe
, only sporting some more tradtionally Thai elements like go-go bars and even more heat! After partying all night, retreat to Phuket's quieter beaches and rest off that Thai hangover.

With plenty of options between
all inclusive
resorts and quieter hotels, you can shape your 2019 Thailand holiday around your needs.

Action and Adventure






Adventurous types will find many things to do in Thailand to get their heart racing. Among some of the most intriguing activities are those found on and in the water.
Water sports
are highly popular, and the country’s stunning coastline -
Phuket
&
Koh Samui
- only adds to the appeal.
Diving and snorkelling
are real must-dos, with an abundance of underwater creatures such as
sharks and turtles
ready to be discovered. There are numerous snorkelling and diving tours around
Krabi
, taking you out into the ocean surrounded by karst islands and blue water. In the north, the ocean is replaced by the mountains and diving and snorkelling make way for
rafting and hiking around Khao Sok national Park.

Around
Chiang Mai
and the border with Laos are some extremely rewarding treks. Your 2019 holiday has never looked so jam-packed! Whether you're an all inclusive lover or looking for something authentic, book those flights: Thailand has you covered! Don’t forget, asking at your all inclusive’s concierge desk is the best way to get a few tips.
