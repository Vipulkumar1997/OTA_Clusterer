Spain
’s famed Costa Blanca, meaning ‘white coast’, is one of Europe’s most popular 2018 / 2019 holiday destinations. Visitors come here for a good time; for sun, sand and sangria. Combining a lively social scene, superb beaches and great weather for most of the year, a holiday on the Costa Blanca will remain a firm favourite for travellers into 2019 and beyond.

Despite being popular for its enticing package deals,
all inclusive
resorts and buzzing bars, there’s a little more to the Costa Blanca than meets the eye. Old towns such as that found in Xàbia conceal beautiful backstreets, whitewashed houses and stone shop fronts behind the more contemporary beachfront. Holidaymakers of every age can't wait to return to this please-all paradise, make the Costa Blanca your next
cheap holiday
for 2018 / 2019 and you'll see why.

Top Attractions






The Costa Blanca is home to some of Spain's most famous resorts, making it pretty tricky to choose for your 2018 / 2019 holidays. First of all is
Benidorm
, which we don't have to say much about. This iconic holiday destination has been famous since the 70s, becoming a part of British holiday culture. Known for its all inclusive hotels, stunning
Levante Beach
and strong nightlife, Benidorm is a good place to start your hunt on the Costa Blanca.

For something quieter, the popular yet peaceful resort of Albir has everything you might need for a relaxing Costa Blanca holiday.
Albir
offers a golden sandy beach, awarded Blue Flag status, and a gorgeous strip of restaurants, cafes and shops.

Alicante, the heart of the Costa Blanca and where your flights will deliver you, is home to Roman ruins and its own share of beaches. Visit the castle of
Santa Barbara
or enjoy the pleasant hike to
Playa la Barraca
.
Alicante
is a beautiful cheap holiday destination.

Off the coast and not far from Alicante is the hillside town of
Altea
. Its iconic domed-roof church and the surrounding plaza offer incredible views over the Costa Blanca. We recommend a late lunch time/early evening visit to make the most of the bustling shops and the array of excellent restaurants dotted around Altea.

Calpe, not far from Benidorm or the upmarket Javea and Moraira, is home to the iconic Calpe Rock, an angular rock formation that juts out into the Mediterannean.
Calpe
is a bit like a smaller Alicante, yet this peaceful, well-appointed resort offers quicker access to the countryside and its own lovely beach.

The towns of
Moraira
and Javea are popular with expats and tourists alike. In recent years these small, once-fishing-villages have boomed in popularity and there are many upmarket hotels and restaurants spread out along their charming beaches. Moraira is the quieter of the two, whereas
Javea
is home to a bustling promenade and some of the best nightlife in the area.

Wine and Dine






Hosting as it does millions of international visitors all year round, the Costa Blanca caters to a wide variety of culinary tastes. You’re just as likely to find a full English as you are a plate of
frito misto
here. If it’s a taste of Spain that you’re after, take a detour away from the centre of
Benidorm
into the historic old town and ‘Tapas Alley’.

Here you can sample fresh local prawns from
Denia
or Iberian ham over a cold beer or glass of wine. It’s the ideal place to get off the beaten track and rub shoulders with the locals, a great place to eat by day or night.

Other great resorts for wining and dining include
Javea
and its beachfront promenade;
Alicante
, where you'll find tradtional tapas galore and the resorts of
Torrevieja
and
Guardamar del Seguera
for their seafood.

For Families






Head down to the southern end of the Costa Blanca, to the playground that is
Torrevieja
. There are so many fun activities for children of all ages here, ranging from the popular beaches, a salt lake to walk around and submarine to explore. At Aquopolis Water Park the whole family can make a splash on all manner of crazy slides, there’s a traditional funfair down by the harbour front and even a huge sports complex offering summer activities for kids.

Culture vultures will lap up the historic Benidorm Balcon, the striking castle viewpoint providing views of the whole city and coast as far as the eye can see. Oh, and there’s cannons. Who said a holiday on the Costa Blanca in 2018 / 2019 was all about the 18-30 club? Resorts like
Moraira
and
Javea
are ideal for families, and the quiet
Albir
or hilly
Altea
are great if you want to escape the main crowds. Even
Calpe
, Alicante's little sister, is quiter than the main resorts and offers the same atmosphere and beaches.


Read More about For Families





Action and Adventure






Sea, sky and mountain sports aplenty can be enjoyed on your Costa Blanca holidays. For an adventure on two wheels get yourself down to
Torrevieja
and ride around the nature parks and salt lakes and even stop off for a dip in the mud baths at Mar Menor. Marvel at the flocks of pink flamingos, herons and gulls.

At
Santa Pola
, gusty offshore winds create a perfect environment for kite surfing, ideal for everyone from beginners to experts. If you’re feeling energetic then why not climb
Montgo Mountain
and admire the views of the coast from up on high?


Read More about Action and Adventure







Life's a Beach






Whilst much of the Costa Blanca holiday action centres on Alicante, much beachside fun is to be had in places like
Gandia
, where the sand is groomed daily by tractors. It’s a popular spot in the summer with a great vibe on weekends in particular.

Down in
Benidorm
,
Playa de Levante
is a Blue Flag-rated stretch of golden sand with a pedestrianised promenade. A little further afield lies
Playa de La Fossa
, a wilder beach offering striking views of the Penyal d’Ifac or Calpe Rock in Calpe, a giant limestone rock that rises out of the choppy sea on the horizon.

Denia, just up the coast from Javea and Moraira, is a peaceful resort with a staggering 15km of golden beaches.
Denia
is also known for its laidback vibes, beautiful old town and general welcoming atmosphere. Ideal for a
family holiday
!

Alicante has a gorgeous 5km Blue Flag beach which is renowned in the area for a hotspot for the locals, therefore probably pretty great for the tourists, too.
Calpe
, which is just a bit further up the coast, has a lovely sandy beach with a laid-back promenade.

Nightlife






If you’ve come to dance until the early hours then you’re in the right place.
Benidorm
has its fair share of nightclubs on the strip, the Avenida Communitat Valencia. Most cost around 15 euros to enter and usually include a free drink or two to sweeten the deal.

Over in
Alicante
it’s all about classy cocktail bars. NIC bar does a mean gin and tonic, whereas down by the water Isla Marina will shake up a refreshing ice cocktail to be enjoyed watching the famous Mediterranean sunset. El Coscorron is known for its mojitos, packed crowd and electric jazz music. One way or another, you’ll certainly remember your holiday on the Costa Blanca for a great time after dark.

Moraira has a quiet cafe culture, whereas its bigger sister
Javea
has some of the biggest nightclubs in the area. Relatively newly built, the Javea promenade comes alive in peak season.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






There’s so much to see and do for couples on a Costa Blanca holiday, it really depends on what you love doing (or not doing). The town of Oliva in the north part of the region is rarely crowded, boasts long sandy beaches and wild coastline that is perfect for couples that want to escape the masses and have a bit of alone time.

Altea is ideal for an evening stroll. Its narrow streets, amazing views of the lights of Costa Blanca and its romantic church square make
Albir
a lover's paradise.

Moraira
, with its incredible blue waters and quiet beaches, is a great place for couples that love scuba diving and snorkeling, not to mention those who love a great local tapas restaurant. Javea, just up the coast, is ideal for a couple with a young family.

Benidorm is great for young couples who love to party, whilst the area capital of
Valencia
is a place to soak up the vibrant culture of arts and sciences.


Read More about For Couples





Culture






The Costa Blanca may appear to be ultra modern on the outside, but peel back its contemporary exterior and you’ll find the southern Spain of old. Enjoy a taste of history in
Denia
’s old town centre, inspiration for movie writers and artists. Uncover castles, vineyards and local restaurants in the countryside just outside of
Alicante
. Maybe you’d like to see the iconic blue and white tiled dome of
Altea
’s old church, or discover Moorish monuments in Adsubia. Whatever you fancy, there’s plenty to see from a cultural perspective on your Costa Blanca holiday.
