Irresistible Ibiza holidays in 2018 / 2019

Ibiza, one of Spain’s beautiful
Balearic Islands
, is the famous Mediterranean clubbing hotspot. With cheap flights, fantastic deals on the popular resorts and a cool alternative to the ever-popular Majorca, Ibiza might be the perfect pick for your 2019 holiday.

Sant Antonio

is the biggest clubbing resort, known for its sunset cafés and outposts of Europe’s most popular clubs. The
Playa d’en Bossa
beach, near
Ibiza Town
, is the longest sandy beach and is one of the top resorts for clubbing on Ibiza.

For those looking for something a little different from their Ibiza holiday,
Ibiza Town
is a gorgeous tumble of whitewashed buildings crowned by the
Dalt Vila
(old town), which overlooks a vast harbour. Plus, the island’s breathtaking coastline is packed with idyllic coves and stretches of golden sand, not just bustling resorts, making Ibiza a burgeoning
family holidays
destination.

If you’re looking for somewhere slightly quieter, consider
Santa Eulalia
on the east coast of Ibiza, the resort of
Portinatx
on the northern tip of Ibiza or
Es Cana
, which isn't far from
Santa Eulalia
. You can take your pick from scores of inviting quiet hotels and resorts scattered around the island. Inland, you’ll find drowsy, authentic villages, some offering hotel yoga retreats, and pine-clad hills to explore.

Top Attractions






Ibiza Town, along with
Sant Antonio
on the other side of the island, are the epicentres for Ibiza’s
world-famous nightlife
, with spectacular parties held throughout the summer season. Sant Antonio’s ‘sunset strip’, lined with stylish bars and cafés, is where everyone in Ibiza gathers to watch the
spectacular sunsets.

For waterpark fun combined with hedonistic clubbing, head to Playa d'en Bossa and the Aguamar waterpark. For a taste of daytime culture, Ibiza's charming capital,
Ibiza Town
, is the main cultural attraction of the island, with an alluring old quarter (Dalt Vila) and a clutch of museums to explore whilst you're nursing a hangover.

If clubbing is not for you, Ibiza also has a stunning
natural beauty
. The craggy bays and azure sea of the Ibiza coastline give way to forested hills, vineyards and olive groves inland. Many farms and country homes have been converted into
rural hotels
and
yoga retreats.
You can visit Ibiza's
wineries
, go
hiking
, or visit the hauntingly beautiful salt flats,
Les Salines,
now a protected
nature reserve
.

Some of the top picks from the quiet resorts include
Cala Llonga
,
Cala Tarida
or even Ibiza's little sister island,
Formentera
. Other reasons for booking holidays to Ibiza include deals on flights, fantastic
all inclusive
hotels, and a shift from its hedonistic image to one of luxury and relaxation.

Wine and Dine






Ibiza, as you’d expect from a Balearic island that draws visitors from around the world, offers a wide choice of
international cuisines
. It also has some spectacularly glamorous places to eat, with elaborate dinner entertainment and celebrity chefs. From the gastronomic splendour of Santa Eulalia to the quick eats in San Antonio, from family meals in
Cala Llonga
on the beach to fantastic all inclusive hotels in Playa d'en Bossa, there's lots of food to love on an Ibiza holiday.

You’ll find plenty of places to tuck into proper Balearic grub on Ibiza. Spanish
tapas
, including
patatas bravas
(fried potatoes with a spicy sauce),
tortilla
(omelette),
gambas
(prawns) and
pulpo
(octopus).
Local specialities
include seafood, particularly
dorada
(gilt-head bream),
merluza
(hake) and all kinds of
shellfish
. Try the
fideù
, a variation of paella made with tiny noodles instead of rice. Traditional country restaurants will serve
meat, fish and vegetables
a la brasa
(barbecued on a hot brazier): pork, lamb and rabbit are all common. Cured sausages are a classic on the Balearic islands, particularly
sobrasada
, which is spiced with paprika. Local desserts and pastries include
flan
(a caramel custard) and
ensaïmades
(a circular pastry dusted with icing sugar).

For Families






Ibiza’s fantastic
beaches
will keep kids of all ages happy and with the wide choice of family-friendly resorts and hotels, Ibiza holidays make for a cheap
family holiday
in 2019. Younger kids will enjoy making sandcastles and jumping shallow waves, while older kids can try out a whole range of water sports, such as
paddle boarding
or
kayaking
.

Other attractions include the
Aguamar water park
in Playa d’en Bossa, which has slides and wave pools, the unusual
aquarium
, which is located in an underground cave in Sant Antonio and
Acrobosc
, a treetop adventure circuit in
Santa Eulalia
. You’ll find several
go-karting tracks
and
bowling alleys
, and the
Hippy Markets
in Es Cana are perennially popular.
Boat rides
are always a hit with the whole family: take your pick from the glass-bottomed boat tours, visits to the Es Vedra nature reserve (on an island) or even dolphin-watching tours.

For a great family holiday to Ibiza, we recommend
Cala Llonga
which is laid back and cheerful,
Cala Tarida
which is chilled out but with all the facilities you might need, and
Es Cana
, with an ideal balance between beaches and a buzzing family-friendly strip.

Action and Adventure






Ibiza offers a fantastic range of activities across various resorts for adrenaline-fuelled holidays. With views of the sister islands of
Majorca
and Formentera, you can try
jet skiing
,
parasailing
and a host of other
water sports
. You can even take a
cliff-diving
course, to learn how to leap off clifftops, or have a go on a futuristic
jetpack
,
hoverboard
or
flyboard
in Santa Eulalia, which will have you flying out of the sea like a Marvel villain. You can also go
horse-riding
,
hiking
, and
mountain-biking
across the beautiful rural interior, and around the rugged coastline close to
Cala Llonga
. Of course, the island is fantastic for
snorkelling
and
diving
, with crystal clear waters and excellent visibility. Other popular activities include
yoga
and
pilates
, which are offered at resorts across Ibiza.

Life's a Beach






The
Playa d’en Bossa
, south of Ibiza Town, is a party hotspot, its hotels jam-packed in summer and lined with stylish beach nightlife.
Talamanca
beach, 2km from the centre of Ibiza Town, is a gorgeous curve of golden sand.

Boho-chic celeb haunts
Cala Jondal
and
Les Salines
both have beach bars, while
Cala Llenya
is a great place for young kids thanks to its shallow waters.
Es Cana
is one of the best beaches to watch the sunrise, and
Cala Conte
is a classic for watching it set.
Aguas Blancas
is Ibiza’s best known nudist beach. If you’re prepared to hike, you can escape the crowds and find some lesser known coves, such as
Cala dels Moltons
in the north of the island.

Cala Llonga, not far from Ibiza Town and Santa Eulalia, boasts one of the biggest beaches on the island. For recovering clubbers and playing children,
Cala Llonga
is the perfect spot.

For family beaches, check out Cala Llonga, Cala Tarida or
Portinatx
. For something a little different, why not visit
Formentera
or Majorca, Ibiza's sister islands?

Nightlife






Ibiza is the partying sister of
Majorca
and the best place to dance in the Mediterranean. Ibiza's best-known nightlife hotspots are
Pacha
,
Amnesia
,
Privilege
(which is in the Guinness Book of Records as the world’s biggest club),
Ushuaïa
,
Hï
,
Sankeys
,
Es Paradis
, and
DC-10
. If live music is your thing, book a room at
Ibiza Rocks
, which is an apartment hotel with two stages, that hosts live gigs by top international acts as well as DJ sessions. For mega clubbing, Ibiza Town and
Sant Antonio
are the best resorts to pick.

As well as the mega-clubs, Ibiza also has some amazing
beach clubs and beach bars
, where you can listen to mellow sounds, sip cocktails and soak up the boho vibe.
Watching the sunset
on the beach has been an institution in Ibiza since the hippy-trippy days of the 1960s and now there are scores of bars and entire resorts that are perfectly set to enjoy the beautiful sight of the sun dipping below the horizon.

The top resorts for nightlife include Sant Antonio,
Playa d'en Bossa
and Ibiza Town. For something a little more laid back, Portinatx has a range of bars and restaurants (no super-clubs though.) Just 15 minutes from Ibiza Town you'll find Talamanca beach, which is perfect if you're looking for somewhere to recover after a party.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






Ibiza is a beautiful island, ideal for visiting with your partner as a late 2018 treat or in 2019. There's a range of romantic hotels and delicious loved-up meals to enjoy in
Santa Eulalia
. You can stroll hand in hand through the whitewashed lanes of Ibiza Town, watch the
sunset
from a romantic beach in
Es Cana
, sip cocktails at a chic bar in
Playa d'en Bossa
and enjoy a
candlelit dinner
under the stars.

If you’re both into
clubbing
, the night in Ibiza is yours, with a dazzling choice of clubs to choose from in Sant Antonio or
Playa d'en Bossa
. And there are scores of gorgeous
spas
where you can both pamper yourselves together. If you’re looking for something more offbeat, how about a
starlit kayak ride
? Or you could take a picnic to the top of
Sa Talaia
to enjoy fantastic panoramic views.

Or perhaps go for a stroll through the otherworldly landscapes of the
Ses Salinas
salt flats, now a protected nature reserve. You could also rent a
tandem
, or go
roller-blading
, or take a
hike
along the cliffs to find a secret cove. For peace and quiet on Ibiza, we recommend
Cala Tarida
, just a 15 minutes bus ride from Sant Antonio. Yep. Ibiza has a lot to offer for romantic holidays in 2018/2019.

Culture






Ibiza Town
is the main cultural hub on the island. It is home to a
contemporary art museum
and a fascinating
archaeological museum
that contains finds from across the island. Ibiza is also where you’ll find the widest choice of
dance, theatre and music performances
.
Festivals
are held throughout the year, and every village will celebrate its patron saint in style. Popular festivals include:
Carnival
, held in February or March;
Sant Josep
, which takes place in March; the
Festa de Maig
(May Festival) held in
Santa Eulalia
, and the
Festa de la Verge del Carmen
, which commemorates the patron saint of fishermen and is celebrated in villages across the island in mid-July. Santa Eulalia boasts its own range of galleries to check out, too.
