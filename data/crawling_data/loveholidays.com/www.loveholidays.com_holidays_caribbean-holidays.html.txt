Welcome to Caribbean Holidays for 2018 / 2019

Think Caribbean and you think beach holiday. You think
Barbados
, you think Montego Bay in
Jamaica
and the beautiful islands of
Aruba
and Antigua. These iconic Caribbean destinations are conjured up when you imagine silky white beaches and sunshine. These are Caribbean holidays.

And you certainly won’t find a better destination for lounging in the sand, preferably with something rum-based nearby. The Caribbean has limitless pleasure to offer its' visitors, whatever their taste. Rainforests, coral reefs and mountains for starters; distinctive island cultures with a shared principle of having a good time; and exciting towns and cities with some fascinating history. With our deals on flights, 7 nights stays and of course,
all-inclusive
resorts and hotels, we've got what you need.

As holiday destinations the islands of the Caribbean offer something for everyone, and that includes a fantastic range of
full board
and package Caribbean escapes. You might want to return for your
honeymoon
or even to get married on the beach. But if a beach towel, a book and a planter’s punch is all you need, you’ll never find anywhere better to lie back and soak in relaxation.

You might want to replace that tin-shack bar in your fantasy with a big, luxurious, 5-star resort hotel. And that’s easily enough done. The islands of the Caribbean are ideal for a
family holiday
, and they do it style. High-quality customer service and endless pampering is top of the agenda here.

The Caribbean’s far from being one-dimensional. There are more than 7,000 islands in the group. Though only 13 of them are inhabited island nations, they are a colourful cocktail of distinctive cultures, unique environments, and long, storied histories.










Top Attractions






The
Dominican Republic
is the most popular island with visitors. It’s a perfect mix of beach resort luxury, tropical rainforest paradise, and pretty colonial towns.
Trinidad
is the capital of carnival, where a party of some sort is never far from breaking out. To Jamaica’s beautiful beaches are added a super-laid-back attitude and the rich musical culture.
Antigua
fits the desert island dream to a tee.

Cuba
– just opening up to America again – is the Caribbean’s biggest, most populated island, an intriguing cultural stew of cuisines, cultures and rhythms that – along with the rum – will leave you intoxicated.

What a lot of choices this diverse box of treasures holds. The beaches and resort hotels at the likes of
Punta Cana
are all-inclusive paradises. Kick off your sandals for a pair of boots and you could be hiking through the rainforest, or up Pico Duarte, the Caribbean’s tallest mountain. Historic rum factories are uncorked around Puerto Plata.
Santo Domingo
, the Dominican capital, was the first port of call for Christopher Columbus on his way to the New World and is a beautiful UNESCO-protected historic town.

Discover Jamaica With its long-established British links,
Jamaica’s
a top destination for UK sun seekers, and they’ve got good reason to love it. The beaches are classically Caribbean with white sand, palm trees, coral reefs and blue waters. Then there are the forests, mountains, waterfalls and banana plantations – pure beauty. Finally, the people, the music, the food, the culture; they’re all as wonderful, welcoming and worth exploring as you’ve been led to believe.

Wine and Dine






Food is an obsession with the Caribbean locals, and if you’re a visitor you should be no different. Super-fresh fish, spicy meat stews, straight-from-the-tree fruit juice and some of the best rum and coffee in the world are highlights of Caribbean cuisine.

Eating like royalty is every Caribbean’s birthright! The cuisine is spicy and international – mixing African, European and Latin American flavours. With fantastic local produce – yam, plantain, fish, goat, fruit – to conjure with, Jamaican food is as rich and diverse as the island’s landscapes.

From Barbados to Cuba, there are dozens of special tastes.
Cou cou
in
Barbados
, which is made from corn meal and okra; in
Cuba
it's
ropa vieja
, steak flank in a tomato-based suace;
Sancocho
in the
Dominican Republic
is a meat and rich dish and from
Jamaica
you'll enjoy Ackee and Saltfish for breakfast, primarily.

For Families






Everything that makes the Caribbean great – Barbados is a good choice of top-quality resorts; party people; beaches and jungles; a beautiful historic capital – can be found in spades in
Barbados
.
Bridgetown
has UNESCO World Heritage Status, but the beaches and wild interior don’t need any certification to confirm their timeless beauty.

One of our favourite picks for a family holiday is the Dominican Republic. With great deals on flights and hotels, where can you go wrong for a late 2018 escape or a big-time 2019 holiday? The big beach resorts around
Punta Cana
,
La Romana
,
Samana
and Puerto Plata offer great value access to some of the best beaches in the world.

Santo Domingo
, in the Dominican Republic, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with 16th-century churches, plazas and forts, standing over a beautiful port. There are good museums to explain the island’s place in world history too. There’s more UNESCO protection for the pristine
Eastern National Park
(Parque Nacional del Este), an internationally important land and sea wildlife reserve full of colourful species from pelicans to dolphins.


Read More about For Families





Action and Adventure






The Dominican Republic
is made for family or his-and-her beach breaks, with big resort hotels offering brilliant value and luxury facilities with perfect sands and crystal-clear waters.

Jungle tumbles down the dramatic mountains in the interior. Head for the hills and get ready to explore an unspoiled new world and release your inner Bear Grylls with rainforest adventure sports.

Get ready to change your desert island preconceptions in beautiful
Santo Domingo
, where modern high rises stand side-by-side with the oldest European buildings in the Caribbean. It’s lively, laid-back, and enormous fun.

Climbing the Blue Mountain Peak is just one inland adventure to experience on this stunningly beautiful island. The Blue Hole springs at
Ocho Rios
, the Dunn’s River Falls, the cliffs at
Negril
- Jamaica is packed with natural wonders to discover.

Life's a Beach






You’ve got a picture of the perfect Caribbean island in your head already – the palm tree-fringed, white-sand beach, the funky little beach bar under the trees, yachts sailing by on the deep blue sea. The good news is that you’ve got it just right; the Caribbean more than lives up to the most demanding expectations.

Lying back on a perfect island beach. Seven Mile Beach in
Negril
has room to spread out. Montego Bay is busy with beach bars and water sports. You can surf at Boston Bay Beach in Port Antonio, or lose yourself on Winnifred Beach, a favourite with the locals as well as seclusion-seeking visitors.

From jumping
Montego Bay
to fashionable Seven Mile Beach or isolated Treasure Beach, Jamaica’s coastline is one of the best for sun and sand in the world. And guess what you’ll find at Reggae Beach?

Cancun
, technically a Mexican resort, actually offers some of the best beachfront hotels in the Caribbean. Cancun's spit of sand reaches out in the Caribbean Sea and offers the same weather and hospitality you might imagine on say,
Barbados
, the
Dominican Republic
or
Cuba
.

With gorgeous beaches, a range of accommodation options at top-quality hotels, and great deals on 7 nights stays in Cancun, we've got your 2018 / 2019 Caribbean holiday covered.

Nightlife






Try
Jamaica
. Dancing the night away is expected in the home of reggae. From African-inspired folk songs or church gospel to booming dancehall beats and street sound systems, everything’s got passion and rhythm. We recommend the main strip of
Montego Bay
, an area that in daytime is considered a true Caribbean paradise, and at night bursts with life.

Bridgetown,
Barbados
, is home to many cocktails bars and nightclubs that specialise in the Caribbean drink of choice: rum. Live music is also very popular in Barbados, so grab a seat in the sun, a cold rum cocktail and relax.

On the island capital of
Aruba
,
Oranjestad
, you'll find a mix of relaxing evenings spent at one of the many beach bars, to heaving nightclubs where the party often doesn't end til dawn.

Havana
, in
Cuba
, is home to a nightlife that is miles away from anything you might've experienced in the U.K. Cuban themed bars and clubs have oft been established across the country, but the real Havana magic has to be experienced for itself.

For Couples






The twin islands of
Antigua
and smaller
Barbuda
are as beautiful as any in the Caribbean. The reefs around the shore make the islands’ diving really rewarding. Smaller and less-developed than some of the islands but with 365 beaches, Antigua has room for everyone on its sands.

The times are changing in
Cuba
. But it’s the years of time standing relatively still that give the crumbling, colourful facades and classic American motors of
Havana
much of its charm. Elsewhere there are resorts and beaches to match any in the region, and a rum, a cigar and some Afro-Cuban beats are the icing on a colourful cake.

Trinidad
(busy and relatively built up) and
Tobago
(chilled and empty) are a beautiful contrast. Party in Port of Spain or zip wire through Tobago’s protected forests before lying back on the pink tinged sands.

St Lucia
is a supremely romantic island, its mountains, waterfalls and beaches stealing the hearts of many a visitor. Brilliant beach-front resorts include the famous Sandals brand. A party can always be found in St Lucia,
Gros Islet
, and peace and quiet is the hallmark or
Choc Bay
.

Culture






Jamaica
has a proud cultural heritage with music just the best known of its exports. Historic houses and capital-city museums celebrate everyone from Noel Coward to Bob Marley. The best way to understand it all is just to dive in and immerse yourself.

Santo Domingo
in the
Dominican Republic
was founded in 1496, making it one of the oldest cities in the Caribbean. History oozes out of the very brickwork that makes up some of Santo Domingo's historical facade.

Cancun
, although primarily a purpose-built Hotel Zone, has amazing access to some of the best historical sights in Mexico. We're talking
Chichen Itza
,
Tulum
and various other Mayan ruins that are a world away from the glitzy all inclusive hotels along the Caribbean beaches.

Cuba was, until very recently, an island that was closed up tight to the rest of the world. Following recent political shifts,
Cuba
has opened up to tourism, and some of its old-world charm which was retained so long by isolation - think 1950s cars, fashion and architecture - is sure to be lost as moneyed tourists descend on its streets. The best time to visit Cuba is in 2018 or 2019, before this magic is lost.
