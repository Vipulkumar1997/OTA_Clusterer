A laid back former fishing village on the Eastern coast of
Rhodes
, Pefkos encapsulates everything about an idyllic Greek island holiday. Taking its name from the pine trees that surround it, the town looks out over the deep blue Aegean Sea with quiet sandy beaches, rocky coves and whitewashed buildings. As you can imagine, the weather here is perfect all summer long, the food always fresh and ouzo always flowing. For that relaxed and laid back
Greek island
adventure, it has to be a holiday in Pefkos.

Top Attractions






Whilst the overall vibe is pretty chilled, there’s plenty of stuff to see and do in Pefkos. Try windsurfing at the Blue Flag-rated Pefkos Beach, a visit to the ancient Acropolis in nearby
Lindos
, or a glass bottomed boat trip along the beautiful coastline. If you want to venture further afield then the old town of Rhodes, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is where the temples of Zeus, Athena and Apollo can be found. Or if wandering through quiet and charming streets is your thing then Pefkos’ local craft shops specialise in homemade lace, ceramics and jewellery. And for the perfect ending to any Pefkos holiday, be sure to pick up a bottle of Koriantolino to take home, the region’s signature drink made from ouzo, spices and a flower that grows only on Rhodes.

Wine and Dine






When you think of Greek cuisine you probably think of mezze platters and ouzo. The culinary experience afforded by holidays in Pefkos is that and so much more. The town is home to many family-run restaurants serving up traditional local food and drink. For a hearty dinner dish, try a spot of lamb kleftiko, beef stifado or moussaka. Seafood here is incredible too and you should give the delicious local delicacy, squid risotto, a go. And then there’s plenty of feta cheese, stuffed vine leaves and grilled vegetables to be enjoyed in groups over a glass or two of Greek island liqueur in the warm Pefkos outdoors.

For Families






Families are well catered for in Pefkos. Grab ingredients for a picnic which you can enjoy under the shade of the pine trees, then hit the beach for a spot of sunbathing and relaxing, or go swimming in the calm and gentle waters that are ideal for children. They’ll love the adventure provided by a glass bottomed boat trip, having a supervised ride on a jetski or exploring the rocky coves at the far end of the beach. A trip taken by hire car across the island’s rugged landscape is a fun way to spend a day of your Pefkos holiday too.

Action and Adventure






There’s only one place to start as far as action and adventure are concerned and that’s with water sports. Experience the thrill of cutting across the waves on a jet ski, or feeling the wind in your hair while kite-surfing. Or the Lepia dive centre offers diving experiences for beginners and experts alike. You’ll see plenty of weird and wonderful sights below the surface. There’s also a place called Flyer’s Bar where, after you’ve enjoyed some wonderful food, you can ask to take a trip in their light aircraft! It’s a great way to see Pefkos and the surrounding areas from the air.

Life's a Beach






Pefkos’ curved and sandy beach stretches the length of the town and the dense wood of pine trees that surrounds it gives an added aura of calm and serenity. At one end can be found some secluded rocky coves, perfect for swimming adventures, whilst water sports lovers will find plenty to keep them busy as the beach is popular for both windsurfing and kite-surfing. The water is crystal clear, the ideal setting for snorkelling.

Nightlife






Holidays in Pefkos aren’t about booming nightclubs and partying till dawn (although you can do that in Rhodes and Lindos). What you will find however is a warm and friendly welcome into cocktail bars, family-run drinking dens and late night establishments. Get yourself down to Pefkos By Night, one of the town’s original bars that’s known for its great 80s music, live entertainment and fabulous drinks. It’s a lively, busy place that’s open until late.

For Couples






The area’s sheer idyllic beauty and calming nature is reason enough for couples to fall in love with a Pefkos holiday, however there are plenty of other reasons why the area is great for a trip for two. Imagine the ambience of a sunset seafood dinner outside on a terrace as live traditional music plays, the views illuminated by a brilliant sunset. Think of afternoon walks through the quiet town, floating on the sea or taking a drive along the pretty coast, and you’ll begin to understand why holidays in Pefkos are so popular with couples.

Culture






The site of ancient Lindos, just a short hop from Pefkos, was founded in the 10
th
century B.C. Today the ruins of the Acropolis can be found, with all its typical Greek columns, statues and buildings. It offers a fascinating glimpse into historical island culture and heritage. The town is also home to more contemporary culture, including an annual rock festival. Pink Floyd guitarist Dave Gilmour lived on the island and his music inspires the acts that flock to the town to play open-air concerts along the coast. Who said holidays in Pefkos were all about gentle relaxation?
