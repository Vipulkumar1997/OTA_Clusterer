Renowned for its striking landscapes and famous Blue Lagoon, the sparkling Turkish gem of Olu Deniz is a must-visit for holidaymakers looking for sea and sand combined with a hefty dose of action and adventure. Nestled away on
Turkey
’s south-west coast, this magnificent resort is abundant in natural beauty. Majestic jagged mountains and shimmering seas provide an ideal backdrop for paragliding flights as well as a myriad of water sports on offer. Kick back and unwind on the tranquil seafront, take a diving trip beneath the water’s surface or indulge in a traditional Turkish bath – you’ll love the diversity that comes with Olu Deniz holidays.

The popular coastal resort of Olu Deniz is one of Turkey’s much-visited, beach-boasting tourist destinations that promise holidaymakers a stay filled with sea and sun.

Olu Deniz attractions can be found primarily around the water, in particular in the form of the stunning Blue Lagoon, a nature reserve boasting some of the stillest water and prettiest beaches in
Turkey
. The fresh fish found in the restaurants along the beachfront allows you to indulge in the culinary riches while the neighbouring bars offer a great place to sit with a cocktail and enjoy one of the town’s beautiful sunsets.

Outside of the town you’ll find a combination of attractive scenery, historic and engaging towns and even more treats for the beach bums among you, meaning you’ll never be short of things to do in Olu Deniz.

The
Blue Lagoon Hotel
offers the perfect base of operations to experience the region, situated at the top end of the famous strip you can enjoy easy access to Olu Deniz while still being nestled against the backdrop of woodlands and jagged mountains.

Top Attractions






Take a trip to the nearby tourist town of Fethiye to indulge in a little bit of culture, one of the further afield Olu Deniz attractions. If you make it up to the town on a Tuesday you will be able to experience the bustling farmer’s market. Here you can purchase a variety of local goods and produce – the fresh fish stand is particularly intriguing.

Fethiye is also home to some fascinating cave tombs which you can locate in the cliffs found on the south side of town. These Lycian Sarcophagi are a fantastic site to visit, as is the Hellenistic amphitheatre set down by the coast.

Another worthwhile destination to pay a visit to outside of Olu Deniz is the eerie ghost town of Kayakoy. The town consists of hundreds of abandoned houses, churches and chapels, as well as an impressive old fountain that dates back to 1888. It is certainly a bizarre experience to wander this deserted town.

Shopaholics needn’t be without anything to do on their Olu Deniz holidays either. Pay a visit to the paved street on Carsi Caddesi to find a myriad of colourful shops selling an array of beachwear and souvenirs, as well as some great deals on designer goods. For a vast choice, travel to nearby
Fethiye
. Here, you’ll be able to buy hand-woven carpets, quality leather and beautiful hand-crafted jewellery. As a relaxing finale to your Olu Deniz holidays, indulge in a traditional Turkish hammam in the neighbouring town of Ortaca. Unwind with a Turkish steam bath before enveloping your body in a massage of olive oil – perfect for soothing your skin post-sunshine and indulging your senses before you even think of stepping on board your flight home.

Wine and Dine






There is a burgeoning restaurant scene in Olu Deniz with a variety of cuisines on offer for visitors including local Turkish cuisine, some great fresh seafood and numerous international specialities that cater to tourists.Joseph’s Restaurant is arguably the most popular eatery in Olu Deniz, combining very friendly service with a great range of dishes from various cuisines, including some good Turkish meals such as the tasty Pide, a pizza-like meal. Buzz Bar has some fantastically fresh seafood on offer to diners, caught that very day from the waters you peer upon as you tuck in to your meal. The bar is also a great place to catch the sunset with a drink in hand.

Head on down to the promenade and you’ll find some of the most mouth-watering Turkish restaurants on offer, paired with unrestricted views of the golden sand. From traditional mezze to succulent meat kebabs and freshly-caught seafood, you’ll find some delicious Turkish treats to feast upon on your holidays.

For Families






The Turkey Dalaman area is a great family holiday destination, and there are many things to do in Olu Deniz for parents and their young ones.The considerable safety of the calm, still waters of the Blue Lagoon provide a fantastic setting for families to take to the water for a paddle or swim with limited danger. The lagoon is called the Dead Sea for a reason; even during storms the water remains completely unaffected.

Families that find they need a little bit of time away from the sea should consider visiting the Grand Ucel Water Park. The park is on the site of the Grand Ucel Hotel, though families can access the slides and pools even if they aren’t guests at the hotel. There is a restaurant and a bar at the park serving various meals, drinks and refreshing ice cream.

Action and Adventure






The majority of things to do in Olu Deniz to get active tend to be found around the beaches. Besides swimming in the calm and clear waters of the Blue Lagoon, you can also parasail and kayak in these parts, allowing you to explore further, whether from the sky or from the water.For something a little more extreme, head to nearby Calis Beach where you can try your hand at some kite surfing through the blustery breezes along this part of the coast.For some action away from the water, paying a visit to Butterfly Valley near the village of Faralya will allow you to explore some more of the area’s natural beauty, this time by foot. There are some pretty waterfalls to discover as well as many attractive butterflies - hence the name.

Life's a Beach






You’ve come on holiday to relax, so you’ll be pleased to hear there are many things to do in Olu Deniz to help you feel chilled.Relaxing on the beautiful beaches with the clear, lapping water and mountain scenery will provide you with much of your chill pill dosage. Calis Beach is located just to the north of Olu Deniz beyond the town of Fethiye. It is a great spot to lounge about in the sun or sip on a cool beer in one of the bars by the waterfront. The Blue Lagoon is ideal for a bit of recharging. Known as the ‘Dead Sea’, the still and calm water creates perfect conditions for a nap session on a lilo.

There are a number of resorts dotted around this area, many of which have great pool complexes with access if you buy a drink from the hotel bar. If you need some further pampering, head to Sanctuary Day Spa and Turkish Baths to reach relaxation euphoria.

Sun, sea and sand are an obligatory package on your holidays to Olu Deniz, making the beach a prime location for your break away. The mesmerising sands of the Belcekiz Beach offer an ideal place to unwind and the Belcekiz promenade is host to a series of well-kept gardens for strolling alongside. Whether you’re looking to stay at a stunning beachside hotel or an apartment with a spectacular view, there is a great range of accommodation to be found on Olu Deniz. If you’d rather explore the surrounding resorts in the
Dalaman area
, pay a visit to Fethiye for its rich history and vibrant markets or take a day trip to the nearby lively resort of
Hisaronu
.

Holidays in Olu Deniz are incomplete without a trip to its famous Blue Lagoon. Beginning at the western end of the main beach, these turquoise waters are a dreamlike spot for keen swimmers, as well as those looking to rest on the nearby sun loungers and parasols. Keep your eyes peeled for loggerhead turtles that inhabit these pond-still waters.

Nightlife






There’s not many holiday destinations better than Oludeniz for sun, sea and a non-stop nightlife! Your holiday will be non-stop – if you want it to be that is! Down by the beach you’ll find One For The Road a friendly and scenic destination to start your evening, with one or several for the road to get you in the mood! As you walk along the beach you can also take in Shadows Bar for its live dancing funky music and sizzling meals. The Mojito Bar is a must for Motown and dance fans, with a superb selection of cocktails and beers to get you in the mood for some proper dancefloor action. For any pool hustlers, head to Relax Cocktail Bar for some 8 ball action as well as a huge variety of fresh fruit and mixer flavours. Oludeniz makes for a fantastic nightlife holiday, blending Turkish mystique with plenty of home comforts for Europeans.

For Couples






Couples can get away from it all on a holiday to Oludeniz, and the Turkish seaside resort is idyllic. If you’re an action and adventure aficionado, no problem. If you’re looking for some culture and history, it’s perfect. Or if you’re looking for more of a feet up and bask in the sun type of time, then you’ll love it. True adventures can literally go sky high with some parasailing and paragliding off the bay, water skiing, jet skiing and speed boat tours in the shimmering blue waters, and tours around the magical hills and coastal areas surrounding Oludeniz. After all that hot work, a bit of swimming and snorkelling in the Blue Lagoon off Oludeniz beach is fantastic for cooling off after a stint on the sun lounger! If all that sounds like fun but hard work, perfect ways to wind down are never too far away either in Oludeniz. Spa experiences, genuine Turkish baths and boat trips could be just what the doctor ordered, or you can simply head down to the beach to chill out in one of the fantastic bars on the golden sands. Couples’ holidays and Oludeniz go together like love and marriage!

Culture






Alongside all of Oludeniz’s tourism, nightlife and fun, there is a deep cultural and historical tradition to be explored. An excursion out to the nearby ancient Kaya Village ghost town is a fantastic experience, with its abandoned amphitheatre, streets and dwellings taking you back in time for a while. As well as historical splendour, Oludeniz is also host to a buoyant arts scene with the showpiece being the annual Oludeniz Culture and Art Festival. This celebration of the town’s culture is a lively fusion of dance, singing, concerts, arts and writers mixed with local people and tourists for a truly enjoyable experience. You’ll also be able to sample some splendid local dishes and delicious seafood, all washed down of course with more than generous portions of the Turkish favourite, raki. Turkey’s rich history is well represented in Oludeniz, and your holiday will be all the more enjoyable for it. Holidays to the town blend culture, sea and sand with perfect measure, and we’re confident you’ll fall in love with Oludeniz.
