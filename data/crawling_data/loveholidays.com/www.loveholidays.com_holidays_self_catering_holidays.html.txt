Self catering holidays on any budget

The beauty of self-catering holidays is that you are in complete control; from what you eat for breakfast (including cooking your eggs just the way you like them!) to which wine you enjoy with your evening meal at night. That's not even including making the lovely choice between whether you want to stay in the
Balearics
, or the
Canaries
, or maybe one of the Greek Islands. With 2018 and 2019 self catering holidays, you can spend your day enjoying your hotel's excellent facilities and then head out in the afternoon for a spot of exploring; enjoy a picnic, dine on some delicious fresh fish at the beach or shop in the local markets for local delicacies and even cook up a storm back at the hotel.

loveholidays has an excellent range of self catering holidays available to help you plan the perfect break; whether you fancy heading to somewhere in
Spain
,
Greece
or the Canaries, or maybe somewhere a little more exotic! Whether you're travelling as a family, couple or group of friends, we've got a self catering holiday for everyone.

Self catering holidays to Portugal






We have a range of cheap self catering holidays in sun-drenched destinations. Portugal and the
Algarve
are a cheap and cheerful getaway. With over 20 stunning beaches near to
Albufeira
in the Algarve, and 300 days of sunshine per year, a self-catering holiday to Portugal is just a short flight from London. Albufeira is a large resort town with a charming old town where you can sample some delicious Portuguese delights.

The Algarve is known for its quaint fishing villages and full-on resorts, so you can get the best of both worlds: local tapas and international cuisine! One popular dish in the Algarve is
caldeirada
, or fish stew! But the Algarve is also known for its seafood and you're bound to find plenty of fresh produce at the small, local markets dotted up and down the coast, often situated snugly between the Algarve's large resort towns like Lagos,
Vilamoura
and Albufeira.

Self catering holidays to the Greek Islands






The
Greek Islands
are the perfect choice for delicious cuisine at a reasonable price, with tasty cuisine to please even the fussiest of eaters! Not dissimilarly from the Balearics and the Canaries, this is island cuisine at its best. If you’re enjoying a self catering holiday to
Crete
, Corfu or any other of the islands that ring mainland Greece, you’re going to have ultimate freedom to use local ingredients. Think sea food, olives, cheese…wine! Scrumptious.

Cuisine in Greece has obviously become an international sensation, but whilst you're in Greece you should really try the
moussaka
! Self catering holidays are all about trying out some new cuisine, and whether you're on mainland Greece or situated on one of the many islands, you'll find lots of local markets with fresh produce. Seafood is a must if you're self catering in Greece!

Self catering holidays to Spain






Self catering holidays to
Spain
will take in many of the Spanish Costas, from Costa Dorada, Benalmadena on the Costa del Sol, and Benidorm and Alicante in the Costa Blanca. The cuisine changes from region to region, and as you move down from the Catalan Costa Brava towards the once-Moorish Costa de la Luz and
Andalucia
you’ll find typical Spanish tapas fused with North African elements.

Benidorm
is an international resort but mostly favoured to British tourists. This ecletic mix of cultures has resulted in a mish-mash of cuisine, from greasy cafes to tradtional Mediterranean tapas. Benidorm also has its Old Town, where some of the local tradtions still hold true. There are markets and restaurants serving local cuisine, so don't just think its all English fry-ups and tapas! You'll find plenty more exciting things to eat on a self catering holiday to Benidorm.

Self catering holidays to the Canary Islands






The
Canary Islands
are a great option if you're travelling as a family, with a range of hotels offering self catering apartments aimed at keeping the whole family happy.
Lanzarote
, Tenerife and Fuerteventura are our top picks of the Canaries. Self catering holidays to the Canaries don’t have to break the bank, either. There are plenty of cheap deals on self catering holidays here at loveholidays, and when you arrive in the Canaries you can eat the way you like, as cheaply as you like. All the Canaries boast a seafood based cuisine with Spanish elements, you’ll have to try it whether you stay on Lanzarote or Tenerife.

On both Lanzarote and
Tenerife
, or any of the Canaries for that matter, you'll find a typically Canarian cuisine comprised mainly of seafood, often served with a delicious red sauce,
mojo rojo
. Self catering holidays to the Canaries are perfect because the islands aren't massive, and if you're out exploring rather than sat by the pool, you're bound to see many of the best sights!

Self catering holidays to the Balearic Islands






The Balearics are another top choice.
Majorca
and Ibiza have some of the best restaurants in the Mediterranean and a very tasty local, traditional cuisine comprised of local ingredients. Along Majorca’s Bay of Palma you’ll find numerous restaurants and on
Ibiza
there’s different kinds of eateries to suit the party makers and luxury seekers. Self catering holidays to the Balearic Islands are delicious!

Majorca is teeming with fresh vegetables and fruit, even its own delicious tomato, the Ramellan! Combined with a Spanish love of seafood and hams, a self catering holiday to Majorca offers something for everyone. The other Balearics, Ibiza and Menorca, are smaller but still have their own special agriculture. You're bound to find lots of small markets and restaurants serving up great Balearics cuisine.
