The 5-star Alia Palace is located in a tranquil spot overlooking the Cassandra Gulf close to the village of Pefkochori, Greece. Just a 10-minute walk from the beach and even closer to a range of shops, restaurants and the chilled-out nightlife of Pefkochori, the Alia Palace also offers a free shuttle service to the beach, an outdoor swimming pool and spa facilities.

The rooms at the Alia Palace are classy and light, with the standard rooms offering a side view of the sea or over the gardens. With each level of the rooms, the views improve, so choose wisely! Each room has a bathtub, a private terrace or balcony with furniture, plus a satellite TV, bathroom amenities and WiFi.

Relax by the pool, head to the spa for a cooling and relaxing treatment or make use of the free gym if you're one of those that like's to keep up their regimes even whilst on holiday. After all that, head to one of the 2 restaurants, both offering a la carte or buffet dining options with a choice of local Greek cuisine or international flavours. At the poolside bar, you can choose from a range of drinks and coffee, whereas you can pick up extras from the mini market.
