An impressive resort located on a hillside in an area of national parkland, Kusadasi Golf And Spa Resort offers gorgeous views, 5-star services and a range of activities to make your stay a dream, including an 18-hole golf course right outside.

The rooms in Kusadasi Golf And Spa Resort are fully equipped with modern décor, air-conditioning, DVD player, fridge/freezer, home cinema, satellite TV, as well as a kitchen area, fitted with modern amenities.

Even though the soft sands of the Long Beach are just a short drive away, should you want to sunbathe or swim, you are perfectly capable of doing this on site, too – truth is, the resort boasts no less than 11 outdoor pools! While the main one is fully equipped with waterslides, offering fuss-free fun for the whole family, there are smaller pools perfect for undisturbed relaxation – including an indoor heated pool, which is an oasis of tranquillity. The pools are also hosting a range of activities like aqua-based fitness, water polo, and pool games.

Naturally, the star of the show here is the 18-hole golf course – overlooking a protected national park, the course layout features lakes, numerous water hazards and dozens of bunkers, ensuring quite an exciting experience for the passionate golfer. Enjoy your favourite hobby, while playing on the Bermuda grass, walking between pine and olive trees, admiring the spectacular views over Kusadasi Bay! The ones who prefer to relax all day long should head straight to the spa, boasting a heated pool, Jacuzzi, saunas and a steam room, as well as a range of massages and Turkish bath treatments, creating the ultimate soothing experience.

loveholidays acts as an agent in respect of all bookings made on our website or by telephone. For all bookings, your contract will be with the applicable Service Provider of your chosen Arrangement (who may be the principal or the agent of the principal) and loveholidays acts only as an agent on their behalf. We do not create or organise package holidays. All package holidays available through us are organised by third-party Service Providers on whose behalf we act as agent and where flights are included, protected under their ATOL. Where you book certain flights or a flight and hotel product, it is protected under our ATOL (10989) but we still act as an agent on behalf of the applicable Service Provider. All the Arrangements are priced independent of any other Arrangements booked at the same time and creates separate contracts directly between you and the principal of each Arrangement. Please see our
Agency terms and conditions
