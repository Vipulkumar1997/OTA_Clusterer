Costa del Sol
is true to its name and really is the sunshine coast. Pack your sunscreen, grab that beach ball and let’s head down to the beach pronto!

Top Attractions






A holiday in Fuengirola is sure to be one where most of your time is spent lounging around on the beach. But don’t let that fool you into thinking that there aren’t a number of other things to hold your attention while on holiday here because there certainly are. As with most beachside holiday resorts, Fuengirola has a rather lively reputation for nightlife and it’s one you definitely have to experience first-hand during your stay. The famous area of Calle Capitan is home to some of
Spain
’s most famous clubs and the emphasis in this area is on fun, frolics and of course questionable dance moves - so pack your best disco gear and sample it for yourself.

There are also many opportunities for more wholesome family entertainment, a major one of these being the large water park Aquatico Mijas. The park offers thrills in its many rides for any adrenalin junkies visiting, a particular highlight being the New Diverdragon slide which is sure to get anyone’s blood pumping. The park also has many bars, restaurants and facilities meaning you can spend the whole day there without stressing about anything. Depending on your preference, you can also celebrate children’s birthdays here as well as leaving your sprogs to attend summer camp – a great time they will remember forever.

Another family attraction is Bioparc Fuengirola, a local zoo which is equally committed to providing fun for all the family as it is conserving the natural environment of its surrounding areas. Within the zoo you will not only have the opportunity to snap photos of beautiful animals, but also learn about how the park is trying to battle the many challenges the environment is currently facing.

Wine and Dine






Having such a large tourist contingent from Britain already, the resort of Fuengirola is extremely well prepared for all potential guests when it comes to the matter of the stomach. Fussy eaters need not worry as the amount of British food and home comforts on offer will immediately assuage any fears you may have.

Along the beachfront there are a huge number of restaurants, cafes and bars to cater to all your needs at any time of the day. Tea, coffee, biscuits and cakes for your afternoon needs and British staples like fish & chips, pie & mash or a simple steak are on offer throughout the majority of the restaurants. But if you are more than happy to sample the local cuisine then there are also a number of options there too. In the backstreets of the nearby beach areas are many local restaurants serving delicious tapas, utilising the finest fresh seafood which has been caught that very same day.

When it comes to drinks Fuengirola also has a variety of haunts to frequent. Classically British pubs are just as easy to find as more metropolitan cocktail bars and clubs, meaning you can feel comfortable whatever mood you’re in. Depending on the type of night you want to embark on in regards to food and drink, Fuengirola will have something you’re looking for.

For Families






A huge number of the resort’s hotels have an amazing amount of facilities for visiting families, from separate children’s pools and playgrounds as standard to amazingly-ran entertainment programmes and day-cares. Meaning that whether parents want to venture out on a communal daytrip, or have a little time off, they will be well-catered for, whatever they choose. Of the many daytrips they can embark on around Fuengirola, two of the most popular are the local waterpark Aquatico Mijas and the local zoo and conservation area Bioparc Fuengirola.

Starting with Aquatico Mijas, there are age-appropriate rides and attractions available for all youngsters. Older kids, and of course young-at-heart adults, can sample the many adrenalin-inducing rides on offer like Adventure River, New Dragondiver and a number of log flumes like Body Ski and the Labyrinth slides. For those a little younger there are the Kiddie Slides in the Jungle area, Lizard Island where they can create their own adventures and of course many shallow pools for them to practice their strokes. When the whole family want to get back together then they can enjoy the Blue Lake for a relaxing time or the Wave Pool if they want to have some excitement. There are also many restaurants and facilities to take care of you throughout the day.

Bioparc Fuengirola is a non-profit organisation which cares deeply about conservation. For this reason, Bioparc is so much more than your average zoo. Despite sharing all the fun qualities that many zoos offer, Bioparc also educates the youngsters about what it takes to conserve nature and why it should be taken care of. Popular attractions in the park are the regionally themed areas like the Africa area, the India-Pacific region and the Isle of Madagascar. In addition to these parts, there are also numerous talks and explanations from expert biologists where the whole family can learn something new.

Action and Adventure






As Fuengirola used to be a traditional fishing village before it was a tourist destination, many of the amazing activities you can do there revolve around the ocean; from the expected water-sports of jet-skiing, snorkelling and scuba diving to the more expansive options of learning to sail or embarking on day-long excursions.

One of the most popular excursions offered from the beach is to go dolphin spotting. There are a number of companies offering to take you out on their boats on the clear ocean, while you ready your camera and take a snap of one of nature’s most beloved mammals. Some companies even offer more than just a simple ferrying option and will often stop on the water so you can get out and swim in the beautiful Alboran Sea.

Those seeking adventure on land can also find something to do. Located just outside Fuengirola on the way to Malaga is the base of Quad Adventure Safari Tours, where you can hire a quad bike, either solo or as a tandem, and go exploring the surrounding areas. These amazing machines are not only easy to operate but also incredibly safe after you complete the mandatory safety training.

Life's a Beach






So if you hadn’t guessed already, Fuengirola is pretty bonkers about beaches. When it comes to white sand and crystal blue sea, Fuengirola has got it covered. Over the years it has earned quite the name for itself as a holiday hotspot all because of its glorious beaches. Whatever your preference, there’s a beach for you. Families and adventurers will love the action packed beaches of Santa Amalia. A haven for water sports lovers, this beach is the perfect location for hours of fun in the sun. Pack a picnic and try your hand at the variety of water sports on offer.

If you’re looking for somewhere a bit quieter, then the El Ejido and El Castillo beaches near Sohail Castle are the perfect location. If you fancy a quick break from the beach, then be sure to visit the stunning castle; definitely a must see. Unwind with a book and a cold drink and take in the stunning views - total bliss.

Nightlife






Like countless other beach resorts around Europe, Fuengirola has a buzzing nightlife scene which is bound to hold your attention and keep you coming back for more. The main area for these haunts is Calle Capitan, a place where you can experience many different music styles.

If you’re missing home a little and want to bask in a British pub environment complete with pool table and dart board, then you will find a number of different options to choose from to satisfy your need. But if you’re feeling a tad more adventurous and want to take in something a little different, then you can try one of the many cocktail bars on offer around the area. Offering classics like margaritas, whiskey sours and of course sex on the beach.

After starting your night in one of these places, a must-visit after they close is the nationally famous bar la Botica Copas which stays open way into the early hours of morning and has been known to stay open till 6am. As well as a plethora of drinks to choose from, this amazing bar puts on a variety of entertainment from club nights, live music and holiday celebrations so be sure to check out it’s timetable for when you’re there.

For Couples






Of the many options already talked about in regards to food and drink, there are also a number of beautiful, quaint and charming local bistros which provide the perfect backdrop for a romantic evening with your significant other. Sampling the best local cuisine across a candlelit dinner table is an ideal setting for any great date night and the fact that you can instantly follow that up with a barefoot walk across the nearby beach means that it will be a spectacular evening you’ll remember forever.

Many hotels in Fuengirola offer a wealth of facilities to keep you occupied during your stay and a number of these hotels have their very own spa and wellness centres, these centres provide a number of treatments to help you relax and unwind with your other half. Couples’ massages, hot tubs and a number of other services will ensure that you can spend some real quality time with your partner.

For those seeking something a little bit more left-field as a way to spend time with their partner, then perhaps sampling some of the many activities offered on the beach - from higher-octane water sports like jet-skiing and scuba diving, to more laidback options like snorkelling and banana boats. There are also a number of daytrips offered on the beach which could provide great memories for couples old and young.
