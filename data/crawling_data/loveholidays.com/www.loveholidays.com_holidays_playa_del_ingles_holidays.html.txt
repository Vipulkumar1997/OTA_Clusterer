Top Attractions






For the ultimate fun day out on your Playa del Ingles holiday you can’t go far wrong with a trip to Aqualand. One of the Canary Islands’ largest water parks, it’s home to a huge array of slides and flumes, from the serene to the extreme. There’s plenty of spots to relax in the sun with a cold beer too, as well as food outlets to suit all tastes. You could take a day out at sea on a catamaran, relaxing in the sun up on deck and taking in the sights of the beautiful coastline such as Puerto Mogan. Or for a simple approach, take a walk across the beautiful
Maspalomas
sand dunes to the ancient lighthouse and keeper’s villa at Boulevard El Faro.

Wine and Dine






Freshly grilled fish and plates of tapas are the order of the day in Playa del Ingles, to be enjoyed outdoors with a glass of wine, jug of sangria or cold beer. Rias Bajas, a place well known for its incredible fish, does a roaring trade in fig ice cream; something that simply has to be tried! If you prefer something on the meatier side then head to Silos on Avenida de Tirajana for steaks, fresh chorizo and pasta. Wash it all down with ‘una jarra’ of Tropical, Gran Canaria’s famous island beer.

For Families






There’s plenty to do for all age ranges in Playa del Ingles. Kids will love exploring the vast Maspalomas sand dunes by camel, or taking an open-topped 4x4 safari ride into the hills. The beach is a great place to build sand castles, go swimming and take jet ski rides, whilst the plentiful supply of cafes behind it make for a great place to relax in the shade and grab something tasty to eat. Adventurous types will relish the chance to take a boat out to sea and search for a sighting of dolphins.

Action and Adventure






Be it deep sea fishing, 4x4 exploring or horse back riding; there’s plenty of action and adventure to be had on Playa del Ingles holidays. Hurtle down jaw-dropping water flumes at Aqualand, go head to head with your fellow travellers at Minigolf Atlantico or go for a ramble across the epic sand dunes at Maspalomas. Whatever your thrill, you’re never far away from the action in Playa del Ingles.

Life's a Beach






You’d be hard pressed to spend a holiday in Playa del Ingles without making use of its fabulous beach. A Blue Flag-rated stretch of sand, it’s the place for relaxation, watersports such as jet skiing and windsurfing and also browsing the cafes, bars and shops that line it. Take a walk a little further around the coast and you’ll come to the incredible Maspalomas sand dunes. This 8km desert-like expanse of golden sand is a great place for kids to explore, and even enjoy camel rides.

Nightlife






Holidays in Playa del Ingles are synonymous with relaxing on the beach by day and letting your hair down by night. The Kasbah Centre and Plaza Maspalomas are the beating heart of the action with clubs such as China White and Pacha providing the good vibes until the early hours. For something a little more serene, Playa del Ingles is home to one of Europe’s largest open-air cinemas, the Moonlight Cinema. Here you can relax at tables or on sofas, tuck into fabulous food and drink and watch films under the stars.

For Couples






From gala dinners with live cabaret, to walks on the sand dunes at sunset, a holiday in Playa del Ingles is a great choice for couples. Enjoy a rip roaring night out at Garbo’s, with sparkling costumes, incredible dancing and live performances to accompany great food and drink. Take a relaxing trip out to sea aboard Aphrodite, a traditional wooden sailing ship with spacious sun deck for relaxing together on the ocean. And who could forget Playa del Ingles’ array of designer shopping outlets where you can indulge in a spot of retail therapy. You could even treat each other to something nice to take home!

Culture






Playa del Ingles culture is all about Carnival! This crazy celebration of flamboyant outfits, song and dance draws visitors from miles around. You’ll witness a Rio-style parade of brash sounds and vivid colours, crazy comedy shows, drag performances and a raucous closing party night that ends not too long before sunrise. It has to be seen to be believed and is the lively cultural staple of this beautiful part of Gran Canaria.
