Lovely La Pineda holidays 2018 / 2019

A seaside resort famed for its sun-drenched
Mediterranean
climate, La Pineda offers powdery golden sands and a bevvy of family-friendly attractions. Nestled along the
Costa Dorada
just an hour’s drive south of
Barcelona
, this laid-back beach town is conveniently located near the Port Aventura theme park. If you’re in search of a relaxed holiday in 2019, La Pineda offers an abundance of award-winning beaches to spend your time on.

Lively
Salou
is located nearby, with its buzzing nightlife and cultural attractions. Within La Pineda, you’ll find a concentration of tapas bars, restaurants and friendly pubs, as well as plenty of shops and water sports facilities. Stay in La Pineda to soak up its mellow atmosphere on unspoilt beaches, or explore the Costa Dorada region at your leisure. The landscape’s rustic castles, sprawling vineyards and lush olive groves also include sleepy medieval settlements and farmers’ markets. And with all the attractions of glamorous Barcelona within easy reach, you’ll find everything needed for an unforgettable Spanish getaway.










Top Attractions






La Pineda is most famous for its beaches, with their clear waters and golden sands. You can visit the water sports centres here to delve beneath the Mediterranean on a scuba diving or snorkelling excursion, or get your heart pumping with an action-packed day of windsurfing. Go horseback riding on the beach or visit one of the area’s golf courses to practice your swing. Ancient monasteries like Scala Dei are within easy reach, while
Tarragona
offers a walkable city centre with international brand names and chic boutiques.

There’s an abundance of historic villages located within easy reach of La Pineda, including Cambrils. This is a must-visit destination for history buffs with its well-preserved fortresses and castle. La Pineda holidays are particularly popular with families due to the close proximity of two major theme parks. The Aquapolis water park is located within the town offering high-octane water slides and artificial waves to navigate. For rollercoasters and themed rides for all ages, visit Port Aventura theme park.

Wine and Dine






Dining is a true pleasure of La Pineda holidays, with the town’s concentration of bars and restaurants situated along the waterfront promenade. From intimate tapas bars to family-friendly pizzerias, there’s something for everyone here. The nightclub Pacha La Pineda houses a stylish waterfront restaurant with unencumbered sea views and a seafood-based Spanish menu. The restaurant sits over two floors, with padded loungers and a modern cocktail bar.

Although there are plentiful international restaurants serving everything from Italian to Mexican cuisine in La Pineda, the traditional Spanish cuisine shouldn’t be missed. The Costa Dorada region’s abundant sunshine means the fresh produce is heavenly, with juicy tomatoes, plump olives and complex local wine. This elevates something as basic as grilled bread with tomatoes and olive oil to the next level of deliciousness. Seafood comes fresh out of the Mediterranean and is cooked simply to showcase its natural flavours. If you enjoy a glass of sparkling cava, take a day trip out into the nearby Penedes wine region to taste this elixir at the source.

For Families






La Pineda holidays are a top choice for families, due not only to the Blue Flag beaches on offer here but also the selection of holiday parks. Aquapolis is located right in the heart of La Pineda with its water slides, swimming pools and hydrotherapy treatments. Children will love watching the daily sea lion and dolphin shows before heading back to the beaches to swim or build sand castles.

Port Aventura in nearby Salou is one of the biggest theme parks not only in Spain, but in all of Europe. It’s separated into six exciting areas, each with regional themes including China, Polynesia,
Mexico,
the Far West, the Mediterranean and Sesamo Aventura. All areas of this sprawling theme park feature rides and attractions suitable for different ages, making this a fun day out for the entire family. Port Aventura also includes an additional water park of its own. Additional kid-friendly attractions in the area include UNESCO World Heritage sites like the Roman ruins in Tarragona or Lleida’s impressive castle.

Action and Adventure






In addition to the Aquapolis water park and Port Aventura’s heart-pounding thrill rides, there are plenty of outdoor attractions for adventure seekers. Spend your La Pineda holidays trying out all the water sports in the area, from kayaking to scuba diving. The coast off La Pineda is famed for its wind conditions, making it popular with windsurfers and surfers.

Go bird watching in the nearby Parc Natural del Delta or take a day trip to the limestone interior of the Sierra de Prades for unbeatable rock climbing. Boat tours depart from Cambrils to destinations across the Costa Dorada, whether you wish to travel by sailboat or catamaran. There are a number of golf courses in close proximity to La Pineda, including the Port Aventura Golf Course. This includes crazy golf courses for children as well as more challenging layouts for golf enthusiasts. Navigate lush fairways and tricky sand or water traps with the sea views in the distance. From swimming to hiking, holidays are never dull in La Pineda.

Life's a Beach






The primary allure of La Pineda is its pristine series of beaches, offering an unbroken 3km stretch of luscious golden sand. The beaches have been awarded a Blue Flag status for cleanliness, with the soft sand and gentle incline making La Pineda safe for all ages. There’s a water sports centre with windsurfing equipment, jet skis, pedalos and sea kayaks for hire, and you can also rent umbrellas or sun loungers here to stake out your spot on the sand.

The main beach, Playa La Pineda, is marked by its beach bars, sun shades and volleyball courts. Stroll along the adjoining esplanade to visit waterside restaurants and bars or venture onto the sand to relax. If you’re in search of a bit of privacy during your La Pineda holidays, the northern end of the beach tends to be quieter. To the south of the town, you’ll find Playa del Raco, marked by a rock breakwater. This part of the beach is ideal for smaller children with its rock-free seabed and shallow, warm water.

Nightlife






La Pineda may be small but when the sun goes down this beach resort knows how to turn up the heat. The area surrounding the Playa del Raco is a hotbed of activity in the evenings, with the Pineda-Drink area offering a multitude of bars, terraces and pubs to choose from. Locals and tourists alike start their evening here with a cool drink on the terrace before heading to the nightclubs well after midnight. Relax in a beachside “chiringuito” or find an intimate indoor tapas bar to cosy up with a glass of wine and live music.

The main nightclub on offer here is Pacha La Pineda, mere steps from the sandy beach. It’s the largest in the Costa Dorada region, with multiple dance floors and internationally renowned DJs pumping up the volume. While other beach bars are quite laid back, you’ll be expected to dress to impress here. For additional nightlife options, neighbouring Salou is well-known for its late night bars, restaurants, and discos spilling out onto the beach.

For Couples






Find your own little piece of seaside paradise on your next holidays in La Pineda. With sweeping sea views, secluded coves and upscale resorts, there’s plenty of romance on offer here. Spend your days soaking up the sun poolside or on the beach of your choice in La Pineda. You’re spoiled for choice in terms of couple-friendly restaurants, intimate tapas bars and nightclubs where you can dance and enjoy live entertainment until sunrise.

Are you in search of romantic adventures? Take a boat trip out onto the dazzling waves or go snorkelling to view the colourful marine life below. You can explore the Costa Dorada’s abundant charms with La Pineda as your base. You’ll discover castles lost in time at locations like Tamarit, where the castle looms over a quiet beach surrounded by fragrant pine trees. Visit neighbouring Salou, with its illuminated fountains and gourmet restaurants, or go cava tasting in the Penedes countryside.


Read More about For Couples





Culture






You can experience authentic Spanish culture during your holidays in La Pineda. The village hosts many vibrant fiestas and special events throughout the year, including the dancing and musical performances of the Fiesta de Sant Jaume in July. The beach comes alive during the holiday season in December, when artists from around the world craft massive sand sculptures on the beach.

Take a day trip to nearby Tarragona to view Roman architecture, including stately fountains and monuments. This UNESCO World Heritage site offers the chance to see well-preserved ruins in the context of a modern city. And naturally, all of the cultural attractions of Barcelona are just an hour away, from the Picasso Museum to Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia.
