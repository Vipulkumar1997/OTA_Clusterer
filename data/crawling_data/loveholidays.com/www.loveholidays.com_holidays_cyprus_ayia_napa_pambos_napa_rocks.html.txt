The fantastic adult-only Pambos Napa Rocks is ideal for your stay in sunny Ayia Napa. Perfect for anyone who wants to sample the best of the resort's legendary night scene thanks to its central location, the hotel is both affordable and full of great facilities to choose from.

Enjoy Ayia Napa's lively club scene from a place that boasts some great parties, too! Be it a pool party, a foam party or an after party in AQUA club (the most popular after party club in town) - the Pambos Napa Rocks has got all your holiday party needs covered. The club has two bars serving a variety of cocktails and different Djs playing every night - getting bored is simply not an option here. But that's not all, lazy lounging by the pool on the lovely sun terrace and a close proximity to the beach mean that you can enjoy the polar opposite as well. That is, absolute leisure under the Cypriot sun. Or why not have it both ways?

Plus, the hotel is based in the centre of Ayia Napa so that you won't miss out on anything the resort has to offer its guests - from the vibrant strip to the many restaurants and bars dotted all over the place. Back on site, there's a modern gym on the top floor (the biggest fitness center in the area), two outdoor and one indoor swimming pools...

Pambos napa Rocks has 224 comfy rooms, all fully equipped with two single beds, air conditioning, LCD TV, telephone, safe deposit, mini bar, en-suite bathroom, terrace or balcony and Wi-Fi (surcharge). So rest assured that if you need some peace and quiet, you'll get that too in the sanctuary of your room.
