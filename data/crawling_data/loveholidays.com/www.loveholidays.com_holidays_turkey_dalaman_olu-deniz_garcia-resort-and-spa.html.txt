Located in the small beach resort village of Oludeniz, the Garcia Resort and Spa offers guests an escape to Turkish paradise. Situated on Turkey's Turquoise Coast where the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas meet, the five-star Garcia Resort and Spa is a must-visit hotel to believe just how amazing it truly is.

As standard, the rooms at the Garcia Resort exude 5-star comfort. This includes offerings like free WiFi, a satellite TV, air con, a free mini bar (which is filled once just before check-in), an electronic safe, kettle, tea & coffee kit, a lush rain shower, and hairdryer. In most rooms, you'll also find a terrace or balcony where applicable, and the type of view you'd like can be chosen at the booking stage.

Holidaymakers can find a variety of treatments in the hotel's spa. Whether visitors want to experience a Turkish bath, massage or relaxing sauna, the hotel has it. While parents are enjoying the spa or one of the Garcia Resort and Spa's swimming pools, children can play at the playground area or participate in the Kids' Club. There are also 2 outdoor pools, an indoor pool and a choice of restaurants between the main restaurants and the a la carte restaurants.

When you stay at the Garcia Resort, you're close to Oludeniz, one of the finest beaches in Turkey. Other excellent local attractions include the Lycian Way Trail if hiking is your jam, or the Oludeniz Nature Reserve & Beach if you'd like to get out of the all-inclusive and reconnect with the more natural side of things. The Garcia Resort and Spa offers visitors something completely different to other Turkish holiday resorts. The five-star Garcia Resort and Spa is the perfect destination for a family or couple's holiday to Turkey.

Hi. The description states "Ultra All Inclusive" what more does this include compared to the normal AI.

1 Answer













Hi Darren, the term 'Ultra all-inclusive' refers to added luxuries. This could be premium drinks, or tokens for free use of premium facilities. It can also mean an upgraded room as standard. Each hotel will advertise this in a different way with different premiums. To find exactly what premiums are on offer, it is recommended that you contact the hotel directly.

All package holidays available through us are organised by third-party Service Providers on whose behalf we act as agent and where flights are included, protected under their ATOL. Where you book certain flights or a flight and hotel product, it is protected under our ATOL (10989) but we still act as an agent on behalf of the applicable Service Provider. All the Arrangements are priced independent of any other Arrangements booked at the same time and creates separate contracts directly between you and the principal of each Arrangement. Please see our
Agency terms and conditions
