Top Attractions






If you're looking for some fun on your family holiday, Son Bou is home to the fantastic Club San Jaime. There, you will find a number of shops, restaurants and even a small water park that is perfect for parents with kids, or adults that are just young at heart. A visit to the prehistoric Cales Coves offers a great opportunity to snorkel and dive in one of the island's most beautiful areas. Son Bou is within easy reach of the capital of
Mahon
, where there are many historic sites to see such as the Baroque 17th Century church of
Santa Maria
. If you’re after a great cultural experience, head to the prehistoric village of
Torre d’en Gaumes
, where the remains of one of the largest settlements in Menorca still lies.

A Son Bou holiday would not be complete without a visit to
Cala’n Porter
, home to the famous nightclub developed from a series of natural caves with a superb dancefloor overlooking the sea. It's a truly unique way to dance the night away on your Son Bou holiday.

Wine and Dine






Menorcan food is traditionally made from simple recipes. That doesn't mean the cuisine found on Son Bou holidays isn't worthwhile though because it’s delicious in its simplicity. The food has been called peasant fare in the past due to how easy it is to prepare, but you will find plenty of great seafood, meat and cheeses to tuck into. The traditional foods of the region centre on meat and vegetables, while Sausages are a popular item throughout; one of the local favourites is
sobrasada.
Eaten with bread, cheese and wine, this sausage is enjoyed across Menorca. One of the most popular seafood dishes found in and around Son Bou is lobster stew. Choose a lobster at a restaurant and then enjoy it with a glass of red wine over a candlelit dinner.

For Families






Son Bou holidays aren't complete until visitors check out the amazing ancient ruins near the resort. Families can have a complete cultural learning experience by visiting the Roman Basilicas known as
Sant
Climent
. Built between 300 AD and 400 AD, the ancient religious buildings housed gatherings of people from the island. Club Sant Jaime is a waterpark perfect to cool off the entire family. After exploring the historical sites around Son Bou refresh the whole family with a few hours of fun at Club Sant Jaime. A day trip to the island's capital Mahon offers the chance to wander the city's quaint streets and walk its lush harbour. Laidback and relaxing, a day in Mahon may be the perfect getaway from the nonstop excitement of Son Bou.

Action and Adventure






Son Bou Beach is ripe with water-sports for guests seeking adventure. Windsurfing is a popular activity and guests to the island can rent a wind surfboard to catch some waves in the sea. Paddleboarding is another popular watersport and riders can get up close and personal with the rock formations and coves in the area. Away from the beach, travellers will find plenty of great outdoor activities. Take up an afternoon of horseback riding in the island's rugged hills. Fancy some extreme sports? Rent a mountain bike and slalom down the mountains and across the hills near Son Bou. The area around the resort has a number of hiking trails that vary in difficulty, but the one thing they all have in common is the amazing view they offer hikers. After a day in the hills and mountains working up a sweat, visitors should be sure to stop off at the beach to cool off. Regardless of which activities visitors look for, there is plenty to keep everyone busy on their Son Bou holidays.

Life's a Beach






A beach holiday in Son Bou offers just under 2 miles of sandy shores. With soft golden sands that gently shelve into beautiful blue waters, providing a safe environment for kids to paddle in. There is also a wide range of water-sport activities available at the beach such as windsurfing, jet-skiing, diving and snorkelling. For those visitors who want a more relaxing affair, why not hire a pedalo and take it easy? There is a fantastic selection of beachfront bars providing refreshments throughout the day, so sit back and soak up the sunshine. Work on your tan, catch some waves or just watch the world go by as you sip a cold drink on Son Bou Beach.

Also in the Alaior region, so not far to drive at all, is the beach resort of
Cala'n Porter
. Ideal if you fancy something different.

Nightlife






Son Bou nightlife provides visitors with a tremendous atmosphere when the sun goes down. The resort has a variety of nightspots to listen to live music, sip drinks or dance.
Mao Harbour
is home to several watering holes that give visitors the chance to rest their tired legs. If it’s music you’re after, there is a top jazz club located there to get your fix. If you’re looking for a different gear then there is a sophisticated bar with a trendy terrace also in the harbour. Son Bou's Mai-Tai Cocktail bar is a popular venue for visitors and is open until the early hours of the morning. Tapas, cocktails and music highlight this great contemporary bar that caters to guests of Son Bou.
Cova d'en Xoroi
is located on the south coast of Menorca and is home to a prehistoric dwelling that has been turned into a stunning bar. A trip to Cova d'en Xoroi is worth a visit for the stunning view alone.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






Couples looking for a unique night out should head to the south coast of the island.
Cova d'en Xoroi
isn't just a great venue for its views, but the nightclub is the perfect evening out for drinks and dancing. The nightclub is located in a cave, which offers visitors a unique way to party on holiday. For couples that want some culture during the day or are in need of burning off a hangover,
Talati de Dalt
is a site teeming with history. The structure is from one of the most important settlements in prehistoric time on the island. Once tourists have recovered and taken in some of the island's ancient sites, why not rent a kayak or paddleboard? Paddle around the shore of Son Bou with a loved one as the sun sets. Finish it off with a drink at a beach bar or a dinner of tapas, both equally romantic in the pale sunlight.

Culture






Menorca is often called the calmest of the Balearic Islands. It doesn't have the reputations that
Majorca
or Ibiza possess, but it still packs plenty of fun. Son Bou and Menorca's capital Mahon are laidback and what holidays are made for. Of course, beach holidays in Son Bou are why visitors make it a must-visit destination; but away from the beaches, the island is calm and offers plenty of great cultural exhibits. The entire island has many prehistoric sites and Son Bou has a number of them all to itself. The Roman Basilicas and Torre d'en Galmes are just two of the amazing ancient venues visitors must see. Guests can also tour museums like the
Museu Municipal del
Bastio
de
sa
Font
to learn more about the history of the area, including its military past.

Summertime offers visitors the opportunity to attend a number of festivals and music concerts that take place in Son Bou. Choral singing and opera are both popular pastimes, and concerts are held throughout the warmer months. The island's art museums houses some of the great local art produced by well-known, and some not-so-well-known, artists. Holidays in Son Bou are a great way to learn about an island often overlooked, largely thanks to its noisy neighbours. But regardless of that, it is one island that will provide an unforgettable holiday abroad.
