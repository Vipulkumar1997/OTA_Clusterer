Ibiza may have built its reputation as a party island, and there’s no disputing it deserves it, but there is more to this island than all night parties and an
all inclusive
holiday to Ibiza can cater to every holiday preference.

Santa Eulalia
is a haven for families and the culturally inclined, making it a fantstic all inclusive option for those wanting a less neon-lit ibiza holiday. The epicentre of Ibiza’s gastronomical and artistic activities, the resort town offers a quieter and more luxuriant Ibiza experience. There is still no shortage of things to do whether it’s popping into art galleries, sampling the fares of the local restaurants, or splashing in the crystal waters of the Santa Eulalia beach.

Cala Tarida
is the place to watch the sun set on this beautiful island, it’s southern location, stunning beaches and lush green hillside surrounds make it a prime spot for sundown drinks and sunset strolls, an ideal location for couples. Set up camp with an all inclusive stay to ensure you never miss a single one.

Playa d’en Bossa
wins the Ibiza resort popularity contest. The party capital of the party island, Playa d’en Bossa boasts Ibiza’s longest beach, famous clubs visited by international DJ’s, and a host of beach activities from water sports to bali beach beds and cocktail bars on the sand. This is the spiritual home of the Ibiza party scene. Opt for an all inclusive Ibiza holiday here to take care of all the holiday essentials, and leave you free to splash your cash after dark.

Ibiza Town
is where you head for more of the world’s most famous clubs, sumptuous yachts in the Marina Botafoch, the beautiful Talamanca beach and historical icons like the Dalt Vila. Yes there’s culture in Ibiza too, making it an all inclusive destination that really does have it all.
