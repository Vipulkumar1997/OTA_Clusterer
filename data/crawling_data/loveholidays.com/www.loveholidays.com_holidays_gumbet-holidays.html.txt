For the perfect beach holiday in 2018, you’ll find it hard to beat Gumbet on the Aegean coast of
Turkey
.  Boasting beautiful sandy beaches alongside a great range of tours and activities, Gumbet makes a great location for a memorable holiday in the sun.

Gumbet is a popular destination for families and couples alike, with its idyllic views, thrilling water sports and relaxing day-long boat trips, not to mention ample shops, restaurants and bars.

Ideally situated for getting out and about, Gumbet is just a 10-minute bus ride from the bustling resort of
Bodrum
, with its mix of ancient sites and lively nightlife, and a great base for those wishing to explore the nearby islands and coves. If the history of the local area isn’t enough, a trip further afield to the ancient ruins of the city of Ephesus is a must.

Top Attractions






One of the joys of holidaying in Gumbet is the great choice of boat trips on offer. There are many excursions that run daily from the nearest beach, ideal whether you choose a boat trip to the Greek island of
Kos
or to the Black Island for a swim in the grottos.

A visit to the market in Turgutreis, just 30 minutes from the resort, will provide a colourful feast for the eyes and is a great place to find that perfect souvenir to remind you of your holidays.

By choosing a holiday in Gumbet, you’ll be filling your days with activities from camel rides to diving among wrecks and snorkelling in the Big Reef. The great choice of bars and clubs will ensure your nights are just as busy.

Those eager to take in a bit of the local culture will appreciate a wealth of sightseeing hotspots, from the quaint Turkish villages and old flour windmills perched on the hillside, to Bodrum’s 15
th
century castle and impressive amphitheatre.

Wine and Dine






With cafes and restaurants offering both Turkish and international cuisines, there’s no palate that will go unsatisfied.  Food inspired by Ottoman and
Mediterranean
flavours means that fresh seafood, spicy meat kebabs, kofte meatballs and sweet pastries are all on the menu.

Many cafes are handily situated on the beach, so little effort is needed to find that perfect meal.  You’ll find plenty to choose from, whether you’re craving refreshing light salads or something more filling.  These can be washed down with a healthy smoothie, a cool cocktail or a glass of Efes beer.

Al-fresco dining with sunset views over the bay are a real possibility here, with restaurants such as The Windmill providing that all important scenic backdrop, as you sample the local cuisine and sip on cooling drinks.

For Families






With plenty of relaxed cafes and restaurants, along with day trips, tours and beach activities, Gumbet makes for a wonderful destination for a family holiday.

Long days can be easily spent at the beach, with its golden sand, shallow waters and wealth of family-friendly water sports. Of course, a ride on a camel will leave smiles all round and is a must-do on your Gumbet holidays.

Pop over to the aqua park with its multitude of water slides, pools and artificial rivers for a day of splashing about in colourful surroundings. Or take a short hop over to the market at
Turgutreis
.  Here you will find yourself wandering among a vast array of local produce, including tangerines, olives and cheese. Exotic spices and colourful textiles will be a feast for the eyes as well as your other senses.

Families seeking a slower pace might like to escape to the tranquillity of the old fishing port of Gumusluk and watch the boats coming and going, explore the rockpools or relax on the beach. There are plenty of cafes here serving the catch of the day, but more adventurous families may fancy catching their own fish and enjoying a barbeque on the beach.

Action and Adventure






Looking for more than just a beach holiday? Gumbet’s wealth of activities, from Jeep, quad and buggy safaris to reef and cave diving will surely fit the bill.

Why not take a Jeep safari with a group of friends or the family and see a mixture of traditional villages, remote coves and forests, all with the added excitement of some off-road driving?

Daily boat trips will whisk you away to the small islands dotted around the coast.  These will leave you with lifelong memories of swimming in secluded locations, feeding the amazing marine life and lounging on board a beautiful sailing boat.

Those looking for an alternative day out can take a boat trip to the popular Greek Island of Kos with its cafes, pristine painted buildings and bustling square.  The ancient city of Ephesus is also possible to visit from Gumbet, although a little further away it is certainly worth the trip. The ancient ruins of stone temples and tombs are a favourite of many visitors.

Life's a Beach






The beaches here are famous for the vast bays of idyllic golden sands and turquoise seas. Gumbet’s bay offers visitors 1km of beach to relax on. Find that perfect spot and lie back on one of the many sun beds or bean bags in the warm Turkish sun.  Grab a shady spot in one of the cafés lining the beach, and cool down with a drink or snack, while taking in the breath-taking views of the coast.

With shallow waters, excellent facilities and the additional fun of camel rides, families are well-catered for. If you’re feeling active on your holiday there’s a great range of water sports on offer, from banana boat rides to windsurfing and parasailing.

Scuba Diving is also popular, with expert tuition available for beginners. Diving sites, such as the Big Reef, will reward you with an up close and personal show of tropical fish and colourful marine life.

Nightlife






When the sun goes down, there is excellent nightlife on offer, with a great selection of clubs, discos, bars and beach clubs in both Gumbet and neighbouring Bodrum – a short taxi trip down the road. The brightly lit bars stay open until the early hours, allowing you to sip cocktails and dance until dawn.  Whether you fancy making some noise with a spot of karaoke, listening to live music, dancing to DJs or simply chilling out with friends, there’s a bar waiting for you to let your hair down.

Those looking for something slightly less energetic, will find that many of the restaurants host live music and entertainment during the evenings.

For Couples






Gumbet is ideal for romantic getaways, with plenty to keep couples captivated. Head above the town to see the old windmills which dominate the hillside and take in the views of the town and coastline, visit Bodrum’s Antique Theatre, or reinvigorate yourselves with a visit to a Turkish bath.

Explore the beautiful bays of Gumbet by boat or hire a car and venture out into the hills. Meet some of the locals by taking a short journey to the nearby villages which still retain their original charm, and marvel at the expertly handcrafted carpets and kilims produced in the area.

Patterned carpets are a speciality of Turkey and couples looking to find a lasting souvenir of their holiday can take a short journey out to Milas. This small town is known as the carpet capital of Turkey and the perfect place to pick up a handmade rug to adorn your home for years to come.

For something completely different, Turtle Beach near
Dalyan
makes a great day trip out. This is an area of unique beauty, famed for its wonderful rock tombs and natural mud baths, which are sure to leave a lasting impression.

Culture






A holiday in Gumbet is a trip into the spectacular history of Turkey. A great place to start is the 15th century Bodrum Castle, which contains the highly-rated Museum of Underwater Archaeology. In the museum you’ll find everything from old ship wrecks and items rescued from the sea, to a large collection of amphoras once used to hold wine and foods. The castle, an imposing structure built by the Knights of
Rhodes
, gives visitors a great view of the coast and is used to host some of the area’s vibrant cultural festivals.

Don’t miss Bodrum Antique Theatre, part of what was once the ancient city of Halicarnassus, an impressive amphitheatre with stunning views of the peninsula. Also just a few kilometres away from the Gumbet resort is the Myndos Gate, once the gateway to the ancient city, and the equally intriguing Ottoman Shipyard Tower.

Travel between Gumbet and Bodrum and you will discover what remains of seven windmills. Made from stone and wood, it’s hard to believe that these 18
th
century mills were still in use until fairly recently. With a wealth of history to uncover, there’s plenty to see in Gumbet.
