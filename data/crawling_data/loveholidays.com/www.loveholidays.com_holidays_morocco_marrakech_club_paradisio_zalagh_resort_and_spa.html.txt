With a great central location, the 4 star Zalagh Kasbah Hotel & Spa could be your oasis of peace and calm in one of the most vibrantly chaotic cities on earth, one that has been attracting traders and travellers for centuries.

Zalagh Kasbah Hotel & Spa is built around a large courtyard pool, and the buildings boast traditional Moroccan architectural styles. There’s also an indoor pool , which is part of a big spa and wellness offering that majors in marbled walls, traditional domed roofs, and steam as well as water treatments. A good portfolio of practical facilities include free Wi-Fi in public areas, on-site shopping, and a free shuttle service.

You won’t have far from the Zalagh Kasbah Hotel & Spa to start discovering this fascinating and historic city. The walls of the Medina – the traditional Arab quarter of the city – loom up nearby. It’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site and packed with culture and traders selling wonderful local products. Add Jemaa-el-Fna square to your shopping route, possibly the largest open market of its kind in Africa. The cities' gardens attract many visitors every year, and are worth exploring too. The Menara gardens, with dozens of varieties of olive trees, were laid out in the 12th century.Yves Saint Laurent, France’s fashion king, owned the predictably stylish Jardin Majorelle, which is also open to visitors.

To the south of the city lie the Atlas Mountains, one of the wonders of Africa, and brilliant hiking, off-road, wildlife, and cultural excursion territory . Casablanca, one of Africa’s largest and most exciting cities, is just three hours away by train to the north, and is thus easily reached.

Plan your Moroccan adventure from the peace and calm of this beautiful city-centre oasis. Book the Zalagh Kasbah Hotel & Spa with Loveholidays now!
