Fabulous family holidays 2018 / 2019

Whether you’re looking to book one of your first family breaks in 2018 or 2019, or that final fling before the kids fly the nest, family holidays are some of the best. But where do you even start with planning one? Do you pick Lanzarote,
Majorca
or Benidorm? Which 'playa' or 'costa' is the most family friendly? All inclusive, half-board or self catering? Which destination offers activities for both adults and children? Does your hotel have a kids’ club?

We believe a family holiday should be as stress-free as possible. That’s why we’re here to make sure that, from departure to arrival at your hotel, booking your 2018 or 2019 family adventure runs as easy as lounging on a beach. To help, we've got cheap deals on hotels and flights to match any budget. To cut down on holiday costs for that classic 7 nights holiday,
all inclusive holidays
are the way forwards.

A big benefit of our choices here is the relatively short, cheap range of flights on offer. To Spain, to
Greece
, to Portugal: the distance between home and your all inclusive hotel is hardly a journey at all.

For Families






A family holiday should be all about beaches and family hotels, and where else will you find more beaches than on an island? From the
Canary Islands
, the Balearic Islands and the Greek Islands, we’ve got quite a range of family destinations to choose from in 2018 and 2019. Our holidays are ideal for families because we offer great deals on flights and 7 nights
package holidays.

Family holidays to the Canaries include Tenerife, Lanzarote and Fuerteventura (although we shouldn’t forget Gran Canaria either.) You can expect big beaches and enough waterparks to tire out even the most excitable children. We're keen on
Costa Adeje
!

The beautiful
Balearic Islands
are known for their party atmospheres, but whether you pick Majorca, Menorca or Ibiza, there’s plenty for families too. Think huge waterparks on
Majorca
around Magaluf, all inclusive relaxation and fun on Ibiza, and countryside and family friendly beach scrambling on Menorca. Ibiza is actually becoming more of a family holiday destination as its ravers from the 90s, which grew up holidaying on the island, have now returned with their families. You'll find that a lot of hotels on
Ibiza
cater more to families than ever before.

Last, but not least, the iconic
Greek Islands
, staples of the Great British family holiday for decades. Corfu has plenty of quiet spots with fantastic beaches suitable for the whole family. Crete is idyllic, with lots more of those family friendly beaches the Greek Islands are known for.

Paphos
in Cyprus is a keen favourite and the relaxed hospitality of the local hotels will guarantee a stress-free holiday.

Portugal & The Algarve






Holidays to the Algarve in 2018 / 2019 boast a stunning coastline, family friendly hotels and beaches.
Albufeira
is an extremely busy resort and a great place to base yourself during your stay in Portugal. Albufeira has a host of sights to see, a charming old town and enough water sports to keep everybody active the whole holiday long.

There are some quieter beaches (worth the drive) that provide everything a family might need. We particularly like Praia do Ancao, near to the capital
Faro
. There are calm seas and the sands are regularly patrolled by life guards.

There's a lot more than beaches in the
Algarve
. Set yourself up in Albufeira and get ready for the family holiday of a lifetime. You have to check out one of the large waterparks, like Aqualand, if you’re travelling with kids. If you’re in Lagos for the beaches (which you should be) you could check out the Zoo de Lagos, or if you still want to see more animals, Zoomarine Algarve.

Canary Islands






Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Tenerife and Gran Canaria. The golden 4. The Canaries are ideal for your 2018 / 2019 family holiday. Here are our top resort picks for families from each of the Canaries.

Lanzarote's
Puerto del Carmen
is the largest and oldest resort on the island. Lined with 3 golden beaches - Playa Grande beach, Playa de los Pocillos beach and Playa de Matagord - Puerto del Carmen is island for families looking for a beach-filled holiday with plenty of activities. Last, but not least, is
Playa Blanca
- an old fishing area which retains a lot of its original charm. Playa Blanca is perfect for a quieter family holiday in 2018 or 2019.

Fuerteventura lays claim to the beauitful
Costa Calma
, very aptly named for an area which provides a charming peace and relaxation. For an experience of a lifetime, you've got to visit Playa del Moro in Corralejo. The dunes here are absolutely stunning. Other worldly!

Tenerife is a family holidays classic. Dominated by Mt. Teide, Tenerife offers up a great choice of family friendly resorts. We particularly like
Playa de Las Americas
. This resort was purpose built with families in mind and so cater to every type of family holiday maker!

Gran Canaria is often under sung and under appreciated. With a rustic rural interior and a quiet calm to the island, we reccommend Playa del Ingles. This resort has catered for a diverse selection of holiday makers, and there's definitely room for you on your 2018 / 2019 family holiday!

Spain






Where else is better for a family holiday than charming
Spain
? Costa Blanca is one of the original family destinations for your 2018 / 2019 holidays. The crown jewel of Costa Blanca is the mega-resort,
Benidorm.
The towering skyscrapers overlooking the blue Mediterranean is just about one of the most iconic images a Brit can conjure up when they’re asked about family holidays.

Fantastic hotels providing all inclusive ease, excellent beaches (Playa Poniente and Playa Levante) and massive waterparks, make Benidorm and Costa Blanca one of our top destinations for family holidays. Don’t forget the cheap flights and hotels…we’ve got the best deals here at loveholidays which make this
cheap holiday
destination even cheaper!

If the Costa Blanca and Benidorm aren't for you in 2018 or 2019, then try the
Costa del Sol
! Or the Costa Brava, home to the popular
Lloret de Mar
.

Family Activities






We’ve mentioned Aqualand in the Algarve, but there’s also waterparks close to
Magaluf
, or in El Arenal (where there’s also a family friendly beach.) There’s a huge water park called Aquapark in Lanzarote, or WaterWorld on Cyprus, an excellent day trip if you’re staying in Paphos. There’s no shortage of water based activities at any of our top destinations for family holidays. Whether you fancy Spain, Portugal or Greece, there's fun to be had for the kids!

Greece holidays have awesome water sports available, including great snorkelling and scuba diving. Take a dip off of Corfu or Crete and explore the depths. Malta has activities for all the family, including bird parks, aquariums and theme parks for the kids. We particulalry like Mellieha and the
Mellieha Bay
area in the north of the island.

Benidorm and
Tenerife
holidays are known for their extensive resort areas, packed full of activities. Ask at the hotel desk for a steering in the right direction. Anything from go-karting to horse riding, or boat tours, scuba diving, the list goes on! We've got you covered, booking a family holiday should be no problem with our 2018 or 2019 choice of some of the best family holidays destinations.

Family holiday to Albufeira






We've already mentioned
Albufeira
in the Algarve, but we thought it was worth mentioning twice! Why? Because there are 20 beaches to choose from! So many beaches it's hard to pick just one...

Our favourite -  and generally agreed to be one of the best beaches in the Algarve - is Falesia Beach, or
Olhos de Agua
. With a stern cliff face and perfect sands, this beach is just a short journey from Albuferia proper. With an adjoining cafe, stunning views and a little town, Falesia Beach should be at the top of your list!

Praia de Oura
, along the front of Albufeira, is a poster beach, the sort of beach you daydream about when you're planning your 2018 / 2019 family holiday. There's beach beds, shops and bars and restaurants to grab a bite to eat overlooking the turqoise sea. Just beautiful!

Resting on the chin of Albufeira's old town, like a yellow moustache, is the huge beach
Praia de Pescadores
. This built up beach is perfect for a family looking for nearby amenities, beaches and facilities. If you're staying in Albufeira, Praia de Pescadores is a must visit.
