Answer








Our son is 16, is there an age limit in the water park ?

2 Answers













Hi Roger, the age and height restrictions for the slides and water park mainly relate to younger/smaller children ie minimum height of 140cm. If your 16 year old is above this height then they will be able to enjoy all that the waterpark has to offer - except of course for the smaller attractions designed for the little ones. Kind Regards
