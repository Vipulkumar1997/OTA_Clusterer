Situated in the beautiful Playa Blanca in the south of Lanzarote, the luxurious 5-star Gran Castillo Tagoro Family & Fun offers guests first-rate accommodation and is in an ideal location for accessing the seafront, great for both couples and families. The hotel showcases Spanish villa-style rooms in romantic whitewashed buildings, surrounded by lush green tropical gardens and was inspired by the design of the famous local castle Castillo de San Jose.

The rooms at the Gran Castillo Tagoro Family & Fun are designed in a light and airy style with traditional elements, including exposed wood and pastel colours. Each room has a bathroom with the all-important hairdryer, air conditioning, safe (no charge), a satellite TV for bedtime watching, a mini fridge/mini bar, and a balcony or terrace (where applicable) with a choice between sea or countryside views. Beyond the standard rooms, you'll find more luxurious Superior rooms, which are bigger and better for families.

With 11 onsite swimming pools, it’s never hard to find a quiet spot by the poolside to set up your sun lounger and parasol and sip a cocktail as you bask in the sunshine. The Gran Castillo Tagoro Family & Fun’s spa indulges your every relaxation need with two Jacuzzis, a sauna and an excellent selection of massage treatments. There are a hotel kids’ club and children’s swimming pool with slides to keep the little ones occupied while you’re at the spa for the ultimate in relaxing alone time.

Guests are invited to enjoy their meals at any of the hotel’s three restaurants. At the buffet-style Coloradas Restaurant (available for breakfast, lunch and dinner), you can watch show-cooking displays while you eat. Try the Portofino Italian restaurant if you’re a fan of pasta and seafood dishes and if you prefer Asian cuisine, there’s the Guang Zhou restaurant. With two bars – La Cascada and Princesa Dacil- you’re never short of options for snacks and refreshments during the day either. For a memorable experience, head to the cinema’s 5D cinema and enjoy a truly immersive cinematic experience.

This elegant hotel is situated within walking distance of the lovely town of Playa Blanca with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants to keep you entertained, plus a short journey of 6km to get to the breathtaking Playa Papagayo beach with its dramatic coastline and warm blue waters.

We have booked as a couple to visit at the end of April.  Can you tell us more about the adults only zones and are there any decent restaurants or bars within 10 minutes walk of the hotel? We are looking forward to a relaxing holiday...

1 Answer













Hiya, there are adult only lounge and pool areas, and even an eating area, too, so you can keep everything peaceful and quiet during your stay.
Playa Blanca is just down the road, probably a 15-20 minute walk. If you're looking for somewhere closer there are restaurants and bars within 5 minutes.

You've booked the right place for a relaxing holiday, there's a good balance between family + relaxation.

Hi William, there is a beach right outside the hotel, but it is pebble/rocky, you can enter the sea from there though. Papagayo natural beach is about a 20 minute walk, or there is a nice beach in Playa Blanca, approx. 30 mins walk away.

Are babysitting services available? If so for what age children?

1 Answer













Bbay sitting is available here is the information we have:
It is reassuring to know that you’ll find skilled professionals at the hotel who can take care of your little one for a couple of hours in the most delightful and charming Baby Club you can imagine. A specially adapted environment for babies from 6 months up to 3 years old with special games and toys and a small sandbox for them to enjoy. Meanwhile, you can keep an eye on them from the swimming pool, as we know how hard it is for you to be separated from your little one. Have a little fun for a while before you start to really miss them.

Hi there, I 'm really exciting at all the great comments I've seen and I am looking to book here shortly.

My questions:
- Upgrading to premium all inclusive seems great, but can this be added at any time? I.e., if I stayed 4 days could I half way through the holiday upgrade for the 2 remaining days I have at the hotel? ? 
- How far are supermarkets/shops to the resort?

Thanks in advance, Lauren :)

1 Answer













Hi there Lauren
I am going to email you my direct contact as I have a contact at Dream Castillo that I was recently dealing with for another customer and I can ask if you can do the Ultra All Inc for a certain time/nights.
With regards to the shops they are about a 20 minute walk towards the Rubicon marina
