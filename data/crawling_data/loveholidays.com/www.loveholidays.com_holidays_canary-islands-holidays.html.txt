Captivating Canary Island holidays 2018/2019

The Canary Islands are a rugged, sun-drenched, Spanish archipelago located just 100 kilometres from the coast of Africa. The main islands are
Tenerife
,
Lanzarote
,
Gran Canaria
,
Fuerteventura
,
La Gomera
,
La Palma
and
El Hierro.

Thanks to the unbeatable combination of year-round sunshine, stunning beaches, and spectacular landscapes that encompass volcanoes, forest, mountains and desert, the Canary Islands attract about 14 million visitors a year. From an
all-inclusive Tenerife
break to a self-catering villa on Gran Canaria, the Canary Islands have accommodation options to suit every budget and holiday taste.

The Canary beaches – a mixture of black volcanic sand and dazzling white sand – may be the biggest draw, but the Canary Islands are also a magnet for hikers and nature-lovers. Four of Spain’s fifteen National Parks are in the Canary Islands, and UNESCO has designated the entire islands of
Lanzarote
,
Gran Canaria
and
Fuerteventura
as Biosphere Reserves.

Beach-bums will be in paradise, nature lovers on cloud 9, but the Canary Islands are also perfect for you culture vultures. Boasting beautifully preserved historic towns, enchanting island capitals, lively resorts, exuberant festivals, and delicious local cuisine, the Canary Islands are a fantastic opportunity to immerse yourself in a unique and fascinating island culture on your 2018/2019 holiday.

Top Attractions






Although all the Canary Islands have stunning beaches, perhaps
Fuerteventura
has the edge over the other Canary Islands, with its Caribbean-style stretches of white sand and its relaxed, beach bum vibe. The crystal-clear seas are perfect for trying out a huge range of
water sports
, from snorkelling and diving to kite-surfing and parasailing. A top resort to check out in Fuerteventura is
Caleta de Fuste
, or for stunning dunes,
Corralejo
.

You can escape the crowds in one of the beautiful
nature reserves or national parks
that are found on all the Canary Islands. Hiking, birding and biking are all popular pastimes.
Tenerife
, the largest of the Canary Islands, is home to Spain’s highest peak – the
Mount Teide volcano
(3,718m). It’s the focal point of a huge National Park, which is the most visited in Spain, and you can swing up to the summit in a cable car. The views are simply breathtaking.

The magnificent
Timanfaya National Park
on
Lanzarote
is also centred around a volcano – which is still active, although there have been no eruptions since the early 19
th
century. There are more volcanic peaks to explore in
La Palma
’s
National Park
. Inland, you’ll also find lots of
charming villages
,
wineries
and
farms
that you can visit, along with
natural swimming pools
and
waterfalls
.

Check out the Canary Island capitals for great
restaurants, shops
and a wide range of cultural events:
Santa Cruz de Tenerife
(Tenerife) explodes every year in the world’s second-biggest
carnival
celebrations, while
Las Palmas
on
Gran Canaria
and
Santa Cruz de la Palma
on La Palma have alluring historic streets packed with great tapas bars and cafés.

All the Canary Islands have plenty of fun
theme parks
to keep kids of all ages happy. The most famous of these is
Siam Park
on Tenerife, which is packed with rides for adrenalin-junkies.

Wine and Dine






The huge numbers of international visitors have meant that there is a wide choice of cuisines available in resorts across the Canary Islands. The local cuisine on each Canary shows the influence of different cultures over the centuries, from the indigenous Guanches to foods brought back by sailors from the Americas. There are dozens of resorts across the Canary Islands where you can try out this tasty cuisine.

Gofio
, a cereal thought to have been central to the Guanche diet, is used in many dishes.
Fresh fish
is a staple across the Canary Islands, including sea bass, wreckfish, parrot fish and sea bream.
Stews
are also popular, often made with chicken, beef or rabbit. They are often accompanied by
papas

arrugadas
, ‘wrinkled potatoes’, and
mojo
, a typical Canarian sauce.
Mojo picón
is made with peppers, while
mojo verde
is made with parsley and other herbs. For desert, there the islands’ abundant fruit – papaya, mango, peach, pineapple and, most famously, bananas – or the almond-and-honey dessert,
bienmesabe
.

The Canaries have been producing
wines
for at least five centuries, and there are now ten D.O. (denomination of origin) regions. You can visit bodegas (wineries) on most of the islands. You’ll also find spiced
herbal liqueurs and rums
.

For Families






The Canary Islands are a fantastically
family holiday
destination. You've got the chance to pick what sort of Canary holiday you'd like: from busy Tenerife to the quieter
Fuerteventura
, the Canarian flexibility is something you'll fall in love with. The beaches on all the Canary Islands are ideal for little ones to build sandcastles and jump waves, while the water sports on offer will keep older kids happy for hours. There are also glass-bottomed boat tours and cruises to watch dolphins and whales.

Active kids and teenagers will enjoy climbing to the summit of
Mount Teide in
Tenerife
or tramping across the volcanic wilds of
Timanfaya National Park
on
Lanzarote
. Tenerife is home to one of Europe’s most exciting theme parks:
Siam Park
is a fun-filled adventure park that combines rollercoaster rides with water slides and pools. The nearby
Loro Park
is another top attraction, with flocks of unusual parrots and whale and dolphin shows.

There are plenty of
safari parks
across the Canaries, including the
Las Águilas Jungle Park
in
Tenerife
, and the
Rancho Texas Lanzarote Park
in
Lanzarote
. Most of the resorts offer kid-friendly attractions such as
go-kart circuits
and
inflatable playgrounds
(both on dry land and in the sea). Gran Canaria has some fantastic family-friendly resorts, including
Maspalomas
.

Action and Adventure






You’ll find all the action and adventure you could ever want on the Canary Islands. From the
windsurfing
paradise of Fuerteventura to the
hiking
mecca of
La Gomera
, this archipelago is packed with thrills. There are water sports galore:
world-class snorkelling and diving
, sailing, kite-surfing, paddle-boarding, canoeing, parasailing and scores of other aquatic activities. The four national parks –
Mount Teide
on Tenerife,
Timanfaya
on
Lanzarote
,
Garajonay
on La Gomera, and
Caldera de Taburiente
on La Palma
– plus nature reserves like the Anaga mountains
on
Tenerife
, provide fantastic opportunities for all kinds of outdoor activities, including climbing, hiking, mountain biking, paragliding and canyoning.

Life's a Beach






The Canary Islands are blessed with some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, comparable even with their Balearic counterpart,
Majorca
. Some of the Canary Islands have golden sand, while others boast the amazing black sand that attests to the volcanic origin of the Canary Islands. The water is turquoise and usually startlingly clear – perfect for swimming and a host of water sports.

Resorts offering a range of full board, all-inclusive, and self-catering accommodation have grown up along many of the best coastlines. Firm favourites include
Maspalomas
and
Playa del Inglés
on Gran Canaria, which are magnificent swathes of golden sand backed by undulating sand dunes. Fuerteventura has its own great dunes.
Corralejo
, at the northern tip of Fuerteventura, is built around a glorious sandy beach, and the sand dunes are a protected nature reserve.
Playa Blanca
on Lanzarote has a fabulous golden beach. Nearby
Papagayo
’s beach may not be one of the largest, but it’s certainly one of the prettiest and is set in a nature reserve. In the north,
Famara
is a surfer’s paradise and one of Lanzarote’s loveliest and most unspoilt sandy bays.

On Tenerife, you can admire the stunning dark sands of
El Bollullo
, a gorgeous bay near
Puerto de la Cruz
, or tuck into some of the best seafood in the Canary Islands at San Andres, a fishing village overlooking the fabulous
Las Teresitas
beach.

Nightlife






If you’re looking to party, you won’t be disappointed on the Canary Islands. Whether you want international DJs, fashionable beach clubs or an intimate jazz bar, there’s something to suit everyone.

Tenerife is generally considered the best island for nightlife, particularly the resort of
Playa de las Américas
, which is often described as the party capital of the Canaries. The island capital of
Santa Cruz
has plenty of lively bars and clubs, and low-key Puerto de la Cruz has lots of venues to hear live music and go dancing.
Costa Adeje
has a wide array of chic beach bars, where you can sip cocktails and listen to DJ sessions.

Gran Canaria is a popular LGBTQ holiday destination, and there are some fabulous gay clubs and bars in and around
Maspalomas
and Playa del Inglés.

Lanzarote’s nightlife scene is centred around the Puerto del Carmen and
Playa Blanca
beach resorts, and you’ll find plenty of buzzing bars in the capital of
Arrecife
. Fuerteventura is great for live music and laid-back beach parties, making
Fuerteventura
the spot to be for relaxation.


Read More about Nightlife





For Couples






The Canary Islands are the perfect escape for couples. We recommend
Fuerteventura
, as there are some truly unspoilt, romantic spots. You’ll enjoy
beautiful views
and incredible landscapes, and can dine in
charming restaurants
and sip cocktails in
fashionable beach bars.
You can pamper yourselves with a
massage or spa
, or get a thrill on a
two-seater parasailing ride
.

Take a stroll along the Canarian cliff tops to find beautiful bays to
watch the sunset
, or
go for a dip in a

natural swimming pool or waterfall
in one of the gorgeous nature reserves. You could go for a
sail
, or go
snorkelling
or
diving
in the translucent waters.

And if you’re party people, hit the
bars and clubs
at the big resorts on
Lanzarote
and Tenerife and dance till dawn. If you want to make sure you have plenty of grown-up fun, take a look at our fantastic range of
adult-only hotels.

Culture






The Canary Islands boast a rich and unique traditional culture that has been forged over centuries. Although the indigenous
Guanche
people were wiped out after the island was conquered, their culture lives on in the Canarian cuisine and in the traditional sports such as
cart-pulling and stone-throwing
that take place during festivals.

The island of Tenerife is home to the historic city of
San Cristóbal de La Laguna
(better known simply as
‘La Laguna’
), which is a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site. Lanzarote was saved from over-development by the artist and architect
César Manrique,
whose legacy is celebrated in gardens and buildings across the island.

His former home near
Costa Teguise
is now a foundation and museum. All the island capitals boast
excellent museums, theatres
and
venues for the performing arts
: in
Santa Cruz de Tenerife,
there is the
Auditorio de Tenerife
, designed by Santiago Calatrava, and in Las Palma, in Gran Canaria, Óscar Tusquets designed the fortress-shaped
Auditorio Alfredo Kraus.
