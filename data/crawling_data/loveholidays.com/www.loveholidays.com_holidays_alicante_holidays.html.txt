Beautiful beaches, a charming atmosphere and plenty of love to give - there's nothing Alicante doesn’t have to provide you with a holiday of a lifetime in 2018 or 2019. Alicante is located within the beautiful
Costa Blanca
region of southern
Spain
.

Alicante is an exciting city and a major travel destination for many European tourists, and it’s no wonder with its array of bars, nightclubs, shops, restaurants, beautiful buildings and fascinating walking trails. All of this is available with some awesome deals on flights,
all inclusive
hotels and packages, making Alicante one of our top
cheap holiday
destinations.

Alicante is famed and much admired for having some of the most magnificent beaches in Spain and is renowned for its idyllic charm. Basking in a delightfully hot Mediterranean climate with temperatures reaching up to 30 degrees between May and October, and rarely dipping below 12 during the winter months, you'll find a buzzing atmosphere whether you choose to go for a summer break in 2019 or a bit of winter sun in 2018.

Top 10 beaches on the Costa Blanca




The
Costa Blanca
(‘White Coast’) is famous for its beautiful beaches of white sand, but also boasts some very pretty little coves and bays that are less well known. We’ve picked out our favourites along this fabulous coastline in this list of the top 10 beaches on the Costa ...

Top Attractions






Towering over Alicante – in the region of Costa Blanca – is
Mount Benacantil
, whose Castle of Santa Barbara is one of the leading attractions in Alicante. Having served as everything from a city fortification to a prison, this medieval fortress’s history-soaked walls and fabulous views towards
Benidorm
are among the key things to do in Alicante.

Alicante is blessed with miles of glorious Mediterranean coastline. Sunny beaches here are among the most beautiful in the region, and
Playa del Postiguet
is particularly recommended. This beach stands almost a kilometre wide, its palm-fringed promenade bustling with bars and restaurants. Choose from a range of hotels and pick the best deals on flights and holidays to make the most of your Alicante holiday.

Wine and Dine






It goes without saying that some of the top Alicante attractions consist of tapas bars and divine Spanish restaurants. While the city offers the best of local Costa Blanca cuisine, there is also an abundance of Italian and Greek restaurants as well. For authentic tapas head to the area around the Town Hall Square, where there are many tapas bars dotted around to start your gastronomic tour.

For a taste of the exotic, head for Carmen del Campillo Tea House in Alicante. Landscaped gardens and fountains mirror the intricacy of this Moroccan-themed house’s extensive architectural detailing. Unusual teas and delicious pastries are served in generous quantities, and this hidden gem is among the most evocative things to do in Alicante.

For Families






For a slice of fun that all the family can enjoy, jump on the city’s impressive tram service and head for the secluded splendour of
Playa de San Juan
. This is one of the finest beaches anywhere in Spain, and it among one of the best things to do in Alicante. As well as bars and restaurants, it’s also host to an 18-hole golf course – although most people come here with a picnic and a beach towel rather than a set of golf clubs.

Playa de San Juan stands halfway between Alicante and
El Campello
, which is a highly recommended location accessible along the local tram line. The quiet fishing town also has two beautiful beaches and water sports activities that visitors of all ages can enjoy. The pace of life is more relaxing here, and you can spend a whole day wandering around El Campello’s historic buildings, such as a 16th-century watchtower overlooking the charming harbour and marina.

Action and Adventure






Rancho La Ofra
is a must-see Alicante attraction for anyone who loves horses. From riding in the woods to trekking, the ranch’s immaculately-presented horses provide ideal companions. Treks through the surrounding valley are particularly recommended, with informative guides offering commentaries on the journey before serving tapas back at the ranch.

If you prefer horsepower of a different kind, Karting Alacant offers a series of winding and interconnected tracks that can be tackled in vehicles of varying power and size. The two-person parent-and-child karts are a particularly nice touch with twin steering wheels for backseat drivers, while the 270cc Senior Karts are guaranteed to get your pulse racing.

Life's a Beach






In terms of Alicante attractions, there is nowhere better for relaxing and unwinding than the island of
Tabarca
, one of the top picks of sights in the whole of the
Costa Blanca
. Just five kilometres off the mainland, its waters are a protected marine reserve while the island itself offers a time-capsule glimpse into Spanish history. Known as the ‘pirate island’ due to its long years of occupancy by pirates, the island was then fortified and is now Spain’s smallest inhabited island.

Thick walls circle around a collection of quirky buildings including a solitary church and a lighthouse, with museums and hotels reflecting Tabarca’s significance as a tourist hotspot. With a population of fewer than 60 people, this tranquil island represents one of the most memorable things to do in the area– it can be reached in 45 minutes from the city’s harbour.

Costa Blanca is all the about beaches, and not just in Alicante. One of the top perks of this stretch of coastline is the excellent road system that connects the various resorts. With access to other areas on the Costa Blanca, such as Benidorm or
Albir
, there's no reason why you should ever be short of a new beach to explore.

Nightlife






Alicante has its own fair share of the Costa Blanca fun along its beachfront promenade and further into the town, where you'll find bars, cafes and nightclubs galore.

The lively areas of
Levante
and
Poniente Beach
in
Benidorm
are known for their buzzing nightlife, with quick access from Alicante if you want to take a taxi. Many hotels have their own bars, restaurants, and entertainment options and you can enjoy panoramic views of the Mediterranean Sea.

For Couples






Alicante holidays are filled with a fantastic selection of places to visit. Two of its top visitor attractions are the stunning medieval
Santa Barbara Castle
and
L'Ereta Park
. This dramatic hilltop castle, built on the imposing Mount Benacantil, is one of the biggest castles in the
Costa Blanca
, and one of the biggest in Spain. Here you can enjoy stunning panoramic views of the city, visit the Museum of the City of Alicante, view exquisite modern Spanish statues and walk through the park from the castle to the old part of the city. The old city is packed with beautiful buildings including the Gravina Palace, which is now the site of the Gravina Museum of Fine Arts.

After drinking in the beauty of Alicante, head to the marina and explore Alicante's stunning beaches. Here you can admire the beautiful boats while grabbing a bite to eat at one of its reasonably priced cafes and restaurants. A visit to
Postiguet Beach
is a must for beach lovers. Famous for its soft, golden, sandy beach and clear blue waters, it offers a range of fun sporting activities for all on a holiday in Alicante to enjoy.

Culture






Alicante is not only about sun and clubbing, there is plenty of historical charm as well and year round events to experience the tranditions of the region.

For some heritage, head to Orihuela and visit the 13
th
century
Gothic Cathedral of Salvador and Santa Maria
. The cathedral contains a baroque organ and Renaissance art. Other examples of fine architecture and history in Alicante are the 18
th
century Portillo palace and Granja palace both with fine balconies and decorative design. Also of interest is the Santiago Apostol Church and several art museums such as the San Juan museum, containing the statue of the Diablesa, a 17
th
century demon that is carried on Easter processions.
