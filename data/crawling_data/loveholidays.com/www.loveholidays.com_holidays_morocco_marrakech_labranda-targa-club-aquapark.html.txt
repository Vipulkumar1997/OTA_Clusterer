Answer








is there a lot to do for adults at this hotel and is it safe to go to local bars outside the hotel..also is there night life or is it relaxing holiday ??

1 Answer













HI there is entertainment at the hotel and also a disco...

*   quiet, on the outskirts of the city
*   distance (circa): to the airport: 16 m, to the city/town centre: 9 km, hotel shuttle bus from the hotel to the center (inclusive, a few times every day)

There are bars in Marrakech but it is not really a party town more souks, bazarrs and markets...If you are looking for more nightlife but similar culture/ weather HUrghada in Egypt would probably be better for you
