Top Attractions






The USA is full of highlights and unique places of interest which are well worth a visit. The iconic Statue of Liberty in the Big Apple is a must see for those who want to get a closer look at one of America’s most world-renowned monuments. Head south to Washington DC which is home to a few recognisable structures of its own – anyone up for a visit to the White House? Sporting opportunities are in abundance in America. The beaches of California are a particular highlight, and they regularly play host to swimmers, surfers and sailors. The ski slopes of
Colorado
, meanwhile, are an ideal choice for lovers of winter sports, so no matter if you want to ‘shoop shoop’ on your skis or race down the slopes on a snowboard, there’s no better place to do it. America also has a wide choice of cities for those who want to shop ‘til they drop. New York is the home of Macy’s and Bloomingdales, which are famous for their designer labels and great value prices. Elsewhere, you’ll be greeted with many a mall, plenty of outlet centres and unique boutiques. Whatever your tastes, holidays in the US are not going to leave you disappointed.

Wine and Dine






As a result of its hugely diverse population, as well as it's fairly recent history as a country, the USA is a melting pot of different cultures, and thus cuisines from across the world. America's European ancestry has resulted in a vast number of Spanish, Italians and Germans opening up restaurants across the country, serving typically European cuisine of excellent quality.

Furthermore, its vicinity to
Mexico
has resulted in Mexican food being hugely popular, to the point when several southern US states have almost adopted certain iconic foods such as tacos and burritos as their own.

However, one thing most Americans will be able to agree on, is that barbecued meat is a national speciality. Even though marinades and sauces vary from state to state the largest, and juiciest barbecued and slow cooked meat can be found in the US.

Those who prefer a sophisticated atmosphere as well as a unique culinary experience will be happy to learn that as many as nine US restaurants currently hold a 3-star Michelin rating, which experts have chosen as amongst the best in the world.

For Families






Made up of 50 diverse and thrilling states, no two holidays to the US will ever be the same. New York City often tops many people’s must visit lists, and it’s no wonder with its majestic skyline, gorgeous parks and irresistible atmosphere. The City that Never Sleeps is one of the world’s most bustling and modern destinations with plenty to offer the avid city goer. Full of family friendly activities such as museums, parks, shopping opportunities and the world’s most desirable restaurants, New York is the ultimate American city destination. California is a diverse state in itself. From the glamour of
Hollywood
to the impressive Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco and some truly breathtaking beaches, California has got something for the whole family. From 5-star USA hotels that ooze sophistication, as well as extravagant entertainment for children such as water-parks and theme parks, to wallet-friendly comfort; your holiday needs will most certainly be covered here.

Action and Adventure






USA holidays, as we’ve already professed, are ideal for all types of jetsetters. Boasting a vast range of cultures, traditions and scenery, it is sure to have your eyes popping at every corner. Those who enjoy scenery should visit the Grand Canyon in Arizona, which can be enjoyed by chartered helicopter. Talk about phenomenal views – these will truly leave you speechless. The relaxing Yellowstone Park in Wyoming is a great place to unwind and marvel at the diverse range of wildlife which inhabit the area, which include grizzly bears. Sun worshippers should head to Florida on the East Coast or California on the West Coast, where there is no shortage of stunning beaches and warm waters to cool down in. Temperatures in America are as diverse as the landscapes that make it. From the cooler lows of Alaska to the scorching highs of Nevada, what you pack in your suitcase is entirely dependent on where in this vast country you visit. The seasons of America reflect ours – so, summer during the months of June-September, winter between November-February and the rest in between. However, they do weather a lot better than us – expect hotter summers and, in certain places, much colder winters.

Life's a Beach






With an enormous amount of coastline, holidays to the USA would be incomplete without visiting at least some of it's countless beaches. On the east coast, Miami has become famous across the world, and instrumental in the development of what we all know and love as 'beach culture', boasting extensive sand beaches and warm waters which have been attracting tourists for decades. More recently, the New Jersey's coastline has been developed into a summer resort, attracting many visitors during the summer months and even giving rise to the popular TV series “Jersey Shore”.

On the other side of the country, California's beaches have become equally as famous. With a long history of surfing (which has its true origins on the island of
Hawaii
) California has attracted surfers and beach bums equally as long as Florida, and for very similar reasons. The waters are warm and clean, and its extensive coastline makes it easy to find secluded beaches even during peak season.

However, beaches of vastly different character are encountered in Oregon as well as Washington state. Due to their geographic location, these have a distinctly northern feel to it, as well as colder waters making them beautiful to visit, albeit less suitable for a typical beach holiday.

Nightlife






Party in the USA! From New York's chic rooftop bars and fancy nightclubs attract celebrities from across the world, from the Southern Blues states to the underground clubs of America's electronic music capital Detroit – the USA has it all.

During the summer months, California hosts an abundance of beach parties, features a large variety of different kinds of music. As the home of Hollywood, music originating from here has been influencing music in all parts of the world for a long time, resulting in a huge number of live music venues suitable to all kinds of tastes spouting up in and around Los Angeles. Portland and Seattle have somewhat earned a reputation as being home to a more alternative crowd, resulting in a live music scene to rival that of L.A, albeit more focused on rock and house music.

Those who prefer nightclubs and bars to live music venues also have plenty to choose from. Although New York is famous for this, every major US city such as Austin, and Chicago is home to a large number of clubs with elaborate decorations, and playing the latest hits.

To test how lucky you really are, can you think of anything better than
Las Vegas
? Get lost in the bright lights of this vibrant city – there’s really nowhere quite like it anywhere else on the planet.

For Couples






Holidays to the USA will be adored by couples. With a culture built on luxurious getaways and world class customer service, couples from across the world come to the US expecting and receiving only the best, making them forget a world exists beyond the hotel’s walls. For unforgettable dinner experiences, and sophisticated nights out couples are drawn to New York and
Los Angeles
, while those who prefer camping to city lights are spoilt for choice.

Opportunities for camping and outdoor activities are countless; experience the grand northern landscapes of Montana, the great plains of Kansas, and the deserts which spread over several US states including Nevada, California, and Arizona.

Culture






Due to the multi-cultural nature of the USA, cultural festivites and history can be found everywhere.

To experience and support first nation culture, head to Albuquerque in New Mexico for the Annual Gathering of the Nations. Held in April, it is a 3 day event that bills itself as the biggest Pow Wow in America. Everyone is welcome to witness traditional dancing, hear music and many performances. There is also food and a traders market to buy gorgeous native artefacts made by over 800 traders. The event is made up of over 500 tribes from North America. To really experience Native American culture this is a must see.

Other events in the USA that are notable are the Mardi Gras in New Orleans, held in February. Festivites for this go on for a week with parades and costumes. Head to Kentucky in May for the Derby Horse Race or for some steam punk fun in the desert, Burning Man Festival at the end of August is a fantastic display of scuptures and music held in the Nevada desert. Be sure to get your tickets for this in time as it is extremely popular.

Halloween is a big deal in the U.S. and even small towns will mark the occasion in some way with trick or treat, costumes and sometimes floats and performances.
