Summer holidays to the Balearic Islands






The most popular of the Balearics is Majorca. Well-loved and well-known for as long as tourism has been a thing, Majorca boasts some of the best resorts in the
Balearic Islands
, including hot spots like Alcudia and Magaluf. Palma, Majorca’s capital, is a hub of culture, and its narrow winding streets lead onto a magnificent promenade, crowned by the must-see Cathedral.

It’s beaches or bust in the Balearics, so head to Alcudia on Majorca to enjoy Playa de Muro, which is lined with fantastic all inclusive hotels, restaurants and bars. Other popular beach resorts on Majorca, to name just a few, include Palma Nova, just up the coast from
Magaluf
; Illetas, which is close to Portal Nous and is one of the smaller, more exclusive resorts on Majorca, and S’Arenal, which offers up palm trees and long white sands. For more information on Majorca’s best resorts, check out our
Majorca holidays
.

Ibiza, which has the buzz of Majorca’s Magaluf but with more variety, is
the
party destination for young holidaymakers in the Mediterranean. For top clubbing holidays, check out Ibiza Town,
Playa d’en Bossa
and San Antonio Bay. For something a little more laidback – and Ibiza does do family holidays just as well as its clubbing holidays – resorts such as Portinatx, Cala Tarida and Es Cana are ideal for those seeking peace and quiet. For more information on Ibiza’s best resorts, check out our
Ibiza holidays
.

Last, but not least, is the small Balearic Island of Menorca. This sedated but vibrant island is ideal for those who’re looking for a chilled out summer holiday in 2019.  Perfect for families, Menorca has some excellent resorts to choose from. Binibeca is a small, relaxing resort with a Blue Flag beach and a range of restaurants and hotels; Es Grau, a hidden gem on Menorca, is popular with the locals, so visit Es Grau for a taste of the traditional Menorcan lifestyle and
Cala Galdana
, where you’ll find the best beaches on Menorca and a range of facilities to make your summer holiday as smooth as possible. For more information on Menorca, visit our
Menorca holidays
.

Summer holidays to the Canary Islands






At first glance, the Canary Islands don’t look like the place you’d set up an all-inclusive resort. These volcanic islands jut out of the sea off the coast of Africa and their rocky interiors and black sand beaches might, at first, seem intimidating. Yet, due to the favourable warm winds blowing in from North Africa, and one or two handy investments, the islands of Lanzarote, Tenerife and have become some of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.

Tenerife is home to the ever-popular resort of Costa Adeje, a resort so famed that holidaymakers are often swayed by its charm and book a Tenerife holiday over the other Canary Islands. Most visitors come for Tenerife’s beaches, of which it has plenty, but the rugged interior of Tenerife’s Mount Teide National Park is a sight to behold. Other awesome resorts on Tenerife include
Puerto de la Cruz
and Los Cristianos, ideal for families; Playa de las Americas, the home of nightlife on Tenerife, and the capital of Santa Cruz, home to the finest Tenerife cuisine and the heart of the island. For more information on Tenerife, visit our
Tenerife holidays
.

Lanzarote is the star of the show when it comes to summer family holidays in 2019. Costa Teguise is ideal for a family holiday. With its sheltered beach, a host of family attractions and a range of family-friendly all-inclusive hotels,
Costa Teguise
would be the place to start your search. Other potential resorts for your family holidays include Playa Blanca, home to the popular Papagayo Beach and Arrieta, a tranquil fishing village home to the stunning Playa La Garita beach. If you’re looking for something a bit more full-on, Puerto del Carmen is home to Lanzarote’s nightlife. For more information on Lanzarote, check out our
Lanzarote holidays
.

Fuerteventura shouldn’t be underestimated. This is a Canary Island that boasts all the hubbub of its sister islands, Lanzarote and Tenerife, but also offers up quiet slices of the Canarian cake. The most popular resorts on the island are also the most family-friendly. The aptly named Costa Calma and the brilliant
Caleta de Fuste
are both home to fantastic beaches, well-facilitated hotels and a range of activities. For something more laid-back, Morro Jable in the south is secluded and peaceful, and not far from Jandia, either, which is another top pick if you’re seeking seclusion. Corralejo is home to Fuerteventura’s nightlife and a range of pubs, bars and restaurants. For more information on Fuerteventura, check out our
Fuerteventura holidays
.

The list of Canary Islands goes on, including Gran Canaria and La Gomera. If you want to find out more about these other Canarian destinations, visit our
Canary Islands holidays
page.

Summer holidays to Portugal






The
Algarve
grows in popularity for summer holidays year on year, why not make 2019 the year you visit? At the heart of Portugal’s beach haven, Albufeira is a bustling resort town with epic beaches, a laidback family vibe, and a charming old town. But there’s a lot more to the Algarve than just the regional capital, including a coastline of 200km with over 20 Blue Flag beaches…

The Algarve region is separated into three distinct areas: Western, Central and Eastern Algarve. In the middle, you’ll find Albufeira and Faro, the main hotspots; in the West, you’ll find rugged cliffs and seclusion, and in the East a sleepy authenticity which appeals to the peace seekers. Just down the road from the Algarve’s stand-in capital, Albufeira, lies the sleepy village of
Olhos d’Agua
, a far cry from the bustlings clubs and bars of a city. Olhos d’Agua has cobbled streets and a lovely beach which is sure to please the whole family. Alternatively, Sao Rafael is famous for its dramatic rock formations and incredible Blue Flag Beach. For more information on Albufeira and the surrounding region, visit our
Albufeira holidays
page.

If you’re keen on a summer holiday city break, Lisbon is one of our favourite cities in Europe. With twisting streets, its own share of fantastic beaches, and a café culture to swoon over,
Lisbon
is ideal for a 2019 summer holiday. Venture up the hills to various miradouro in ramshackle trams, gaze down over the multi-coloured roofs and enjoy a delicious Portuguese custard tart. To read more about Lisbon and the Algarve, check out our
Portugal holidays
page.

Summer holidays to the Greek Islands






Just as popular as the Balearic Islands, with the Greek Islands you really get to customise your summer holiday just the way you like it. With so many
Greek Islands
to choose from, picking one from this impressive bunch is no easy feat. If you’ve got an island in mind, jump ahead and check out our deals on flights and all-inclusive hotels, but if you’re looking for inspiration, read on.

Santorini is an island-junkies' dream. Often seen popping up on your newsfeed, this picturesque island is famed for its romantic setting, black sand beaches and incredible hikes.
Oia
, that village with the tumbling whitewashed buildings which has become synonymous with Santorini’s image, is only the beginning of this fascinating Greek Island. Other top resorts include Kamari, Perissa and the capital, Fira. For more information on Santorini, check out our
Santorini holidays
.

Corfu is a popular summer holiday destination because of its vibrant mix of modern tourist amenities and laid-back Greek Island tradition. Known for its hectic
Kavos
party resort, Corfu gets its rep as an under 30s party destination, and whilst Kavos certainly delivers on that front, there’s a lot more to Corfu than its beachfront bars and cheap eats. For families, couples and those just seeking something away from the booze, top resorts to check out include Gouvia, Aghios Nikolaos and Acharavi, which all boast excellent beaches, picture-perfect Greek tavernas and a charming even atmosphere. For more information on Corfu, check out our
Corfu holidays
.

Zante – or Zakynthos, take your pick – is another Greek Island known for its hedonistic party-vibes. The resort of Laganas teems with nightclubs, bars and places to get your quick fix of gyros.
Laganas
is also popular because of the variety of music and different experiences available across the resort, something which sets it apart from its Greek Island counterparts. Another popular destination for clubbing on Zante is Tsilivi, which has its own fair share of bars and clubs. Again, you’d be mistaken thinking that Zante was only about its nightclubs: the charming Kalamaki beach is great for families, and the beach at Alykanas is laid-back and peaceful in comparison to its raucous neighbours. For more information on Zante, check out our
Zante holidays
.

Summer holidays to Spain






An old classic, the summer holiday to Spain has been unchanged for decades. The most popular spots still include the Costa Brava, where you can visit the bustling city of Barcelona and the charming Lloret de Mar, and the Costa Blanca, home to the popular resorts of Benidorm and Alicante. For more info on Spain holidays, read on or check out our
Spain holidays
page for deals and hotels.

Barcelona, Costa Brava, is one of the most popular city breaks in Europe and ideal for a summer holiday. Bustling
Barcelona
doesn’t give up its secrets easily, and there’s so much to be explored here you’d be forgiven for not spending too much on time on Barcelona’s beach. If you can manage it, squeeze in as much Gaudi as you can, take in the awe-inspiring bubble that is the Las Ramblas, and then navigate Barcelona’s narrow streets, art galleries and cafes.
Lloret de Mar
, north of Barcelona, is another popular Costa Brava destination. Known as a family holiday hotspot, why not consider it for your 2019 summer holiday? For more information on Lloret de Mar and the Costa Brava, head to our
Costa Brava holidays
page.

Benidorm and Alicante have been firm favourites for the British tourist since the 70s. The iconic Benidorm skyline is home to a wide range of
all-inclusive
hotels that suit every kind of holidaymaker. Since the explosion in popularity of Ibiza and the Greek Islands for clubbing holidays,
Benidorm
has relaxed and can now be considered, due to its two huge beaches Playa Levante and Playa Poniente, a family holiday destination.
Alicante
, south of Benidorm, and where your flights into the Costa Blanca will probably land, is home to the same sort of vibe as Benidorm: bars, restaurants and great hotels. You’ll also find a bit of Costa Blanca old-world charm in both resorts if you look hard enough. For more information on the Costa Blanca, visit our
Costa Blanca holidays
page.

Summer holidays to other destinations






We’ve got lots more on offer. Where do we start?

Paphos in
Cyprus
is well-loved, well-known summer holiday destination. What is it about Paphos that makes the tourist tick? Probably its lovely beaches, laidback vibe and the variety on offer up and down the coastline. The Paphos Region is really focused on two cities, Paphos and
Limassol
. On your first wander down to the beachfront promenade in Paphos, you’ll focus on the Irish pubs and English breakfasts, but the real magic of Paphos has been its ability to retain a certain sense of Cypriot tradition. Paphos has lovely ancient temples, and Limassol boasts a quaint old town with cobbled streets. Find out more about Paphos on our
Paphos holidays
page.

Turkey is summer holiday destination which has had its ups-and-downs over the decades, but the mesmerising coastal areas of Dalaman, Marmaris,
Bodrum
and Antalya boast fabulous
all-inclusive
hotels, magnificent, secluded beaches and a wild nature that makes a pleasant alternative to a bustling holiday resort.
Dalaman
is one of the most popular summer holiday destinations in Turkey, known for its long sandy beaches, crystal blue seas and the opportunities to find peace and quiet in an otherwise buzzing area. Read more on our
Turkey holidays
page.

Halkidiki, the fork of peninsulas that jut out into the Aegean Sea, is somewhat of an underrated mainland Greece holiday destination. With a laidback atmosphere and lots old world charm, Halkidiki offers some of the best scenery in Greece, both along its epic beaches and further inland, to its undulating hills and quaint villages. The three peninsulas are called Kassandra, with its choice of resorts from Kalithea to
Sani
; Sithonia, the middle peninsula, which is wild and rugged, and lastly, Mount Athos, a strict monastic republic which you can only really appreciate from a boat, seeing as visitors are not allowed inside. For more info on Halkidiki, check out our
holidays to Halkidiki
.

Croatia is home to the magical Dubrovnik, a relatively new contender for summer holidays, but incredible nonetheless.
Dubrovnik
might just be one of the most romantic cities in Europe, and its cobbled streets, red-tiled roofs and access to many of Croatia’s dazzling attractions along the Adriatic Coast make it a top pick for a 2019 summer holiday. Whilst you’re in Croatia why not visit the historic city of Split, or one of the many charismatic islands like Hvar? For more information visit our
Croatia holidays
page.
