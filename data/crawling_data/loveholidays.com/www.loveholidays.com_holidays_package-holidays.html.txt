Package holidays to Spain






Spain
is perhaps the ultimate package holiday destination, with fantastic deals to a fabulous range of resorts that will suit everyone from families to couples to groups of friends looking to party.

The
Costa Brava
has pretty coves and bays, while the
Costa Dorada
boasts long sandy beaches and the spectacular PortAventura World theme park.

The
Costa Blanca
also has beautiful beaches, while the
Costa del Sol
is home to fun-filled beach towns like
Málaga
and
Benalmádena
.

From city breaks to sunny beach holidays, there is a package holiday to Spain perfect for every holiday taste. Snap up your cheap Spanish deal in 2018 / 2019.

Package holidays to Greece






Greece
is the perfect place for a truly relaxing package holiday in 2018 / 2019. Sugar cube houses trimmed in vivid blue, secret coves and long white beaches, ancient ruins and captivating towns make the
Greek Islands
an idyllic destination – and there are plenty of places to party if you want some nightlife. Why not explore Heraklion, the fascinating capital of the beautiful island of
Crete
?

Or you could kick back in
Zante
, which boasts a stunning coastline and a choice of family-friendly resorts and party towns. Lefkas is another excellent option for package holidays, not quite as well known as many of the islands, and offering an enticing mix of vibrant resorts and deserted beaches, along with hiking and waterfalls in its lush, mountainous interior.

Package holidays to the Canary Islands






The
Canary Islands
are the off shore home of the package holiday. The Canaries, as the collection of islands are fondly known, boast some of the finest beaches, deluxe resorts and delectable sunshine.

Tenerife, one of our favourites for 2019. The best known resort is Playa de las Americas, and for good reason. Long a haunt of the British tourist,
Playa de las Americas
has everything you might expect from a package holiday. Fantastic hotels, great beaches and a killer atmosphere. Other favourites include
Puerto de la Cruz
and
Santa Cruz
.

Our other top island in Canaries is the classic Lanzarote. With just as many awesome beaches, endless activities and range of popular resorts, how can you not love
Puerto del Carmen
? Or for something a little more relaxed, the family friendly
Costa Teguise
?

Package holidays to Portugal






Spectacular cliffs, endless beaches of golden sands, charming towns and lively seaside resorts have made
Portugal
a perennial favourite for great-value package holidays. Our top pick is the Algarve.

The
Algarve
, with its wide range of resorts, water parks and activities like dolphin-watching, is a top choice for 2018/ 2019. From lively Praia da Rocha to sleepy Tavira, there are towns to suit all tastes along this stunning stretch of Atlantic coastline. The Algarve is separated into distinct areas, West, Central and East. In each you'll find something special, making the Algarve ideal for a family or couple looking to explore or just enjoy the pleasure of your package holiday.

For something a little quieter, why not head to the lovely sub-tropical island of
Madeira
and its enchanting capital of
Funchal
? You can escape the heat in the beautiful mountains, covered in luxuriant forest, or snorkel and dive in the crystal clear waters.

Long haul package holidays






If you want a package holiday to remember at an affordable price, why not head to the blissful island of
Barbados
? Soak up the relaxed Caribbean vibe, chill on palm-shaded beaches of dazzling white sand, and, if you’re in the mood, dance till dawn at one of the reggae bars or calypso clubs.

If you’d like to mix up beach time with city attractions in 2018 / 2019, how about a package break to
Dubai
? This glittering city of skyscrapers has an incredible range of things to do, from star-gazing safaris to the desert to indoor ski centres and theme parks.

Plus, of course, gorgeous beaches, fabulous restaurants, and enormous shopping malls. Hidden within this modern metropolis is a charming historic town, where you can explore century-old narrow streets and handsome mansions, or take a cruise on a traditional dhow.

Package holidays to the Balearic Islands






The Balearic Islands
are an old favourite for the package holiday, and with good reason. The Balearics have become synonymous with a quick getaway for British tourists looking to experience lush beaches, an incredible nightlife and classic Balearics hospitality.

Flights to Majorca in 2018 and 2019 are super cheap, and with the range of destinations on offer on the island, why wait?
Palma de Mallorca
is the crown jewel of the island and offers up some great historical sights as well as a booming nightlife. Magaluf isn't to be missed if you're young and looking for music and beaches in your package holiday.

Ibiza is Majorca's raucous sister and boasts an even more exciting range of nightlife. With top all inclusive hotels that boast their own pool parties, long stretches of sand taken over with crazy club nights and even the quiet moments of hangover relaxation available in places like
Formentera
, Ibiza is a top package holiday destination. Menorca is a peaceful equivalent with wild spots to enjoy the Balearics sunshine.
