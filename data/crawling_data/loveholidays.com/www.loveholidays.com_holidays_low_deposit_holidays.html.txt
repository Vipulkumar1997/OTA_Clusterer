Spain






You won’t have to look far before finding what you seek in scintillating
Spain
. Make sure you visit the Old Town of
Benidorm
to transport yourself into an evocative world of whitewashed buildings, easily affordable with our deposit holidays.

Much of Spain’s southern coast is well-visited and you can expect oodles of excitement as you stroll in and out of the famous stretch of sandy beaches, extending from Costa Brava to Costa de la Luz. If it’s beaches you’re after then Malaga along the
Costa del Sol
is good bet. If not, you could always check out Alicante on the Costa Blanca or Barcelona in the Costa Brava. Don't forget the Costa Dorada: Spain's aptly named "Golden Coast" the Costa Dorada offers some of the finest beaches in Spain.

If you can drag yourself away from the beautiful beaches for an hour or two then it’s advisable to head on over to
Costa Blanca
, the tourist capital of Benidorm will serve you well if you’re looking to peruse castles or hike across magnificent mountains. Don’t worry though, Playa Levante and Playa Poniente are some of the finest beaches in the Costa Blanca and they’re right on Benidorm’s doorstep.

Canary Islands






Portugal and Spain are great and all, but sometimes their winter sun options seem a little bleak, that’s not if you head on over to the
Canary Islands
, however!

Being such popular islands you’ll be happy to know that top destinations like
Lanzarote
are easily affordable with our low deposit holidays.

Suiting large groups, as well as small families, the Canary Islands have a host of awe-inspiring attractions to brighten up even the coldest winters, whether you’re out there for the buzzing nightlife of
Tenerife
, picking up a winter tan in Lanzarote, lounging on peaceful Fuerteventura beaches or exploring rugged Gran Canaria, the Canary Islands have something for you.

Low deposit island holidays






We're talking the Balearics, the Canaries and the Greek Islands.

In the Balearics we offer low deposit holidays to two giants of the Mediterranean holiday:
Majorca
and Ibiza. From all inclusive madness on Ibiza, to chilling out along the Playa de Palma in Majorca, the Balearics have something for every type of holidaymaker.

Fancy a low deposit holiday further afield? Want to get more bang for your buck? Well, the Canaries are an ideal option. We've got big love for the classic Canary Island sisters, Tenerife and Lanzarote. In Tenerife we suggest
Playa de Las Americas
: who could fault those gorgeous beaches? In Lanzarote (a classic low cost destination in every right) you definitely have to visit Puerto del Carmen!

Don't forget the Greek Islands. If we had to pick just one Greek Island we'd go for...
Corfu!
This low deposit holiday destination has something for everyone, from the party makers in Kavos to beach loungers in the quiet parts of Corfu, this Greek Island destination is one to consider if you haven't been that way in the world yet!

Portugal & The Algarve






If reading about Spain has brought up the common notion of ‘been there, done it’, then there’s no need to fear, especially if you’d rather not sacrifice the wondrous weather on your next outing. Spain’s lively next door neighbour,
Portugal
, is ideal if you want to secure your low deposit holidays for a summer to remember.

We must recommend the Algarve. Its tourist capital,
Albufeira
, is an ideal destination for a low deposit holiday because the cost of holidaying is low, too! With an incredible offer of 20 beaches in the Algarve, with the most popular being dotted around Albufeira (Falesia Beach, anyone?), Albufeira in the Algarve is the ideal holiday destination.

Ibiza
