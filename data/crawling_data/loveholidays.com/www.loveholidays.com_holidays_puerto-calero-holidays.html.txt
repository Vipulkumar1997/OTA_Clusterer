Introducing holidays in Puerto Calero

Enjoy a fantastic holiday in the year round sun on a Puerto Calero holiday with loveholidays.com. Sheltered from Lanzarote’s north easterly winds, Puerto Calero is situated on the south west coast of the
Canary Island
of
Lanzarote
, just 20 km from Arrecife the island’s capital and about two kilometres from bustling Puerto del Carmen.

Puerto Calero was the brainchild of a developer 20 years ago who wanted to provide an exclusive retreat with a luxury marina and a residential development on Lanzarote.

Top Attractions






The Marina at Puerto Calero is now lined with beautiful yachts and the atmosphere is of pure luxury. Enjoy watching the boats coming in and out of the harbour from one of the cafes or restaurants where the day will simply just disappear. From the harbour visitors can take catamaran trips to view Lanzarote from the sea or to visit one of the nearby resorts, take a submarine excursion to explore the underworld, go on a deep sea fishing trip or enjoy deep sea diving at one of the diving schools. Whilst walking along the promenade, make sure you pop into one of the luxury boutique shops or souvenir stores!

Other great trips to take while on holiday in Puerto Calero is to Ruta de los Volcanes, el Golfo, the National Park of Timanfaya and Mirador del Rio.

The striking and attractive Villas del Mar are the ideal accommodation for holidays in Puerto Calero.
With its upmarket vibe and serene setting, the charming marina town of Puerto Calero provides a perfect opportunity for relaxation. Located on the southwest coast of Lanzarote, this resort delivers a flawless combination of aquamarine waters and sunshine.

The harbour is undoubtedly Puerto Calero’s showpiece – with an ensemble of cafes and bars scattered at the waterside. Sharing its space with multi-million pound luxury yachts, it is no wonder that it has been nicknamed Millionaire’s Harbour. Not merely a picturesque setting, this is also the launch point for the catamaran cruises that take you to neighbouring islands
Playa Blanca
and
Fuerteventura
as well as the idyllic beaches of Papagayo, providing plenty of things to do in Puerto Calero.

Wine and Dine






Much like its appearance, the restaurants in Puerto Calero ooze sophistication. There is a great selection of Spanish cuisine on offer as well as some unique international restaurants. Canarian food can be found throughout the town and papas arrugadas, small salted potatoes boiled in their skin, are very popular. Serve yours up with a spicy red mojo sauce, made from herbs, spices and a generous dose of chilli. For delicious seafood and salad, visit La Portena – a hidden gem in the centre of town, while Las Margaritas is a great place for traditional Mexican cuisine and ice-cold mojitos.

For Families






If you’re looking to visit with your family, there are plenty of things to do in Puerto Calero. For a day out that will entertain and delight the children, head to Rancho Texas Splash and Animal Park. With 60,000 square metres of desert and gardens and a large selection of animals – including tigers and pumas, as well as thrilling water rides, this is the perfect place to keep the children entertained. For a great perspective of the island from the water, experience one of the top Puerto Calero attractions and take the Catlanza from the harbour for a trip to Papagayo Bay. Cruise along the jagged coastline while you experience the sea breeze and watch out for the dolphins and flying fish that inhabit these waters. After dropping anchor at the bay, there is a chance for relaxing swims and snorkelling to spot underwater marine life. For those feeling brave, there is a chance to hop aboard a jet ski before setting sail for home.

Action and Adventure






Due to its waterside location, many of Puerto Calero’s attractions are based in the water. If you’re looking for a way to explore the ocean without getting your feet wet, an underwater safari is the ideal opportunity. Delving 60 metres underwater, you’ll be able to discover a wealth of great marine life through the viewing windows as your tour guide takes you through the various species. If you’d rather take a safari on land, why not take a camel ride through nearby Timanfaya National Park? A great way to explore Lanzarote’s volcanic landscape, this is an unforgettable experience and a lot of fun.

Life's a Beach






There is no sandy beach at Puerto Calero, but the nearest main resort with a great beach is neighbouring Puerto del Carmen only two kilometres away. There is a good choice of water sports including surfing, water skiing and windsurfing, as well as sunbeds and umbrellas and a whole host of cafes, restaurants and bars. The sandy Papagayo beaches are a short distance from Puerto Calero.

Nightlife






If you’re looking for things to do in Puerto Calero after the sun goes down, look no further. While the area is home to some sophisticated evening hang-outs, it is in nearby
Puerto del Carmen
that the party really gets in full swing. Take a visit to the main strip, Avenida de las Playas, where you’ll find a whole host of top nightclubs in the Centro Atlantico. If you want to indulge in happy hour, there are plenty of great disco bars and clubs to experience that won’t break the bank – Niki Beach and Tequila Bar are great picks with a fantastic party atmosphere. If you’d rather spend your nights kicking back and relaxing with a pint, there are some great local pubs. With its welcoming feel and sea views, The Pool Shack is a great place to grab a long drink, as well as a small bite to eat if you fancy it, while for a good dose of Irish hospitality and brilliant live music, head to The Island Bar. Located in the charming old town, this bar promises a good night, you’ll be sure to return.

For Couples






Couples looking for class and sophistication canlap up the romance of classy Puerto Calero. Built around the harbour, there are plenty of charming restaurants and bars in which to soak up the sea breeze and each others company. Boutique shops offer a great chance to treat your other half, and strolling along the marina stocked with flashy yachts will make the two of you feel like movie stars. For a peaceful, elegant couples escape, Puerto Calero is a fantastic choice.

Culture






If you’re lucky enough to be travelling during March – Lanzarote’s carnival season, get ready for an incredible atmosphere. During the 40 days leading up to lent, the island becomes a mass of laughter and dancing as some of the best parties and parades are featured in the individual towns. While Puerto Calero remains fairly quiet during this season, the main carnival in
Arrecife
is only a short journey away. Street parties, parades, fireworks and costume processions all have a part in this celebration– with a haze of live music and bright colours taking over the town, a must-see for anyone visiting Lanzarote.
