Situated on the west coast of Rhodes in the charming village of Ialyssos is the Labranda Blue Bay Resort (ex. Blue Bay Beach Hotel), just 10km from the Greek island’s vibrant capital, Rhodes Town.

With 300 spacious, newly-renovated rooms boasting great views from private balconies, it’s easy to see why the 4-star Blue Bay Hotel is such a great accommodation choice for a holiday to Ialyssos, offering an ideal haven for both couples’ or family holidays. All rooms are fully fitted with modern designs and conveniences, allowing for a stress-free getaway – some of the bungalows even have their own private dip pools, so be sure to ask about this upon booking!

Looking to mingle? The Labranda Blue Bay Resort offers an array of opportunities for socialising, its most notable being the Family World Centre in a quiet part of the complex. True to its name, this area offers a small, secluded paradise - exclusive to families – where the kids are free to have fun while parents relax (or vice versa).

Despite the endless excitement that the Labranda Blue Bay Resort promises, if you venture outside the boundaries of the hotel you’ll find a number of amazing attractions and fascinating places of interests nearby such as the Acropolis of Rhodes, Grand Master Palace and the Modern Art Gallery. And that’s before we even start on the beach, Kremasti, a pebble/shingle paradise with clear turquoise sea and perfect conditions for watersports such as kite- or wind-surfing (equipment can be rented here). Just don’t forget your bathing shoes!

Hi Steve this may depend on the accommodation supplier that its is booked with,,,I know that there are several suppliers that include unlimited entrance to the waterpark( although I believe it is closed 1 day).....please call our sales line for us to check this or customer services on 03330339995 if you have already booked

Hi, I would be booking through loveholidays.  I called both of your numbers, the sales line told me it would be what ever Blue Bay site is advertising so 1 day per week July/August and the customer services number told me to submit this query via Q&A as they didnt know but advised that you would?
So if I complete this through loveholidays would I be guaranteed unlimited access to the water park.
