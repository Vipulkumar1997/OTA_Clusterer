Menorca is one of the
Balearic Islands

family holiday
.

Spend time kicking back on the beautiful stretch of sandy coastline, from
Binibeca
to
Playa de Fornells
, or
Santo Tomas
...the list goes on and on! Whether you’re visiting Menorca with your family, friends or as a couple staying in all-inclusive luxury, you’re sure to enjoy this Spanish paradise. With cheap flights that take just
2 ½ hours
from the UK, Menorca really is a perfect holiday destination for 2019.

Top Attractions






Menorca is considered the gem of the
Balearics
. Menorca’s beaches are similar to its neighbouring island Majorca, but here in Menorca beautiful Mediterranean scenery can be enjoyed in more refined and tranquil surroundings. Book a hotel and experience the peace and quiet of Menorca every second of your 2019 holiday.

Pristine beaches and diverse history make Menorca a great choice in the Balearics, especially for those who want to experience sun, sand and rustic Catalan charm. Featuring a mix of colonial and local architecture, from its capital
Mahón
, or the old capital,
Ciutadella
, to the popular
Cala Galdana
, the island is a unique blend of old and new, featuring a variety of fortresses, castles, and even prehistoric monuments, ensuring that there are more things to do in Menorca than lazing on a sandy beach. For those who want a peaceful getaway laced with stunning golden beaches and engaging local heritage, Menorca is the ideal choice.

Wine and Dine






In cosmopolitan
Mahon
, there's a range of Balearics cuisine. Although the food is of a high quality, the prices are very reasonable. If you fancy wetting your whistle, the island’s famous
gin
is a famous Menorca attraction. Visit a distillery or just work your way through a glass or two at a
seafront bar
in

Fornells
, enjoy a seafood meal in
Binibeca
or
Es Castell.
Even better: lounge by the pool, cocktails on tap.
Cala Santandria
, a village on the western coast, offers up some rustic Menorca treats.

For Families






Families can enjoy the many beaches dotted along the island’s coastline. The shallow waters of
Es Grau
, which is situated on the north of the island, is ideal for families seeking safe options for their children.
Cala Macarella
and
Macarelleta
are two picturesque coves lined with pine trees and offer the most scenic beaches on the island.
Binibeca
and
Cala Galdana
really are perfect family day-trip destinations. Many of the all-inclusive hotels on the island are family friendly – and they highlight the typical Balearics hospitality!

Sea kayaking is also readily available on the island, giving you the opportunity for a more personal spell of exploration. Other water sports are available in abundance throughout Menorca. The Diving Centre in
Ciutadella
offers a range of diving courses and programmes to suit all levels, from beginner level to those who are more experienced.

If shopping is more your thing, there are a wealth of shops in Ciutadella to find gifts to take home for yourself and friends. You’ll find a range of markets in each area, held during the day and evening. Head to
Placa Rotxina
for handcrafted jewellery or take a trip to the
Fornells
night market to stock up on sweets.

Action and Adventure






There is a great range of adventurous things to do in Menorca for the intrepid traveller. There are plenty of boat trips available that will transport you deep into the Mediterranean waters, exposing you to the expansive and beautiful coastline, from Cala to Cala. Take a ferry out of
Mahon Harbour
and explore the other Balearics, if you're visiting for a while. Some of Menorca’s attractions can be enjoyed away from the water, so why not don your walking boots and hike the ancient
Cami de Cavalls
trail that encircles the island? If your feet are too sore you can swap the boots for a bike and cycle the trail. Both options provide a great overall impression of the island’s geography.  Remember, the concierge at your all-inclusive hotel will be able to pick the right activities for your holiday!

Life's a Beach






Menorca’s Balearics beauty is in its array of scenic beaches -
120 to be exact
. With so many of opportunities to sit back and relax, you’re sure to find a luxurious paradise where you can unwind, embrace the sea and enjoy the sun.

The beautiful
Santo Tomas
and the unique
Cala Turqueta
are wonderful places to relax, along with the historic settings of the
Old Ciutadella
.
Cala'n Porter
is a stretch of white sand which is surrounded by a lush nature reserve. This quiet and peaceful area provides a tranquil setting for beach lovers who want to get away from the hustle of busy towns. There are even secluded pools, for those pining for a private dip.

Cala'n Brut
is a secluded inlet of water, which resembles a natural pool, and provides the perfect setting for a relaxing swim. Although there is no beach here, the secluded pool is a popular spot for those who want to recharge their batteries. Family-friendly
Binibeca
is great for a day-trip, and you should visit
Cala'n Forcat
or
Son Bou
, beaches that rival any on Majorca. Some resorts and hotels will have private beachfront, where you can enjoy the Menorcan sun in peace.

Nightlife






Menorca is a hub for all things entertaining and this is especially the case in the evenings. If you’re a fan of home comforts while being away then there are many British pubs for you to choose from around the resorts, fully equipped with pool tables and dart boards. But if you’re after something a little different, then there are also cocktail bars and clubs which serve exotic drinks long into the night.

The two areas for nightlife are
Máo
and
Ciutadella
and, between them, there are countless offerings for fun and mischief. Whilst not as heaving as
Ibiza
, or as youthful as
Majorca
, Menorca holds its own in the battle of the Balearics. If a more laidback vibe is what you’re after then there are some stylish piano bars which partner their cocktails with some equally potent jazz. If sweet rhythms are what the doctor ordered then the best place to fill your prescription would be one of the many salsa bars that adorn the streets. Watch closely, feel the music and you’ll be able to go back home and show off some of your newly acquired moves.

Alternatively, you could also try your hand at one of Menorca’s many
casinos
located on Menorca Harbour. And if you strike it lucky, the previously mentioned bars are open until the early hours of the morning so you’ll know exactly where to go and spend your winnings.

For Couples






Couples will enjoy the range of water sports on offer, as well as the many boat excursions which are available throughout the island. Of course, there’s nothing more romantic than an evening meal by the ocean at an all-inclusive resort as the sun sets, something the island of
Menorca
specialises in.

Historical and heritage sites are among the more curious of Menorca’s attractions.
Old Ciutadella
is an ideal place to take a step back in time. Ciutadella features charming, whitewashed buildings and is lined with cobbled streets, plus the lovely resort of
Cala'n Forcat
isn't far. The rustic beauty of the area is worth a visit for anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the unique Catalan culture which features throughout the island. The island is home to castles and fortresses, the most famous being
La Mola Fortress
. Set over
Mahon
(or Mahón) Harbour, this fortress is an example of nineteenth-century Spanish military architecture.

For art lovers, the
Noble Mansions
are unique and decadent buildings, which host temporary art exhibitions featuring a wide range of local and national talent. The unusual T-shaped stone formations are amongst various prehistoric monuments found on the island, all shrouded in mystery. If you fancy a nighttime ramble, the
Fornells
night market is a great way to spend an evening.
Binibeca Beach
is where you should head if you're looking for peace, and for tranquil scenery try
Cala Galdana
. Menorca is a peaceful alternative to the bustle of Majorca or Ibiza.

Culture






The culture in Menorca is a vibrant mix of
Spanish traditions
and
Mediterranean customs
which culminates in a truly unforgettable environment. A motto of the island and deep-set cultural ethos is
‘work to live, not live to work’
and although this doesn’t result in lacklustre service standards the relaxed vibe is easy to spot and entirely infectious.

Holidays are a huge point of celebration in Menorca and there are numerous
fiestas
dotted around throughout the year. You'll find festivals and events at every resort and town, from
Ciutadella
to
Binibeca
. If you are lucky to be visiting during a fiesta, you will be witness to a feast of succulent food, delicious home-made sangria and other alcohols as well as a general party atmosphere that takes over the whole island. The concierge at the all-inclusive hotel will be able to let you know the details!

Renowned internationally for its making of gin, the city still has remnants of its British-ruled past and this makes for a visually striking capital, Mahón, in terms of its architecture. Aside from the interesting buildings, Menorca’s natural scenery is just as striking. Horses also play a special part in the island’s history and they play a huge part in many of the island’s fiestas. There are
equestrian pursuits
dotted around the island and they prove to be an amazing way of witnessing the natural beauty of the island.
