Top Cuba Holidays 2018 / 2019

Culturally rich and historically captivating, Cuba is an eclectic country that doesn’t fail to charm. The archipelago exists amid a montage of sweeping pale beaches, archaic colonial architecture and the colourful classic cars, making holidays to Cuba unforgettable. Once a Spanish colony, Cuba has a blend of international influences, from French and American, to Jamaican and African, all of which can be unearthed across the cities, towns and villages of this
Caribbean
paradise.

Whether you are attracted to the bustling streets of the fiery
Havana
, or would rather feel the sun-kissed sand between your toes in the picturesque
Varadero
, Cuba holidays will give you the chance to enjoy both a cultural city break and a serene beach trip.

Boasting a tropical climate, Cuba is blessed with year-round sunshine, with its lowest temperatures only reaching 15C. So you can plan a holiday in Cuba at any time of the year, safe in the knowledge that the sun will be on your side. Cuba also makes a great
all-inclusive
destination, with quality resorts and generous packages giving you the freedom to really indulge in your tropical escape.

Top Attractions






The
Caribbean
island of Cuba is famous for its hip-swivelling salsa and hand-rolled cigars but it has a lot more to offer.

Cuba’s exciting capital
Havana
offers small-town charm along with plenty of cultural attractions and must-see sights. Its streets are scattered with ancient architectural wonders, with Moorish and Art Deco traces hidden between grand colonial buildings, home to tempting restaurants, vibrant bars and fascinating galleries. If you want to get away from the city, jump on the Hershey Train to meander your way through the rolling countryside that tumbles away from the city.

The much-loved resort of
Varadero
sits on pearlescent shores and is the place to visit for a beach day. As the country’s leading beach destination, you get it all here, with great amenities, fabulous hotels and water sports.

Being a tropical island, Cuba has stunning beaches as well as marine attractions. Visit
Caya Coco
for the best scuba diving sites. Along the causeway you will see pink flamingos as well as a massive coral reef off the north coast. For snorkelers, the best spot is
Holguín’s
clear Atlantic shallows -  a colourful underwater world.

Wine and Dine






Cuba has a varied range of cuisine. The best places to sample the different dishes are in the paladares, or restaurants. Most serve criolla which is Cuban fare, but there are also a lot of European dishes on the menu. Street food is very popular and cheap on this island, you can indulge in the favourite meal -  corn fritters and pizza.

As you can imagine, Cuba is a big producer of rum, in fact, it has around 12 rum distilleries, which produce 60 different brands of rum. Therefore the classic cocktails, including daiquiris and mojitos, are always the best to order.

For Families






Are you travelling with the kids in tow this 2018 / 2019? Family holidays to Cuba are memorable for all ages. The fun starts at your fabulous family-friendly hotel where the food, refreshments, swimming pools and activities all cater to children, so you don’t need to plan for anything.

Many of the beaches are family-friendly, with sand and water-based activities that provide fun for all ages. Cuba’s underwater world can be explored from boat tours at
Cayo Coco
and Varadero, or if you and the little ones would prefer to stay dry, visit the aquariums in
Havana
and Guardalavaca.

For the adventurous family, the kids can pretend they’re pirates on a guided hike to the largest cave in Cuba. The Bellamar Caves are home to a pool and an underground stream and feature the “Fountain of Youth”, which will certainly be popular with the adults. Excursions can easily be arranged from
Varadero
and Cuba's other main hubs.

Action and Adventure






On your holiday to Cuba you get the best of both the land and sea. Surrounded by both the Atlantic Ocean and the Carribean Sea, the island has some fantastic sites. To the south, the underwater world of Maria La Gorda is well worth exploring.  At
Varadero
there are 30 dive sites, as well as reefs around Isla de la Juventud which was the inspiration for the book ‘Treasure Island’. This island is not crowded and offers bountiful marine life and the chance to wreck dive. Offshore is one of the world's biggest reefs,
Cayo Coco
.

To the east of Cuba, you should journey to the rainforest for a trek and riverside wander within the hazy Guantánamo Province. Delve deep into misty cloud forests and scale the soaring mountain ranges for outstanding views. If you enjoy the climb, Torre de Manaca Iznaga has some of the best views, along with an intriguing history. The Valley of the Sugar Mills is home to the Torre de Manaca Iznaga, which was a former slave watchtower by an old plantation house.

Life's a Beach






Bask on the beautiful beaches of Cuba, the laid-back local feel provides the perfect place to relax. Find peace and quiet along the isolated beaches or go swimming in the turquoise waters of
Santa Maria
.  A UNESCO biosphere, Playa las Tumbas on the Guanhacabibes Peninsula is picture-perfect, as is Playa Ancón near Trinidad.

Locals and tourists alike flock to Varadero Beach for its 36 kilometres of soft golden sands. The sands are much whiter in
Guardalavaca
and
Cayo Coco
in the Jardines del Rey.

Snorkelers will love
Holguín’s
or lovely Playa Jibacoa with its warm waters which are shallow at the shore, so perfect for young children. Cuba's top beaches are host to some stunning hotels and resorts, giving you the option to sleep in sumptuous surrounding just metres from the waves.

Nightlife






Like its people and sights, Cuba has a vibrant nightlife. As the sun sets, many of the island’s urban areas come to life with live cosmopolitan music in local bars, sophisticated operas and ballets in their theatres. If you’re on the island during July 2019, you can get into party spirit at the multi-coloured carnival in
Santiago de Cuba
.

As the most popular nightlife spot has to be
Havana
. Bursting at the seems with clubs, vibrant bars, and live music venues, the Cuban festive spirit is alive every night in the capital. However, you shouldn't forget to explore the island's alternative hotspots. Resorts like
Varadero
boast a lively evening scene and you can expect a brilliant mix of partygoers of all ages dancing the night away.

For Couples






From secluded coastlines to romantic dinners in colonial harbours, you’ll receive a warm welcome when you come to the
Caribbean
. When you book a couples holiday in Cuba, you can expect - pampering at a relaxing spa, getting spoilt at luxurious beach resorts or all night dancing in a back-room bar. You’ve guessed it, there's something in Cuba to suit every kind of couple in 2018 / 2019.

If you and your loved one want to get away from it all, then escape to the white-sandy beaches of
Cayo Santa Maria
. Get lost together in the character and charm of the island, as well as the music, culture and architecture.

For fun-loving couples, the only place to head is Cuba’s capital,
Havana
. The city has a live music scene like no other. Expect to salsa the night away with the locals or dine out in one of the fine restaurants. Neither of you will forget this holiday to Cuba, thanks to the many cultural sights and sounds around every corner.

Culture






By day, Cuba has an array of contemporary art scenes that outdo many cultural hubs across the world. Art influences come from the diverse cultural blend of North American, South American, European and African elements.

As the most cared for colonial centres, Old
Havana
is home to attractions like the colourful Plaza de Armas Book Market, where you can enjoy an evening of dancing in the ancient Salsa clubs.

When staying in Havana, make time to explore Cuba's oldest fort, Castillo de la Real Fuerza. Today the fort stands next to a new shipwreck museum which is also well worth a visit.

Whilst in
Trinidad
, culture vultures will enjoy the ancient town that is made up of quaint cobbled streets that lead to colonial ruins that echo its Spanish roots. The elegant mansions that have been left behind are now museums and registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
