Alcudia holidays on the stunning island of
Majorca
guarantee amazing beaches, wonderful coastal scenery and a lively family friendly destination that will bring a smile to your face. Located in the north-east of Majorca, families and couples are treated to seven kilometres of golden sands, a picturesque port and thrilling attractions like the Hidropark water park.

Stroll along the sandy coast, or have the time of your life under the Spanish sun before heading into the Old Town for delicious fresh seafood in one of the restaurants or cafes, hidden along the picturesque back streets.

The contrast between the old town and the modern beach will make you feel like you’ve stuck gold, as the diversity of such a unique place will be at your fingertips. Family attractions and
all inclusive
couples retreats are plentiful, along with a rich cultural prevalence. With gorgeous vistas, fresh fare and the magical atmosphere of Majorca, Alcudia is one destination you’ll never forget.

Top Attractions






Despite being a small town, Alcudia’s attractions are countless, and there’s plenty to keep you occupied throughout your stay. With a heritage dating back to the 2nd century, there are numerous places of historical interest, such as the enormous Porta Del Mol gate through which most visitors enter the town. There are many religiously-orientated things to do in Alcudia. Pay a visit to the Gothic church of Sant Juame at the centre of town, and the nearby old sanctuary of Oratori de Santa Anna. Another jewel in Alcudia’s crown is the two thousand-year-old Roman theatre, the smallest to have survived anywhere in Spain.

There are a number of private resorts which cater for those looking to unwind. A full range of spa treatments are available in many hotels, from saunas and steam rooms to massage parlours. For some of the most relaxing things to do in Alcudia, take a dip in one of the hundreds of swimming pools, or top up your tan in the sunbathing areas. The sandy beach at Port d’Alcudia is a perfect place to while away the hours with a good book, or to kick back with a cocktail in a waterfront bar.

You’ll find plenty of choice when you search for top holidays to Alcudia at loveholidays. Wake up to the sounds of the
Mediterranean
in a 5-star resort along the golden sands, perfect for family retreats.

Wine and Dine






As you would expect, Majorcan cuisine is heavy on seafood, but its dishes are highly variable. In Alcudia the best restaurants are gathered around the centre of the old town and along the waterfront. Most offer outdoor seating perfect for enjoying
Mediterranean
cooking in the warm air. Lobster is particularly good in Majorca, and a number of restaurants in Alcudia specialise in delicacy. Another local favourite is sobrassada, a spicy pork dish, served with delicious Majorcan-style garlic bread. There are many places serving Spanish tapas, alongside the typical smattering of Italian, Greek and French restaurants to satisfy a wide range of foodies.

For Families






There are numerous things to do in Alcudia that visitors of all ages can enjoy, in particular along the pristine beaches of the region, flanked by the warm Mediterranean waters. The beach at Port d’Alcudia, a short walk out of town, is the most popular in the northeast of Majorca due to its clear, shallow waters. Alcudia Water Park offers fun for all the family, with water slides, mini golf and a bouncy castle to entertain the kids. The mysterious maze of El Labarinto is great for exploration, with magicians, clowns and witches lurking around every corner. The walk to Playa Coll Baix provides a welcome escape from the crowds, taking you up the hill past wild mountain goats, before dropping down to a secluded beach. There are a range of family friendly
all inclusive
hotels in Alcudia which will help keep those holiday costs to a minimum.

Action and Adventure






Sailing is very popular in Majorca, and is amongst the most sought after of Alcudia’s attractions. You can hire all kinds of vessels to explore the coastline, from catamarans to yachts. A number of international regattas take place off the shores of Alcudia and other towns, allowing you to watch the professionals in action. The clear Mediterranean waters are perfect for diving and snorkelling, while tour companies can offer paragliding and water-skiing lessons for beginners. Hiking and cycling are also popular on the island, and from Alcudia you can reach a number of other pretty towns on foot or by bicycle. The nearby marshlands of S’Albufera Natural Park are great for bird watching, with over 200 species living in the area.
