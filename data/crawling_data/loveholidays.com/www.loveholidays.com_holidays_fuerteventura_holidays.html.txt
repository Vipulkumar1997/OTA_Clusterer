Holidays to Fuerteventura in 2018 and 2019

Fuerteventura comfortably rivals its sister Canary islands,
Tenerife
and
Lanzarote
. Anywhere with a beach called "
Costa Calma
" should be at the top of your 2018 and 2019 holiday wish list. With over 150 beaches, spectacular sand dunes, wind surfing galore and more than an unbelievable 3,000 hours (yes, you did read that right!) of sunshine a year, Fuerteventura is the perfect destination for all the family.

Picking a 2018 or 2019 holiday destination that is fun for all the family is no mean feat. Often you are hard pushed to find a destination that caters to all tastes and one member of the family may end up feeling short changed. Holidays to Fuerteventura are different. Jump across on cheap flights, chill out in hotels and enjoy the delights of Canaria. Choose from great resorts such as
Jandia
,
Caleta de Fuste
or
Morro Jable
, to make the most of Fuerteventura.

From the smallest self-catering hotel, to the grandest 5-star
all inclusive
resort, a holiday to Fuerteventura has something for everyone. If you fancy something closer to home with a similiar island flavour, check out our Balearics holidays in
Ibiza
and
Majorca
.

Top Attractions






Fuerteventura is a popular holiday destination and is often a hub of activity. If you are wanting to avoid the crowds, then we suggest you head to the more secluded
Jandia
on the southern coast. Jandia offers a beautiful and quieter retreat that is perfect for families. Relaxation is the name of the game down on the southern coast and Jandia will allow you to holiday at your own pace, leaving room judgement free siestas.

Other firm family favourites are the
Costa Calma
or
Caleta de Fuste
. Caleta de Fuste has beautiful secret coves and coastal walks, as well as a golf course. The secluded Morro Jable, not far from Jandia, is great for a beach day out, and the popular area of Corralejo is the right place to begin your holiday at Fuerteventura. On the opposite side of Corralejo is the quieter area of
El Cotillo
, perched on a rocky cliff with a delightful bay.

Wine and Dine






Fuerteventura is the king of the Canaries for wining and dining during your holidays, beating off its rivals Lanzarote and Tenerife. Fuerteventura has a fantastic spread of choice, and all tastes and flavours are catered for in style! Restaurante El Horno in the north of Fuerteventura is just superb for authentic ribs and seafood in a unique and traditional setting.

Sanus Fuerteventura in
Corralejo
is also a must to enjoy fine dining and a bottle of Rioja in a crisp, contemporary setting. Avenida Restaurante in the Corralejo harbour is a seafood paradise, and with a more than ample wine cellar, you’re sure to find the perfect white to accompany your meal.

Further south, Nuevo Kwizeen in Caleta de Fuste is a bustling spot for tasty bites and a varied menu as well as good company, and if you’re really looking to treat yourself on your holiday then a grille at the Beach Club Chiringuito La Isla near to
Caleta de Fuste
is unbeatable. Indulging in wine and dining on Fuerteventura is a splendid experience, ask at your all hotel for the local cuisine to engage with the local culture.

For Families






Fuerteventura is an island of opportunity for
family holidays
in 2019 – you’ll find everything and more for all the family from sprawling golden sands to explore, swimming and snorkelling off the stunning coastline, and plenty of tasty eating spots to dine out and socialise together across the many resorts. Top picks for family Fuerteventura resorts include
Jandia
, with its great beach and nature park; Morro Jable, a very peaceful resort not far from
Jandia
, and
Caleta de Fuste
, which offers activities and fantastic hotels.

Fuerteventura boasts a large selection of styles that cater for all budgets and tastes – you can choose from the paradise charm of the Barcelo Castillo Royal Level through to the vast pools and water fun at the Hotel Faro Jandia & Spa. Days out are also rich in choice – beaches and water sports will play a huge part in your holiday, and whether you’re into a spot of sailing, scuba diving off of the
Corralejo
coast, or slides and thrills at the
Baku Water Park
, Fuerteventura will not disappoint!

You can also visit the unique
Cueva del Llano
volcanic cave, and the
Oasis Park
for its beautiful botanic gardens and wildlife walks.

Action and Adventure






Fuerteventura is home to an impressive array of action and adventure activities to enjoy during your holiday – you’ll especially love it if you have a passion for water sports! It doesn't matter whether you base yourself in Jandia, Caleta de Fuste or
El Cotillo
, there's plenty of places to get involved along the Canaria Costa! Whether you’re a complete novice or fancy yourself as king of the waves, the island caters for all skill levels in water skiing, windsurfing, diving, snorkelling and swimming. The beaches are also a great launch pad for sailing, and various private sailing options are readily available. You can even take a private four-hour trip out to the stunning Lobos Island from Corralejo!

Walking is especially invigorating on Fuerteventura with the varied coastline offering everything from rugged rocky outcrops to fine sandy strolls. Roaming around the Parque de National
Jandia
will afford some amazing sights across Fuerteventura. Quad biking and buggy tours are also available to burn some rubber and see the sights in comfort. Fuerteventura also boasts some fantastic landscapes.  Action and adventure run in the veins of Fuerteventura and your holiday will take full advantage of it!

If you don’t know where to begin, ask the concierge at your all inclusive: they want to help you have the best holiday!

Life's a Beach






Those of you with adventure on the brain need not fear, as Fuerteventura is a water sports haven. Windsurfing and kite surfing are the most popular sports on Fuerteventura and there are schools located on the beaches to help you become a pro on the waves in no time. Due to the close proximity of the other
Canary Islands
, including Lanzarote, the sea is often calm. Most all-inclusive hotels and resorts will be able to direct you to the right destinations to enjoy the ocean.

If you’re in need of a little motivation, The World Wind Surfing Championship is held here every July. Take some tips from the pros as they battle it out on the waves. Lots of resorts on Fuerteventura offer slices of private beachfront. Try the Costa Calma, aptly named for a relaxing day on the beach. The biggest attraction of a Fuerteventura holiday is the fact you're never far from a beach - whether you're in
Corralejo
or Jandia, there are beaches to match Fuerteventura's Canaries cousins, like Tenerife or Lanzarote.

Nightlife






If nightlife is your passion, you’ll love what Fuerteventura holidays offer. There are hidden gems to enjoy across Fuerteventura. Nico’s Belgian Beer House in
Corralejo
is a great place to start your evening for its friendly welcomes and a huge selection of brews. Towards the coast, the Boardriders Grill and Bar is a trendy spot for delicious food and good company before you head further into the town. Once in the centre of Corralejo, there’s an exciting cluster of bars and clubs all close together, so it’s easy to follow the whims of the evening.

There’s live music at the Rock Café, cocktails and karaoke at Flicks Bar, and a beach paradise for dance, sunsets and trendy music at the Waikiki Beach Club. With a selection of all-inclusive resorts and hotels verging on the overwhelming, you can situate yourself as close or as far away from the action as you like. For such a small island, you’ll be amazed at the nightlife Fuerteventura offers, and your holiday will be one you’ll treasure for years.

For Couples






Holidays for couples on Fuerteventura can be as eventful, romantic or peaceful as you’d like them to be – from all-inclusive luxury to a quaint hotel. Beach bums are totally spoilt for choice, with spectacular beaches lining almost every inch of the Fuerteventura's stunning coastline. If you're struggling to choose, our favourites include
Jandia
,
Costa Calma
and the Fuerteventura Costa
Caleta de Fuste
, all worth a look! As well as the obvious sun, sea, sand and fun, the beaches are also home to fun pursuits such as scuba diving, snorkelling, fishing and wakeboarding.

There’s also some stunning coastal walks to enjoy at your leisure, with resorts and cafes dotted around Fuerteventura to relax and recharge. The island’s main town,
Corralejo
, is great for couples to explore, with its narrow streets and a port providing a treasure trove of local produce and gifts as well as fabulous choices of seafood, fine dining and some trendy pubs and bars. We’re sure that you’ll love your holiday in the Atlantic paradise of Fuerteventura.

Culture






Fuerteventura carries a deep Spanish influence in its culture, although you’ll very quickly discover that the island has a lot of its own personality and flair!  Holidays to Fuerteventura in 2018 or 2019 will be packed full of cultural delights, enough to make it worthwhile leaving the hotel! The cultural scene and nightlife are plentiful, and the locals certainly love a carnival!

All the towns on the island host their own celebration of dance, music and food in February and March, and usually a series of smaller events during the year. Betancuria is well regarded as the cultural hub of Fuerteventura as it plays host to the island’s main museums of history, religion and archaeology, as well as a fine selection of eateries and bars.

The home-cooked cuisine is also a big part of Fuerteventura life, and your holiday won’t be complete without sampling one of the many varieties of goat stews and chops, as well as the local speciality of ‘
Gofio
’ – a delicious toasted corn and wheat flour accompaniment to delicious soups and stews. You’ll love the Spanish vibe with a local twist that Fuerteventura offers, and the result is a uniquely fascinating island culture not to be found anywhere else on earth.
