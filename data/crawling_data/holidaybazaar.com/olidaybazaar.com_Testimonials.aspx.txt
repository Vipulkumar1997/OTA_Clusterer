We got back to India yesterday.
Just a short note to say that we all had a wonderful time in South Africa and Zambia. Thank you very much for all your help and advice. It really made a big difference to us. All your recommendations for the trip turned out to be spot on. In particular, the hotels were exactly what we wanted.
