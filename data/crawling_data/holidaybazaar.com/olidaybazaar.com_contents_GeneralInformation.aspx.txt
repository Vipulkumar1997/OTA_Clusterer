Prices


Prices mentioned in the brochure are per person and based on a minimum of two adults
                                        sharing a room. Child and infant prices are shown individually for each tour. Although
                                        infants under 23 months are normally free of charge, a nominal charge will be made
                                        for a seat on the coach, as it is a legal requirement all person on board a coach
                                        are allocated individual seats.




Travel Insurance


Because of the importance of having adequate insurance cover we make it a condition
                                        of booking on all holidays that you are covered by an insurance policy. If you elect
                                        not to take out insurance, you agree to indemnify Sona Tours Ltd. for any costs
                                        that arise which would otherwise have been met had you had your own travel insurance




Wheelchairs


Sona Tours does not provide a specialist tours for the disabled, however every attempt
                                        will be made to accommodate you to our best ability. It is possible to bring along
                                        a folding type wheelchair which may be kept in the baggage hold of the coach. The
                                        driver will load and unload the wheelchair from the coach for the passenger however
                                        they will need to be physically fit enough to be able to embark and disembark the
                                        coach on their own. It is also essential that a capable person is accompanying such
                                        a passenger on the tour to push their wheelchair. Sona Tours will also request hotels
                                        for suitably equipped rooms; however, this is only on a request basis and cannot
                                        be guaranteed.




Essentials to carry with you


Passports with relevant visas; travel insurance policy; appropriate currencies.
                                        Long journeys are unavoidable and we recommend you wear comfortable clothing and
                                        carry essentials such as a jacket or jumper, snacks, water, tissues etc., as access
                                        to the luggage hold may not be possible until a comfort stop or arrival at your
                                        destination.




Coaches


All coaches are fitted with arm rests, TV, VCR/ DVD & cassette player, and toilet
                                        facilities (W.C. facilities on coaches have limited capacities and therefore we
                                        advice passengers to use them only on an ‘emergency’ basis. We try and make sufficient
                                        stops to ensure comfort for passengers). On rare occasions your coach may not have
                                        a W.C. facility on board. All coaches are either air conditioned or air cooled.
                                        We have a strict “no smoking” policy on all our coaches. During transfers we may
                                        use an alternative vehicle (and smaller coaches) which may not have the above facilities.





Pick-up Points


Pick up points cannot be changed 7 days or less prior to departure date. However,
                                            in case of an emergency if you need to change the pick-up point within a week of
                                            travel please advise our office immediately and we will endeavour to assist. Please
                                            note that this will attract an administration fee of £10 per person. It is imperative
                                            that you are at the pick-up point at least 15 minutes before the coach departure
                                            time. Also for those who are arriving at the pick-up via taxi, we recommend that
                                            you book the taxi the night prior to departure day as trying to get one on the day
                                            may be difficult or impossible. In the event that you miss the pick up at the appointed
                                            time, it will be your responsibility to get to the next destination on your itinerary
                                            at your expense. No refund will be allowed in any circumstances if you do not continue
                                            with the tour.

Please be on time as we cannot be held responsible or liable for any loss or expense
                                            suffered if you miss the coach or flight.
Note: For logistic reasons Sona Tour’s reserves the right to change the timings
                                            of any pick up one day prior to departure and the right to changes coaches during
                                            the trip.




Front Row Seats on Coach


For all our European tours, front row seats can be reserved for £10 per person (for
                                            6 days tours or less) or £15 per person (for 7 days tours or more). This offer is
                                            only available for bookings of two or four persons and is subject to availability.
                                            In addition to this, seats on the second row can be reserved for a supplement of
                                            £5 per person (for 6 day's tours or less) or £10 per person (for 7 days tours or
                                            more). Guaranteed front or second row seats cannot be reserved on feeder journeys
                                            to and from UK ports. On certain coach tours there may be further priority seats
                                            available and charges will be advised at time of booking.

Note: children under 15 years of age are not permitted to sit in the front seats
                                            of any coach. Also if your tour is cancelled for any reason and the front or second
                                            row seats are not available on your new tour you will be refunded the supplement
                                            paid. No other compensation will be payable.





Luggage on Coach


Maximum weight allowed for luggage of each passenger occupying a seat is 20kg. Since
                                        there is no porter service provided, passengers will be required to carry their
                                        own luggage from the coach to the hotel rooms; and therefore one piece of main luggage
                                        and one small hand luggage is recommended. We also recommend that children or family
                                        members not sharing a room have separate luggage as rooms cannot be guaranteed adjoining
                                        or nearby.

It is advisable to put your name and address on each piece of luggage as many passengers
                                        have similar bags and this avoids confusion. If for any reasons your baggage or
                                        personal valuable is lost or stolen, you must report it to the tour guide, or in
                                        the absence of a tour guide to the local police or hotel. Sona Tours cannot accept
                                        any responsibility for your personal belongings.




Children & Young Infants


Children and young infants are welcome to travel on our tours. Children under the
                                        age of two years will be charged an infant fare on all tours; a nominal supplement
                                        applies and will be advised at time of booking. Car seats are not provided on coaches
                                        and it is strongly advisable to carry your own. Some coaches will have cold or hot
                                        water available to heat up or cool milk bottles (cold water not suitable for drinking).
                                        However, this cannot be guaranteed and it is therefore the passengers’ responsibility
                                        to make sure of necessary arrangements for any children in their group. Milk and
                                        baby food cannot be provided by the hotel or restaurants and passengers are advised
                                        to carry prepared baby milk cartons whilst on tour.

Please also note that not all hotels provide a kettle so if hot water is required
                                        for warming milk etc in the hotel then it is advisable to carry a bottle warmer
                                        / kettle ( do not forget your adapter). Pushchairs can be kept in the luggage hold
                                        of the coach.




Tour Director


Escorted tours are accompanied by professional tour director or local guides throughout
                                        your itinerary. On rare occasions, your tour manager may not meet you at your dedicated
                                        pick up point but at a later stage; however, the driver will be there to take care
                                        of your needs. A number of itineraries include flights or rail journeys; it may
                                        be that you are not accompanied during these journeys; in this case, your Tour Director
                                        will meet you on arrival at your first destination. On rare occasions a tour director
                                        will not be available to accompany you; this would be either due to unavoidable
                                        operational issues or we will be utilising local guides for their wealth of experience.
                                        Furthermore, if minimum number of passengers are not reached on the set departure
                                        tours, there will be no accompanying tour director but rather local tour guides
                                        will be used.






Weather


The weather in some parts of Central and Northern Europe tends to be very similar
                                        to the UK. Yet in the Southern parts it can be hot and humid during the day and
                                        cool in the evening.

We recommend that you visit
www.weather.com
to ensure you
                                        have an idea of the weather at the time of the year you want to travel.




Clothing & Accessories


During summer months it is advisable to wear light garments during the day, but
                                        keep a light jacket or sweater in your hand luggage for the evening as it can be
                                        quite chilly. Also few other items which are highly recommended are a family sized
                                        umbrella, rain wear, pair of sunglasses, pair of trainers or comfortable walking
                                        shoes especially for certain excursions that involve a considerable amount of walking.
                                        Smart clothes will be required if you wish to go to a Casino or Nightclub. You may
                                        also be required to be ‘covered’ up when visiting certain places, If you are unsure
                                        what to take then please do discuss with our operators, who will only be too happy
                                        to assist.




Holiday Flights


All your tours that include flights are booked in economy class, with reliable airlines.
                                        Most of our holidays in the brochure are priced on departures from main London airport
                                        i.e. Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, City or Luton on contracted group rates. However,
                                        if you prefer to fly out from your regional airport, then please contact the office
                                        to check your options and supplements if applicable. Prices for flight holidays
                                        in our brochure are based on group contract seats, if for any reason they are not
                                        available at time of request, we will book the next available fare level and advise
                                        you of the additional cost. We cannot confirm specific seats at time of booking;
                                        you will need to check with each individual carrier their seat booking policy. We
                                        recommend you check-in for your flight three hours before the scheduled time for
                                        long haul flights and two and half hours for European destinations.

Note: please check baggage allowance for carry on and check in baggage at time of
                                        booking, as this varies from airline to airline.




Booking your own flights


If you book ground arrangements with Sona Tours, but make your own airline reservation,
                                        then all flight bookings will be your own responsibility and are subject to the
                                        terms and conditions of the airline involved. In the unlikely event of your flight
                                        being cancelled or changed by your airline, no refunds will be given for your holiday
                                        element booked with Sona Tours. Any extra costs incurred to alter your booking with
                                        us will be your responsibility. If you wish to make use of our airport transfers,
                                        please advise us. However, should your flight be delayed on arrival and you miss
                                        the transfer, then any costs incurred in getting to the hotel will be your responsibility.

Note: Booking specific seats on the flights are your responsibility and when you
                                        can book is different to each carrier, please check at time of booking the earliest
                                        that you can reserve your seats. Certain no-frill airlines have no facility for
                                        booking seats and only have a first come first serve option.




Hotels


The hotels on our tours are carefully selected. Ensuring that a 3* category minimum
                                        is provided (overseas ratings are classified by countries own tourist boards) and
                                        can be located either in the city you are visiting or on the outskirt. Facilities
                                        vary from hotel to hotel and include en-suite bath or shower and generally a TV
                                        and telephone. Some of the rooms may have mini bars and 24 hour room service, use
                                        of these facilities will be charged to your account and payable by you on departure
                                        ( Most hotels may require a credit card to cover your extras or cash deposits) .
                                        Please remember that most hotels in Europe have small rooms unlike many other countries
                                        and also not all hotels will have air-conditioning or lift as standard. (If you
                                        have difficulty with stairs please advise us so we can try and request a room on
                                        a low floor). Rooms are also allocated as ‘run of the house’ so some guests may
                                        get larger or different type of rooms to other guests-we do not have control over
                                        this.

Note: Sona Tours reserves the right to substitute hotels whilst passengers are on
                                        tour to a similar standard due to unforeseen circumstances. Please note that hotel’s
                                        normal check-in times are from late afternoon, e.g. 3pm, and checkout around 11am,
                                        but it does vary from hotel to hotel.




Meals


Breakfast is normally either continental or buffet and is taken in the hotel that
                                        you will be staying in. All other pre-booked meals will be either in the hotel’s
                                        own restaurant or at an outside restaurant and is not changeable. The meals will
                                        only include the food; all extras i.e. alcohol, beverages or any extra items requested
                                        by you will need to be settled by you directly with the proprietor. Any meals not
                                        taken will not be reimbursed under any circumstances.

Note: We endeavour to book Indian meals for dinner wherever possible, however due
                                        to local constraints if we are unable to do so, we will offer local vegetarian options.
                                        If you have any specific dietary needs or allergies you must inform us at time of
                                        booking, so we can inform the caterer. Passengers with severe food allergies are
                                        advised to make appropriate arrangements prior to commencing their tour. Sona Tours
                                        reserve the right to change meal arrangement in circumstances which are beyond our
                                        control.




Seating, Dietary or Room Allocation and Other Requests


Sona Tours works at times with intermediary agents (Airlines, Hotels, Transport
                                        Companies, Other Suppliers etc.) to arrange your holiday. If passengers have special
                                        requirements with regards to the service provided by the intermediaries such as
                                        a rooming request, seating request or a special meal request etc., then they should
                                        advice Sona Tours at the time of booking and we will endeavour to ensure the intermediary
                                        is advised of the request. It is important to note that Sona Tours cannot guarantee
                                        the request and that the passenger should confirm their request with the concerned
                                        intermediary themselves before their departure




Credit Cards


We recommend that you take a credit or debit card on holiday with you, as it provides
                                        extra financial flexibility. Major international credit cards, such as Visa or MasterCard
                                        are accepted by many restaurants, shops and hotels. It is also possible to draw
                                        cash with your credit or debit card at some banks and cash machines, though this
                                        will incur a fee charged by your card provider.

Note: Advise your bank which countries you are visiting prior to travel so that
                                        you don’t run the risk of your card being refused and subsequent expensive phone
                                        calls to unlock it.




Currencies


Currency of the EU Countries is Euros ("), Countries out the EU have their own currency
                                        e.g. in Switzerland the currency is Swiss Francs. (Currencies of countries you are
                                        travelling to will be advised on your confirmation). If you need more local currency
                                        when abroad, we recommend that you exchange money at a bank rather than at hotels
                                        as they will charge high commission rates. You may also need your passport for identification
                                        as you would for travellers’ cheques. Even though in Europe credit and debit cards
                                        are widely accepted, keep in mind the exchange rate may be poor and commission will
                                        be charged.






Passports & Visas


All passengers require a passport for travel outside the UK. It is the responsibility
                                        of each passenger to have a passport that is still valid for 6 months from the date
                                        of completing the tour.

Sona Tours will attempt to supply passengers with the most up to date information
                                        regarding the visa requirements for the destinations which they will travel. However,
                                        as visa stipulations change frequently, we advise passengers to inquire with the
                                        relevant consulate as to the exact requirements which they must fulfil in good time
                                        prior to their travel date. Sona Tours cannot take responsibility of cancellation
                                        due to lack of correct visa requirements as it is the passenger's responsibility
                                        to ensure that these requirements are fulfilled prior to their tour departure. For
                                        further information on visas please contact Sona Tours or visit

Lost Property and Theft


It is your responsibility to ensure that your property and valuables are safe at
                                        all times. If an item has been left in a hotel you will need to call the hotel and
                                        arrange with them directly for the return of your item. In case of theft you will
                                        need to advise your Tour Director immediately and report the theft to the nearest
                                        police personnel who will provide you with a police report or crime reference number.
                                        You are advised not to carry unnecessary valuables and to be vigilant at all times
                                        as tourist spots are well known targets for pickpockets.




Tipping


Tips for all our European coach tours for the driver and tour leader are included.
                                        However, should you wish to tip separately, you are welcome to do so at your discretion.

For International Tours and Cruises, tips are NOT included, and will need to be
                                        paid locally and vary from country to country.




Porterage


Since there is NO porter service provided on any of our holidays, passengers will
                                        be required to carry their own luggage throughout their entire holiday. If local
                                        porter service is available and you use this service then tips for this will need
                                        to be settled directly.




Phone Cards


Almost all hotels will add a service charge to the cost of any phone calls you make
                                        from your room. This charge can be high, especially for international calls. It
                                        is always cheaper to use public telephones. If using your mobile phone, then please
                                        ensure you do not have your data roaming on as it can become quite costly. Your
                                        tour director if available will also advise you how to use the telephone if you
                                        are unsure.





Voltage


Electrical currents vary between Britain, the European continent and North America.
                                        We suggest you carry a converter for your electric shaver, travelling iron, hair
                                        dryer, and other small appliances. We recommend that you purchase a universal electrical
                                        travel adapter to help prevent accidents and damage to your appliances.




Tours outside Europe


These tours are operated by local ground operators who handle all the details within
                                        the various destinations. In most cases we will be able to arrange a tour on minimal
                                        group sizes of two to four confirmed travellers and as such you may not necessarily
                                        be accompanied by a guide from Sona Tours. You will be assisted by a local contact
                                        during your tour for emergencies and enquiries. Your local ground agent will not
                                        be present with you at all times. Many of your sightseeing excursions will be guided
                                        by a local agent, however at times you will be given free time to explore the destinations
                                        on your own. Your sightseeing excursions and tours will be conducted within a coach
                                        or mini-bus. There is no seat allocation on these tours and travellers will be accommodated
                                        within the vehicle based on the seats available. Sightseeing tours may be culminated
                                        with groups not booked through Sona Tours. Meals will be served at selected restaurants
                                        or during excursions. Restaurants will be located within walking distance from your
                                        hotels and passengers will be requested to attend meals at their leisure.




Customs & Immigrations delays / enquires


Sona Tours will not be held responsible if passengers are stopped or held by any
                                        government departments, e.g. Police, Customs, Immigrations or any other authorities
                                        of the destination country. The tour will continue and no financial or any other
                                        kind of responsibility will be accepted by Sona Tours.




Health


All UK and EC Citizens will need a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) to receive
                                        health care that may become necessary during your visit to an EEA Country or Switzerland.
                                        Please note that it is advised that you should still obtain travel insurance as
                                        a precaution. Information on health is available from the Department of Health website
                                        www.dh.gov.uk and from most Post Offices. Recommendations and requirements may change
                                        and you should check the up to date position with your GP or travel clinic in good
                                        time before departure.
