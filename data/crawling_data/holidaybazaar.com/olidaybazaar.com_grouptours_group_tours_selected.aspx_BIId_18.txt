A:
Passports with relevant visas, travel insurance policy, appropriate currencies. Long journeys are unavoidable and we recommend you wear comfortable clothing and carry essentials such as a jacket or jumper, snacks, water, tissues etc., as access to the luggage hold may not be possible until a comfort stop or arrival at your destination.



Q: Do I need to carry a passport and apply for Visa?


A:
All passengers require a passport for travel outside your country of residence. Please ensure you have a passport that is valid for 6 months from the date of completing the tour.

We request you to see the following websites for the latest updates on travel to your destinations
.


For UK Residents:
https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice

For USA Residents:
https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/country.html


You are responsible for ensuring that you have correct visa prior to travel. Sona Tours is not responsible or liable in any way should you be denied travel due to incorrect documentation.

For further information on visas please contact Sona Tours or check our visa tab on home page.



Q: What happens to me if stopped at customs & Immigrations?

A:
Sona Tours cannot be held responsible if passengers are stopped or held by any government departments, e.g. Police, Customs, Immigration or any other authorities. We are sorry to say that the tour will continue and no financial or any other kind of responsibility will be accepted by Sona Tours.



Q: What clothes shall I wear or pack?


A:

D
uring the lovely summer months, it is advisable to wear light garments during the day, but keep a light jacket or sweater in your hand luggage as evenings can get chilly. Also highly recommended are a family sized umbrella, rain wear, pair of sunglasses, pair of trainers or comfortable walking shoes Smart clothes will be required if you wish to go to a Casino or Nightclub. You may also be required to be ‘covered’ up when visiting certain countries or religious places.



Q: What are the luggage requirements on the coach?


A:
Maximum weight allowed for luggage of each passenger occupying a seat is 20 kg. Please make sure that you are able to carry your luggage from the coach to your rooms as porter service is not provided on the holidays.

We also recommend that children or family members not sharing a room have separate luggage as rooms cannot be guaranteed adjoining or nearby. It is advisable to put your name and address on each piece of luggage as many passengers have similar bags to avoid delays and confusion. Should there be any reasons your baggage or personal valuable is lost or stolen, you must report it to the tour guide, or in the absence of a tour guide to the local police or hotel. Sona Tours cannot accept any responsibility for your personal belongings.



Q: Will I travel with people from other countries?


A:
The beauty of taking a guided holiday with us is you’ll have the opportunity to meet and travel with people from all over the globe
.



Q: How many people will be on my trip?


A:
It varies from different tours. An average of 40 to 48 guests on trips throughout Europe.



Q: Will I have free time?


A:

Each itinerary offers the perfect balance of downtime and discoveries. We also give you the opportunity to tailor your trip with optional experiences. You might choose to enjoy some of the best seats in the house at the world-famous Moulin Rouge in Paris. Or maybe take a magical early-morning balloon ride over the Napa Valley.



Q: What type of coach will I be travelling in?


A:
We pride ourselves on having the finest fleet of fuel-efficient, most will have armrests, TV, VCR/DVD & cassette player fully air-conditioned or air cooled coaches – all with reclining seats and on-board restrooms (W.C. facilities on coaches have limited capacities, therefore we advise passengers to use them only on an ‘emergency’ basis. We try and make sufficient stops to ensure comfort for passengers). The high vantage point from your coach’s window means you can take in all the glorious scenery, whether it’s a vast rural landscape or an urban city centre.

On rare occasions your coach may not have a W.C. facility on board.. We have a strict “no smoking and no alcohol” policy on all our coaches. During transfers we may use an alternative vehicle (and smaller coaches) which may not have the above facilities.



On a touring holiday there are some long journeys which are unavoidable especially when travelling from city to city and usually it’s the case that first and last days are the longest.



Q: Can I change my pick up point?


A:
Pick up points cannot be changed 7 days or less prior to departure date. However, in case of an emergency if you need to change the pick-up point within a week of travel please advise our office immediately and we will try to help and may have to charge an administration fee
.



Q: Can I join Europe tours from other pick up point or destination?


A:
Yes, please see Europe pick up points at
https://www.sonatours.com/contents/pick_up_points.aspx
.


Kindly note that there will be no reduction to the cost of your coach holiday in this case.



Q: Can I select my seats?


A:
Yes, you have the option to select the seat number when making a booking. However the management reserves the right to change the seat numbers
.



Q: What time do I need to be at my point?


A:
It is imperative that you are at the pick-up point at least 15 minutes before the coach departure time. Also for those who are arriving at the pick-up via taxi, we recommend that you book the taxi the night prior to departure day as trying to get one on the day may be difficult. In the event that you miss the pick up at the appointed time, you would need to get to the next destination on your itinerary at your expense. We will not be able to provide any refunds in any circumstances if you do not continue with the tour.

Please be on time as we cannot be held responsible or liable for any loss or expense suffered if you miss the coach or flight. For logistic reasons Sona Tours reserves the right to change the timings of any pick up one day prior to departure and the right to changes coaches during the trip.



Q: Can I travel with my child or infant?


A:
Sona Tours welcomes children and infants. The rates for children and infants for all the tours are available in the brochure and on the website. If your child requires a booster/child seat, please carry one.



Q: Do hotels have hot water for my baby?


A:
Please also note that not all hotels provide a kettle so if hot water is required for warming milk etc. in the hotel then it is advisable to carry a bottle warmer / kettle (do not forget your adapter). Foldable pushchairs can be kept in the luggage hold of the coach
.



Q: Are wheelchairs provided?


A:
Sona Tours does not provide special tours for the disabled. It is possible to bring along a folding type wheelchair which may be kept in the baggage hold of the coach. The driver will load and unload the wheelchair from the coach for the passenger however they will need to be physically fit enough to be able to embark and disembark the coach on their own. It is also essential that a capable person is accompanying such a passenger on the tour to push their wheelchair
.


Sona Tours will also request hotels for suitably equipped rooms. However, this is only on a request basis and cannot be guaranteed. Should you require the above please advise at the time of booking to avoid inconvenience
.



Q: Is there a tour director on the tour?


A:
Escorted tours are accompanied by professional tour director or local guides throughout your itinerary. On rare occasions, your tour director may not meet you at your dedicated pick up point but at a later stage; however, the driver will be there to take care of your needs

A number of itineraries include flights or rail journeys; it may be that you are not accompanied during these journeys; in this case, your Tour Director will meet you on arrival at your first destination. On occasions, it may be the case that your Tour Director may change whilst on tour; this is usually due to operational reasons or utilising local guides for their wealth of experience. If minimum number of passengers has not been achieved, we will have a driver guide and a small coach will be provided
.


Please ensure your tour director has your mobile number that you are carrying with you on tour. The tour director will provide passengers with their contact details for the duration of the tour on the first day.



Q: Where will I stay?


A:
The hotels on our tours are carefully selected. Ensuring that a 3* category minimum is provided (overseas ratings are classified by countries own tourist boards) and can be located either in the city you are visiting or on the outskirt. Facilities vary from hotel to hotel and include en-suite bath or shower and generally a TV and telephone. Some of the rooms may have mini bars and 24-hour room service, use of these facilities will be charged to your account and payable by you on departure (Most hotels may require a credit card to cover your extras or cash deposits). Please remember that most hotels in Europe have small rooms unlike many other countries and also not all hotels will have air-conditioning or lift as standard. (If you have difficulty with stairs please advise us so we can try and request a room on a low floor). Rooms are also allocated as ‘run of the house’ so some guests may get larger or different type of rooms -we do not have control over this
.


Sona Tours reserves the right to substitute hotels whilst passengers are on tour to a similar standard due to unforeseen circumstances. Please note that hotel’s normal check-in times are from late afternoon, e.g. 3 pm, and check out around 11 am, but it does vary from hotel to hotel
.



Q: Should I bring any electric outlet adapter?


A:
Electrical currents vary between Britain, the European continent and North America. We suggest you carry a converter for your appliances such as electric shaver, travelling iron, hair dryer and other personal appliances. We recommend that you purchase a universal electrical travel adapter to help prevent accidents and damage to your appliances



Q: What will I eat?


A:
Breakfast is normally either continental or buffet and is taken at the hotel that you will be staying in. All other pre-booked meals will be either in the hotel’s own restaurant or at an outside restaurant and is not changeable. Available meal options are vegetarian, Jain or non-vegetarian (where possible Halal). Please let us know the time of your booking what your dietary requirements are.

The meals are pre-set buffet and a choice of menu is not available. The meals will only include the food; all extras i.e. alcohol, beverages or any extra items requested by you will need to be settled by you directly with the proprietor. Any meals not taken will not be reimbursed.


Note
: We endeavour to book Indian meals for dinner wherever possible, however due to local constraints if we are unable to do so, we will offer local options. If you have any specific dietary needs or allergies you must inform us at time of booking, so we can inform the caterer. Passengers with severe food allergies are advised to make appropriate arrangements prior to commencing their tour. Sona Tours reserve the right to change meal arrangement in circumstances which are beyond our control.



Q: Can I have a special request?


A:
Sona Tours works at times with intermediary agents (Airlines, Hotels, Transport Companies, Other Suppliers, etc.) to arrange your holiday. If passengers have special requirements with regards to the service provided by the intermediaries such as a rooming request, seating request or a special meal request etc., then they should advice Sona Tours at the time of booking and we will endeavour to ensure the intermediary is advised of the request. It is important to note that we cannot guarantee the request and that the passenger should confirm their request with the concerned intermediary themselves before their departure.



Q:
What do I do if I have left something in the hotel?


A:

Every effort is made for your safety. Please note that you are responsible for looking after your valuables and property when on vacation. If an item has been left in a hotel you will need to call the hotel and arrange with them directly for the return of your item.



Q:
What happens if something is lost or stolen?


A:

In case of theft you will need to advise your Tour Director immediately and report the theft to the nearest police personnel who will provide you with a police report or crime reference number. You are advised not to carry unnecessary valuables and to be vigilant at all times as tourist spots are well known targets for pickpockets.



Q:
How does tipping work?


A:
Tips for all our coach tours for the driver and tour leader are included. However, should you wish to tip separately, you are welcome to do so at your discretion.



Q: What about porter service
?


A:
Since there is no porter service provided on any of our holidays, passengers will be required to carry their own luggage throughout their entire holiday. If local porter service is available and you use this service, then tips for this will need to be settled directly by yourself.



Q:
Should I take credit card with me?


A:
We recommend that you take a credit or debit card on holiday with you, as it provides extra financial flexibility. Major international credit cards, such as Visa or MasterCard are accepted by many restaurants, shops and hotels. It is also possible to draw cash with your credit or debit card at some banks and cash machines, though this will incur a fee charged by your card provider.

Advise your bank which countries you are visiting prior to travel so that you don’t run the risk of your card being refused and subsequent expensive phone calls to unlock it.



Q:
What about local currency?


A:
Currency of most of the European countries is Euro (€) and other Countries have their own currency. If you need assistance in identifying what currencies you would need whilst travelling, please feel free to ask us. If you need more local currency when abroad, we recommend that you exchange money at a bank rather than at hotels as they will charge high commission rates. You may also need your passport for identification as you would for traveller's cheques. Even though in Europe credit and debit cards are widely accepted, keep in mind the exchange rate may be poor and commission will be charged.



Q:
How can I check the local weather?


A:
Y
ou can check the local weather to your destinations here:
http://www.accuweather.com



Q:
What if I arrive late and miss a part of the trip?


A:

We regret that no refunds can be made for absences from a trip, including experiences such as missed meals or sightseeing.



Q:
What if I become ill on my trip and am unable to continue?


A:

We regret that no refunds can be made for absences from a trip, including experiences such as missed meals or sightseeing.



Q:
Can I drink the water in the countries I visit?


A:

In Europe it’s fine to drink the water from a fresh-supply tap. We suggest that you should always ask the locals or the hotel reception if in doubt.



Q:
Can I smoke on the coach?


A:

There is a strict policy of “no smoking, no alcohol and no smelly food” on all of our coaches. We do, however, make plenty of comfort stops.



Q:
What if I need to cancel my tour?


A:

Please note that if you for any reason need to cancel your tour, please let us know as soon as possible, this will help reduce the amount of cancellation charges you may have to pay. Cancellation charges will be as per the terms and conditions which you can find on our website.
