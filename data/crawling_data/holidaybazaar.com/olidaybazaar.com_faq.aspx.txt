FAQ's




What to Pack


Cotton clothing work best in Africa. During the daytime, we recommend shorts and tee shirts or polo shirts. For the evening, We recommend a long sleeved shirt / blouse and trousers / slacks. Do not pack jeans because they are very heavy. You will need a jacket; early morning and late afternoon game viewing drives tend to get too cool. Take a fleece jacket. It is light and does not wrinkle when crunched into the airplane overhead bins. We strongly recommend a hat, for shade from the African sun and a pair of sunglasses.

All the lodges and hotels offer same-day laundry services at very reasonable prices. It is possible to make your wardrobe work with packing just five outfits. This makes a total of six outfits.

Useful items to take include scissors, tweezers, lipsalve, sun block as well as preferred brands of toiletries and cosmetics. Local supplies may be scarce. Also take a torch (flashlight), pocket knife and spectacle wearers should bring a spare pair.



Passports & Visas


All passports must be valid at least 6 months beyond the date of intended stay and must have sufficient blank VISA pages (not endorsement pages) for the countries to be visited.  We recommend three blank pages (with at least two blank opposing pages) or four if you are travelling through more than one country. All children now require their own passport. Visa requirements change very frequently; please check with us for the most current information. Should a visa need to be obtained in advance of travel, we can recommend the services of a visa company. Note that postal applications to certain embassies may take up to 4 weeks. Early application is advisable.

It is also advisable to take photocopies of all your important documents, e.g. passports, air tickets, visas and credit cards and keep them separate from the original documents. In the event of loss of any of the original documents whilst travelling, replacement will be much easier.



Money


You will need very little spending money on most safaris as the majority of meals and activities are included in your itinerary. You only need to pay for extras like beverages, laundry, telephone calls, additional sightseeing or deviation from the itinerary, etc. You will usually have to pay for lunch, dinner and drinks when staying at hotels in cities. Bills may be settled in U.S. dollars, by traveller’s cheque or credit card, However, use may be restricted in small towns and rural areas.



Health


The exact choice of vaccines required depends on many individual factors as well as your precise travel plans. The vaccines most commonly recommended to travellers to Africa:




Tetanus

Typhoid

Meningitis

Polio

Yellow fever

Rabies

Hepatitis A.



In addition, malaria is a serious disease spread by mosquitoes, with prevention consisting of taking anti-malarial medication. Every traveller to Africa should seek advice from a qualified doctor or practitioner prior to travel. It is advisable to use insect repellent.

Immigration of almost all countries will request to see proof of Yellow Fever vaccination (or ask you to show a valid official exemption certificate) if you are travelling from, or have recently travelled to, any country with risk of Yellow Fever transmission, regardless of the amount of time spent in the country or even if just transiting at the airport.

Special Note: Travellers who are unable to have the Yellow Fever vaccination for medical reasons may be exempt from this. However, you must carry a valid official medical exemption certificate from your Doctor or Travel Clinic explaining why you cannot have the injection. It is recommended that the certificate is also accompanied by a detailed letter from the Doctor specifying entry and departure dates from each country and a full medical reason for the exemption.

Some visitors forget to pack eye drops. Carry them, particularly if you wear contact lenses. Air carries fine-particle dust.



Luggage


Space in the safari vehicle is limited and we request that you pay particular attention to the following guidelines.

Your luggage is restricted to 1 bag not exceeding 15 kg* and 65 x 46 cm. Our vehicles are equipped to carry limited luggage. Overloading the vehicle does affect operations and possible break-downs.

*PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY EXCESS LUGGAGE OVER 15 KG WILL NOT BE LOADED INSIDE THE VEHICLE. EXCESS LUGGAGE WILL BE STORED AND ANY COSTS INCURRED WILL BE THE PASSENGERS’ RESPONSIBILITY.

We recommend that you pack your personal effects in an inexpensive barrel / sausage bag available from discount stores, hypermarkets and sports shops.

We recommend that you utilize old or inexpensive luggage. Suitcases are unsuitable for our type of safaris. You may use a small / medium-sized rucksack, provided that it has no frame.

If your first night is in Nairobi, you may wish to leave your unnecessary luggage at the Hotel’s left luggage and only take what you really need on safari. Please have a look at
10 Things You Must Consider for Your Kenya Safari
and
Top 5 Reasons Why Luxury Safaris Are Special.


THE SAFARI CODE:
East Africa is the uncontested ‘Safari Capital of the World’. This has been proclaimed since the 1900's when royalty, aristocracy, politicians and movie stars flocked here to hunt the ‘Big Five' (lion, rhino, buffalo, elephant and leopard). The word ‘Safari' literally means ‘to travel' (in Kiswahli language) and may be used to refer to any journey or trip.

When in either a park or reserve, visitors should observe the following code:
Respect the privacy of the wildlife. This is their habitat.




Beware of the animals - they are wild and can be unpredictable.

Do not crowd the animals or make sudden noises or movements.

Do not feed the animals - it upsets their diet and leads to human dependence.

Keep quiet - noise disturbs the wildlife and may antagonize your fellow visitors.

Stay in your vehicle at all times, except at designated picnic or walking areas.

Keep below the maximum speed limit (40 kph / 25mph). Never drive off-road - this severely damages the habitat.

When viewing wildlife keep to a minimum distance of 20 m. Pull to the side of the road so as to allow others to pass.

Leave no litter and never light fires or discard burning objects.

Respect the cultural heritage of Kenya. Never take pictures of the local people or their habitat without asking their permission. Respect the cultural traditions of Kenya and always dress with decorum.

Observe the rules: leave the park by dusk; never drive at night in a national park.



An informed safari is an enhanced safari; carry guidebooks (about the park, wildlife, birds and flora) and binoculars. Always travel with plenty of water, wear sensible shoes in case you have to walk, carry a hat, sunscreen and sunglasses.

The best time for wildlife viewing is 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. This is due to the fact that most of the animals retire to the shade to rest during the middle (hottest) part of the day. For best viewing, the trick is not to look AT the bush but THROUGH it. Focus your eyes at mid-range distance. Look under bushes and into the shadows and watch out for those subtle changes in colour and continuity that may indicate the presence of wildlife.


A Typical Day on Safari: A Day Full of Rich Experiences
Luxury safaris are quite active because guests want to make the most of their learning adventure. We prepared this timetable to give you an idea of a typical day.



5:30 a.m.


After coffee and a light pre-breakfast snack, you depart on a 3- to 4- hours game drive with your ranger and tracker in their safari vehicle. Bring your camera and binoculars.



Morning drive


You stop in the wilderness for hot coffee, tea or hot chocolate served with a light snack.



9:30 a.m.


You return to the lodge, where a hearty breakfast awaits. Or, sometimes, you may enjoy a full-fledged bush breakfast in the "middle of nowhere".



10:00 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.


This is the time to relax at the pool, take a nap, curl up with a book on your or the lodge's veranda, have a massage in your room or join a 1-hour ranger-led midday interpretative walk through the wilderness.



1:30 p.m.


Lunch is served, either in the main dining area or on your private veranda.



4:00 p.m.


Disembark from the safari vehicle to have cocktails with your safari mates in a remote natural setting.


8:00 p.m.


Upon your return from the evening drive, you have cocktails and dinner with your companions. This could be in the indoor dining area, or in an enclosed open-sky boma, in the bush or almost anywhere.


9:30 p.m.



You enjoy after-dinner drinks with your old- and new- found friends or retire to bed after your active day.


The times above are for summer. Winter times are slightly different due to shorter daylight period. For example, the winter morning drives depart at 6:00 a.m. and dinner begins at 7:30 p.m.
