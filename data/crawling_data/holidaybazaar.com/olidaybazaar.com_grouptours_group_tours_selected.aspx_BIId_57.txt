Keep a watchful eye as you sail through Yakutat Bay; you may be a witness to geological history.

Juneau, the capital of Alaska, was founded during a gold rush in 1880. Today, the former gold-mining town counts among its riches some of Alaska's most spectacular scenery. Nestled at the foot of Mt. Juneau in the Alaska Panhandle, it faces the water from the mainland side of Gastineau Channel. Several magnificent fjords are located along the channel coast, and the majestic Mendenhall Glacier, a favourite of visitors, is nearby. When you're in Juneau, you shouldn't miss the amazing glacial landscape. Optional Excursion- The best view available is from the seat of a helicopter on one of our shore excursions, where you can watch for bear, mountain goats, and moose. Then, once you've landed, you'll be taken on a once-in-a-lifetime dogsled ride. Or take a fully narrated helicopter flight over four translucent glaciers within the Juneau Ice Field. You'll soar past towering peaks and picturesque alpine lakes on this exciting adventure. Various other excursions available from the cruise liner itself.

[Y] Breakfast [Y] Lunch [Y] Dinner








Day
11


Cruise: Ketchikan, Alaska



Ketchikan originated as an Indian fish saltery, but the town's major growth began when it became a supply base and entry port for miners during the 1898 Gold Rush to the Klondike. Much of the town's colourful past is still in evidence, especially in the nearby Indian villages, where you'll see colourfully carved totem poles and hear the fascinating legends that surround them. (Optional Excursion-Experience the sheer granite cliffs, plunging 1,000-foot waterfalls, crystalline lakes and low-hanging mists of Misty Fjords from the air on a seaplane.
