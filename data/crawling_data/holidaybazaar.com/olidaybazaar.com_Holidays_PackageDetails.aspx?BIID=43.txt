Day 1:
Siem Reap Arrival
(-)

Welcome to Siem Reap! Upon arrival, our driver and English speaking guide will be waiting to provide transport into the city for hotel check in.

After a short relaxing break, pay a visit to the famous Angkor Wat complex by car. Built in the early 12th century, this iconic temple was constructed to represent the Hindu/Buddhist home of the gods, Mount Meru. Inside the temple, the walls are covered with stone carvings, bas-reliefs, and more than 2,000 Aspara dancers. Today, Angkor Wat is figured on Cambodia's national flag. Enjoy soaking in the temple during sunset- one of the most beautiful (and less visited) times of the day.

Return to the hotel, to enjoy the evening at leisure.

Overnight in Siem Reap.


Day 2: Siem Reap
(B/D)

After breakfast, head out to the early-Angkor era temples of the Roluos Group. Visit the site’s three main temples: Bakong, Lolei, and Preah Ko. The beautiful surrounding countryside with its paddy fields and sugar palm trees is very typical for Cambodia – enjoy this natural beauty on an ox cart ride to Roluos Pagoda, a fun way to get in touch with rural Cambodia and its friendly people.

Here, in a small contemporary pagoda, Buddhist monks will provide a private blessing ceremony, wishing health and safe journeys. Return to the hotel for a break during the midday heat. Enjoy lunch on own expense.

In the afternoon head to another unique group of temples, the Small Circuit of Angkor. Start the tour with a visit to Ta Prohm, built in the mid-12th to early 13th centuries. This temple is unique in the fact that it has been left largely as it was found: overgrown by jungle trees and vines, with many parts crumbling to the ground. Continue next to Banteay Kdei, a Buddhist monastery from the late 12th Century, and Srah Srang, also known as the “pool of ablutions”.

Next stop is the ancient city of Angkor Thom, the last capital of the Great Khmer Empire under the reign of Jayavarman VII. Enter the city through the ancient South Gate, an impressive stone structure carved with elephants and four giant faces. From here, continue to Bayon Temple in the exact center of the city. This 12th century masterpiece is known for its 54 face-carved towers, Terrace of the Elephants, and the Terrace of the Leper King.

Wrap up the day at Madame Butterfly. Set in a traditional Khmer wooden house with exotic gardens, Madame Butterfly serves up some of Siem Reap's best Khmer cuisine.

Overnight in Siem Reap.


Day 3: Siem Reap
(B/L)

Begin the day with an early visit to the “gem” of the Angkor area: Banteay Srei. Also known as the “Citadel of the Women,” this remains the best preserved temple in Cambodia. It displays some of the finest examples of classical Khmer art and is noted for its truly remarkable bas-reliefs.

Heading back from the temple, stop in the villages to enjoy some interaction with the local community (with some assistance from the guide.) Among other things, see how Palm Wine and Palm Sugar are made and get the chance to sample them!

Enjoy lunch at Viroth’s Restaurant, before embarking on an interesting boat trip on Tonlé Sap, Southeast Asia’s largest freshwater lake. Board a local boat and visit Kampong Phluck, a village where houses are built on stilts to avoid complete flooding during the wet season (when the lake swells to four times its size.)

(Note: Due to low water levels during the dry season, the boat trip is only possible from June to March. However an alternative floating village at Chong Kneas can be arranged instead).

Overnight in Siem Reap.


Day 4: Siem Reap Departure
(B)

Depending on the departure flight, there may be some time to explore Siem Reap’s colorful markets. Visit Artisans d’Angkor, established to support Cambodian arts and crafts, and to help young people find work in their local villages by continuing the practice of traditional arts. Discover how wood and stone carvings, lacquering, gilding, and silk paintings are created.

Transport will then be provided to the airport for the departing flight.
