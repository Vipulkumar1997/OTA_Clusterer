Booking Terms and Conditions :

We accept your booking on the basis of the terms and Conditions below, which are designed to clarify the contractual obligation between us. It is important that you read these conditions together with the holiday and insurance information pages, as they not only define our obligation to you but also impose some important commitments upon you. Your contract is with us. In these booking conditions, “you” and “your” means all persons named on the booking (including anyone who is added or substituted at a later date).


Our Confirmation of Reservation :

When we have received your booking and deposit we will send you a Confirmation of Reservation which details exactly what is booked for you. From this moment we has accepted your booking on the terms set out in this Contract.


Our System Errors :

In the event of your Confirmation of Reservation showing an incorrect price for your holiday, the price that will prevail is the price shown in our reservation system. Accordingly, you may not seek to rely on system errors with a view to obtaining a holiday at less than the correct price, and any contract entered into upon a mistake, such as a wrong costing due to system errors, is not valid or binding.


Our Complaints and Dispute Procedures:

We do our best to give passengers travelling on our holidays an enjoyable; trouble free holiday, but occasionally plans do go wrong. If you have any complaint, please share it with your tour manager as soon as possible who will do anything possible to resolve the matter. You must also report it to the supplier of the service(s) in question immediately, who will endeavour to put things right. If the situation is not resolved to your satisfaction, then you must notify the company within 28 days of the end of your holiday in writing. It is strongly recommended that you communicate any complaint to the supplier of the services in question as well as to our representative without delay and complete a report form whilst in resort. If you fail to follow this simple procedure we will have been deprived of the opportunity to investigate and rectify your complaint whilst you were in resort and this may affect your rights under this contract. Please also see clause 16 on ABTA.
