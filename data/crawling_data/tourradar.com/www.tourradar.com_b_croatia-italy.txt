Highlights
Travel back to a time when Roman gladiators fought for their lives in magnificent amphitheatres that celebrate Roman craftsmanship, at Pula.
Wake up early to watch fishermen bring in their catch and soak up the Mediterranean vibes of Rovinj.
Breathe in pine-scented air and cycle through the lush vegetation that surrounds the pristine salt water lakes of the Mljec National Park.
Listen to waves crashing against the Adriatic Sea, step inside the spectacular Diocletian Palace and discover the soul of Dalmatian life at Split.
Stroll through the rapturous interiors of St. Marks Basilica and linger on the wistful Bridge of Sighs in the city that defies the sea, Venice.
Enjoy the sight of marble busts glinting in lavish hallways and take in Michelangelo’s splendid frescoes that decorate the celebrated Sistine Chapel in Rome.
Savor the taste of rich Italian coffee, walk under the spectacular Duomo and be swept away by the elegant Renaissance atmosphere of Florence.
Explore the charms of intimate seaside towns in the picturesque setting of the Italian Riviera at Cinque Terre.
Tips
Use the phrase ‘Parla inglese?’ to convey ‘Do you speak English?’ while in Italy.
Cover your shoulders and legs while visiting churches in Italy.
Avoid putting your shoes or feet on tables or chairs in Italy as this is considered to be rude.
Try the famous Italian cappuccino at one of the quaint coffee bars.
Sample special Split dishes such as ‘pasticada’ (a meat dish) and black calamari or scampi risotto.
If you want to shop for souvenirs in Split, go to the Pazar open air market that runs along Hrvojeva Street.
You can use the phrase ‘Koliko je to’ to convey ‘How much does it cost?’ in Croatia.
