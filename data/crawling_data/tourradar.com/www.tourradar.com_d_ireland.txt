Highlights
Go sea kayaking, and meet the famous dolphin “Fungie” in Dingle Bay.
Try rock climbing at the Dalkey Quarry, in Dublin.
See Belfast's political murals on a 'Famous Black Cab' tour, before visiting the Titanic Museum.
Try your hand at SUPing (Stand Up Paddling) along what is known as Ireland's amazon river, the Lough Gill.
Immerse yourself in a Victorian seaweed bath, at Enniscrone.
Visit the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin to see how this dark beer is made, before hitting a pub to enjoy some traditional Irish music.
Visit Blarney Castle, where you can kiss the Blarney Stone and hopefully gain the ‘gift of the gab’.
Muster the courage to cross the famous 'Carrick-a-Rede' rope bridge before taking in the Giant’s Causeway, a famous natural oddity made up of around 40 000 interlocking basalt columns.
Tips
English and Irish (Gaeilge) are the two official languages in Ireland, but in Northern Ireland you’ll also hear Ullans.
The sun will shine eventually, but be prepared for rain.  Bring layers, rain gear and good walking/hiking shoes.
The currency used in the Republic of Ireland is the Euro, while Northern Ireland’s currency is the Pound Sterling.
Be sure to bring home some Irish whiskey, a Claddagh ring and some Arun sweaters.
Ask for a “blackcurrant and water” on one of your pub visits. This pinkish-purple beverage will only set you back a few Euros.
There isn’t a strong tipping culture in Ireland, but it’s common to leave 10% at restaurants and for taxis.
Don’t leave Ireland without trying some fish and chips.  Tap water is safe to drink in Ireland, but the Irish will tell you whiskey
goes down just as easy.
The “Guinness Book of World Records” was created by Guinness brewery employees.
Ireland Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"During my trip to Ireland, I chose to go with Vagabond and the tour was a mix of wonderful experiences with a few set backs. The accommodations were a delight and in perfect locations as well as the complimentary breakfast which surpassed my expectations. Our tour guides was estremely knowledgeable, accommodating and fun to be with. I was impressed by that we were never dumped in  gift shops and tourist traps. There were a few set backs which disappointed me during the tour. The Land Rover was uncomfortable with only one good seat in the front and the long drive everyday was something I didn't like. We also never got a chance to do all activities in the itinerary and instead did all the strenuous one and we didn't have free time to explore on our own. Overall, I learned that a tour is still a tour no matter how you dress it up."
8 day Wild Irish Rover Tour
"The best way to see Ireland was joining this trip. Everything about it was amazing, from the hostels to the local guide who was very knowledgeable. Everyone was friendly and accommodating. It was tour that was worth every penny."
Celtic Rocker
"We had a great Ireland vacation coupled with the best Irish weather. We climbed for a few hours but the view from the top was worth it. I will definitely come back and do this trip over again."
