Highlights
Experience a steamboat dinner!  Choose your ingredients and plop them into the soup simmering in the middle of your table.
Trek to the summit of Mount Kinabalu in time to see the sunrise.
Cross the world’s longest canopy walkways in one of the oldest tropical rainforests.
Surrounded by numerous white coral reefs, the island of Tioman is a scuba diver's dream.
Walk across the world’s highest 2-storey bridge which sits between the world’s tallest twin buildings.
Learn how the rescued baby orangutans in Sabah are being rehabilitated.
Make your way to the largest cave chamber in the world.  The Sarawak chamber could accommodate about 40 Boeing 747s without overlapping their wings.
Sail to the Perhentian Islands for rest and relaxation alongside palm-fringed white sandy beaches and turquoise blue sea.
Tips
The currency in Malaysia is called the Ringgit.  Credit cards are widely accepted and ATM’s are readily available.
The official language of Malaysia is Malay (Bahasa Melayu).  English is spoken widely.
Tipping is not expected in Malaysia but will not be refused.  Around 10% is the norm for good service.
Try the national dish of Nasi lemak!  The water in Malaysia is safe but delivery pipes aren’t.  Stick to bottled water.
Light clothing will keep you comfortable in the heat.  Dress modestly, and cover your shoulders and knees when visiting religious sites.
Don’t leave Malaysia without some batik, Royal Selangor pewter and Malaysian Tea.
There are 9 reigning royal families in Malaysia!
The world’s largest roundabout is in Malaysia.  It’s 3.5km in diameter.  Don’t miss your exit!
Malaysia Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"The Malaysia tour was fantastic. Some of the tour highlights were; visiting Turtle Island and seeing Sepilok which was breathtaking. The acccommodation was pretty basic but was mostly clean and I wouldn't stay in a more luxurious accommodation as I feel this would detract from the overall experience.  Our tour guides were amazing, knowledgable and passionate. The group was also fantastic as we helped each other in Mt Kinabalu. I would highly recommend this trip to anyone who wants to explore Malaysia."
