Stories from travellers
Sapphire sent out her referral code to friends and family. When she returned from Machu Picchu, she discovered that she had USD$700 worth of travel credits! She booked
Fujian Adventure
and absolutely loved it.
“I had a smile on my face the whole time!”
Sapphire Brash
from England
Janice organised three South American tours with her friends from around the world. She invited them to book their tours with her referral code from the Friends with Benefits program. Using the travel credits she collected, Janice booked her tours for less and her friends did too!
