Highlights
Take a tiny elevator down into the depths and explore the “buildings” inside the salt mines in Krakow.
Everyone should visit Auschwitz at least once in their lifetime.  It’s not about remembering what happened, it’s about never forgetting it.
Visit a castle that’s old and new!  The Royal Castle in Warsaw is an amazing example of the fine rebuilding of the Old Town after WWII.
Cycle from Krakow to the Open-air Museum of Wooden Folk Architecture in Dobczyce.
Travel by traditional wooden rafts through the Dunajec Gorge.
Use “memory machines” to create your own “time document” at the Oskar Schindler's Factory.
Go gnome-hunting in Wroclaw!  There are about 250 gnomes hidden all around the city!
Take a chair-lift to Palenica to admire the Pieniny Mountains.  Return to the bottom on a 700 metre summer slide!
Tips
The official language of Poland is Polish.  English and Russian are also spoken.
The currency in Poland is called the Zloty.  Credit cards are widely accepted and ATM's are easy to find.
Don't leave Poland without honey-flavoured Miodówka vodka, gingerbread and amber jewellery.
Tipping is expected in Poland for good service.  Somewhere between 10-15% is the norm.
Clothes are pretty casual in Poland for ordinary days but dressier to go out.  You’ll do well with casual layers.
Try as many Pierogi flavours as you can while in Poland.  The water in Poland is safe to drink.
The most popular name for a dog in Poland is Burek which translates to: “brownish-grey color”.
In Poland, bananas are peeled from the blossom end, not from the stem end.
Poland Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
