Highlights
Let your Gondoliere whisk you away and introduce you to the sublime beauty of Venice, on a languorous gondola ride along the famous Grand Canal.
Stroll through tree-lined avenues, explore puzzling alleyways and admire the vibrant offerings of the Picasso Museum, during a visit to Barcelona.
Relax in a traditional Turkish bath, dig into some mouth-watering kebabs and take in the exotic sights and smells that surround the 15th century Grand Bazaar, in Istanbul.
Stimulate your senses with Mykonos’ lively variety of seaside taverns, posh garden restaurants, drag shows and all the other special delights that Little Venice offers.
Snorkel in shimmering blue waters, explore Gozo’s fascinating rural culture, and enjoy the warm kisses of the Mediterranean Sun at Malta.
Listen to gentle whispers of the wind, as you walk across the majestic medieval walls that guard the Dubrovnik Old Town in Croatia.
Enter a timeless landscape, interspersed by ancient churches and monasteries, during a picturesque hike across pine scented forests in the heart of the Troodos mountain range, in Cyprus.
Enjoy vistas of wild, sweeping mountains and paradise beaches from vantage points inside the Llogara National Park, in Albania.
Tips
Try Albanian sea food specialties such as eel and sea bass, and wash it down with the region’s most famous spirit ‘Raki’.
If you’re looking for the best of Cypriot food, then order some ‘mezedhe’ or mezze at a local tavern.
Kick up a conversation with the locals and start by saying ‘Bok’ which means ‘Hello’, or ‘Dobro jutro’ which means ‘Good Morning’ in Croatian.
The best time to visit Malta’s Blue Grotto Cave is anytime between sunrise and about 1 pm.
Try some Greek fusion cuisine and fresh sea food such as fried calamari, in the modern tavernas of Mykonos.
Don’t forget to watch the mesmerizing performance of the ancient Whirling Dervishes, in Istanbul.
You can shop for Spanish souvenirs such as tins of olive oil, Catalonian textiles, carpets, rugs and leather goods.
Learn basic Italian terms such as ‘Per favore’ for ‘Please’, and ‘Grazie’ for ‘Thank you’.
