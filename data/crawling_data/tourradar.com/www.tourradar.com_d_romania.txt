Highlights
Take a peek at the handiwork and craftsmanship of the Saxons in the splendid town of Stejarisu and don’t miss the famous Bacon Tower.
Sit in on a pottery workshop in Marginea and learn a unique way of molding clay.
Visit the enclosed remains of Stephen the Great inside a 500 year old monastery in Putna.
Interact with locals and craftsmen in the villages of Bukovina and enjoy their lively and exciting stories.
Be amazed at the Moldovita monastery, a true Byzantine architectural masterpiece and follow that up by learning how to paint and decorate Easter eggs.
Visit the largest Museum of Painted Glass Icons in Romania in the traditional rural area of Sibiel.
Spend a day or two in the cultural capital of Europe – Sibiu. Its old town, museums, historical buildings and artsy cafes will give you enough to reflect upon.
Climb 1480 steps up to Poenari Castle, Dracula’s hideaway. Discover Vlad Tepes’s ancestors and his cruel and frightening history.
Tips
If you’re going to the theater or opera, remember to dress well and accessorize with classy and elegant bags, watches and shoes.
You may get gum or candy in lieu of small change at a local store – this is normal and accepted.
Be wary of pick pockets near the train station Gara de Nord and main tourist areas.
Avoid whistling or opening an umbrella inside a house as it’s considered a bad omen.
Get vaccinated for ticks if you plan to go hiking in Romania.
It is customary to tip 10% when you dine at a restaurant.
Always close a door behind you as the locals believe that the cold draft could affect health.
Ignore stray dogs and if they get aggressive, don’t run but just keep walking.
