Tips
Need help with the language? Almost anyone under 25 years old is likely to speak both standard Mandarin and English.
Be sure to check the weather for the areas you’ll be visiting in the month you’ll be visiting them.
Enjoy the food!  Try as much as you can and don’t be afraid of the street vendors.
There are bargains to be had when it comes to leather goods, tailored clothes, accessories and jewellery.
Tipping in mainland China is not expected but is common in hotels and restaurants that cater to Western tourists.
Cash is king in China.  Don’t expect to rely on your credit cards other than in hotels, restaurants and some upscale shops.
For the most part, the Chinese are not comfortable with physical contact.  Avoid back-slapping, arm-touching and hugs.
China has planted the biggest artificial forest in the world to stop the spread of the Gobi desert.
China Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"My husband and I enjoyed each others company as we explored China. The tour guide was amazing, took us to fantastic places and was our personal menu translator when we visited small towns where everyone spoke Mandarin. We never would have known and experienced a lot of things if we did this on our own. Overall it was a memorable trip with minor set backs. I definitely recommend the Fine China tour to everyone who wants to expereince the Northern Chinese culture."
Fine China
"Beijing was a great city with warm hearted and welcoming people. I also like Nanluogo Xiang, the snakes and the local delicacies. It was a trip worth remembering."
4 Days Guilin Tours including Longji Terrace Rice Fields and Li River Cruise
"The China tour was an awesome adventure. The tour guide was great and took us to the most stunning places that I was so eager to see but the highlight of the tour was seeing the Great Wall of China. A very memorable experience to last a lifetime."
