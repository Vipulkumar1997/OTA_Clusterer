Who can join
TourRadar works with professional tour operators running multi-day group tours with ready-to-book itineraries.
                   There is no cost for a Tour Operator to list on TourRadar, however there is a set of terms and conditions each
                   Tour Operator should agree to and also a standard service fee payable for all confirmed bookings.
Application process
Complete the form via the 'Apply Now' button. TourRadar screens all applications and due to the large volume,
                   we only respond to applications that have successfully passed our initial screening process.
Once you receive confirmation that your application has been successful, we will guide you through the easy
                   setup process, put a contract in place and assist you with setting up your tours.
Set up process
Tours can be added to TourRadar using a JSON / XML API feed, via one of our existing reservation system partners,
                   or manually using the TourRadar Dashboard.
The TourRadar technical and content teams will be available to assist with ensuring your tours are going to be
                   presented in the best possible way to maximise exposure and sales opportunities.
