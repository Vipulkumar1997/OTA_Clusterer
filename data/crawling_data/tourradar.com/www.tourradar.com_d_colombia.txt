Highlights
Take a canoe ride through unspoiled mangroves with Afro-Colombian fisher folk from La Boquilla.
Cross the Buritaca River, walk through indigenous villages and climb 1200 mossy steps to find the Lost City.
Visit the Zipaquirá Salt Cathedral and the Paloquemao market at the old colonial town of Villa de Leyva.
Walk through lush coffee plantations, learn about the process and buy your own beans at Manizales.
Experience the second largest Easter parade in the world, in the famous ‘white city’, Popoyan.
Walk around the beautiful San Felipe de Barajas Castle at Cartagena, a UNESCO site famous for early Spanish settlements.
Enjoy a rejuvenating and relaxing mud bath at Volcan de Lodo El Totumo.
Explore pre Colombian ancient ruins at the Tayrona National Park.
Tips
Enjoy Colombia’s exciting street performances and acts but be watchful of your surroundings.
If you’re on a budget, try street food instead of heading to one of the expensive pizzerias.
Refrain from saying anything negative about Catholics; the Colombians are closely bound with their religion.
If you’re visiting a local at home, you will be offered a sugared black coffee called ‘tinto’.
Wear casual clothing but avoid wearing shorts especially if you want to blend in. Remember that nude or topless sunbathing is not allowed.
Whistling to get someone’s attention is considered rude.
To indicate the length of an object, extend your right arm and mark off the length with your left hand. Using two fingers is considered an obscene gesture.
Avoid paying taxi drivers in dollars as they’ll hike the price. Keep pesos in hand before you travel.
