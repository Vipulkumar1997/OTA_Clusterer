We Rank the Best Christmas Markets in Vienna
It’s time to get excited because the
Christmas markets in Vienna
have arrived! If you’ve been waiting for this moment since January, it’s time to grab your woolly mittens, your best Christmas jumper and embrace the festive feels in Vienna. But b
efore we go any further, it’s important to note that not all Christmas markets were created to the same level of awesomeness – and that’s why
we’ve ranked the
best Christmas markets in Vienna
to help fulfil your festive dreams.

Austria
Christmas is a special time in Vienna
9. Winter Market Prater
Located beneath the iconic Vienna ferris wheel, you will find a collection of festive huts otherwise known as the Winter Market Prater which tick all the boxes for festive fun and more.
On weekends you can enjoy live music and parades, or if you need a break from festive entertainment, you can pop into Madame Tussauds. Alternatively, you could explore the vast parklands of Vienna’s largest public park.
If you’re staying in Vienna, you might be able to catch the iconic Philharmonic Orchestra concert on New Year’s Eve.

8. Stephansdom Christmas Markets
A smaller setup than most other markets, this cluster of huts located by Stephansdom Cathedral are a fantastic option if you want a quick taste of traditional Christmas markets in Vienna. With a huge Christmas tree set against the dramatic backdrop of St Stephen’s Cathedral, what these markets lack in atmosphere, they sure make up in convenience.

7. Schönbrunn Palace Christmas Markets
Set beside the breathtaking backdrop of the yellow Habsburg Palace, the Schönbrunn Christmas markets are a firm favourite for many travellers making the journey through Vienna.
Here, you’ll find a rich selection of tasty treats from candy to oversized gingerbread hearts and Käsespatzle cheese noodles. As one of the most famous and historical sights in Vienna, this market can get crowded and in some cases may be more expensive than the alternatives we have listed below – so maybe keep that in mind when planning your journey. Overall, the setting is magical and filled with plenty of traditional handicrafts and Christmas decorations to marvel at, but just beware that the peak times for visitors is between 4-8pm!

6. Belvedere Christmas Markets
Another stunning palatial location, the Belvedere Christmas Markets are smaller than Schönbrunn markets but equally as great. Home to approximately 40 stalls, this market holds a greater focus on crafts and artisan products than other markets.
You’ll still be able to find plenty of tasty Austrian treats, but primarily this market is great for a short visit and for a mug of glüwein. During the day you can combine entrance to the museum nearby with a mug of
punsch
for just €17 during museum opening hours. Belvedere is pretty, but beyond a punsch or two, there’s not much to keep you entertained once you’ve snapped a few photos for Instagram.

5. Rathaus Winter Dream
The Rathaus Winter Dream has it all. Here, you can wander beneath illuminated decorations surrounding Rathaus Square and eat endless amounts of sweet baked treats.
There’s even an ice skating rink with a view of the famous Burgtheater. While you’re there, you can try your hand at
Eisstockscheisen
, a Bavarian bowls-style game played on ice.
Rathaus Platz markets are by far the busiest in the city, so just be prepared to elbow your way through the markets and enjoy the festive spirit among the crowd. The sparkling archway entrance is iconic and is a popular spot take a few naps beneath, but the queues for drinks and food can get out of hand during peak times – not to mention the queues for the bathrooms! Just be patient, take a warm jacket and enjoy the festive spirit and soak up the pre-Christmas excitement.

4. Maria Theresien Christmas Village
The Maria Theresia Christmas Village is an adorable location to stop and recharge while you explore the city. Surrounded by the Natural History Museum and the Art History Museum, there’s no excuse not to visit these markets.
The picturesque wooden huts lined up along garden paths serve traditional punsch and sweet snacks. Being so popular, you might struggle to find a table but there is always space for a quick drink. These markets are also great for strolling and capturing a few photos as you make your way into Vienna’s old town. Situated between the Museums Quartier area and Hofburg Palace, you have no excuse not to keep exploring Vienna.

3. Spittelberg Christmas Markets
Winding between quaint, cobblestone alleyways in the über cool 7th district, Spittelberg markets are seriously something special. Here, you will find twinkling lights and glowing Christmas decorations combined with a more local feeling. Each stall is set up between independent gift stores and restaurants to mix it up. If you’re lucky, you’ll stumble upon one of the small courtyards dotted between the alleys.
This is also the market where Viennese locals will visit after work or for a weekend stroll. Visitors will enjoy the genuine atmosphere and high-quality woodwork and woven clothing. If the temperature drops,  you can take refuge in a nearby restaurant as this is one of the best areas for food in Vienna. With streets as charming as these, you’ll want to wander around here for hours.

2. Altes AKH Christmas Markets
A hidden delight, nestled behind the walls of a former hospital turned university campus. The Altes AKH Christmas market offers diverse food and wine stands along with a miniature ferris wheel for children.
The protective canopy of oak trees surrounding the markets makes this a particularly cosy retreat to enjoy the atmosphere. A low-key favourite amongst locals, the Altes AKH is perfect for a dose of Christmas cheer.

1. Karlsplatz Christmas Markets
The Karlsplatz Market is the most special of them all. Put simply, the quality of the artisanal products sold at the market stands is superb. The whimsical lights strewn across the iconic Karlskirche square will impress both locals and travellers. Also, t
his is the only market in the city where stallholders must meet the jury standard to sell their artwork. You can guarantee the person who made the artwork will be running the stall too.
By purchasing your gifts and Christmas decorations here you’re directly supporting local artists and businesses.
