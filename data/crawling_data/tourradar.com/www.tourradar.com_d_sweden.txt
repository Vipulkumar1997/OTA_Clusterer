Highlights
Explore the ethereal beauty of Stockholm, spread across 14 islands and slice into some of the finest culture, fashion and nightlife to be found in Europe.
Get off the beaten path and cycle through Stockholm’s archipelago stretching all the way to the Baltic Sea. Pass through exceptional beaches, hidden lakes, charming island villages and national parks.
Cook your own meals and sleep in a tent surrounded by amazing nature as you canoe and kayak through the calm lakes of the Saint Anna area on the east coast.
Be one with nature as you hike through the famous Kungsleden Trail sprinkled with hills, mountains and valleys.
Learn to ride with a team of Siberian huskies on a dog sledding expedition through pine scented forests and snowy hills in Lapland.
Indulge in superb winter sports at world renowned ski resorts in Lulea and Miekojarvi.
Enjoy the sights of charming old churches and museums and walk through the royal chambers and secret passages in the palaces of Sweden.
Watch the sun, shine at night during the summer months and stay awake all night just to marvel as this amazing natural phenomena.
Tips
Be prepared for extended hours of daylight in summer and long winter nights. Regions further north experience extreme variations.
The Swedish have a reputation for being efficient and don’t like to haggle over prices. They appreciate straight talk and honesty.
While most museums do not charge an entry fee, be prepared to pay around 50 kroner at certain locations.
Avoid drinking alcohol in public places as it's against the law.
Popular souvenirs include intricately patterned Dala horses, Swedish glass and hand-woven table runners.
Swedish cuisine is mostly based off meat and potatoes. Try some popular dishes such as Kottbullar (meatballs) and a wide array of cheese and bread.
The locals have perfected the art of queuing. So stand in line, wait your turn and don’t jump the line.
The Swedish have a tradition of eating surströmming (fermented fish) but be careful when you open the tin as the smell can be quite strong.
