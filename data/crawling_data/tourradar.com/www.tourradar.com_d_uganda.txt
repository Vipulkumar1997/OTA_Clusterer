Highlights
Visit the jungles of the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park to catch a glimpse of the endangered mountain gorilla in its natural habitat.
Enjoy the chorus of Shoe Bills and African Fish eagles, two of Uganda’s most exotic bird specimens.
Rest at the mesmerizing Lake Bunyonyi and savor the picturesque scenery of low hanging mists over terraced hillsides.
Discover gorgeous sunsets and white sandy beaches at Ssese Islands near Lake Victoria.
Take a tour of a tea plantation and end the day sipping a delicious cup of hot steaming tea whie watching the beautiful sunset.
Travel to the source of the mighty River Nile at Owen Falls near Jinja.
Get a taste of wild adventure as you go white water rafting across grade 5 rapids on the River Nile.
Give back to society by doing volunteer work with local communities and participate in ecosystem protection programs.
Tips
Carry U.S. dollars and debit cards since many places outside Kampala do not accept credit cards.
The minimum age for entry at the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park is 15 years and visitors have to pay a minimum of $500 for a gorilla tracking permit.
Avoid getting too close to political demonstrations or rallies in Kampala as these can turn violent.
Stick to a guided tour as it is not advisable to travel independently in North East Uganda.
Avoid eating bushbuck, buffalo or hippo meat as it would have been obtained by illegal poaching.
Homosexual relations are illegal and those indulging in such acts are liable to be prosecuted.
Wear sturdy shoes to counter the steep terrain of the Bwindi National Park and carry appropriate rain gear as this area encounters showers almost every day.
Check with your tour guide before handing out toys, chocolates or other gifts to local children.
