Highlights
Join pilgrims from around the world as they arrive to worship at the Buddhist Shwedagon Pagoda.
Visit a Burmese cat sanctuary that’s built on stilts in the middle of Inle Lake.
Take a magnificent sunset canoe ride with boatmen who steer and row perched on one leg!
Follow monkeys as they lead you up 770 steps to the top of Mount Popa.
Share a glass of local “fire water” with the Akha people.
Watch the sunset over U Bein Bridge, the longest and oldest wooden teak bridge in the world.
Make your way to the Kuthodaw Pagoda, nicknamed the ‘World’s Biggest Book’ because of the 729 stone slabs of Buddhist scriptures.
Spend the morning snorkelling the bay and the afternoon relaxing on the unspoiled beaches of Ngapali.
Tips
Burmese is the official language of Myanmar.  English is widely spoken throughout the country.
The national currency in Myanmar is the kyat.  Don’t rely on ATM’s or credit cards.  US dollars are accepted in many places and are easy to exchange.
Tipping is welcome in Myanmar.  Leave between 5-10% to reward good service.
Dress modestly in Myanmar, and leave body-revealing clothes at home.  Cover your legs and shoulders when visiting religious sites.
Don’t leave Myanmar without a handmade parasol, a traditional marionette and a Longyi skirt.
Try Myanmar’s national dish called Mohinga.  Drink bottled water only but tap water is fine for brushing your teeth.
To get a waiter’s attention, locals will make two or three short kissing sounds.
People of Myanmar use a yellow paste from the Thanakha tree as a natural sunscreen.
Myanmar (Burma) Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"Myanmar was such an incredibly beautiful country. Our tour guide (Helen) was helpful, knowledgeable and organized. The tour was an amazing way to discover Myanmar and its people. I recommend this tour for everyone to experience the true beauty of Myanmar."
The Best of Myanmar (8 destinations)
"Joining the Myanmar trip will let you experience some adventurous feeling, like the bumpiest ride in the world. However, you will also get to see amazing sceneries of historic places like the temples, amazing sunsets and the longest wooden bridge in the world or floating villages on mountainous lakes. It was a fascinating trip and will surely do it again."
Discover Myanmar
"It was our first time to visit Myanmar and we did not expect it to see beautiful landscapes and a wonderful culture. We saw a lot of amazing sights with the help of our tour guides. The trip went smoothly without a hitch and we will surely come back soon."
