Highlights
Drift away on an unbeaten track to be amidst flamingos, elephants, hippos, lions and other wild creatures against the imposing backdrop of the Great Rift Valley and Lake Naivasha.
Learn about Kenya’s history and culture at the National Museum in Nairobi, touted as the safari capital of Africa. It’s also a great place to pick up local handicrafts.
Stay in a bush camp and sleep under a brilliant starlit sky in the beautiful Loita Hills and sample the local cuisine and Swahili dishes.
Gain an insight into the culture and life of the traditional Maasai tribe, known for their ornate jewellery and vibrant costumes.
Experience quintessential Africa in the Masai Mara National Reserve with its sparse open savannahs and a dramatic blue sky.
Glide over the Kenyan jungle plains in a hot air balloon at dawn for a splendid view of migrating wildlife.
Spend some time interacting with the little ones at the New Hope Children's Centre, an orphanage that provides for the less fortunate.
Experience the fun and excitement of swimming with dolphins at the Shimoni and Wasini Islands.
Tips
The best time to visit Kenya would be between June and October.
Wear full sleeves and long trousers to protect yourself from mosquitoes and carry insect repellents and malaria pills.
Though generally safe, tribal conflicts have occurred in the Mount Elgon area of western Kenya. Your tour guide will let you know if it’s safe to travel in this region.
There are stringent restrictions on the consumption of alcohol in public and smoking is prohibited in all public places.
Possession of ivory, even as a jewel is strictly prohibited.
Avoid taking photographs of official buildings as it may land you in trouble.
