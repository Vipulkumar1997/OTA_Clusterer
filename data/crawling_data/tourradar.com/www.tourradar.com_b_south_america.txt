Highlights
Watch the early morning sunrays illuminate the mystical temples, in the lost Inca kingdom of Macha Picchu, Peru.
Wake up to the cries of chattering birds and monkeys, in Ecuador’s steamy Amazon jungle near Quito.
Watch giant condors performing breathtaking aerial balancing acts, in the blue Andean mountains at the Torres del Paine National Park, in Chile.
Step into a 4WD and traverse the eerie, desolate Salar de Uyuni salt flats in Bolivia.
Try and spot blue butterflies as they flit by in the misty spray of the spectacular Iguazu Falls, which straddles the Argentinean and Brazil borders.
Soak up the sun, hit the night clubs and indulge in hedonistic pleasures at the pulsating Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
Celebrate the joie de vivre, that is amply evident in any of Buenos Aires’ French style cafes and decadent tango bars.
Wander around thought-provoking megalith sculptures and forgotten burial chambers, at the Parque Arqueologico in Columbia.
Tips
You can head to vantage points on Montserrate Mountain, for a panoramic view of Bogota, Columbia’s capital city.
Be prepared for a bit of a trek when you visit Angel Falls, the world’s highest waterfalls in the Canaima National Park, Venezuela.
Sample exotic food such as grilled blood sausage (morcilla), or tasty Argentinean beef accompanied by delicious chimichurri sauce.
Go ahead and practise your samba moves with local performers, when you’re in bustling Rio de Janeiro.
While in Bolivia, shop for vibrant lucky charms, protective talismans and woollen scarves made from alpaca and llama wool.
Learn a few words in Spanish such as ‘Hola’ for ‘Hello’, and ‘Gracias’ for ‘Thank you’.
Taste spicy Peruvian food, such as ‘ceviche’ (raw fish marinated in hot chili pepper and lime juice).
For a really good time, attend a favela funk party in one of Rio’s downtown neighbourhoods, such as Lapa.
