Highlights
Discover sophisticated and unique neighbourhoods like Recoleta where palaces remind us that this was once the Paris of the South.
Witness Mother Nature’s stunning display of power as massive blocks of ice from the Perito Moreno glacier break off and crash into the waters of Lago Argentino.
Indulge in gourmet food and sip delicious wine in Mendoza, famous for traditional wineries and year-round sunshine.
Visit Iguazu Falls, one of the seven natural wonders which is also a UNESCO world heritage site.
Groove to Latin American rhythm in a live tango show with dancers, gaucho music and Argentinean folklore.
Hike to Mount Fitz Roy for an unforgettable view of Laguna de los Tres.
Lose yourself in the beauty of Ushuaia Bay and see diverse marine life, such as cormorants and fur seals, on De los Lobos and De los Pajaros Islands.
Be awed by the scenic beauty surrounding the gorgeous Nahuel Huapi Lake, a reminiscent of the Swiss Alps.
Tips
Don’t be surprised if the locals greet you with a quick cheek-kiss. This is a part of the Argentinean culture.
Make sure you pack a variety of clothes and dress in layers as some regions have extreme temperature shifts in a single day.
Dress nicely to a tango show or party. Avoid jeans, sneakers and casual attire.
Avoid eating in public transportation or on the street.
Head to a bar only around 11:30pm or later as the nightlife starts late and goes on until almost dawn.
Be careful with hand gestures. The inverted American ‘okay’ sign is considered obscene in Argentina.
When you drink yerba mate, the national drink, remember that it is passed clockwise.
Avoid sensitive topics which are religious or political in nature.
Argentina Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"The tour was great as it highlights amazing parts of South America. It  was a combination of small tours with different local guides. The tour guides (Joanna in  Ecuador and Martin in Chile/Argentina) were good. They were friendly, knowledgeable and made the experience memorable. The accommodation was better than what I expected."
Inca Empire
"We had a 10 days tour through Patagonia, stayed at local inns and restaurants. The best fish I've ever had was at El Gato in Peurto Varas. We explored many hills but the 10 mile grade over the Andes was amazing and the ride was interesting. Our tour guides (Juan Pablo and Pablito with Experience Plus) made the trip memorable. There were beautiful sceneries and the trip was well worth our time and money."
Bicycling Patagonia's Lakes District Plus! The Island of Chiloé (from San Carlos De Bariloche to Puerto Montt)
"Though we travelled a lot, this trip was the best we had. The entire experience was extraordinary, from the booking and getting there. Franco and Mel made everyone feel special and they were such an adorable couple. The experiences we had was incredible and it was an exciting adventure."
