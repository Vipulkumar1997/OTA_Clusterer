Highlights
Take in the spectacular sight of smouldering lava embers, as they envelope the Arenal Volcano by night, in Costa Rica.
Experience the eerie mysteriousness that surrounds Tikal’s ancient Maya ruins, set amidst dramatic and steamy forestland in Guatemala.
Wander among colonial architectural jewels, in the carefully restored Nicaraguan city of Granada.
Take in the sights of vibrant hued marine life, as you snorkel in the pristine barrier reef just off the Caye Caulker island, in Belize.
Go on a memorable boat cruise and marvel at the amazing engineering intricacies of the world-famous, Panama Canal.
Go off the beaten track, and canoe through wild, untamed rivers located in the remote and marshy coastal wetlands of La Mosquitia, in Honduras.
Tap into your adventurous spirit while hiking up to Santa Ana, El Salvador’s highest volcano.
Watch ancient Maya history spring to life in the spectacular tombs, pyramids and temples of Palenque, in Mexico.
Tips
Try authentic tacos, burritos and mouth-watering mole sauces in Mexico. Wash it down with a shot of tequila or mezcal.
You can shop for decorated, little ceramic orbs called sorpresa in El Salvador.
Keep an eye out for elusive mammals such as pumas, jaguars, and tapirs in the tropical rainforests of Honduras.
Get a surfing lesson when you’re at one of the gorgeous beaches of Bocas del Toro.
Strike up a friendly conversation with Belize locals by greeting them with a ‘Maanin’ (Good Morning!) or ‘Hey Bali!’ (Hey Buddy).
Take a few Spanish classes in-between excursions, while you’re in Granada, Nicaragua.
Guided canopy tours are an exciting way to explore the rainforests that surround Tikal.
Sample savoury snacks called ‘bocas’, which are served before main meals at the bars and restaurants of San Jose, Costa Rica’s capital city.
