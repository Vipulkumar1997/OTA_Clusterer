Tips
Tipping is not done in Japan…..anywhere!  Service-people are paid a living wage.
Japanese currency is called Yen. Carry at least 20,000 yen in cash with you. Many establishments don’t accept credit cards.
Water is safe to drink.  You can refill at any public fountain without worry.
Language can be a challenge.  Carry a notepad with you to write down what you want, or even draw it if need be.
Don’t leave Japan without some stationary, green tea and a pair of Geta wooden shoes.
Pack layers so you’ll be prepared. Be sure your socks are in good shape!  You’ll need to remove you shoes quite often to go inside.
Manners are very important in Japan.  The polite greeting in Japan is the bow.
Imitate the bows you receive – don’t overbow or ignore the greeting.
Japan has around 5.5 million vending machines. You can find them on almost every block.
