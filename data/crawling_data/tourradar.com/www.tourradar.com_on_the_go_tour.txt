Why On The Go Tours
Comfortable Travel
On The Go knows that adventures can be better when the day ends with a cold beer by the pool or a soft pillow to lay down on. Each day On The Go is searching out comfortable hotels and boutique properties where travelers can stay while on tour. On The Go is known for their attitude of “adventure in style”!
Friendly Team
When traveling with the On the Go team, you will notice that they are more like a family than a group of colleagues. They are brought together by their enthusiasm for travel, as well as a professional work ethic.
Continuous Improvement
To help build the family-like relationship, once a year they will travel from all across the globe to meet up and discuss how to make One The Go even better. They get together at one of their destinations, and share ideas, reflect on the previous year, and make plans for the future, to ensure you as a traveler have the best experience possible.

On The Go Tours Story & History
Back in the cold winter of 1998 in London, Scott and Jay, founders of On The Go, followed the warmth of the sun and summer for an unforgettable adventure. It was this experience of traveling the world discovering history, cultures, and the incredible beauty that surrounds us, that lead to On The Go tours being born. Understanding how special the friends they made along the way were, they wanted to inspire others to travel and have similar amazing adventures; and that was shaped into On The Go tours.
