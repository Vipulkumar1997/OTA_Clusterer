Together you can seek out new experiences, make lifelong friendships, and see new places, all with other like-minded travelers.

These experts will make sure your trip is full of local insight, great experiences, and they will do everything they can to enrich your travels.
Keep Costs Down
Even if you are travelling solo, G Adventures will help keep costs down by partnering you up with a same-sex roommate. This way you ensure you are paying the same as everyone else. If you would like to have a room to yourself, that’s also fine - G Adventures can arrange this at an extra cost.

G Adventures Story & History
G Adventures started in 1990 by Bruce Poon Tip. He had the belief that other travelers would want to share the experiences and authentic adventures of travel, in a responsible and sustainable way. Back then it was just a one man show, and now it has grown to a company of over 1250 people worldwide. Originally just a few trips around Latin America, there is now hundreds of trips on offer around the world! Since it’s first days back in the 90’s, there has now been over 100,000 travelers who have sen new sights, gained new experiences, and made new friends. While things may have changed a bit over that time, the core values are the same; Authentic experiences, and sustainable travel.
