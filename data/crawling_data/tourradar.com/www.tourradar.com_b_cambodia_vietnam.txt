Highlights
Explore first hand the Cu Chi tunnel network, a series of supply and communication tunnels just outside of Ho Chi Minh City which played an imperative role for North Vietnamese fighters during the Vietnam War.
Discover the early morning bustle of floating markets of Vietnam’s iconic Mekong Delta as you pass by riverside towns whilst cruising along the intricate waterways.
Discover grottos filled with splendid stalactites, swim in emerald green waters and marvel at the sight of striking limestone karsts rising out of Vietnam’s majestic Halong Bay.
Pedal through lush rice fields, shop for vibrant fabrics, step back in time in the Old Town and enjoy a cocktail in a riverside bar at Vietnam’s historic Hoi An.
Marvel at the grandeur of the Royal Palace and delve into Buddhist tradition and tranquillity at Phnom Penh’s Wat Phnom temple.
Watch the early morning rays illuminate the magnificently carved ruins of Cambodia’s Angkor Wat and surrounding temples.
Soak up sweeping countryside sights as you immerse yourself in the rustic charms of Cambodia’s Cham villages.
Kick off your shoes and kick back on white sandy beaches, soaking up the sun as you enjoy Sihanoukville’s balmy atmosphere.
Tips
Shop for silverworks, Buddhist artworks, silks and textiles in Phnom Penh’s Central Market and Angkor Night Market.
If you’re travelling with your family, head to Phnom Penh’s riverfront restaurants as children will love the laidback atmosphere here.
Try some wild, exotic Cambodian delicacies such as fertilized duck eggs (Balut) and crispy fried spiders.
Avoid pointing your feet at anyone in Cambodia as this is considered impolite and rude.
You can shop for fabrics and get a perfectly tailored suit in Vietnam’s Hoi An city.
If you want to mingle with the locals, head to Vietnam’s pavement bars and order quail eggs and some beer. This is the best way to strike up a conversation with the locals.
Head to Ho Chi Minh’s District 1, Hanoi’s Old Quarter and the area around Hoan Kiem Lake if you’re looking for some great Vietnamese nightlife.
Sample Vietnamese street food such as ‘Nem’ (crispy spring rolls stuffed with pork and noodles) and ‘Bim cha’ (a plate of grilled pork, fried rolls, rice noodles and salad).
