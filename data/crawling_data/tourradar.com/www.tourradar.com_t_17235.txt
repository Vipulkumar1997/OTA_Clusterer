A great way to see Cuba in a small group before it gets overtouristed.  Our Guide, Tony, was great and as a Cuban had such an indepth knowledge of the country, history, culture etc that a none local guide would never have had.  Took us to places we would never have found on our own and gave us a true insight into what life in Cuba is really like.  Cuba is beautiful.  Minivan was spacious and commfortable even for the longer drives.  Homestays in Trinidad and Vinales were more basic than traditionally a Peregrine hotel would be but more than counteracted by the experience of staying in a traditional cuban house and the hospitality of our hosts.

Do you help in Visa application?
Unfortunately we are unable to give visa advice due to the vast number of nationalities which our customers represent. Some nationalities can travel freely over borders, where others require advance permission to enter. There are also changes in requirements from time to time. We recommend checking your local embassy or consulate's website for the latest up to date information.
