Highlights
Capture the romance of Renaissance architecture in the mesmerizing cities of Bansko, Plovdiv, Sofia and Koprivshtitsa. Lose track of time as you walk along the narrow cobbled streets of Plovdiv, passing by a Roman amphitheater and quaint houses.
Take in the beauty of fabulous frescoes at Rila Monastery.
Travel back in time as you hike or trek your way to old historic capital cities of Veliki Preslav, Pliska and Veliko Tarnovo.
Embark on an adventurous trek across the magnificent Rhodope Mountains, dotted with delightful mountain villages and virgin forests. Make your way through a stunning landscape of gorges, peaks, caves and canyons.
Explore picturesque mountain trails amidst pine forests to reach the majestic peaks of Pirin and Rila Mountains.
Explore the stark beauty of the Belogradchik Rocks, a fantastic expanse of colorful yet bizarre rock formations.
Relax in a therapeutic mineral water spa after an exciting white water rafting expedition on Struma River in Kresna Town.
Savor the gastronomic delights of Bulgarian cuisine while on a cultural highlights tour of Sofia.
Tips
Late spring, early summer and the beginning of autumn are the best times for camping and hiking.
Avid and experienced hikers may search for multi day hikes with overnight accommodation.
Both sides of Vitosha Boulevard are good shopping areas in Sofia and you can buy wine, confectionary, gloves and handicrafts.
Be prepared to get heckled by crying beggars and those trying to sell traditional Bulgarian bells.
Enjoy folk music and dance performances in the cafes and restaurants of major cities.
Try local dishes such as shopska salad, tarator salad, kavarma (a casserole) and cheverme (spit roasted lamb).
Remember, shaking your head indicates ‘No’ and nodding your head indicates ‘Yes’.
Not all coin-operated phones at bus stations to work.
