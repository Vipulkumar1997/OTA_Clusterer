Highlights
Explore and enjoy colonial architectural gems in the wonderful city of Granada.
Have fun boarding down the ash-smeared slopes of the Cerro Negro Volcano and hike up to the peak of Masaya Volcano for an amazing view of the surrounding areas.
Ride a wave at the cheerful town of San Juan del Sur on the Pacific Coast.
See the stunning beauty of lake housed within an imploded crater at Laguna de Apoyo.
Marvel at the spectacle of imposing twin volcanoes rising over a lake at fabulous Isla Ometepe.
Delve into Nicaragua’s revolutionary history and learn the art of guerilla warfare in the cities of Managua, Leon and Matagalpa.
Breathe in the heady aroma of cigars at a cigar factory in Esteli and discover the processes involved in the production of world famous hand rolled cigars.
Listen to soothing Reggae music and soak up the laidback Caribbean way of life on the palm fringed beaches of Corn Islands.
Tips
The market at Masaya is the heart of the handicraft scene in Nicaragua and popular souvenirs include wood carvings, ceramics, leatherwork, textile arts and hammocks.
Don’t hesitate to haggle with street vendors and at markets.
The climb up to Cerro Negro takes about an hour and the descent offers exciting and unusual fun.
Managua and San Jan del Sur have some of the liveliest clubbing venues in Central America.
Try Nacatamal which is a moist tamale filled with chicken, pork and vegetables and cooked in a banana leaf.
Nicaragua is famous for its rum and Flor de Cana is one of the popular brands.
Get some expert scuba diving lessons at Corn Island.
With good surfing conditions and warm water, San Jan del Sur is a great place to learn how to surf.
