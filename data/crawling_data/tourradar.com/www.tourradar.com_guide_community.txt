Our annual Guide Awards recognise excellence in the guide industry, based on travellers reviews. Collect reviews and check the leaderboard for your ranking.
Refer and Earn Travel Credit
TourRadar has created a reward program for Guides to earn travel credit and cash. Anytime travellers you have referred to the site book a tour through us, you will earn 5% of the price of the tour that traveller books. The 5% credit is collected in your Travel Fund which can then be redeemed either for a tour booking or cash.
All you need to do is share your Guide Profile link with your travellers and ensure they submit a review to your profile page to have the 5% attributed to your travel fund.
