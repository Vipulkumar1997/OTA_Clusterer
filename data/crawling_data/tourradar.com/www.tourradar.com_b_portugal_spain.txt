Highlights
Admire the artistic flourishes of Spanish greats such as Goya and Velazquez in Madrid’s Museo Del Prado.
Walk through majestic Arab gates and discover the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by erstwhile Moorish kings at the sensual Alhambra palace fortress in Granada, Spain.
Stroll along sun-kissed plazas, snack at gourmet tapas bars and explore hedonistic pleasures in sophisticated Seville.
Immerse yourself in spirituality during a memorable hike to the colossal cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, believed to be the final resting place of St. James, the Apostle.
Pedal along quaint country roads beside the gently-flowing Douro River and stop to go wine-tasting in the beautiful vineyards of the Douro Valley.
Explore the baroque churches that dot the narrow winding alleys in Porto’s Riberia district.
Dine on mouth-watering seafood while listening to the longing strains of traditional fado music in Lisbon’s bars and clubs.
Relax on picturesque cliff fringed, cove beaches and discover the rich cultural heritage of idyllic fishing towns in Portugal’s Algarve region.
Tips
If you’re looking for some entertainment head to Lisbon’s Bairro Alto district as it is the hotspot for bars and clubs.
Lisbon’s Baixa Pombalina (downtown area) houses specialty stores which sell good quality leather products.
Satisfy your sweet cravings by tucking into cinnamon dusted custard tarts found in Lisbon’s Antiga Confeitaria de Belem patisserie.
Along with port, try other local Portuguese wines such as Vinho Verde and Vinho da Bairrada.
If you want to hop from one tapas bar to another head to destinations such as Ventura de la Vega and Plaza de Santa Barbara in Madrid.
You can shop for carpets and fine rugs in Granada.
Try some Portuguese delicacies such as ‘carne de porco à Alentajana’ which is pork garnished with clams and marinated in wine.
