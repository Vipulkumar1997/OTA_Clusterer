Visit Liverpool and lose yourself to Beatlemania!  Stop by Penny Lane on your way to the Cavern Club.
Revisit the golden era of motor sport racing at the Goodwood Revival festival.
Sip samples at a winery before boarding the Tenterden Steam Railway.

Let the mystery of Stonehenge wash over you while you enjoy a beer from the Stonehenge Brewery.
Tips
The official language in England is English.  There are many different accents but you shouldn’t have a problem.
The currency in England is called the Great British Pound.  ATM’s are everywhere and credit cards are widely accepted.
If a service charge hasn’t been added to your bill, be sure to leave between 10-15% as a tip.
Feast on traditional fish and chips wrapped in newspaper.   The water in England is safe to drink.
Be ready for anything when it comes to weather.  Dress in layers and keep rain gear handy.
Don’t leave England without some Cadbury's chocolate, a pair of Doc Martens and some tea.
It’s considered an act of treason to put a postage stamp with the queen’s head upside down on an envelope!
English people consume more tea per capita than anybody else in the world!
England Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"As I travelled to Great Britain, our tour guide (Gayle) was absolutely wonderful. She was very knowledgeable and a vibrant happy lady. I highly recommend a tour with Gayle as I know it would be fun and memorable."
Great Britain - 7 Days
"The most incredible experience I've had was joining the European Wonder May 2014 tour. The tour guide was awesome and very knowledgeable about the facts from countries, buildings, culture, food and history. The food was excellent as it was really authentic and cooked to perfection.  The accommodation was brilliant, either in camp sites or hostels across Europe, all were very modern, clean and well organized. I would recommend this trip to anyone who loves to experience Europe."
European Wonder
"As a solo traveller, it was one the most memorable experience of my life and I made a lot of friends. Everything about the tour was fantastic and I will definitely go on a Contiki tour again."
