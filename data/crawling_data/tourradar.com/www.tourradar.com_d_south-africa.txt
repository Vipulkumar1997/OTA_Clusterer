Tips
There are 11 official languages spoken in South Africa.  English is spoken widely in most places.
South Africa's unit of currency is the Rand.  ATM’s are easy to find and credit cards are widely accepted.
Tipping between 10 and 15% is common practice.
Don’t leave South Africa without a bottle of Amarula, a Mohair sweater and some Rooibos Tea.
Try the national dish of Bobtotie!   Tap water is safe in cities but drink bottled water elsewhere.
Dress in casual layers.  Evenings can be cooler so bring a light jacket.
Don’t sit closer than 2 meters from person of the opposite sex if you’re wearing only a swimsuit.  It’s illegal!
The world’s first heart transplant was performed in South Africa.
South Africa Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"This Africa tour was amazing. Some of the highlights were the cheese and wine tasting, canoeing in the wilderness, the great accommodation and the tour guide (Maudy) was awesome as he gave us information about the Garden Route and the history of South Africa. It was such a memorable experience."
Garden Route and Cape Winelands
"I am grateful to be part of the tour. The five amazing days I spent in South Africa was very memorable. The tour guides were great and fun. The accommodation was superb and the vegetarian food and desserts were one of the best I've had on the trip."
