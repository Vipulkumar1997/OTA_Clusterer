Highlights
Capture all the romanticism of an African safari, as you catch a glimpse of predators roaming through the sprawling grasslands of the Serengeti National Park, in Tanzania.
Inhale the tantalizing aroma of fresh spices, during a visit to a spice plantation on the palm fringed spice islands of Zanzibar.
Observe the graceful ways of rhinos and gaze at thousands of cackling pink flamingos, at the magnificent Lake Nakuru National Park, in Kenya.
Enjoy the musical symphony of trumpeting elephants and roaring lions at the Maasai Mara National Reserve.
Get up, close and personal with mountain gorillas, in the lush tropical forests of Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park.
Spend a moment in silence at the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre in Rwanda.
Walk by fascinating ibexes and gelada baboons, during a memorable trek through the impressive Simien Mountains, in the heart of Ethiopia’s highlands.
Spend an exciting night in a tent, overlooking the ancient Meroe pyramids in the fabled land of Sudan.
Tips
You can shop for souvenirs such as beaded jewellery and traditional Maasai red checked blankets in Kenya.
Visit during the months of July to October to see the dramatic annual wildebeest migration into Kenya.
Try some Tanzanian cuisine which includes the ubiquitous ‘Ugali’, which is a maize meal porridge and ‘Nyama Choma’ or barbequed meat.
Learn up terms such as ‘Jambo’ meaning ‘Hello’, and ‘Habari Yako’ meaning ‘How are you’ in Swahili, while in Tanzania.
Try the thick and sweet traditional Ethiopian coffee, which is normally served in small cups.
If you’re in the mood to go swimming and fishing, then head towards Sudan’s Red Sea Coast.
Stay with your group and avoid straying away from the trail, while you observe habituated gorilla communities in the Volcanoes National Park, in Rwanda.
