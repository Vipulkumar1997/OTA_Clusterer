Highlights
Enjoy Cardiff, the capital city, where centers of rich cultural heritage sit snugly alongside outstanding monuments of contemporary life.
Explore the stunning beauty of splendid waterfalls, moorlands, mountain vistas, secret caves and plunging coastlines at Snowdonia National Park, Pembrokshire Coast National Park and Brecon Beacons National Park.
Get a glimpse of Roman fortresses, monasteries and other relics of ancient Celtic culture. See history come alive before your eyes as you see magnificent castles strewn across the countryside.
Climb up Mount Snowdon, the highest mountain peak in Wales. Bounce on a cave trampoline or hurtle through the air on a mile long zip line in Zip World.
Go down an old unused coal mine and learn more about its contribution to the Industrial Revolution.
Get ready to be serenaded by the soothing harmonies of a choral choir practice session in South Wales.
Hike or trek your way across Offa’s Dyke National Trail on the border separating Wales from Britain.
Feel rejuvenated as you swim in the choppy waters of Pembrokeshire surrounded by the rugged beauty of towering cliffs.
Tips
Learn a few basic phrases in Welsh such as ‘Bore Da’ which means ‘Good Morning’.
Try some of the delicious local cuisine including laverbread, Welsh rabbit and roast lamb. Your tour guide will help you find the best restaurants in town.
Get a taste of some real ale, the famous Wrexham lager and Penderyn Whisky at the local pub.
Don’t refer to the Welsh people as English since they have a great sense of individuality and ethnic pride.
Be prepared to encounter dramatically changing weather - a sunny day may soon turn into a gale, blizzard or a chilling fog.
If you love special events and festivals, attend the Hay Festival of Literature and Arts or the Brecon Jazz Festival.
Be careful not to use the term ‘taffy’ which is a slur and would be considered offensive.
Avoid asking intimate or personal questions as privacy is highly regarded in Wales.
