Canada Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"I loved our trip to the Canadian Rockies. It was such a fun and amazing adventure made possible by our wonderful guide, Matt. The memories were simply priceless. I had a fantastic trip, indeed!"
Canadian Rockies Active Escape
"The Canada trip was superb! Our group had fun and bonded a lot with the jam packed activities. Exploring the wonderful scenery in Jasper and Banff with Nick, our tour leader, was awesome. The places we stayed were of great value, too! I certainly recommend this to anyone who wants to see the beauty of the Rockies, a hassle-free trip where you can just simply relax and bond with your family and friends."
Canadian Blt
"For the last 30 years of leading hundreds of expeditions, I can say that the Canadian Arctic is beyond compare. I truly cherished the time I had snorkeling with the Polar Bears, Belugas and Narwhal, and camping over the frozen sea.Their accommodation comes with a hot shower, electricity, and a comfortable bed and outstanding staff members. It was totally worth it. I can’t wait to go back."
