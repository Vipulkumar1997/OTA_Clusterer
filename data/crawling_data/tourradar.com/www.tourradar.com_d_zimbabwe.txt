Highlights
Hear the mighty roar of the powerful Victoria Falls and get a glimpse from different vantage points, which include a bird’s eye view from a helicopter.
Participate in adventurous activities such as white water rafting along the Zambezi River, explore the surrounding bush land on the back of an elephant and go bungee jumping off the Victoria Falls Bridge.
Explore Zimbabwean township life at Chinotimba near Victoria Falls.
Drive through the sun washed grasslands of the Hwange National Park to spot friendly elephants and enjoy sightings of rare African wild dogs and black and white rhinos at the Matobo National Park.
Marvel at the rich cultural heritage on display at the National History Museum at Bulawayo and marvel at the beauty of ancient Bushman paintings in the Matobo Hills.
Explore the mysterious ruins of an ancient city state at the Great Zimbabwe National Monument.
Get a hands-on experience caring for young animals and assisting in the general management of the Bulawayo Wildlife Sanctuary.
Help in the rehabilitation of cubs born to captive bred lions as a part of the Victoria Falls Lion Rehabilitation Project.
Tips
The dry season from May to October offers great opportunities to see wildlife, while the wet season from November to April is great for photography as the stunning landscape comes to life during this period.
Bulawayo’s colorful curio market near Old Town Hall is a great place to bargain and shop for batik fabric and handicrafts.
Consider a combined tour of Zambia and Zimbabwe to experience the complete grandeur of the Victoria Falls.
If you have time, go see the massive baobab, nicknamed the ‘Big Tree’, located near the Falls.
Sample some local cuisine specialties like wild mushroom soup (Nhedzi) and small dried fish served with maize meal (Kapenta).
Always follow the guide’s lead and adhere to all precautions, instructions and warnings while on safari.
When volunteering, always listen to the project manager’s instructions and keep them informed about your whereabouts.
Try to learn a little of the native language and adapt to the local culture in order to make the most of this life changing experience.
