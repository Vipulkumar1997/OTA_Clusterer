Highlights
Gaze at the ancient beauty of the towering Giza pyramids, and the enigmatic Great Sphinx.
Enjoy a mesmerizing sunset, as you float effortlessly on the therapeutic waters of the Dead Sea in Jordan.
Travel back in time, as you visit the many Biblical sites strewn around the sacred Sea of Galilee, in Israel.
Marvel at beautiful bell towers, golden domes and remarkable minarets, as you explore relics of multiple faiths, in the holy quarters of the Jerusalem Old Town.
Shop for trinkets, aromatic spices and frankincense in the intricate alleyways of the busy Muttrah Souk, in Oman.
Go on a trekking adventure through the gorgeous Hatta canyon in the United Arab Emirates, and relax near one of the refreshing pools to rejuvenate your body and soul.
Enjoy traditional Bedouin hospitality and sleep under a blanket of stars, deep in the deserts of Qatar.
Listen to the eloquent silence that surrounds the ancient stairways and deserted columns, that form the magnificent Persepolis archaeological ruins in Iran.
Tips
Remember a few Arabic phrases such as ‘As-salaam-alaykum’ for ‘Hello’, and ‘Shukran’ for ‘Thank you’.
You can shop for Persian rugs, dried fruits and nuts in Iranian shops and souks.
Try Egyptian street food specialties, such as shawarma rolls (pita bread stuffed with shredded meat), and kushari (a mixture of rice, macaroni, humus, vegetables and lentils).
The ancient ruins of Petra, carved from red sandstone cliffs in Jordan, look spectacular at sunset so don’t rush back to your hotel too soon.
Don’t miss the annual nesting season of green sea turtles, between July and October at Ras al Jinz in Oman.
You can shop for a variety of fabric and clothing in Qatar’s Doha Souq.
Shop for tax free, luxury brands in Dubai, and visit malls such as the Mall of the Emirates and Dubai Mall, especially during the annual Dubai Shopping Festival.
Quench your thirst with seasonal fruit juices to prevent dehydration, as the temperatures soar in summer.
