Netherlands Tours and Trips 2017/2018
43 trips through Netherlands with 6 reviews
Touring through Netherlands by bike is easy as a lot of the terrain is flat and (unbelievably) below sea level. Medieval cities and straw roofed farmhouses abound the countryside. A must-see in Amsterdam is the Van Gogh Museum, and a trip to the cheese markets in Edam is another.

Highlights
Feel the romance as you explore Amsterdam’s wonderful canals, halt at major museums and art galleries and discover the charms of the little streets that line the waterways.
Enjoy the dazzling floral beauty of the Keukenhof Gardens which houses the largest open air flower show on earth featuring endless rows of colorful tulips, hyacinth and daffodils.
Take in the beauty of dense woodlands at the Hoge Veluwe National Park and come face to face with roe deer and amazing birds.
See the largest concentration of fantastically preserved windmills in the region of Kinderdijk.
Follow the cheese trail in the towns of Gouda and Edam, learn how to make world famous cheese and visit the Friday cheese market at Alkmaar.
Cycle beside quiet lakes, stop at historic towns such as Leiden and Haarlem and soak up quintessential Dutch atmosphere in the regions of Green Heart.
Breathe in the essence of the Dutch Golden Age in the old maritime town of Hoorn.
Explore the stately rooms inside the spectacular Kaasteel de Haar and admire the gardens surrounding this fairytale castle.
Tips
King’s Day held on April 27th every year is a day of celebration and a fantastic opportunity to see Dutch culture firsthand.
Cycling is the most popular way to discover the delights of the Dutch countryside. However, be prepared for gusty winds, especially during the winter season.
The Tulip Gardens at Keukenhof really come to life by the end of March and during the months of April and May.
Porcelain costume dolls, miniature windmills, wooden clogs and Dutch gin are some popular souvenirs that you can buy.
Amsterdam has a very liberal night scene that can be a real eye opener for the uninitiated.
Netherlands has plenty of restaurants that feature excellent Indonesian cuisine, a legacy of Dutch colonialism.
Avoid expansive gestures such as backslapping or hugging as the locals are quite reserved by nature.
Contrary to popular belief, the sale and use of marijuana is only permitted in designated places and in very small quantities.
