The snow-covered Cotopaxi volcano is the highest active volcano in the world, and an overnight climb is one of the many tours available in Ecuador. Another is a visit to the eerie Cloud Forest of Mindo, and not to be missed is a day at the Otavolo markets.

Highlights
Go on a cruise around the enchanting Galapagos Islands and spy upon giant sea turtles, iguanas, penguins and other unique wild life.
Enjoy an evening cocktail in your rustic style cabaña while you take in the sights and sounds of the remote Amazon jungle.
Feel the adrenalin rush through your body as you indulge in some exhilarating mountain biking down the Cotopaxi Volcano.
Satisfy your thirst for adventure by white water rafting and trekking through a cloud forest in wild and wet Banos.
Catch a glimpse of the elusive pink river dolphin or take a night canoe ride to spot caimans.
Have your picture taken with one foot on either hemisphere when you visit the Equator that passes through Ecuador.
Walk around the culturally charming town of Cuenca, replete with cathedrals and churches.
Buy beautiful tapestries at Otavalo, South America’s biggest indigenous crafts market.
Tips
Take a few days to get acclimatized to the high altitude of Quito before attempting any strenuous activity.
Get the latest travel advice before travelling to areas that have active volcanoes. Your guide will let you know the best time to travel to these locations.
If you wish to sample local cuisine, try Tamales, Hornado, Musgaratas, Cuy and Ceviche.
If you’re speaking to a police officer, refer to him as ‘Mi Sargento’. It shows respect.
Walking around Guayaquil after dark is not recommended.
Avoid eating raw food or salads and carry bottled water. Further, use a high grade sun block as UV radiation is very high even when it’s cloudy.
If you get into an argument with an Ecuadorian, avoid raising your voice or gesticulating.
Get vaccinated against typhoid before you travel to Ecuador.
Ecuador Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"Visiting Ecuador was great and enlightening. The trip gave us everything that we hoped to see. The islands were breathtaking and the culture was fascinating. Even though there were some issues with the weather for the first 2-3 days, we still enjoyed what the islands had to offer. The tour leader (Randy) did great as he tried to accommodate everyone's needs and gave alternatives to those who do not want to join the main expeditions. The trip showed us the lifestyle of the locals, we saw the local transportation and cuisine and even did some shopping accross the towns. It was such an amazing experienced but it would have been better if we could spend more time on those incredible destinations especially on Santa Cruz Island."
Galapagos on the cheap
"Being part of the Galapagos adventure in an 8-cabin catamaran was such a cozy and intimate experience. We had a small group which made us feel comfortable by receiving personal attention and an action packed itinerary. The highlights of the trip were some of the activities we had which made us feel closer to the wildlife in the Galapagos. We did snorkeling, short hikes, swimming with sea lions, sting rays, turtles, sharks, giant tortoises, blue footed boobies and we did so much more. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and enthusiastic, the staff on our floating home were superb as they provided us with every attention we needed and served delicious meals. I highly recommend this tour to those who wants to have an adventure of a lifetime."
Galapagos Islands Cruise (Comfort)
"The Galapagos adventure I took was fantasic. The accommodation was basic but it was adequate. I would recommend this trip to anyone who loves to experience Galapagos."
