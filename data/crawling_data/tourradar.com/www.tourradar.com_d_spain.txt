Highlights
Get messy at the Tomatina Festival, with more than one hundred metric tons of over-ripe tomatoes.
Watch the fearless (or foolish) adventurers who try to survive the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona.
See all the foot stomping, castanet rattling, and hand clapping flamenco you can handle in Seville.
Rest up before hitting the party island of Ibiza.  Be ready for all-night parties, world class DJ’s, the hippest bars and spectacular beaches.
Visit the striking mountaintop monastery of Montserrat, before heading into the Penedès wine country.
Cheer for the city’s premier team, Real Madrid, at Bernabéu Stadium.
Stroll down one of Europe’s best pedestrian malls, La Rambla in Barcelona.
Bike your way through the picturesque Rioja wine region before spending the night at
an aristocratic mansion.
Tips
Don’t forget about Spanish siesta!  You might be ready to shop and eat but everything’s closed!
Spanish is the official language of Spain.  Know a few phrases before you arrive.
Spain uses the euro (€) as its currency.  Credit cards are widely accepted and there are more the 45 000 ATM’s.
Tap water is safe to drink in major cities, but stick to bottled water elsewhere.
A dirty floor in a bar can actually be a good sign!  It’s acceptable to throw things on the ground in bars.
Tipping is not common in Spain.  Leaving between 5-15% is more than acceptable.
While visiting Spain go with a ‘smart casual’ look.  The Spanish are stylish and pay particular attention to personal grooming and shoes.
Don’t leave Spain without leather goods, saffron, and a Paella Pan.
Spain Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"Our self guided bike tour of Mallorca was really fun. It’s our third time with Pure Adventures and this is the most challenging bike tour among the three. The towns around the island were lovely, they had excellent shopping, food and wine. The sad thing is that we didn’t get to spend any time on the beach. This might be a good addition to this trip."
Spain - Mallorca Road Bike 6-night cycling
"I would like to express my gratitude for booking our recent bike tour in Spain. It was more than what I expected it to be. I commend how fantastic and well organized it was. Bo, our orientation guide in Girona, was simply excellent. I would definitely consider another Pure Adventures trip in the future, I highly recommend this to my friends!"
Spain - Catalonia Gastronomic 5 Nights
"We utterly enjoyed our first bike tour. There were no dull moments as day rides were highly organized with lots of interesting places to stop and enjoy. The hotels were as impressive as their menus, their tour guides were very helpful, and  their guide mapswere extremely detailed. I am looking forward to another tour."
