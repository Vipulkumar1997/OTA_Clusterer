Tips
The currency in India is called the Indian Rupee.  Credit cards might not always be accepted.
There are 22 official languages in India.  English is commonly used and understood throughout.
Always drink bottled water.  Be careful of spicy foods, especially if you’re not used to it.
Dress modestly.  Shorts and short skirts are offensive to many.Be prepared for very cold winters and veryhot summers.
Tipping is very common in India.  Keep small bills on hand.
Don’t leave India without a set of gold bangles, spices and Darjeeling tea.
Kissing and embracing are regarded in India as part of sex: do not do them in public. It’s not even a good idea for couples to hold hands.
India produces a staggering 4,700 daily papers!
India Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"This wonderful tour was a great introduction to India, especially for a solo traveller. Thr tour guide did an incredible job. Although the accommodations were average to below average because some issuess were with wifi and hot showers, there was definitely room for a higher level of accomodation. A more authentic Indian tasting experience is recommended. Overall the trip was good especially for first time travellers in India and I have made memories to last a lifetime."
North India Social Club
"The India experience was amazing and excellent in all levels. Some of the sceneries were breathtaking like the Taj Mahal, sunrise/sunset trip to Ganges, the flower ceremony, the Orcha Palace, Kama Sutra Temples and Amber Fort. The food and people were also great."
North India Highlights
"I had a splendid time in India. Some of the highlights of the trip were the accommodation and transportation were modern and comfortable, I adore the food and the culture, the tour guide was amazing and most of all the views were breathtaking especially the Taj Mahal."
