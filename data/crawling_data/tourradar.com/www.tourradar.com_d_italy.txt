Highlights
Follow the footsteps of Julius Caesar as you walk through the Roman Forum and the Colosseum in Rome
Marvel at the craftsmanship behind the elaborate masks of the Carnival festival in Venice
Be swept away by the beautiful rolling hills of Tuscany while enjoying wine from some of the world’s best vineyards
Sink your toes in the sandy white beaches of Sicily before treating yourself to a night of dancing and cocktails at the open air beach bars.
Spoil your inner shutterbug at the spectacular cliff hugging villages of Cinque Terre in the Italian Riviera
Visit Michelangelo’s famous sculpture of David before taking in the shop-lined Ponte Vecchio bridge in Florence
Shop ‘til you drop in the fashion capital of Milan before hitting the raging club scene until 4am
Stuff yourself silly with all the pizza, pasta, gelato and wine you can handle in this YOLO paradise
Tips
Finding someone who speaks at least rudimentary English won’t be difficult but you’ll find learning a few common phrases in Italian will be greatly appreciated
Italians are impeccably dressed – better to overdress be prepared to cover up for church visits
Don’t be surprised to see many stores closed for 2 hours of “riposo” between 12-4:30pm
Dinner is served later than you might expect – between 7:30-10pm is the norm
Tipping in Italy is not required
Acknowledge people when you enter a shop or a bar with either “buongiorno” ("good morning") or “buona sera” ("good evening")
Practice the Italian two-cheek kiss before you need it – it’s an air kiss (with the kissing noise) planted high on the right cheek and then the left.
Italy is the fourth most visited country in the world!
Italy Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"I had an eye opener and an amazing experience during my in trip in Italy. We had a knowledgeable and enthusiastic tour guide. Kent a true Mr Gadget, extremely patient with our constant stream of silly questions and trivial needs. Because he is originally from the UK he has a good understand of both our Western culture and the culture of Italy, and can explain why things are how they are in a context that Australians, Americans etc can understand. The tour took us to family owned, authentic Italian restaurants and hotels, and uses public transport where possible we were not isolated from the true Italy."
Italy Uncovered
"Our  5 day self guided bike tour in Italy was amazing. As expected, the accommodations were good. We stayed at the Trulli house in Alberobello. Ate a lot because the food and wine were perfect. We had a spectaculer ride through the back roads with grapes on one side and olive trees on the other. I had a pleasure working with two fantastic women in the States and in Italy (Ryan and Ali). I also had a 5 star customer service experience with Ryan since she booked the trip for us. I would do another self guided bike ride with Pure Adventures in a heartbeat!"
Italy - Puglia 8 Nights
"My tour in Italy was great, I wished to stay abit longer in some places like sorrento - Positano, venice. I also have some suggestions to either cut out some destinations or extend the trip and pick a central location for the accommodation. Adding more night life would be good, the karaoke needs to be scrapped from the activity list. I don't do a tour to be taken to a karaoke bar to mix with other tour groups etc. I want to mix with local people. It was a shame that there was not much choice on the dinner and it was average. I would like to eat a variety of food aside from pasta. However, I would still recommend this tour as it showcased many places in Italy. I would like to go back to and explore many places."
