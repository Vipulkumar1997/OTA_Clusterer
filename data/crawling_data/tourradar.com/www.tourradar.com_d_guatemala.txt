Highlights
Discover Mayan hospitality with a home stay in the lakeside town of Panajachel.
Add some thrill to your holiday with a trek up the active Pacaya Volcano.
Be one with nature as you gaze upon the mind-blowing limestone formations in the Kamba caves.
Spend the day enjoying the nature and beauty of the Languin Caves in the Semuc Champey National Park or go for a quick swim in one of the crystal clear natural pools.
Venture into the Peten Jungle in search of Mesoamerica’s largest Mayan pyramid.
Watch the sunset from the peak of an ancient Mayan pyramid after exploring the La Dante temple with your guide at the El Mirador site.
Unwind with water sports, swimming, bird watching or even horseback riding at the tranquil village of Jaibalito, on the shores of Lake Atitlan.
Absorb the sounds of music and the sights of local art and architecture as you walk through the plazas and cobbled streets of the colonial town of Antigua.
Tips
Watch your step while exploring the ruins as there may be missing steps, uneven ground or tree roots on the way.
Keep your eyes open for the rare red and green quetzal which is Guatemala's national bird. You won’t find them in zoos.
Remember to carry an insect repellent as sand fleas and flies can be a bother in the jungle.
Guatemalans are polite and quite reserved, so avoid being aggressive, loud or rude.
Always ask permission before you photograph the Mayan people, especially the children.
If you pass a street performance on a marimba; stop, listen and offer a tip. Tips are their livelihood.
Try and read up on Mayan history before you visit the sites as it will enhance your experience.
Guatemala doesn’t encourage begging, so avoid giving money to people who approach you.
