3 day California tours
Highlights
Experience decadent dining, blissful beach retreats and exhilarating nightlife in Mykonos, the party capital of the Mediterranean.
Ride a scooter past the sun drenched iconic houses and whitewashed villages that cling to Santorini’s cliffs.
Walk the ancient agoras where Socrates once delivered philosophies in what is thought to be the cradle of ancient Western civilization, Athens.
Leave the world behind while exploring fragrant olive groves along Corfu’s gentle slopes in the idyllic seaside destination.
Admire exquisite art treasures in every nook and at every turn in beautiful, timeless Florence.
Sway with the romantic waters of the Grand Canal, as your gondola meanders under ornate bridges and alongside the stunning architectural marvels of ethereal Venice.
Revel in the magical atmosphere of Rome’s Pantheon Temple when brilliantly lit with the colours of a golden Roman sunset.
Unravel Ancona’s secrets in its piazza cafes and hilltop parks, offering sweeping views of the Adriatic.
Tips
If you’re in the mood to party, then head to the beaches of Paradise and Super Paradise in Mykonos.
One of the best ways to explore Mykonos is on a motorbike or scooter.
Try the local Greek speciality taramasalata, a creamy fish roe dip that goes well with bread or potato.
At tavernas it is quite common to share food at the table so don’t be surprised if other diners dip their bread into a common dish.
Besides pizza, try some of Italy’s finest offerings such as bigoli, ribollita, tortellini en brodo and osso buco.
When shopping in Italy, avoid buying counterfeit goods as it is punishable with a hefty fine.
Pack light clothes if you’re planning a trip to Greece during the summer months as it can get very hot.
Avoid eating or drinking and remember to dress modestly when visiting churches in Rome and the Vatican City
