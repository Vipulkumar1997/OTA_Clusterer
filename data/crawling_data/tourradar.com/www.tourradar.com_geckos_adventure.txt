About Geckos Adventures
Geckos has made group travel for young people accessible again - eating local food, traveling with like minded travelers aged 18-29, and getting true local experiences. Taking the local public transport, sleeping in family run accommodation, and seeing places that the mainstream tourists never even knew existed - all this plus plenty of free time along the way. By ensuring not to impact the local communities and places they visit, Geckos aims to give an insiders view, while using local guides to show the cultures and places.

Geckos Adventures Benefits
Local Group Leaders
By travelling with Geckos, you will have access to local group leaders. This means they were born in and grew up in the places you will be visiting. Local, street level knowledge like this will help you get access to the best food in town, finding the unknown swimming holes, or the obscure modern art gallery that no one knows about. Your group leaders are there not just to be tour guides, by also your new friends and a part of the group. This means you will be able to find out more, eat more, and get a authentic experience, just be spending the time with them and asking them the questions!
Solo Travelers Welcome
By having such great guides, combined with the small groups, it means that travelling on your own is no problem - it is how most of the travelers in the group do it! Even if you are a solo traveler - Geckos will generally pair you up with a travel partner, so there is no extra cost to you. Even if you do want a room to yourself, that can normally be arranged for a small extra cost.
Authentic Local Experiences
By travelling in a small group, it means you get more authentic experiences - local transport, homestays, and small, out of the way places. While Geckos also will show you the main sights and attractions, by being part of a small group it means there is the opportunity to go places big groups can’t. When it comes to getting on and off buses, bikes, boats, trains, ferries, gondolas, eating hawker foods from back alleys, and going places without hurting the local environment, traveling in a small group definitely has its benefits.
Why Geckos Adventures
Ages 18-29
Geckos has trip options for just for 18-29 year olds. All Gecko’s trips are suitable for those who have a sense of adventure, an open mindset, and those are willing to step outside of their comfort zone. Adventures along the way might include ordering off the local menu, jumping in a tuk-tuk or simply just making new friends, language barriers and all. Geckos is there to explore and for those wanting to travel - not for tourists.
Affordable Travel Experiences
By providing trips that are affordable, Geckos wants everyone to be able to see and experience new sights and cultures across the world. Geckos have already “been there done that”, and because you are travelling with a group, the cost is shared among the group, so you can get the most for your travel dollar.
Small Group Travel
By travelling with Geckos, you will be a part of a small group - getting to know the other travelers who will become lifelong friends, as opposed to a large group of strangers who happen to be in the same place at the same time. This is so important to what Geckos stands for, their symbol is Native American crossed arrows; a symbol of friendship.
