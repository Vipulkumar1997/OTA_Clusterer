Highlights
Visit the ancient desert fortress city of Ben Haddou in Draa Valley that was used as a backdrop for legendary Hollywood movies like Gladiator, Lawrence of Arabia and Jewel of the Nile.
Discover the hidden delights of a Bedouin camp in the deserts of Merzouga. Savor a magical sunset and dine under the stars while enjoying a musical performance by a local band.
Explore hundreds of years of history as you tour the important imperial cities of Rabat, Fes, Marrakesh and Meknes.
Get the perfect tan while sunbathing at the beach resorts of Agadir and Essaouira. Try kayaking, water boarding and windsurfing for water sports.
Hike into the High Atlas Mountains, enjoy the lush forest area and the sight of Berber homes as you make your way towards the summit.
Walk through cosmopolitan Casablanca, marveling at the stunning art deco buildings before heading to see the glory of the King Hussain II Mosque.
Have a unique sensory experience in Fes, watching the dyeing skills of tanners on display as they use age old techniques to soak and dye skins.
Feel the unique pulse of Africa in the mythical Djemaa el Fna square of Marrakesh where snake charmers, acrobats and story tellers breathe in the sweet aromas of spices wafting through the air.
Tips
Do not drink or eat in public during the holy month of Ramadan. Remember, many restaurants and cafes may be closed during the day.
Fill your pockets with loose change as tipping is an important part of Moroccan life.
Always check with your tour guide before you enter a mosque as most of them do not allow foreigners.
Sample some delicious local cuisine such as couscous, kefta and tangine.
It is considered highly disrespectful to drink in view of a mosque.
Use your right hand when you eat or when you greet someone. Do not use your left hand especially when eating communal food.
Bargain your way through souks as this is an intrinsic part of Moroccan culture.
As a woman traveling alone, you can try to ignore unwanted public attention or threaten to call the police to ward off pesky teasers.
Morocco Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"The Morocco tour was terrific. It was an awesome experience , we covered a lot of ground. The tour guide (Abdoul) was amazing as he was keen to details on the trip and kept the people pumped up for the next adventure. The visit to the towns of the Kasbahs, the Berber Villages, desert jeeps rides, tent camping and the beach towns were extraordinary. The tour our exceeded my expectations and I reccommend to do some weather research prior to joining the trip. Once you finish the tour, I guarantee you'll be excited to plan the next one."
Adventure Morocco
"Visiting Morocco during Ramadan was very interesting. Our tour guide (Samir) gave us an opportunity to learn a lot and really respect the dedication of the people who participated. The scenery was astounding as is it so vast and beautiful that I coudn't take enough pictures. The food was amazing and overall it was an unforgettable experience."
Best of Morocco
"During my trip to Morocco, our tour guide (Idris) was very friendly, approachable and helpful. We had a large group but having a larger bus gave us plenty of opportunity to spread out during th tour. The tour was absolutely fantastic."
