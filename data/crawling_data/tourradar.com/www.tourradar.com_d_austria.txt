Highlights
Take a stroll through glorious Habsburg palaces and interesting museums in the gorgeous city of Vienna.
Admire stunning Baroque architecture and pay homage to Mozart’s musical genius in Salzburg.
Feel the breeze as you pedal around the stunning Wachau countryside and stop to admire beautiful castles, elegant Benedictine abbeys and ancient vineyards that dot the hillside villages.
Swim in crystal-clear lakes, breathe in crisp mountain air and explore charming market towns during a visit to the Salzkammergut region.
Hike through floral scented landscapes to reach the icy beauty of Dachstein’s subterranean caves.
Delve into magnificent medieval architecture and indulge in mouth-watering Austrian cuisine at Innsbruck, in the heart of the Austrian Alps.
Experience excitement and adrenaline as you ski or snowboard over acres of untouched, freshly powdered trails at Tirol’s world renowned ski resorts.
Wander through festive Christmas markets, enjoy sleigh rides and sip on warm mulled wine during the magical winter season.
Tips
A train journey through the Salzkammergut region is the best way to enjoy Austrian scenery of lush meadows, picturesque valleys, dense forests and mountain lakes.
Spend a relaxing afternoon digging into some delicious cake and pudding at one of the local coffeehouses.
Sip on Austrian white wines such as Riesling and Veltliner.
Buy souvenirs such as chinaware, handbags and glassware.
Try and attend the Sunday Mass at Vienna’s famous Hofburg Palace.
Book tickets to watch an opera, cabaret or theatre performance to experience Vienna’s varied nightlife.
To cool off spend some time hanging out at beer gardens during the summer.
If you're looking to hit the slopes, head to St. Anton am Arlberg as it offers unbelievable ski terrain.
While visiting Austria, remember to address the gentlemen as ‘Herr’ and the ladies as ‘Frau’.
Austria Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"My Austria ski trip was absolutely wonderful. The group of about 25 travellrs were mainly Aussies and South Africans. There was a great balance of proper skiing and decent nightlife and there was never a dull moment. Our tour guide (Jackie) was also brilliant as she was helpful and accommodating."
Ski Austria
"Our Vienna tour was marvelous. It was a tour we took last 2005 receommended by family friends. I was concerned about the bike ride but it was much easier that I thought it was since the bike path was easy. Our lunch stop was fun as well as the wines and wineries."
The Grape Escape Small Group Wine Tasting Bike Tour to the Wachau Valley
"My Austria trip was the best holiday I've ever had. The views were breathtaking with a minute walk to the town center. Alpenrider is a MUST-go holiday!"
