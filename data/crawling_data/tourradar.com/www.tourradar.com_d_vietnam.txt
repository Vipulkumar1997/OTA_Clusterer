Highlights
Visit pagodas and Buddhist monasteries as you wander through the streets of Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Hoi An.
Visit the tomb of Khai Dinh and Cao Dai Temple; take a look at precious paintings and vibrant mosaics to get a glimpse into the grandeur of Vietnam’s royal past.
Relax on idyllic beaches along the 2000 mile coastline, explore underground rivers or dive in Nha Trang waters.
Tour the mystical Mekong Delta, a labyrinth of waterways to see mangrove swamps, rice paddy fields and to shop at quaint floating markets.
Revisit Vietnam’s war legacy by crawling through the Cu Chi tunnel network that once symbolized Vietnam’s tenacity.
Have the adventure of a lifetime as you walk with hill tribes through the remote mountain regions of Sapa.
Enjoy a home cooked meal and some home brewed rice wine prepared by a Vietnamese family in a home stay.
Be mesmerized by Hoi Na’s beauty at night, replete with markets, lanterns and boat rides on the Perfume River.
Tips
Remember to watch out for jelly fish off the coast of North Vietnam during the months of June to August and in South Vietnam during the months of August to September.
Be very careful when you cross the road in Ho Chi Minh City as traffic can be quite chaotic.
If you’re visiting a local, you can bring sweets, incense, flowers or fruit as a gift.
Dress conservatively while visiting pagodas and temples as a mark of respect to Vietnamese culture.
Avoid pointing your feet at the family altar while sitting with a Vietnamese family.
If you’re visiting an ethnic tribal village, avoid taking your video camera with you.
Try some Vietnamese coffee as it has lovely flavors of mocha and hickory.
Try the local delicacies including ‘Pho’ the world famous rice noodle soup, Ca Kho To (a fish dish prepared in a clay pot) and fresh spring rolls.
Vietnam Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"I had a great Vietnam adventure. There were a great mix of people on the tour. Andy helped me to step out of my comfort zone as I try new things and got great incouragement which made me want to do more. I had great memories and enjoyed every milestone. It would have been nice to stay a bit longer in Ha Long Bay and less night in Hanoi. I would highly recommend this tour and this is a great experince for solo travellers."
Vietnam Adventure (from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City)
"We were a bit nervous upon joining the tour but as it turned out, we had a splendid experince in Vietnam and the best holiday we've ever had. There were a great bunch of people on the tour but what made the trip memorable was our tour guide. Tan made everyone fell like we were one big family and he loves his country by telling us all about it. We are already planning our next Intrepid Tour."
Vietnam Express Southbound
"I had a memorable first time experience in Vietnam. I was unsure what to expect since it was my first time to travel overseas. The tour guide was lovely and had a great knowledge of the country. The accommodations were of good quality and were always clean. I would recommend intrepid and the Vietnam discovery to anyone who likes to travel."
