Account Registration
For Operators - Tour operators that wish to take advantage of TourRadar services and sell their tours on the TourRadar.com Global Marketplace need to first submit their application via the
tour operator sign up form
. TourRadar reviews all sign up requests and assesses the compatibility of the tour operators' product with the TourRadar.com Marketplace. This review process can take up to 2 weeks as the product, company, market fit, bonding, safety and global reputation of the company is assessed. Upon reviewing the sign up request the TourRadar team informs the operator whether or not working together is possible. TourRadar reserves the right to decline the application at this stage, or any other, stage. If the first screening is positive, the operator will be asked to fill out a application form and submit it to the TourRadar team. Once this form is accepted, processed and the application is confirmed by TourRadar, TourRadar will guide the operator through the next sign up steps, which includes uploading tour listings, installation of tools like Facebook Applications and assists the operator wherever possible. Before TourRadar can start driving bookings for the operator, the operator must agree to TourRadar Terms and Conditions in writing via e-mail.

performs regular backups on all servers to ensure critical files are never lost. However TourRadar is NOT responsible for lost data, time, income or any other resource due to faulty backups or non-existent backups. Please always backup your own data for Redundancy.
Group Tour Listings
Operators may create Listings. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Group Tour to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, itinerary, features, availability of the Group Tour and pricing and related rules and financial terms. Operators working with TourRadar are responsible for making sure that their tour listings on the TourRadar.com Marketplace are up-to-date so that travellers who wish to book their tours are presented with correct information. Tour operators are responsible for updating their tour information - either manually using the TourRadar Dashboard, or by supplying the TourRadar team with a fully functional XML feed. Alternatively tour operators can also provide TourRadar with their TourCMS ID and connect using their API. TourRadar reserves the right to specify the details of the XML feed setup and to decline XML feeds that do not meet the TourRadar standard. In such cases, it is the sole responsibility of the operator to provide a satisfactory XML feed or to keep the tour listings up-to-date manually. Listings will be made publicly available via the Services. Other Members will be able to book your Group Tour via the Services based upon the information provided in your Listing. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Listings you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Listing you post and the booking of, or Traveller taking of, an Group Tour in a Listing you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties (such as any agreements with or rules of employers or local tourism agencies) and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Group Tour included in a Listing you post, including, but not limited to, tourism, tour guide licensing laws, and other laws governing events and tours of public spaces and other venues and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that TourRadar assumes no responsibility for an Operator's compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations. TourRadar reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Listing for any reason, including Listings that TourRadar, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Services. You understand and agree that TourRadar does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for you as an Operator. If a Traveller requests a booking of your Group Tour and participates in your Group Tour, any agreement you enter into with such Traveller is between you and the Traveller and TourRadar is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TourRadar serves as the limited authorized agent of the Operator for the purpose of accepting payments from the Traveller on behalf of the Operator and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Operator, subject to these Terms. When you create a Listing, you may also choose to include certain requirements, which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Group Tour. Any Member wishing to book Group Tours included in Listings with such requirements must meet these requirements. You acknowledge and agree that, as an Operator, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who are present during the Group Tour at your request or invitation, excluding the Traveller. TourRadar recommends that Operators obtain appropriate insurance for their Group Tours. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Group Tour carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Travellers while participating in your Group Tour.
No Endorsement
TourRadar does not endorse any Members or any Group Tours. In addition, although these Terms require Members to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member's purported identity. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you contact via the Services. We will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members. By using the Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from TourRadar with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members via the Services regarding any bookings or Listings made by you. This limitation shall not apply to any claim by an Operator against TourRadar regarding the remittance of payments received from a Traveller by TourRadar on behalf of an Operator, which instead shall be subject to the limitations described in the section below entitled "Limitation of Liability".
Bookings and Financial Terms for Operators
If you are an Operator and a booking is requested for your Group Tour via the Services, you will be required to either confirm or decline the booking using TourRadar's Messaging System within the specified timeframe (which is generally within 48 hours of when the booking is requested, as determined by TourRadar in its sole discretion) or the booking request will be automatically cancelled. If you are unable to confirm or decide to decline a booking of an Group Tour within the specified timeframe, any amounts collected by TourRadar for the requested booking will be refunded to the applicable Traveller's credit card and any pre-authorization of such credit card will be released. You understand and agree that once a Traveller requests a booking of your Group Tour, the price for such booking may not be altered after you confirm the booking without first obtaining the Travellers consent which must be done using TourRadar's Messaging System. If you have not yet confirmed the Traveller's booking you can amend the price, details, add discounts, food funds, single supplements and other local payment so long as you advise the Traveller of these changes via the TourRadar Messaging System before you confirm the booking to allow Travellers to consent to your changes. Any attempts to take the conversation or transaction outside TourRadar's Messaging System before a booking has been confirmed my result in suspension or cancellation of your Account. When a booking is requested via the Services, we may share with you the first and last name of the Traveller who has requested the booking in the TourRadar Messaging System. The Deposit amount displayed on the booking page is set by you. Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Group Tour Cost. The Group Tour Cost and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the "Total Cost". The amounts due and payable by a Traveller solely relating to an Operator's Group Tour are the "Group Tour Cost". Please note that it is you and not TourRadar which determines the Group Tour Cost and you agree this Cost will be exactly the same Cost stated on your website. Unless otherwise stated, if the Departure is 60 days or more from the booking date, TourRadar will only collect the Deposit at the time of booking confirmation (i.e. when you confirm the booking within the specified timeframe). Unless otherwise stated, the Balance of Payment (defined as the Group Tour Cost minus the Deposit) will be automatically collected from the Traveller by us, 60 days prior to the departure date. After you confirm a booking, you are responsible for invoicing TourRadar for the original tour price listed in the TourRadar.com tour listing at the point of booking request (which must correspond to the pricing on your website) minus TourRadar's Service fee. TourRadar's Service fee is displayed in your TourRadar Dashboard. Invoices are to be emailed to finance@tourradar.com. Invoices must have a payment due date of the 5th business day of the next calendar month after the tour departure date. Each tour booking must have its own invoice. TourRadar will pay the Net Amount (defined as being the Group Tour Cost minus the Service Fee) to your nominated bank account as long as the payout amount is above â¬500. We are not responsible for delays in remitting Group Tour Fees, which can vary based on the bank, currency, location, etc. We are responsible for emailing the Traveller with a booking receipt for their payments. You are responsible for emailing any documentation and vouchers to the Traveller.
Select tours are packaged by TourRadar and branded as "TourRadar Exclusive". These exclusive offers are limited in time and may only have a single departure date. TourRadar is the managing tour operator for these tours. TourRadar Exclusive works with local ground suppliers, who will be your primary point of contact during the tour. TourRadar Exclusive offers require a depost payment of 20% for all departures where the booking date is 20 days prior to the departure, at which time the full payment will be taken from the credit card provided at the time of booking. All payments are non refundable. All other booking and financial terms for travellers above apply to TourRadar Exclusive offers.
Appointment of TourRadar as Payment Agent for Operator
Each Operator hereby appoints TourRadar as the Operator's limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Travellers on behalf of the Operator. Each Operator agrees that payment made by a Traveller to TourRadar shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to the Operator and the Operator will make the Group Tour available to Traveller in the agreed upon manner as if the Operator has received the Part Payment. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Operator, TourRadar assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Operator. Operators acknowledge and agree that TourRadar reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to introduce and collect other fees from you in accordance with the Modification Section of these Terms. Please note that TourRadar will provide notice of new fees via the Services, prior to implementing such new features.
Bookings and Financial Terms for Travellers
The Operators, not TourRadar, are solely responsible for honouring any confirmed bookings and making available any Group Tours reserved through the Services. If you, as a Traveller, choose to enter into a transaction with an Operator for the booking of a Group Tour, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement (including releases) with the Operator and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Group Tour imposed by the Operator. Operators may not change the Group Tour Cost after a booking has been confirmed unless the Operator asks for your Consent via the TourRadar Messaging System (changes might include additional services that you request from the Operator). If a booking has not yet been confirmed by the Operator, the Operator may change the price, details, add discounts, local payments and other services requested by you but the Operator must notify you of this change via TourRadar's Messaging System and you must consent to this change before the Operator can confirm your booking. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not TourRadar, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that TourRadar is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, TourRadar disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that TourRadar is not a party to any agreements between you and the Operator, TourRadar acts as the Operator's payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Operator. Upon your payment of amounts to TourRadar which are due to the Operator, your payment obligation to the Operator is extinguished, and TourRadar will remit to the Operator the difference between the Group Tour Cost minus the Service Fee (defined below). The secure payment provider that TourRadar uses to process all payments is Braintree. The Booking Page for a Group Tour will specify the Total Cost called the Group Tour Cost. As noted above the Operator is required to either confirm or decline the booking via TourRadar's Messaging System (also known as E2B) within the specified timeframe (which is generally within 48 hours of when the booking is requested, as determined by TourRadar in its sole discretion) or the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Operator), any amounts collected by TourRadar will be refunded to such Traveller, depending on the selections the Traveller makes via the Site and Application, and any pre-authorization of such Traveller's credit card will be released, if applicable, and you acknowledge we will refund these amounts as soon as possible but the speed at which these amounts are returned to your credit card is often something you will need to discuss with our bank and is not something we are responsible for. It is important that all communication is made by you with the Operator using TourRadar's Messaging System because this will help in the event of disputes and TourRadar reserves the right not to rely on emails exchanged by you and the operator. Plus any transaction completed outside the TourRadar Messaging System will not enable you to use TourRadar Travel Credits, savings and other promotional offers. Unless otherwise stated on the tour booking page, you agree to pay TourRadar for the Deposit for any booking requested in connection with your TourRadar Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the applicable Operator if the departure date is greater than 60 days to the booking date. Unless otherwise stated on the tour booking page, if the departure date is within 60 days of the booking date the Group Tour Cost is payable. If you have paid a Deposit then the balance of payment will be automatically deducted from the credit card stored in your Account Profile (unless otherwise stated) 60 days prior to the departure date. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Operator's confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that TourRadar, on behalf of the Operator, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Part Payment and/or (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound) to verify your credit card. Once the Operators confirms your booking, TourRadar will collect the payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. TourRadar also provides a free option to pay by instalments so you can slowly pay down the balance of tour. There is no obligation to pay by instalments but if you do, we will reduce the balance owing each time so that on the due date only the balance, if any, will be charged. The minimum amount you can pay is stated on your booking conversation page. Please note that TourRadar cannot control any fees that may be charged to you by your bank related to TourRadar's collection of payments, and TourRadar disclaims all liability in this regard. In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to TourRadar or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay TourRadar for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your TourRadar Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods as may be described on the Site or Application - e.g. by credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by TourRadar or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the other payment methods as may be described on the Site or Application. If you are directed to TourRadar's third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service and that third party's personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and
privacy policy
before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking and the Operator will email documentation and vouchers to your email address.
Service Fees only apply to Operators
In consideration for providing the Services, TourRadar collects a service fee only from Operators ("Service Fees"). A Service Fee is a percentage of the amount of the Group Tour Cost or the Forfeited Tour Cost (only applicable for tours cancelled by the traveller - see section below) which is defined in the Operator's TourRadar Dashboard. Where applicable, Taxes may also be charged in addition to the Service Fee. Services Fees are deducted from the Group Tour Cost or the Forfeited Tour Cost before remitting the balance to the Operator (please note that we will not be responsible for delays in remitting payouts, which can vary based on the bank, currency, location, etc). Balances over â¬500 will be remitted by TourRadar to Operators via direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site or via the Application, in the Operator's currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Operator makes via the Services. Please note that for any payments by TourRadar, we will pay our bank's costs and you are responsible to pay your bank's costs. If you request a payout when your balance is under â¬500 then you must pay all bank costs. More information on Service Fees can be found in your Dashboard by going to Profile > TourRadar Package. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.
General Booking and Financial Terms Traveller Cancellations, Refunds and Complaints
If, as a Traveller, you cancel your requested booking before the requested booking is confirmed by an Operator, TourRadar will cancel any pre-authorization to your credit card and/or refund any nominal amounts charged to your credit card in connection with the requested booking within a commercially reasonable time (7-10 business days). You agree to pay TourRadar the Deposit for any booking requested in connection with your TourRadar Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the Operator. Once your booking is confirmed by the Operator, your Group Tour is non-refundable. Unless otherwise stated on the booking page of the tour, the following rules shall apply to cancellations & refunds. If you provide notice of cancellation to the Operator prior to 60 days to departure, only your Deposit will be forfeited.Â If you request to cancel a tour between 60-31 days before the departure date 50% of the Group Tour Costs will be forfeited and the balance will be refunded to your credit card within a commerically reasonable time period (usually within 10 working days). If you request to cancel a tour between less than 30 days before the departure date 100% of the Group Tour Costs will be forfeited. This cancellation must be done by sending an email to
booking@TourRadar.com
with the name of the tour you want to cancel and for the reason. Cancellation of transfers, pre and post accommodation, optional tours, singlement supplements are treated differently where if the cancellation is made before 31 days prior to departure we will provide a full refund of those costs. However if cancellation is made within 31 days to departure 100% of these costs will be forfeited. Cancellation of permits will result in the costs being 100% forfeited. Neither TourRadar nor the operators selling their tours on TourRadar.com offer or pay any discounts or refunds for missed or unused services which were missed or unused by the traveller due to no fault of TourRadar, or operators working with TourRadar, which shall include any termination of the traveller's participation in the tour due to the traveller's own fault, negligence or breach of these Terms. All traveller complaints about their experience on tour will be passed onto the tour operator's team to resolve. TourRadar is committed to working with tour operators to achieve a high level of service. If the response time and/or response quality of the tour operator however continue to fall below acceptable timing and quality despite our working together to rectify any issues, TourRadar reserves the right to remove the operators' tour listings from TourRadar.com Marketplace, Affiliate websites, Mobile Apps and remove any Applications provided by us.
Unforeseen Circumstances Operator Cancellations and Refunds
If an Operator cancels a confirmed booking made via the Services, (i) TourRadar will refund any Payment for such booking to the applicable Traveller within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation and (ii) the Traveller may receive an email or other communication from TourRadar containing alternative Listings and other related information. If the Traveller requests a booking from one of the alternative Listings this will be treated like a new group tour booking. If an Operator cancelled a confirmed booking and you, as a Traveller, have not received an email or other communication from TourRadar, please contact TourRadar at
booking@tourradar.com
.
Cancellation in the Event of Inclement Weather
Certain Group Tours may be weather-dependent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of inclement weather, the Operator has the discretion as to whether the weather conditions will prevent the Group Tour from taking place. As an Operator, if you need to cancel an Group Tour for reasons of inclement weather, you must contact the Traveller and TourRadar (at
booking@tourradar.com
) as early as possible. Subject to the Traveller's consent, the Operator and the Traveller may choose to reschedule the Group Tour for another date. If the Group Tour cannot be rescheduled, as a Traveller, please contact TourRadar so we may assist in finding a replacement, non-weather-dependent Group Tour. For clarity, in the event the alternative Group Tour is of a higher price than the former, you may be responsible for any difference in price. In the event the alternative Group Tour is of a lower price, you may be entitled to a partial refund for the difference. As a Traveller, if you have contacted TourRadar as provided above and TourRadar is unable to find you a replacement Group Tour, TourRadar may refund the Payment for such booking to the Traveller within a commercially reasonable time of the cancellation.
Taxes
You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting requirements in consultation with your tax advisors. TourRadar cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members of the Services. Additionally, please note that each Operator is responsible for determining local indirect Taxes and for including any applicable Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in Listings.
Foreign Currency
As part of the Services, TourRadar may provide a feature through which Travellers may view prices for various Listings in foreign currencies. You understand and agree that these views of prices are for informational purposes only and may not be the official local price for the Operator's Listings. If you (as a Traveller) request a booking, you will be notified of the currency in which you will be charged together with the corresponding amount of the Payment, if your booking is confirmed by an Operator. The currency in which you will be charged may be determined by TourRadar based on the payment method you select and the location of the Group Tour in the Listing you are booking. If the currency in which you will be charged is different from the currency chosen by the Operator to receive payment, TourRadar will be responsible for the required currency conversion processing, including the costs thereof, which will be calculated based on the most current applicable foreign exchange rate that TourRadar has uploaded to the Site as of the date and time that your booking is confirmed (the "Applicable Exchange Rate"). You acknowledge that the Applicable Exchange Rate used for currency conversion processing may not be identical to the applicable market rate in effect at the specific time such processing occurs because: (i) although TourRadar would update the Applicable Exchange Rate on a regular basis, it would not update such rate on a real-time basis; and (ii) the Applicable Exchange Rate may include an incremental cost or margin that is not included in the applicable market rate. For the avoidance of doubt, TourRadar would retain any profits (and will bear any losses) that result from such currency conversion processing due to changes in the applicable foreign exchange rate between the date your booking is confirmed and the date TourRadar makes payment to an Operator.
