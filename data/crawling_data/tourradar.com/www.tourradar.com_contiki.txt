The Contiki Story and History
In 1962, a kiwi by the name of John Anderson set off from London in a minibus across Europe to lead the first ever Contiki tour. Initially this was a way to stretch the 25 pounds he had in his pocket - and see Europe at the same time. Being a New Zealander, the company name is derived from the native New Zealand Maori good luck charm, “Tiki”, and the “Con” from continent - for continental Europe.

As the story goes, when John was trying to get back home to New Zealand he tried selling his minibus - only to find out that no one wanted to buy it. The next year, he decided to travel Europe again… and Contiki Holidays was born.

To date, over 2 million young people have travelled with Contiki to more than 40 countries on 5 continents. Contiki has become a household name, synonymous with travel, adventure and exploring. Many travellers will go on a Contiki, the same way their parents did - with many of the same parents meeting on a Contiki while travelling!

These days, Contiki has come a long way since that first trip around Europe in the minibus with just John Anderson. They run tours right across the world, and the company now has over 700 staff worldwide, a fleet of coaches, multiple resorts and villas, an Austrian Gasthof (guest inn), and even a 16th century French Chateau!
