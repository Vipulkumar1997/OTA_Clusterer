Highlights
Enjoy a memorable evening soaking up Belgrade’s electrifying, bohemian atmosphere in its many bars and clubs.
Gaze at striking rows of elegant Ottoman houses which dot the hillside of Berat, Albania.
Sit back and sip on a leisurely sundowner, as you witness a spectacular sunset over Santorini Island, in Greece.
Explore the intoxicating smells and sounds of Turkish heritage, as you wander through the Old Bazaar of Skopje in Macedonia.
Give your taste buds a treat, as you indulge in ocean fresh seafood in the bars and restaurants that line the boulevards of the sun kissed Budva town, in Montenegro.
Sit in solitude or send out a prayer, while in the captivating Aleksandar Nevski Cathedral located in Sofia, Bulgaria.
Watch the romance of the waves, on an exciting cruise along the fairytale Lake Bled, in Slovenia.
Relax on the deck of a sailboat, and revel in the sparkling island delights of Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast.
Tips
Autumn is a great season to travel to this region as the weather is milder, and you’ll get to enjoy beautiful fall foliage.
Wear reef shoes to avoid injuring your feet, during walks along Croatia’s pebbled beaches.
Don’t depend on credit cards; bring exchangeable US dollars and currency in Euros for transactions.
For some local cuisine, try the mixed grill or Mješano meso, spit roasted lamb or pašticada (beef cooked in prunes and wine).
Sip on some ‘Rakija’, which is a hard liquor well known to this area.
On train journeys, you can keep track of your exact location by using your smart phone or just ask your guide.
The Balkan people normally sound aggressive, but don’t be alarmed as it’s just their way of communicating.
Be sensitive about topics such as ethnicities, as this region has only recently recovered from civil war and ethnic strife.
