Highlights
Experience an adrenalin rush as you indulge in a wide range of exciting activities such as skydiving and bungee jumping in Queenstown.
Enjoy captivating fine art performances and experience the traditional ‘hongi’ greeting at an authentic Maori village in Rotorua.
Explore an intriguing geothermal phenomenon of boiling mud pools and shooting geysers against the craggy backdrop of Rotorua.
Hike across the volcanic terrain of the Tongariro National Park for an unforgettable glimpse of emerald crater lakes, cold mountain springs and active craters.
Spend a relaxing afternoon sipping delicious wine at a vineyard in Nelson.
Snorkel, swim and sail around the Bay of Islands, an archipelago of 144 sun kissed islands.
Discover the remarkable beauty of spectacular waterfalls, snow-capped mountains and dramatic fjords as you make your way across Milford Sound fjord.
Marvel in mysterious subterranean caves, underground rivers and thousands of glow worms at Waitomo.
Tips
Carry plenty of water and sun block while venturing outdoors since the sun is much stronger here than in the Northern Hemisphere.
Respect Maori culture by not sitting on tables or putting your hat on them. Further, avoid eating or drinking when inside a wharenui (meeting place).
You can safely use the word ‘kiwi’ while referring to New Zealanders. They don’t consider it to be an offensive nickname.
Eat your food only after it has been blessed by the Maori. Your tour guide will give you an idea of traditions and customs before you visit the tribes.
Be careful not to criticize the All Blacks; New Zealand’s favourite rugby team.
If you’re wrapping a gift, avoid using the color red as it’s considered a taboo here.
Cafes and restaurants usually levy an additional service charge of 10% on statutory holidays.
Avoid making the ‘V’ sign to indicate victory.
New Zealand Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"My New Zealand tour was memorable because of Isobel, the tour guide. I did not know what to expect on my Contiki tour but as it turned out, Isobel made it wonderful."
'Sweet as' South
"The New Zealand experience was fascinating. There isin't anything not to like about New Zealand, it is an awesome country with beautiful sceneries, the people were amazing and the food and drinks were superb. Our tour guide (Isobel) did a fantastic job as she knew all the best places, encouraged us to do something bit different or scary (like a bungy jump) and her good taste in music kept us going in the mornings if we were feeling a bit worse for wear after a night out. I highly recommend this New Zealand tour."
'Sweet as' South (End Wellington)
"This New Zealand tour was amazing. I made some good friends during the travel and what made the tour enjoyable was the tour guide (Isobel), she was very informative and helpful as well as hilarious and fun to be around. I highly recommend this New Zealand tour to family and friends and will definitely do another one."
