Highlights
Enjoy a therapeutic soak in the steaming aqua waters of the geothermal hot springs at Blue Lagoon.
Ride the surefooted Icelandic horse, across moss covered lava fields. Explore caverns and saunter past peculiar ice candles as you go lava tubing in the dimmest depths of Raufarholshellir.
Sail past marvelously glinting icebergs as your boat makes its way across the Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon.
Go snorkeling in the crystal clear waters of Silfra Lake at Thingvellir National Park and peek into the underwater fissure separating the North Atlantic and Eurasian tectonic plates.
Discover the watery wonders of the awe-inspiring double waterfalls at Gullfoss and feel the excitement as you go river rafting on Hvita River.
Hike across the icy Solheimajokull Glacier and attempt to climb its ice walls.
Watch humpback whales, porpoises and dolphins at play on a whale watching trip, off the coast of Reykjavik.
Arrive in the darkest winter months to witness the uncanny light show of Aurora Borealis.
Tips
Visitors making purchases worth ISK4000 or more can claim a partial refund of VAT when they produce the receipt at the airport.
Some museums are operational only in the summer months so check with your tour guide before you plan a visit.
Use sunglasses and sunscreen for protection against the harshness of the northern sun reflected off snow and ice.
Use adequate moisturizer and a special hand cream as the cold dry air, dust and wind can crack exposed skin.
Avoid getting exhausted when out hiking and cycling as this may be a sign of hypothermia. Seek shelter and get a foil space blanket if you get any symptoms.
Children need to be carefully supervised due to the lack of barriers and warning signs at hot springs, waterfalls, cliffs and crevices.
Remember to follow the highest hygiene protocol at swimming pool change rooms to avoid annoying the locals.
Try and attend the Icelandic Airwaves Musical Festival in October, Gay Pride Festival in August or Beer Day in March.
Iceland Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"My trip to Iceland was part of my bucket list for many years which I was able to tick off last year. I was astonished during the trip when I saw the beauty of the place. I absolutely recommend this G Adventure trip to anyone who wants to experience Iceland."
Best of Iceland
"Iceland was more than what I had hoped for. I joined the tour operated by funtravel.is and we had so much fun as our tour guide took us to some of the most fascinating places.  We were given time to explore on most days but on some days we felt a bit rushed. We stayed on farms and guest houses with shared bathrooms mostly in the middle of nowhere but we still had a good time."
Iceland Discovery
"I have been to two Thirsty Swagman tour and had an amazingly good time. I made friends and the tour was worth every penny."
