Highlights
See beautiful rainbows, misty sprays and Victoria Falls’ awesome beauty from a micro-light aircraft or helicopter that offers a splendid aerial view of ‘The Smoke That Thunders’.
Go kayaking in the Upper Zambezi, ride the rapids beneath the falls and feel the rush of adrenalin as you bungee jump off a bridge near Victoria Falls.
Paddle a canoe to see yawning hippos and crocodiles on the Lower Zambezi and enjoy sightings of elephants and elusive white rhinos on a leisurely sunset cruise along the Zambezi River.
Sway to the gentle rhythm of pachyderms as you search for wild game in the surrounding areas near Victoria Falls and spot herds of giraffe and buffalo wading through shallow waters.
Go on a walking safari inside the South Luangwa National Park and come face to face with civets and other nocturnal animals during a night safari.
Explore the pristine wilderness of Luiwa Plains, home to many rare species of wildlife such as blue wildebeest and wild dogs. Search for roan antelope, oribi and waterbuck in the virgin landscape of the Kafue National Park.
Discover a plethora of birds and wildlife in the Mosi oa Tunya National Park.
Drift on a houseboat and be charmed by the delights of Lake Kariba.
Tips
Rafting season is from June to January and August to November is the best months to ride the rapids.
August to October is the best season for wildlife sightings as animals gather near watering holes to quench their thirst.
Many of the lodges and national parks may be closed from November to April which is the wet season as animals are harder to spot in the lush, green landscape.
Victoria Falls is at its resplendent best at the end of the rainy season.
Livingstone has some nice restaurants and bars where you can kick back and have a good time.
Women should dress conservatively and avoid wearing shorts and miniskirts.
Check the minimum age for lion walks. You guide will have more details.
For a meaningful travel experience, spend some time doing community work which could involve teaching, sports development, medical work or lion rehabilitation.
