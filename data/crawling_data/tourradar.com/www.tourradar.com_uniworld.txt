About Uniworld Boutique River Cruise Collection
For nearly four decades, Uniworld has taken guests to the most spectacular destinations in Europe, Russia, Egypt, Vietnam, Cambodia, and China. In 2006, Uniworld was acquired by The Travel Corporation, a highly successful international travel group with over 25 award-winning brands such as Trafalgar, Insight, Brendan, and Contiki, as well as Red Carnation Hotels—the award-winning five-star luxury hotel collection. The Travel Corporation has made major investments in Uniworld's ships and its people. The ultimate goal of these investments is to provide guests with a first-class European boutique cruise experience. Combining our sister companies’ expertise in tour planning and in first-class hotel management with our own decades of superior nautical experience has enabled Uniworld to create a new standard in luxury river cruising. Uniworld’s company-owned boutique river cruise ships Boutique hotel designers often invest considerable time, thought, and resources in creating destination-specific interior decor for their properties, and in choosing amenities that will assure an intimate, elegant yet relaxed experience for their guests. This same care and attention is apparent on each of Uniworld’s ten company-owned boutique ships. In the last few years, Uniworld has introduced several stunning new ships to its fleet and has completely remodeled and redesigned its existing ships so that all company-owned ships meet the highest standards of comfort and style. No matter their ship, Uniworld guests can travel from one exciting destination to the next with access to inviting lounges, cozy libraries, panoramic restaurants offering sumptuous cuisine, and lovely riverview staterooms. Uniworld’s Partners Additionally, the company jointly operates one river cruise ship, the Douro Spirit, in Portugal and another, the River Victoria, in Russia. Ships used in the Egypt program are under charter agreements, and, in China, space is booked through an affiliation with Victoria Cruises, China's premiere five-star river cruise ship company. Expect more personalized attention with Uniworld Uniworld employs an all English-speaking, professionally trained staff, so there are no language barriers and no problems with understanding what is being said or what's going on when you're onboard. All announcements are made only in English. Unlike many companies offering river cruise programs in Europe and elsewhere, Uniworld is an American company focused on North American travelers and other English-speaking clientele (as the trips are popular with Australians, British, Canadians, and South African travelers as well). Uniworld’s headquarters is located in Los Angeles, California, and it has an outstanding European operations team who reports directly to our Los Angeles headquarters, which allows us to have complete control over every aspect of product delivery: nautical, hospitality, and land. In addition, we have a satellite office in Arnhem, the Netherlands, and a China operations team in Beijing. By having operations teams located in these regions, Uniworld is able to react quickly and efficiently to any given challenge and/or emergency.
