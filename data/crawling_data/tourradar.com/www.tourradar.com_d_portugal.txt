Highlights
See the vineyards famous for producing the ruby ports in Porto.
Feast on tapas while listening to Fado, a national obsession of haunting and emotional music.
Cycle to the top of a fortified village before heading to dine at a monastery.
Toboggan down winding streets, being pushed by men who use rubber-soled boots as brakes!
Rest on the beaches of Lagos and prepare for a bar crawl that lasts until sunrise.
Visit Palacio Pena (Feather Palace), commissioned by an artistic king who chose its vivid colours and fine stone carvings.
Ride the Glória Funicular from downtown Lisbon to Bairro Alto.  Fall in love with its bohemian vibe, picturesque streets, and wild art scene.
Enjoy a glass of Alentejo wine with your dinner at a 17th-century Neo-Moorish palace.
Tips
The official language of Portugal is Portuguese. English is widely spoken within the tourist areas.
The currency of Portugal is the Euro.  Keep cash handy as credit cards aren’t accepted everywhere.  ATM’s are easy to find.
Tipping is part of the culture in Portugal.  Leave around 10% for good service.
The Portuguese are well dressed and groomed.  Loose, lightweight natural fibres will keep your comfortable.
Try an egg custard tart called Pastel de nata!  Drink bottled water when outside of major cities and towns.
Don’t leave Portugal without some Claus Porto soaps, a bottle of Ginjinha and some decorative glazed tiles.
Portugal is the oldest country in Europe. It’s had the same defined borders since 1139!
The oldest bookstore in the world (1732) can be found in Lisbon.
Portugal Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"We had an amazing trip. The bus we took to Spain was a great value for money. The crew were also awesome and we are well taken cared of by making sure that we had a wonderful experience. I truly love Spain and Portugal and would highly recommend this tour."
Iberian Adventure (from Madrid to Lisbon)
"I was on an Iberian Adventure with Busabout and had an amazing experience. Our tour guide (Isobel) was great, she was hilarious, fun and knowledgeable. Even though there were long rides on the bus, she kept us entertained about her experiences and her knowledge on the destinations. I look forward to share another adventure with her."
Iberian Adventure (from Madrid to Lisbon)
"I had done thirteen tours and Rebecca Charlie was so far the best tour guide ever. During my Portugal tour, she was caring, accommodating, fun, organized and very knowledgeable. She is still young with only a few experiences but she was outstanding in what she does."
