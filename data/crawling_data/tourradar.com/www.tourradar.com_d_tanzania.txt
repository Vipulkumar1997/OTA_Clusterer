Highlights
Gaze upon snow fields and other mesmerizing vistas from atop Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s highest mountain.
Enjoy amazing sightings of exotic wildlife while on safaris at the Serengeti National Park, Tarangire National Park and Ngorongoro Conservation Area.
Watch the glorious sunset at the Serengeti National Park that stretches over 12,000 square kilometers.
Get enchanted by the quaint shops and bazaars of Stone Town.
Embark on a scintillating tour of a spice plantation at the port city of Zanzibar.
Spend some time watching beautiful flamingos at the Lake Manyara and explore the acacia woodlands and grasslands of the National Park.
Visit a traditional Masai village and observe native culture at close quarters at the Ngorongoro Conservation Area.
Set up camp near the Ngorongoro Crater, a World Heritage site which showcases the world’s biggest intact caldera.
Tips
Don’t be surprised if you are called ‘Mzungu’ which means ‘explorer’ or ‘restless’ as this is a tag given to most foreigners.
Carry a good quality camera with a big lens to get close up shots of wildlife in their natural habitat.
Prices are normally increased for foreigners so check with your tour guide before you make an expensive purchase.
Get the right anti malaria medication since Tanzania is host to the chloroquine resistant form of malaria.
Beware of thieves pretending to be police officers. Don’t venture out after dark on the empty beaches of Zanzibar.
The best time to witness the annual migration of zebras and other wildlife is during the months of February and March.
Wear light or neutral colored clothing while on safari and avoid wearing contact lenses since it can get very dusty.
Keep a tube of Neosporin on hand in case you get frost nip when you’re climbing Kilimanjaro. Your tour guide will also give you a detailed checklist before you start your journey.
Tanzania Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"Our absolute Safari adventure was worth every penny with the help of our awesome tour guide (Philippa) whose knowledge on places and animals were impeccable. She was fun to be with and provided us with sumptuous meals. Our driver (JB) was also amazing and always ready to help. It was a memorable tour which I highly recommend."
The Absolute Safari
"The Southern Safari trip is an incredible trip that is suitable for all ages. The tour crew were amazing in providing us with an excellent tour. They were helpful and made sure we enjoy every single aspect despite the group size. Everyone got along well and had fun. Absolute Africa is a great company that offers amazing tours."
The Southern Safari
"We decided to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary doing something extraordinary. We searched the internet, came accross Lobelia Tours Agency and decided to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro in East Africa. Everything went well according to plan though there were some mishaps along the way. I broke my ankle during the trek but I was well taken cared of  by the crew and got every care that I needed. It was a tip worth remembering and we loved it."
