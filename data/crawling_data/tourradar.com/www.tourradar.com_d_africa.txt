Tips
While English, French and Arabic will prove useful, a phrasebook for the local native language of the area you’re visiting is a good idea too.
The easiest currencies to exchange within Africa are the euro, US dollar and pound sterling.
Dress appropriately for the religious and cultural context of the places you’re visiting.  In some countries women are expected to cover up.  Be prepared for heat and cold.  It’s chilly before the sun rises and after it sets.
Bargain your way throughout Africa particularly for souvenirs in the markets and bazaars.
Ask your tour guide about drinking water.  Stick to bottled or boiled water in countries where the water isn’t regulated.
Sunblock and insect repellant are highly recommended
Bring a head torch!  You’ll know why once there’s a power cut…or no electricity to begin with!
Over half the African continent is under the age of 25!
Africa Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"Amazing Africa tour! Sam, our tour guide, was simply the best. He was so friendly and informative, and has a broad knowledge about Egypt. We visited the major sights of Egypt in such a short span and it was an extremely a good deal. I loved the tour and will absolutely recommend this to my friends and family!"
Felucca  Odyssey
"The Africa Tour was a memorable one. People are free to do their own thing and no one is pressured to engage on optional activities.Our tour guide, Vailet, was very sincere and helpful especially when I got sick for a few days, she really took care of me. As stated in the package, our tour visited all of the main attractions in Africa. I highly recommend this tour for those travellers with a tight budget. I really got the most out of it myself. The tour leaders and drivers really did a great job in accompanying us."
The Absolute Safari
"Topdeck’s Pyramids and Beaches Tour is the best deal out of all their Egypt tours. With this package, you get to visit the historical landmarks in one week and you get to relax on the Red Sea, the best beach in the Middle East, on the following week. The trip was really smooth sailing thanks to Waleed a.k.a Will, our tour leader, who really put much effort in making sure that we are safe throughout the travel. He also gave us a lot of tips in souvenir buying, haggling, places to eat and a lot more. I highly recommend this tour."
