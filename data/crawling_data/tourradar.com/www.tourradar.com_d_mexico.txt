Tips
Spanish is the official language of Mexico.  English is widely spoken, particularly in tourist areas.
The national currency of Mexico is the Mexican Peso.  Credit cards are becoming more popular but are not accepted everywhere.  ATM’s are easy to find.
At restaurants a tip of 10% and 15% is expected for good service. It’s best to tip in cash.
Don’t leave Mexico without some Achiote spice, a bottle of Xtanbentun and a Mayan mask.
Feast on street vendor food whenever given the chance.  Use bottled water for drinking and brushing your teeth.
Mexicans tend to dress nicely for a night out, but in tourist areas casual summer clothes are perfectly fine.
Mexico City was built on what used to be a lake.   As a result, the city sinks nearly 10 inches per year!
In Mexico it’s illegal to lift your feet from the pedals of your bike!
Mexico Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"We had a wonderful time on the tour and our guide was awesome and very knowledgeable. We got to see some of the most incredible sights with lots of fun things to do. I got to meet some amazing people which became my friends and the accommodation was also great. I definitely recommend this tour."
Mayan Sun–Northbound
"Apart from the beautiful beaches, this trip showcased the perfect way to see everthing Mexico has to offer. The tour guide was very knowledgeable, the group was great and the sceneries were breathtaking. The tour also offered a lot of flexibility as we were given choices on day trips or just relax with friends. I really enjoyed the trip."
Mexico Unplugged
"I spent eight wonderful days in Mexcio. The food was fantastic, the sights were beautiful as we explored markets and ate the most tasty Mexican food. The tour guide was a delight and New Year's Eve in Mexico City was an additional highlight."
