Highlights
Take in Riga’s stunning Jungendstil architecture, and go on a wild shopping spree in the central market area.
Feel the soft caress of the salty sea breeze, as you stroll around Curonian Spit’s wild, rolling sand dunes, on a memorable Baltic Sea experience in Lithuania.
Listen to the rumbling winds sweep through the corridors of the Toompea Castle, perched atop a hill in Tallinn, Estonia.
Get intoxicated by the heady aromas of fine vodka, at the Vodka Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia.
Feel the pulse of Finland’s urban, trendy vibe while sampling fine nouveau cuisine and party the night way at Helsinki.
Pay a solemn tribute to the brave people who endured the horrors of the German Holocaust at Auschwitz, in Poland.
Discover your inner Bohemian spirit as you leisurely wander through the winding streets of Prague, in Czech Republic.
Visit the remnants of the Berlin Wall in Germany and be reminded of this regions interesting history.
Tips
Shop for embroidered Muhu slippers and traditionally knit garments in the Old Town area of Tallinn.
Find your way into small, local bars to experience Riga nightlife at its best.
Sample smoked eel, a Baltic delicacy eaten across Lithuania.
While in Russia, try pepper infused Pertsovka vodka and Starka vodka which is a dark coloured, aged vodka.
To rejuvenate your body and soul, spend some time in a traditional wood sauna in Helsinki.
When in Prague you can say ‘Dobrý den’ before you enter a restaurant or a store as it is considered to be a polite greeting. To say goodbye, you can say ‘na shledanou’.
Choose to travel in an original communist era van to visit Warsaw’s attractions in Poland.
Don’t be deterred by cold welcomes and stern faces in Germany; they’re actually quite genial at heart.
