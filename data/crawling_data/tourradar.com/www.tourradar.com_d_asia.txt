Tips
Asia is a shopper’s paradise.  Mega malls filled with luxury brands compete with traditional markets for your attention.  Pick up tea in China, toys in Japan, wood carvings in Cambodia and custom clothing in Bangkok.
Tipping in Asia can be a tricky matter.  Be sure to consult your tour guides for advice on each nation’s practices.
If a good Wi-Fi is important to you, be sure to check signal strength before committing to a room or café.
Language differences are rarely an issue in Asia.  While it’s sure to be easier in tourist areas you’ll find that even in
more remote areas you’ll get by with some hand gestures and pointing.
Save some money by haggling.  Tourists are often quoted up to five times more than a local would be.
Tap water is unsafe to drink in most of Asia but bottled water is readily available.
Bring half the clothes you think you’ll need.  Most items can be purchased inexpensively if needed.
India and China combined make up more than a third of the world’s entire population.
Asia Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"I had an amazing tour in Asia. Though I was very nervous about travelling for the first time on my own,  the tour made it so easy. It was easy to make friends and I even decided to carry on my future travels with some of them. What made the tour really special was the little bonuses, the attention to detail and the inclusion of so many things I would never of done as a tourist on my own. Also, the guides always go above and beyond about the whole experience."
Thai Intro - 9 Day
"I travelled to SE Asia with Trutravels. I started in Thailand and the experience was definitely amazing. I felt at ease with cute little messages before departure that got me hyped for the trip. I took in literally awesome sights that left memories to last a lifetime. So all in all if you are planning on travelling around S.E Asia start in Thailand. You won't regret it and if you're lucky enough, you get either Luke Macdonald or Harry Bradbury as your group leader who are very friendly and helpful."
TruTravels Thailand Experience
"I recently went on a trip round paradise and it was an absolutely amazing Thailand experience. We were lucky enough to have 2 amazing guides Luke and Ryan on our tour. Both of them have incredible knowledge of Thailand and went out of their way to make sure we were having an awesome time and that we were getting a proper Thailand experience. We were also super lucky to have an very talented videographer Matt on our tour aswell capturing all the fun stuff we were getting up to and showcasing the trip for your viewing pleasure. The trip was epic and amazing and the value for money is worth every penny. You will not regret coming on this trip and joining the Trutravels family!"
