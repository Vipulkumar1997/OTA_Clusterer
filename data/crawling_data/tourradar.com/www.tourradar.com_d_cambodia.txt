Highlights
Walk amongst the 216 carved stone faces at Bayon. They’re something to see at 13-feet tall!
Feeling brave?  Be the first to eat a fried tarantula in Phnom Penh!
Take a wacky ride on the “Bamboo train”.  They’re powered by a whiny lawn motor engine!
Ask the locals how Monkey Island got its name.  Ask about the King Kong” legend and the  60’s pop group version?
Travel by tuk-tuk to the Angor Wat.  Marvel at the lotus-like towers rising 65 meters into the sky.
Sail past the floating villages of Tonlé Sap Lake.
Spend the day swimming in Sihanoukville. Spend the night trying your luck at the casinos.
Tips
Khmer is the official language of Cambodia. English is very widely spoken.
The national currency of Cambodia is the Riel but US dollars are also accepted.  ATM’s are everywhere and credit cards are accepted in most tourist areas.
Tipping is not really part of the culture in Cambodia, but leaving a tip of 10% will go a long way.
Be sure to try Lort Cha from a street vendor.  Drink bottled water only but brushing your teeth shouldn’t be a problem.
Don’t leave Cambodia without a Betel Nut Box, some rice paper prints and a chequered karma scarf.
Cambodia is hot!  Pack natural fabrics that’ll keep you cooler.   While visiting places of worship you’ll need to cover your legs and shoulders.
An hour long reflexology foot massage can be had for a mere $5 US!
Half of Cambodia’s current population is under the age of 15 years.
Cambodia Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"The Cambodia Discovery tour was the perfect way to get a taste of Cambodia in a short amount of time. Some of the highlights of the tour were, discovering Phnom Penh where we visited the Killing Fields and visiting the temples of Angkor. Some people on the tour got a bit sick of seeing temples, mainly because it was very hot, but if you're a history buff you'll love it. I would recommend any traveller to visit and experience what Cambodia has to offer."
Cambodia Discovery
"I saw the best of Cambodia when I joined the tour. Although the country has a tragic past, the people have a very possitive attitude and the country is beautiful. My only suggestion is a one day stay in Battambang and an extra day at Siem Reap to visit the temples is preferable."
Best of Cambodia
"I had an amazing tour in Cambodia. The tour guides' knowledge in history and religion were very impressive. Intrepid's guides focused on the environmental awareness throughout the tour program."
