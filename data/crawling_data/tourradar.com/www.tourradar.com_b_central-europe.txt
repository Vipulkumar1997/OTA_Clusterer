Highlights
Listen to the calming strains of beautifully composed classical music at Salzburg; hometown of the legendary maestro, Mozart.
Join thousands of people and revel in the world’s largest beer party, Oktoberfest, held every year in Munich, Germany.
Experience the true grandeur and grace of Central Europe, in the elegant churches and fairytale castles of Budapest, Hungary.
Feel the wind against your face as you cycle around the quaint village hamlets and rolling hillsides, that surround the picturesque town of Cesky Krumlov, in the Czech Republic.
Enjoy a romantic, candle lit boat ride along the beguiling canals of Amsterdam, in Netherlands.
Surrender yourself to nature, and admire the sights of cascading waterfalls at the Plitvice Lakes National Park, in Croatia.
Indulge in fine gourmet cuisine and refreshing Trappist beer, in the cafes and markets of Belgium’s Bruges city.
Let your imagination play havoc with your mind during an exciting visit to Bran Castle, the fictional abode of Count Dracula, in Romania.
Tips
Try exotic meats such as pheasant, rabbit and venison apart from ubiquitous Belgian delicacies such as waffles, beer and chocolate.
Hit the night clubs and bars of Zagreb, Dubrovnik and Hvar town, for a taste of Croatia’s pulsating night life.
Avoid walking on the bike lanes when you’re in the Netherlands, as you may get mowed down by a cyclist.
Taste traditional Czech gastronomic cuisine such as goulash (beef stew served with bread dumplings), pickled sausages and cheeses.
Greet the locals by saying ‘Boo- nuh-zee-wah’ or ‘Buna Ziwa’, which in Romanian means ‘good day!’.
Buy sausages, salami, tinned goose liver and caviar in Hungary, the home of these delicacies.
You can enjoy delicious cake, pudding and coffee in the famous ‘kaffeehaus’ or coffee houses across Austria.
Do try and visit Germany during Christmas, as markets are beautifully lit up and brimming with special Christmas presents.
