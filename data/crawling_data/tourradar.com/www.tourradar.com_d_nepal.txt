Tips
Nepali is the official language in Nepal, but English is widely spoken.
The currency of Nepal is the Nepali rupee.  Credit cards are widely accepted in tourist areas but not in smaller towns.  ATM’s are plentiful in most cities.
Try the national dish of Daal Bhaat but stay away from the water.  Bottled water is readily available.
Don’t leave Nepal without a Thankas painting, a prayer wheel and a Singing Bowl.
Dressing with modesty is advisable.  Keep shoulders and chest areas covered especially when visiting religious sites.
Tipping is not mandatory but it’s common.  Between 5-10% is acceptable and appreciated.
Try a cup of chiya – black tea infused with cinnamon, cardamom and cloves.
Greeting people in Nepal involves placing your palms together in a prayer style and saying "namaste".
Nepal Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"On my Nepal adventure, I was treated like a VIP, from the moment I landed in KTM to the moment I left for the states. Everything was unique and the accommodation was great. The crew on the tour were organized, efficient and fantastic. It was truly a once in a lifetime experience."
Everest Three High Passes Trek
"An amazing trip that was haulted by the April earthquake. Everthing prior to the earthquake was wonderful, the food, accommodation and service were perfect. Our guides were very knowledgeable and were happy in assisting us. Even after the earthquake, our guide (Subal) kept us safe. Despite what happened, it was still an amazing experience."
Everest Circuit & the Cho La
"We had an amazing time on our Langtang trek. We were very happy with the crew since we were well taken cared off by the tour guide and the porter. The accommodation was simple but the food was good. There were heated water and solar showers and the views were breathtaking especially Sing Gompa which was so beautiful."
