Highlights
Be surrounded by the bustle of floating markets, and glimpse into classic Vietnamese scenery, as you drift along the meandering channels of fertile Mekong Delta.
Slip into your swimsuit, soak up the sun and join the crazy revelry of a Thai beach party at Koh Phangan, in Thailand.
Admire the magnificent evening aura of soaring towers and sprawling ruins at Angkor, Vietnam.
Wander through misty tea plantations, colourful butterfly gardens and mossy rainforests, during an intoxicating visit to Malaysia’s Cameron Highlands.
Explore underwater caverns, snorkel in sparkling clear waters and swim around secluded white, sandy beaches of Puerto Galera, Philippines.
Listen to mystical sounds of sacred Buddhist chants, emanating from the glittering Shwedagon pagoda in Burma.
Spend some time watching playful orangutans and their feeding rituals, in Indonesia’s Gunung Leuser National Park.
Learn to make lip smacking treats such as braised pork with oyster sauce, and ‘nasi lemak’ (a coconut milk and rice preparation) in the multicultural city state of Singapore.
Tips
Check out Little India’s offerings of Indian culture and food, in Singapore.
A guided tour is the best way to explore the natural beauty and popular attractions of Bali, in Indonesia.
Book a cruise on the Ayarwaddy River and gain an insight into Burma’s riverside village life.
Don’t forget to hike around the Cordillera rice terraces in the Philippines.
You can shop for duty free fashion and electronic goods in Kuala Lumpur.
Sample Vietnamese street food specialties such as ‘nem spring rolls’ (fried rice rolls stuffed with noodles and pork) and drink some local rice wine.
You can shop for silks, textiles, Buddhist artwork and krama scarves in Angkor’s night market.
Learn a few Tagalog phrases such as ‘Magandang umaga’ for ‘Good morning’, and ‘Salamat’ for ‘Thank you’, before you head to the Philippines.
