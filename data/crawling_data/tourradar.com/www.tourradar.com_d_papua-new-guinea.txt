Highlights
Trek across the grueling but legendary Kokoda Track that covers the path of an iconic WWII battle between the Australians and the Japanese in the mountain rain forests of Papua New Guinea.
Stop by at Efogi Village, a major settlement at higher altitudes that has its own first aid post and airstrip.
Buy fresh fruits and vegetables from the locals at the village of Naoro.
Stay overnight at an old wartime campsite on the banks of Ua Ule Creek.
Test your skills and endurance as you trek up Mount Bellamy and be rewarded with marvelous views of the mighty Owen Stanley Range Mountains.
Pay your respects at the Bomana War Cemetery, the final resting place of over three thousand Australians.
Ride exhilarating and challenging breaks at a private surfing camp near Moresby.
Go kayaking and explore the underwater mysteries of coral reefs in the Tigak area.
Tips
The ideal time to trek the Kokoda Trail is between the months of April to October when it is the dry season.
Practice walking on inclines before you start on the Kokoda Trek as it will help you build stamina and endurance.
Wear well-used boots as wearing new ones may lead to blistered feet.
Pack a light jacket as the evenings can get quite cold at the higher altitudes.
Ask your guide for help if you find it difficult to communicate with the villagers.
Try some delicious seafood, fresh from the waters of the Tigak area.
When you paddle your way to different islands, try and meet with local folk and watch their way of life.
Surfing conditions are good throughout the year so come prepared to spend lots of time in the water.
