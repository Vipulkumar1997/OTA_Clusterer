Highlights
Keep your eyes peeled for Nessie, on your river boat cruise of Loch Ness.
Climb aboard the Jacobite steam train, made famous in three Harry Potter films.
Ferry to the magical Isle of Skye to explore its scenic landscapes, before sampling whiskey at a local distillery.
Attend the Up Helly Aa festival to take part in a torchlit parade, and the ceremonial burning of a replica Viking longship.
Visit the “home of golf” in St.Andrew’s before making your way to Balmoral Castle, the Scottish home of the Royal Family since 1848.
Tour the mysterious underground walkways in Edinburgh.
Bike across the Scottish Highlands, before enjoying a home-cooked meal at a family run lodge.
Hike to the top of Ben Nevis (Britain’s highest peak) after a boat trip to “Seal Island”.
Tips
The official languages of Scotland are English, Gaelic and Scots.  Be forewarned: Scottish accents can be hard for some to understand.
Scotland’s currency is the British Pound.  Credit cards are widely accepted but carrying some cash is advisable.
Tipping is in the neighbourhood of 10% at most establishments.
Be sure to shop for Celtic jewellery, Scottish Woolens (tartans, cashmere and lambswool), shortbread and whiskey.
Weather is quick to change.  Be prepared with layers, rain gear, boots and good walking shoes.
Tap water is safe to drink, although may be chlorinated quite heavily.
Irn Bru is Scotland’s most popular soft drink.  The recipe for it is known only to two living people at any one time.
Scotland’s official animal is the unicorn. It’s not surprising considering the love Scotland has for legends.
Scotland Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"During our Scotland visit, our tour guide (Tim) took us to the most amazing places. From Dalkeith, Edinburgh, Inverness to Loch Ness and all the way up to the peak of Skye. It was the best experience I had in a long time."
3 Day Isle of Skye
"The tour was amazing and informative. Our tour guide was nice and friendly and  provided us with lots of information about the places we visited. This tour is highly recommended to anyone who wants to travel in the Highlands."
3 day Oban, Mull & Iona
"It was a relaxing tour as we hiked in the hills and saw a lot of breathtaking sceneries. Our tour guide (Graeme) shared lots of wonderful stories as well as interesting facts. I enjoyed every bit of the tour."
