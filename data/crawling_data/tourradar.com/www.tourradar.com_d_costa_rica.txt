Head to the Tourtuguero National Park between March and June for the leatherback turtle nesting season.
Shop for rocking chairs, carved masks and ceramics in San Jose’s Central Market.
Sip on coffee, ‘pipas’ (coconut water), Cuba Libre and ‘horchata’ (a drink made of cornmeal).
Feast on a set lunch called ‘casado’ which consists of rice, beans, fried plantain, meat and salad.
Quepos and San Jose offers exciting nightlife options.
Go on a photography spree as you explore Liberia’s colonial era architecture.
Come armed with a few Spanish phrases such as ‘Cuanto cuesta’ for ‘How much does it cost?’, ‘Por fovor’ for ‘Please’ and ‘Gracias’ for ‘Thank you’.
Costa Rica Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"We felt great joining the Costa Rica tour. The tour guide was fun and extremely accommodating and the hotels are superb in service and uniqueness. The activities in Hacienda Guachipelin were fantastic and and the Villas Playa Samara is truly a beach paradise. All the sceneries on the tour were beautiful, the wildlife were also astounding. We got more than what we bargained for. We had a great experience and we will definitely do it again."
Essential Costa Rica Tour
"As I travelled to Costa Rica, our tour guide (Bryan Mendez) was outstanding as he was very knowledgeable, hilarious and seamless. Even though it was my first time to tour with a group, I still had an amazing experience. The tour offered a lot of activities and it was a perfect mixture of wildlife, adventure and relaxation. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone who wants to go on an adventure to Costa Rica."
Classic Costa Rica
"Visiting Costa Rica was the best vacation we ever had. It was a relaxing trip with lots of sun, the climate and the people were amazing. The country have breathtaking sceneries and wildlife, the food was sumptuous and the citizens were so far the happiest people I know. Some of the highlights of the trip were, a hike near Arenal Volcano, a boat ride on Lake Arenal, crossing the hanging bridges, zip lining in the rain forest and and at the top of the canopy, soaking up the sun on a Pacific Ocean beach and we had fun traveling with a diverse group of wonderful people."
