Highlights
Walk beside massive stone spires and flat top mesas that guard Monument Valley’s desolate landscape.
Hop into a helicopter to get a bird’s eye view of the stunning depth and eternal beauty of the Grand Canyon.
Pay your respects to the King of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, at his gravesite and charming home in Memphis.
Get your feet tapping to the sounds of jazzy blues in the French Quarter area of New Orleans.
Breathe in the addictive aroma of scintillating Californian wines in the world-famous wine growing region of Napa Valley.
Hike across the sprawling wilderness of the Denali National Park and spy on grizzly bears, moose and caribou.
Discover world class museums, opulent shopping opportunities and lively entertainment and nightlife in the skyscraper Mecca of New York.
Dance the hula, dig into a traditional Luau feast or cool off in the waters of the Pacific Ocean that surrounds the tropical island paradise of Hawaii.
Tips
Tipping is very much a part of the culture in the US so check with your guide if you’re confused on how much to pay.
When you’re wine tasting in Napa Valley, remember to see, swirl, smell, taste and savour the wine.
It is illegal to smoke at bars, clubs, malls and other public spaces in Washington, New York City, Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, DC etc.
Stay on the left while cycling or walking along designated tracks inside national parks.
Stay hydrated and wear used hiking shoes to avoid getting blisters on your feet while on a Grand Canyon hike.
For a little variety in cuisine try some reindeer sausage in Talkeetna, Alaska
Whether it’s deep sea diving or snorkelling with sea turtles, try at least one adventure activity in Hawaii.
USA Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"California Calling was a great introduction of the West Coast. Yosemite and Grand Canyon was breath-taking. I also loved partying in Las Vegas but San Francisco was my favourite city though.
You spend quite a time on the road but there is so much to see while you're on the road, after all it was no problem at all.
Our tour guide did a great job. She was good fun, always partying with us but at the same time very helpful in any way. I had a great time and recommend everyone to visit California once in a lifetime."
California Calling 2015-16
"I had a breathtaking tour in Yosemite and Grand Canyon which was a great introduction of the West Coast. My favorite city was San Francisco but I also loved partying in Las Vegas. It was no problem even if you spend quite a time on the road because there is so much to see. Our tour guide did a fantastic job. She was good fun, always partying with us but at the same time very helpful in any way. I had a great time in California and would recommend this once in a lifetime experience."
Canyons And Indian Lands (hotel)
"I would recommend this tour if you want to explore Texas. During my trip, we had a smaller group of 8 and  the group was between 21 to 60 years old from across Europe / UK & Australia. There was a mix of cities, national park and cowboy country.  The trip was perfect and I loved all the little stops along the way. I'd definitely recommend Grand America/Intrepid tour for the mix of ages, flexibility for meals, stops, and other activities."
