Highlights
Challenge yourself to complete the ropes course at Interlaken.
With a professional photographer at your side, learn to take better shots of the beautiful mountains.
Walk through fragrant fields of lavender, sage, and thyme at a farm which supplies herbs for Ricola.
Enjoy a traditional raclette dinner in a 16th century chateau.
Explore the car-free village of Zermatt, at the foot of the world famous Matterhorn.
Hike from First to Lake Bachalpsee to enjoy view of the snow-clad Alpine peaks.  Return to First on a gigantic zip line that travels up to 50 metres high and speeds of up to 84 kilometres per hour.
Take in a traditional alphorn concert on a Saturday night in Gruyeres.
Climb aboard the Chocolate Train bound for Maison Cailler—Nestlé’s premier chocolate factory!
Tips
The four official languages of Switzerland are French, German, Italian and Romansh. English, though not an official language, often bridges the divides.
The currency in Switzerland is called the Swiss Franc.  Credit cards are widely accepted and ATM’s are everywhere.
Don’t leave Switzerland without some chocolate, a Swiss army knife and a watch.
You can never be overdressed in Switzerland.  Dressing in layers will help you with the temperature changes
during the day.
There is no real culture of tipping in Switzerland.  Reward good service by rounding the bill to the nearest Franc.
Try a traditional fondue for dinner!  Swiss water is safe to drink.
There is a 500-year-old statue of a man eating a sack of babies in Bern, Switzerland, and nobody is sure why.
There is no national flower, animal or motto in Switzerland.
Switzerland Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"My tour guide (Elise) made my Mega European tour very memorable. She and our driver took good care of us during the entire trip. She was very amazingly friendly, welcoming and professional and I would recommend and definitely do another trip with her."
Mega European
"On our Europe tour, our tour guide (Gayle) was awesome. She was very professinal and she made sure we had an amazing time. Although there were some mishaps in Montecatinni and Barcelona , Gayle adressed the situations according to the best of her abilities. She also had thorough knowledge on the countries we visited. The trip was fantastic."
Western Adventure - 17 days
"Visiting different countries in eight days was such an amazing experience. It maybe strenuous, but it was all worth it. The crew were fantastic and everything on the tour were perfect."
