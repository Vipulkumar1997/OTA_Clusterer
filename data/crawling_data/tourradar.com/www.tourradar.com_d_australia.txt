Highlights
Take a swim at Lucky Bay. It’s so beautiful that even kangaroos laze on the beach!
Visit an interactive animal farm to cuddle a kangaroo joey, and play with a koala.
Climb to the top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, for a spectacular view of the Opera House.
Become a certified Open Water Diver while exploring the Great Barrier Reef.
Challenge yourself to bike around Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock).
Visit Tasmania for a guided walk of an old convict settlement.
Go on a wild 4WD trip through the Bungle Bungles, before settling in at a bush camp.
Spend the day learning about Aboriginal culture.  Play a didgeridoo before searching the Wetlands for crocodiles.
Tips
Australia’s official language is English.  Slang however is what you’ll remember!
Australia’s currency is the Australian Dollar.   Keep some cash on hand as many shops won’t take credit cards for small purchases.
Be sure to try the “national dessert” called Lamington Cake!  Tap water in Australia is almost always safe to drink.
If it’s not, it’ll be clearly marked.
Australia likes to keep things casual.  Dress up or go to the opera in jeans.
Tipping isn’t essential in Australia, but great service in a restaurant is usually rewarded with around 10%.
Don’t leave without a boomerang, Opals and some Aboriginal art.
Coffee culture is huge.  Go café hopping at places with great names like Fleetwood Macchiato and C U Latte.
Internet in Australia is slow and expensive.  Free Wi-Fi  can be found at libraries.
Australia Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"The tour was fantastic as it was a brilliant introduction to the life in Australia. The information given about finding future jobs was useful and the help with booking ongoing travel was great. It was indeed a memorable and brilliant week spent in Australia"
Oz Intro
"My Australia experience was great. The highlight of the tour were the swimming in the bay and coming down Mount Wellington on my bike. Our tour guides (Tomo and Paul) were also great and the tour was well organised. It was a fun and spectacular tour."
Cycle, Kayak and Walk Tasmania
"This tour was one of the greatest experience in my life. It started on the beautiful fraser Island with its unique Sand Rocks and the Maheno Shipwreck. We had a stop on a farm where there were many optional activities like quad biking or a goat muster and horseback riding. We also visited Emu Park which includes a toga themed dinner. When we reached the Whitsunday Islands, words can't describe the beauty of the inner great barrier reef. The last stop was Cairns, my personal highlight was scuba diving in the outer great barrier reef which was a breathtaking journey into a fascinating colorful underwater world which hides so many beautiful things that you just wish for more time to explore. I highly recommend this tour to anyone who loves to travel and create lifetime memories."
