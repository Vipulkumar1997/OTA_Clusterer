Highlights
Take in the beauty and architectural marvel of 12th Century monolithic churches carved out of pink granite at the UNESCO site of Lalibela.
Immerse yourself in Axum, Ethopia’s oldest city, known for its towering structures and the Ark of the Covenant.
Go on a guided tour of the castles of Gondor and see the beautiful baths, residences and palaces of Emperor Fasilidas.
Spot giant crocodiles, massive hippos and a plethora of water birds on a boat trip down Lake Chamo.
Learn about the Mursi, Karo tribe and the Hamer tribe and get a personal glimpse into their lifestyle.
Trek through the breathtaking Simien Mountains National Park around the majestic Jinbar waterfalls.
See the most stunning fossil collection at the National Museum or experience the hustle and bustle of the Merkato, a busy market in Addis Ababa.
Walk around the beautiful Blue Nile Falls and then visit the island monasteries on Lake Tana.
Tips
Try your hand at rowing Tankwas, which is a kind of papyrus canoe, commonly found on Lake Tana.
If you’re invited to someone’s home, you can take a gift of raw coffee or ‘Bhuna’ which is available at kiosk shops.
When you greet someone with a handshake, bow a little bit to show respect.
Rise to your feet when an elderly person joins you. As a customary greeting, you can say ‘nor’. They will reply saying ‘be'igzier’ and ask you to sit.
Women need to cover their knees and shoulders in Ethiopia, except while visiting Addis Ababa.
Restaurant tips range from 2 to 5 Birr irrespective of the total cost of the meal.
Ethiopian ATMs do not recognize foreign credit or debit cards so come well-prepared.
Ask your tour guide if you’re confused about the ingredients in your meal. For instance, ‘Kitfo’ is raw minced beef and can be a little difficult to digest.
