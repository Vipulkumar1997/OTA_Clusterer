Highlights
Go clubbing in Tel Aviv at 11pm and then sleep on the beach as the sun comes up.
Zoom around Jerusalem on a Segway.  It’s a fascinating place no matter what your beliefs may be.
Float in the Dead Sea, play in the mud and then relax with a coffee in a Bedouin tent.
Descend into the Alma Cave if you dare.  Make your way (sometimes crawling) through the winding maze.
Climb all 1700 steps of the “hanging gardens” in Haifa.  Take in views of the city and the Galilee Hills.
Take a 4x4 jeep tour of the Makhtesh Ramon Crater.  Rocks here are estimated to be around 250 million years old.
Visit the beautiful resort town of Eilat and go swimming with dolphins near the amazing coral reef.
Go kayaking on the Jordan River before returning to your Kibbutz guesthouse.
Tips
The official languages of Israel are Hebrew and Arabic.  Virtually the whole country speaks English.
Israel's currency is the Israeli shekel.  Credit is widely accepted and there are ATM’s outside most banks.
Tipping is common.  Between 10-12% is the norm if it hasn’t already been added to your bill.
Don’t leave without Dead Sea mineral products, Armenian Pottery and Bedouin rugs.
Feast on street food!  Try bagels and zartar, knafe (cheese pastry soaked in syrup) and tamarind lemonade.  The water in Israel is perfectly safe to drink.
Prepare for hot days and cool nights.  Modesty is important around religious sites.  Women need to cover legs and shoulders while men need to cover their heads with a yarmulke.
Learn to say “shalom” everywhere you go.  It’s used for saying both hello and goodbye.
There are more sushi restaurants per capita in Tel Aviv than in any other city on earth, including Tokyo!
Israel Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"We had a great adventure. There were mixed travellers and only five of us went to Israel. We had a great time and well taken cared of by our tour guides as they went an extra mile to accommodate us with the excurtions and home visits and by making sure we had the best experience. They also provided us with information on the destinations."
Jordan & Israel Explorer (13 destinations)
"This tour surpassed our expectations even though we planned it at the last minute. The sights were breathtaking and we got to see almost every site that we hoped to see. The knowledge and experience of our tour guide (Yossi Gellem) also made the tour very memorable. I would absolutely recommend this tour to anyone who wants to experience Israel, its cities and culture."
Biblical Israel
"The tour was such an amazing experience and there was never a dull moment. In Jordan -  the accommodation, the food and tour guide was fantastic. The highlight in Jordan was the overnight stay in the Bedouin Camp in Wadi Rum. Israel was also fascinating but the itinerary was a bit too fast paced with no free time to explore more but the sights were beautiful. The highlight in Israel were the Western Wall, the church f the Holy Sepulchre, Nazareth and Bethlehem, walking the streets of Jerusalem and seeing Masada. Our last stop was Dubai which was the perfect place to end the tour with lots of shopping and sightseeing."
