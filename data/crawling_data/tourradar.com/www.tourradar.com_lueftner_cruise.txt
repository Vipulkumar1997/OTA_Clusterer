Life Onboard
Entertainment
You can look forward to stimulating evenings and memorable experiences on our AMADEUS ships as we take it to our heart that our onboard ship experience is as lively and captivating as your time on shore! Varied folklore shows, insightful and intriguing lectures, regional themed evenings, culinary demonstrations and live music events are just some of the entertainments awaiting our passengers.

In the evening, let our on-board musicians entertain you and perhaps take to the floor yourself and dance to some of your favourite tunes! Take time for something special – yourself!
Dining Experience
With loving attention to detail, the head chef on your Lueftner Cruises' vessel will create new and imaginative menus for you every single day. Drawing inspiration partly from the regions you travel through as well as the season, our chefs will produce fresh and authentic symphonies of flavour to tempt you away on a culinary voyage of discovery. Of course, you are always free to choose between your classic favourite dishes and sophisticated specialties, vegetarian alternatives and delicious gourmet treats.
On all our vessels your taste buds go on a voyage of discovery too, as you enjoy the region’s culinary delights as well as its scenic delights. You’ll be surprised at the, as it were, symphonic temptations that emanate from the kitchen!

Get the day off to a good start by tackling the magnificent breakfast buffet in our elegant Panorama-Restaurant. For lunch, there’s the choice between varied menus and buffet specialities in the restaurant and a light alternative in the AMADEUS Salon. In the afternoon our experienced patissiers produce exquisite desserts each day and spoil you with lovingly prepared cakes and pastries to go with your tea or coffee. Our carefully composed evening 5-course menus provide the tastbuds with all sort of surprises. We serve regional specialties of the countries we travel through, sophisticated menus, classic favourite dishes and vegetarian alternatives.
Shore Excursions
Excursions
All our cruises are designed so that you experience the best of the countries and regions that we travel through – primarily through our carefully planned programme of excursions with experienced English-speaking guides. How deeply you want to immerse yourself in a country and get to know its people is up to you. We offer you a range of different excursion packages that you can book at a discount in advance compared to paying for individual excursions on board.

A river cruise offers you what is probably the most comfortable way to discover new countries, cultures and people. You can, for example, enjoy a choice wine tasting in romantic Burgundy, visit vibrant cities like Amsterdam, Cologne or Budapest, take a walk along the Black Sea or visit the Dutch Keukenhof during the tulip season. Whatever you decide, all our excursions are unique and are sure to be unforgettable!
À la carte – or in a well-priced set of excursions
Owing to the variety of available excursions it’s often difficult to choose between them – so on each cruise we offer up to four tailor-made and carefully composed sets of excursions that you can book in advance at favourable prices. You can, of course, still book all excursions individually, à la carte, for the point is for you to be able to select the shore programme that suits you best.
The AMADEUS concierge service
Feel like discovering the regions we travel through on your own? In that case we recommend you take advantage of our exclusive onboard concierge service. Whether you just want to make a dinner reservation on shore, stroll around the shops, get tickets to a museum exhibition or plan a private city tour, our experienced and well-connected concierge is on hand to provide recommendations and assistance at any time during your planning and will always have useful addresses available.
Experienced tour managers: ashore and on board
Our experienced cruise managers on board look forward to acquainting you with the highlights of the last two millennia of European art and culture and providing you with insights into the life and history of the regions through which we travel. Experienced local tour guides also accompany our shore excursions. With their regional expertise and genuine enthusiasm you can be sure they will take you on inspiring voyages of discovery so that you can gain a full appreciation for the region and its culture.
Amadeus Audio-Guides
You will be provided with feather-light, wireless AMADEUS Audio Guides during all of the land excursions. The receiver is carried around the neck or in a pocket and practical headphones enable you to hear every word of your travel guide all the time. It provides maximum flexibility and convenience without missing a moment of fascinating commentary. Our AMADEUS Audio System is, of course, also compatible with hearing aids.
Complimentary bikes on board
Away from the normal routes there are also many wonderful sights that are worthwhile seeing. What better way of getting to know a country and its people is there than setting off on an individual shore excursion on a bike? You can borrow one of our onboard bikes, free of charge, if you want to be independent ashore - electrical bikes are also available on request.
