Expat Explore Story & History
Years ago, there was a young South African by the name of Carel Cronje, who traveled around Europe, ending up in Paris. using only public transport and walking, he managed to explore and become familiar with the city. On his last day, and as his funds were running low, he had a difficult decision to make; to have lunch, or go on an adventure to Disney Paris. True to the travelers spirit, he decided to go explore Disney Paris!
After this initial trip to Paris, he started to take his friends around the city of love, and joined forces with another Expat in Europe, Jakes Maritz. Together they started to lead tours around Europe, and as this venture of theirs grew, this was the birth of Expat Explore Tours.
They founded the company wanting to offer great value tours to those travelers wanting a once in a lifetime experience. Since 2005, Expat Explore Travel has been conducting expert-led coach tours to Europe and the UK. A small company started by two South African travelers, the company has grown to now run tours in Europe, Turkey, Greece, and Croatia - all the while focusing on the desire to share the knowledge and experience of amazing travel, at a competitive price.
