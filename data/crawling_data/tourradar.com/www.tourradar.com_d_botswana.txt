Highlights
Cruise along the intricate waterways of the spectacular Okavango Delta in a mokoro. Walk on islands to observe exotic wildlife through dense vegetation.
Observe the social dynamics of elephant herds as they arrive to quench their thirst at water bodies strewn across Chobe National Park.
Take a jeep safari through the Moremi Game Reserve, home to large concentrations of endangered wild dogs and other rare wildlife in their natural habit.
Spot rare white rhinos while on guided walks, night drives and game drives at the Mokolodi Game Reserve.
Marvel at the diverse eco system ranging from deltas, desert, rivers, salt pans and the associated wildlife as you traverse the landscape by coach.
Enjoy an adventurous safari through the wild and intensely stark landscape of the Kalahari Desert. Walk with Bushmen in Ghanzi, heart of the Kalahari Desert.
Feel the spiritual atmosphere in Tsodilo Hills, home to thousands of sacred Bushmen rock paintings.
Cross the enormous flat terrain of Makgadikgadi salt pans surrounded by massive baobab trees on its fringes. Watch herds of zebra make their annual migration when the region magically springs to life in the wet season.
Tips
Stick close to the group and follow the tour guide’s instructions on a walking tour. Don’t wear too much perfume or brightly colored clothes.
Never jog or run when wildlife is around as it may induce wild animals to attack.
Stay close to shallow waters while on a canoe safari and maintain adequate distance from hippos as they can be very dangerous.
An aerial trip over Okavango Delta will give you a bird’s eye view of attractions.
You can exchange money at banks found in Botswana’s major towns.
Opt for a guided tour as GPS in this region can be quite unreliable.
Avoid black or synthetic clothing. Wear lightweight cottons as the daytime temperatures can exceed 40 centigrade.
While on safari remember to wear sunscreen, a sunhat, sunglasses and after-sun lotion.
