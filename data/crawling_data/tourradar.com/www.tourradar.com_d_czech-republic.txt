Highlights
Stroll amidst the archeological wonders of the Jewish Quarter, Old Town and New Town in Prague. Savor the city’s highlights such as the medieval Charles Bridge and the splendors of the Prague Castle.
Discover the romance of river landscapes dotted by pretty parks, idyllic villages and fairylike castles as you journey along Vlatava River.
Visit the picture perfect Karlstejn Castle, nestled deep in a valley between forests covered hills.
Cycle past historical hamlets and see elegant churches and castles in the heart of the Bohemian hinterland.
Marvel at the glistening Neo Gothic chateau of Hluboka nad Vltavou and take a tour of stately rooms to discover its treasures.
Cycle along Moravian wine trails, around beautiful vineyards and rolling hills. Sample some delectable wine in the picturesque surroundings of Valtice and Mikulov.
Wander along the cobblestoned streets of medieval towns such as Telc and Cesky Krumlov.
Endure the challenging terrain of the National Park Podyji for breathtaking views of a river canyon.
Tips
Niche tours covering the history of communism in Prague or the legacy of the Habsburg dynasty offer deep insights into various facets of Czech heritage.
December to February is a good time to capture the country’s highlights in a snowy, winter setting.
The peak tourist season is from the end of May to August. Travelers can beat the crowds by visiting the country in the months of April, May, September and October.
Castles and chateaus often have several interesting events lined up for the summer months.
Budweiser beer was invented in Budejovice. Enjoy a taste of excellent Czech beer at a local beer bar or ‘hospoda’.
Prague’s Old Town and Wenceslas Square are good places to shop for souvenirs such as Bohemian crystals, glass, ceramics and handmade clothes.
Cycle tours are the perfect way to experience the Czech countryside.
Choose a bicycle tour depending the highlights, your fitness level and the tour duration.
