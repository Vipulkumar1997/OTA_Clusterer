Lycian Activity Week
Dingo Ways (from Byron Bay)
Group size is between 1 and 15 Inca Trail tours
Highlights
Go on a leisurely stroll to see onion shaped church domes, magnificent Tsarist palaces and other monumental relics, during a visit to the iconic Red Square in Moscow.
Spend an idyllic day cycling past vineyards and rolling hillsides, and stop to sample the wine in quaint, historic villages while you’re in Czech Republic’s South Moravia region.
Relax in Budapest’s elegant Gellert baths, and take in the gorgeous scenery that surrounds this exquisite Hungarian city.
Follow the romantic, medieval Saxon heritage trail in Romania, and pepper your trip with visits to fortified churches, castles and beautiful Transylvanian villages.
Ring in the New Year at the Market Square in Krakow, Poland, when the town is still decorated with all the magical festivities and fervour that accompanies Christmas.
Listen to the wind as it sweeps across mountain peaks and glacial lakes, on a hike through Slovakia’s High Tatras mountain range.
Enjoy the vigorous, bubbling energy of Belgrade’s cafes, bars and clubs.
Let go of your inhibitions and go on a thrilling, foam-covered river rafting expedition across River Struma in Bulgaria.
Tips
Learn a few terms such as ‘Dobroye utro’ meaning ‘Good Morning!’ or ‘Preevyet’ meaning ‘Hi!’ to strike up a conversation in Russia.
Don’t forget to catch an opera performance at the prestigious Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.
You can shop for Bohemian crystal and wood folk carvings in the Czech Republic.
Try some red paprika infused cuisine such as ‘csirke’, which is paprika chicken and ‘Kolbasz’, a paprika spiced sausage.
Change a little currency into Romanian Lei, as Euro is generally not accepted in Romania.
The best way to explore Bratislava, Slovakia’s capital city, is by foot. Pack comfortable and sturdy walking shoes.
Smoking is allowed in most places in Bulgaria, so be prepared to smell cigarette smoke even in public spaces.
Sample grilled meat delicacies such as ‘Raznjici’ (skewered meat) and ‘Pihtize’ (jellied duck or pork) in Belgrade, Serbia.
