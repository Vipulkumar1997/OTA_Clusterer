Highlights
Get a feel of Soviet, Ottoman and Italian influences as you stroll through the vibrant and colorful boulevards of Tirana, the capital city.
Take a dip in the marvelously colored waters at Dhermi, Saranda, Himara and Vlora and explore secrets hidden in the charming little bays dotting the beautiful Ionic Sea coast.
Step back in time as you marvel at interesting archaeological remains including the Roman amphitheatre in Durres, the abandoned city of Appolina, the imposing Ottoman era hill-top castles at Berat and Gjirokaster, and the stunning spectacle of Butrint.
Trek through pine scented forests and stop to enjoy breathtaking views before you reach the green carpeted environs of the Llogara National Park.
Look for colorful birdlife as you enjoy a ferry ride on Lake Koman. Go boating around the Karaburun Peninsula and explore mysterious caves.
Hike from Vlora to Dhermi, an unforgettable journey along winding mountain roads that offer panoramic views of lagoons, beaches and heavily wooded areas.
Climb the steep slopes of Mount Cika and be rewarded with marvelous views of wild mountainside and pristine beaches.
Cycle the road less traveled through mountains, sleepy villages, past gorges and lakes to reach Berat, a medieval town with pretty Ottomon houses on the hillside.
Tips
Shops and restaurants do not adhere to strict working hours but normally you can expect them to be open between 9am to 5pm. Museums are not open on Mondays.
Sometimes, prices may be written with an extra ‘0’ in terms of old currency.
Try and visit one of the larger malls such as Citypark, Tirana East Gate or QTU.
Carry sufficient cash since credit and debit cards have only come into use recently.
For a diversified itinerary, choose a tour that offers a multi-sport experience.
Stay and dine with a family in a mountain village to savor the true essence of Albania.
Sip on some Raki, a clear spirit made from grades and the national drink of Albania.
The body language to indicate ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ is opposite to what is normally practiced in the West.
