Belize Tours and Trips 2017/2018
16 trips through Belize with 7 reviews
Belize would have to be one of the last unspoiled places on earth – with its lush tropical rainforests, turquoise waters and secluded sandy beaches. Venture deep into the Belizean jungle to Mayan underground caves and archaelogical sites or try a cave tubing tour.

Highlights
Swim with nurse sharks and rays in the warm Caribbean waters of Shark Ray Alley at Hol Chan.
Go island hopping and spend a night on an uninhabited island, staring up at the beautiful night sky from your hammock.
Live the Caribbean pirate life by visiting local canteens and stock up on supplies for a great sea adventure.
Stay in a tree house suite, perched twenty feet above the rainforest canopy and the gorgeous Caves Branch River.
Rappel to the bottom of the Actun Loch Tunich limestone cave sinkhole to see spectacular rock formations.
Explore the Actun Tunichil Muknal caves and go for a quick swim in the refreshing and cool waters of the cave mouth.
Take a boat ride down Monkey River and observe iguanas, howler monkeys, tropical birds and crocodiles in their natural habitat.
Enjoy a romantic afternoon picnic on the sandy banks of your own private island at Goff’s Caye.
Tips
Avoid sitting directly under a coconut tree which has brown coconuts as this indicates that it’s ripe and ready to fall.
Don’t touch the coral while snorkeling or diving as the barrier reef is very fragile. Your tour guide will give you instructions before you set off.
English is widely spoken in Belize and near the Guatemalan and Mexican borders you’ll also hear lots of Spanish.
At dawn and early dusk, remember to wear long pants and some insect repellent.
Keep a few lollipops and chewing gum in your pockets to hand out to local children.
Ask permission before you take photographs of locals.
Get used to a slower pace of life while on the islands and be prepared to wait beyond the appointed time.
A 10% tip applies for taxis and at restaurants, hotels and excursions.
Belize Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"This magnificent tour takes to you to some of the most fascinating and beautiful places with lots of fun things to do along the way. The accommodations were neat and clean and were in stunning locations. Our tour guide was brilliant, friendly and well-informed. This was an great tour that I highly recommend to everyone who wants to to experience Belize."
Mayan Sun–Northbound
"My first tour with Tucan was such a delight. Our tour guide (Scott) was pretty impressive with his job considering it was his first time in Central America. He was always ready to help and was very attentive to our needs. Some of the accommodations were nice and others were basic. There were some unfavorable parts on the tour, like the transportation which was a hassle since we had to walk from the station to the hotel and van or taxis were not provided. But despite that, we still had a wonderful time since we got to see amazing sights. My only suggestion is to include a detour to a must see attraction which is the shrine of Guadalupe."
Mexico City to Antigua
"The trip to Belize was more than what I had expected. Everything in the trip was great, the food, the other travellers and the staff at Pook's Hill were all excellent, the night hike, the canoeing, and of course the ATM cave was amazing. I would recommend this trip to anyone looking for a challenging adventure."
