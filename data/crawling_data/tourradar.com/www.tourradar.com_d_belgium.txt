Highlights
Cycle through the magical town of Bruges, famous for its small canals, fascinating museums and architectural wealth from the Renaissance period and before.
Be spellbound by the captivating town square, the Gothic town hall and the many elegant guild houses in Brussels.
Revel in the festivities around the Grote Market and treat yourself to hot chocolate or the famous Belgian beer while in Antwerp.
Wander through the charming cobble-stoned streets and alleys to see historic landmarks of Ghent’s old town area.
Savor the distinct flavours of delectable Belgian chocolate.
Cycle to the country’s best breweries and taste unique beer flavours such as Lambic, Chimay, Triple and many more.
Cruise in comfort and style on a small barge along winding rivers and picturesque channels on River Schelde.
Visit the gorgeous seaside resort of Blankenberge where you can go for a relaxing swim in the sea or take a nap on the sandy beach.
Tips
Belgium has three official languages:  Dutch, French and German; but most young people understand English.
If you’ve ordered a heavy beer, don’t drink it straight from the bottle.
The locals drink alcohol mostly for the taste and not to get drunk so don’t go overboard while on a beer tour.
Remember that it’s impolite to snap your fingers and or to slap someone on the back. It’s considered rude and offensive.
Don’t worry if you haven’t bought chocolates during your trip. You can buy some at the Brussels International Airport- commonly called ‘The world’s biggest chocolate selling point’.
It is illegal to wear clothing that covers the face such as the burka and nikab.  It will result in a hefty fine or detention and there is no exemption for tourists.
Carry extra cash as you may have to pay an entrance fee to enter certain cathedrals and churches. Your tour guide will keep you informed of when and how much you have to pay.
