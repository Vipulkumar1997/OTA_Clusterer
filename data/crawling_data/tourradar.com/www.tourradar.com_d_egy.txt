View the pyramids of Giza from camelback before heading on a dinner cruise complete with belly dance shows.
Descend into a network of underground passages and tombs at the Roman burial sites in Alexandria.
Travel to Aswan aboard a sleeper train.  Join a local family for dinner at their home.
Shop the madness of the Khan-el-Khalili market in Cairo before relaxing at one of its many coffee houses.

Take a horse-drawn carriage to Karnak to see one of the world's most celebrated temple complexes.
Tips
The official language of Egypt is Arabic.  English is widely spoken in Egypt
The currency of Egypt is called the Egyptian pound.  Credit cards are widely accepted and ATM’s are fairly easy to find.
Service charges that have been included on your bill go to the restaurant, not the waiter.  Be sure to tip the servers 10% in addition by handing it to them directly.
Don’t leave Egypt without a water pipe, Papyrus scrolls and a Bedouin head scarf.
Pack loose layers of natural fibres.  Dress conservatively while in Egypt.  Avoid short tops, skirts, shorts and tight clothing when outside of tourist areas.
Try the national dish of Kushari!  Don’t drink the tap water.  It’s safer to stick with bottled water.
On average, only an inch of rain falls in Egypt per year!
Cairo is home to Africa’s only subway.
Egypt Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"We had an incredible tour in Egypt. Our tour guide (Sameh) was awesome as he was very knowledgeable and passionate about his country. The tour offered the most amazing sights, people, food and guide. This was a very memorable experience."
Essential Egypt
"It was my first time to travel with Topdeck and I had an amazing experience. I was impressed by all aspects of the tour especially our tour guide (Waleed) who did a great job in making the trip memorable. I recommend this tour to anyone who wants to experience the Egyptian culture and explore the country and don't miss the hot air ballooning over The Valley of the Kings and Felucca cruise down the Nile river."
Egypt Express
"It was a once in a lifetime experience joining the Egypt tour. We saw some incredible sights, met wonderful people and enjoyed what the country had to offer. The people in Egypt were so welcoming and friendly. Sameh our tour guide was just awesome, he made us feel safe and was very knowledgeable and we learned so much about the Egyptian history."
