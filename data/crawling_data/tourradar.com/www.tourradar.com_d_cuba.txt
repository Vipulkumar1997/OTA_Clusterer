Highlights
Weave your way through the streets of Havana in a classic 50’s convertible.
Go snorkeling alongside rich marine life and amazing coral reefs.
Put your Salsa lessons to good use at a festive Cuban street party.
Horse-drawn carriages and pastel houses make the town of Trinidad a photographer’s dream.  Sip on a pineapple soda as you stroll through the “museum of Cuba”.
Be moved by the tributes to Che Guevara.  See the museum, the eternal flame and the bronze statue that graces his mausoleum.
See Cuba as Hemingway did.  Sit next to a life-size statue of him at the El Floridita and visit his home of 20 years, Finca La Vigía.
Horseback ride through the valley of Viñales to see the unusual limestone pincushion hills.
Learn how world famous Cuban cigars are made in a “vega” or cigar factory.
Tips
The official language of Cuba is Spanish.  Practice a few phrases before you arrive.
The Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC) and the Cuban Peso (CUP) are the two currencies in Cuba.  Credit cards are not widely accepted and debit cards are unreliable.
Street vendor food is cheap and tasty.  Tap water in Cuba is not considered safe to drink.
Don’t leave Cuba without cigars, rum and a local artist’s painting.
Pack casual summer clothes, but bring something a bit smarter for dining out.  Be prepared for cool evenings in the winter.
A tip of 5-10% is reasonable if gratuities haven’t already been included in your bill.
From the air, Cuba resembles a crocodile.  It is often referred to as "El Cocodrilo".
Cuba is one of two countries forbidden to sell Coca-Cola products. The other is North Korea.
Cuba Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"We had a fantastic trip and got to experience Cuban life and culture. Our tour guide (Rioger Guilarte) was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The tour had a nice balance of accommodation and activities. We visited the Cuban fishing village for a meal and stayed in Casas which made the trip memorable. We truly experienced the real Cuba and will surely do it again."
Cuba Libre
"The itinerary on the Cuba tour was impeccable since it gave us enough time to explore each destinations and an opportunity to see the beauty of the country. We loved the accommodations and enjoyed everything that Cuba has to offer."
Cubano Jazz
"Our tour in Cuba was a once in a lifetime experience. We were lucky to have such an amazing tour guide. She was sincere that she didn't know everything since she was new but we appreciated her honesty. We learned a lot about the people, culture and history of Cuba. The accommodations were fantastic and the food was excellent. Every towns and cities were rich in history but Baracoa and Camaguey were my favourite places. It was a superb experience and I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to have a Cuban adventure."
