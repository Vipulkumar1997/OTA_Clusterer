Highlights
Try some Turkish Delight at a candy shop that’s been in the same location for over 230 years.
Visit the remarkable Grand Bazaar to practice your haggling skills.
Relax in a tea garden at the base of the castle walls, in Amasra.
Take a dip in the hot springs, believed to have therapeutic powers in Roman times.
Witness the natural phenomenon of the Chimera, natural flames springing from the rock, that have burned ceaselessly for millennia.
Take a hot air balloon ride over the mystical Cappadocia region.
Take a tour of impressive art work and murals, on the streets of Sishane.
Relax, while enjoying a belly dance performance at one of the many ancient Turkish baths.
Tips
Not many people speak English in Turkey, but the Turkish people are friendly and eager to help.
Street food can be purchased for one lira and can be very filling.  Don’t even brush your teeth with tap water.
Use bottled water at all times.
The currency in Turkey is the Turkish Lira.  Carry a mixture of cash and credit cards.
Don’t leave Turkey without spices, carpets, and at least one evil eye to protect you against envy and bad will.
Winter months are really cold and wet, while summer months are hot and dry.  You’ll need to cover shoulders and bare legs, when visiting any mosques or religious sites.
Tips are generally modest in Turkey, usually no more than a few percent of the price paid.
To decline an offer, people often just put their hand onto their heart.
Turkish soap operas are hugely popular.  Almost every Turkish region has its own.
Turkey Tours and Trips 2017/2018  Reviews
"The “Absolute Turkey” tour with G Adventures is just fantastic! This has been my favourite out of all the  different tour companies in different countries I’ve been with before. It covers everything you want to do in Turkey from adventures to relaxation. It is a busy tour but when you don’t feel rushed it can be done so well. I have been recommending this to friends ever since."
Absolute Turkey
"The “Blue Lagoon” journey on the gulet in Turkey has been fantastic. I enjoyed all the amazing colours of the sea while on board great people and a supercrew. Being on the water for a week was an awesome experience that I will never forget. I highly recommend this trip to everyone!"
Blue Lagoons (6 destinations)
"A well organised tour embracing history, geography, culture and economics of Turkey that is indeed a great value for money. The pre-organised tours saved me from long ticket queues. The guide was very helpful with his recommendations. It is such a beautiful, clean, and marvelous country."
