Highlights
Explore the forgotten world of Europe’s far north where the indigenous Sami people have zealously preserved their distinct culture and identity.
Visit an authentic reindeer farm in Rovaniemi and take pictures with Santa Claus at the Santa Claus Village.
Traverse the Finnish waterways in a canoe expedition on River Hossanjoki or indulge in surfing, boating or fishing in the waters of Lakeland.
Wander through mysterious Finnish forests in lush Hossa, picking wild berries and mushrooms along the way.
Take your pick of winter adventure activities at the Levi Ski Resort in Lapland. Go horse riding, cross country skiing, downhill skiing, snowshoe hiking, ice-karting and if you’re feeling particularly daring, try ice swimming.
Spend a day learning age old survival technique of trappers. Have fun trying to build igloos, go ice fishing in frozen lakes and pick up some handy fish-smoking tips.
Set your eyes on the grand Aland Sea and stupendous Turku archipelago. Go island hopping, taking in the imperial sights of medieval cathedrals and castles.
Admire Helsinki’s avant-garde architecture, visit the eclectic cafes and shops and enjoy the nightlife of the vibrant Design District.
Tips
Don’t be surprised to see people walking with poles. Nordic Walking is a common activity in this country.
Sip on water, beer or cider to stay hydrated while you’re in a sauna.
Be careful near cliff edges and waterfalls as there may not be safety rails or ropes.
Don’t make comparisons of Finland with Sweden and other neighboring countries while talking to Icelanders.
Remember to place your order at the bar and then head to a table. Avoid waiting for a server especially if you’re in a rush.
Try some of the local cuisine such as ‘Kalakukko’ (rye loaf stuffed with fish), sautéed reindeer, and ‘Karjalanpiirakka’ (a kind of savory pastry).
If you’re invited for a meal, don’t leave before kahvi (coffee) and pulla (bun) are served.
Remember to remove your shoes and place them outside before you enter a house.
Check with your tour guide before you decide to go on a solo trekking expedition.
