This covers you for costs if you suddenly find you can't go on your trip for some unforeseen reason such as illness, an accident or the death of a close relative. Cancellation cover starts as soon as you buy a policy, so you if you want to be covered for longer, you may want to to buy travel insurance when you start booking tickets and not the week before you leave.
