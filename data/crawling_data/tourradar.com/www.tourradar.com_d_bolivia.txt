Bolivia Tours and Trips 2017/2018
50 trips through Bolivia with 5 reviews
Few places in the world can boast that they once had the richest and largest silver mine (Cerro Rico), the largest salt flat (Salar de Uyuni) and that Bolivia is the birthplace of the Inca empire (Sun Island). Here a vibrant indigenous culture exists from the Amazon basin to the Andes ranges.

Highlights
Discover the relevance of magic rites and age-old traditions in the Witch Doctor’s Market of La Paz.
Enjoy the thrill of a lifetime descending the dangerously snaking Death Road in the Yungas forest region.
Take a 4-wheel drive across the eerie terrain of Salar de Uyuni. Walk across the salt flats, taking in the amazing and surreal landscapes of multi colored mountains, vividly colored lagoons, volcanoes and uniquely shaped rock formations.
Explore the spectacular pre Inca ruins at Tiwanaku and marvel at the megalithic architectural wonders of pyramids and subterranean temples.
Hike to the highest city in the world, Potosi, and tour the once prosperous silver mines at Cerra Rico.
Relax by Copacabana beach or stroll through its charming colonial markets and squares against the backdrop of extraordinary white-capped mountains.
Cruise along the mighty Amazon River at the Madidi National Park and observe exotic flora and fauna including birds, alligators, piranhas, capybaras, pink dolphins and anacondas.
Join the challenging Cordirella Real Trek, passing by breathtaking scenery of subtropical forests, Aymara villages, and high alpine valleys to reach snow capped mountains.
Tips
Always ask before taking pictures of indigenously dressed men and women.
Never refer to indigenous people as ‘Indos’ as they consider this to be highly offensive and racist.
Shop for interesting products such as alpaca and llama wool scarves, wood carvings, gold and silver ornaments and weaved goods in the markets of Sucre.
Exploring the mines of Potosi would be difficult for those who experience claustrophobia. It is an exercise that involves groveling inside dusty and small tunnels.
If you experience altitude sickness when flying into La Paz, try sipping on coca tea.
Go on an Amazon cruise in Bolivia as it’s cheaper than in neighboring countries like Brazil.
Plan your hiking and trekking trips carefully since floods and landslides in mountain areas are a common feature in the rainy season of November to March.
Carry extra change to give tienda owners, taxi drivers and restaurant waitresses.
