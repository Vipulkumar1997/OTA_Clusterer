Highlights
Cruise past Sognefjord’s cascading waterfalls and lush mountainsides, in the heart of Norway’s fjord land.
Feast on slabs of succulent salmon and cod in Bergen’s historic timber framed taverns.
Explore Stockholm’s exquisite Baroque architecture by day, and party the night away in its bohemian bars.
Paddle, swim and camp as you please, and choose paths never travelled before in the raw wilderness that surrounds Sweden’s St. Anna archipelago.
Ride with reindeers, meet Santa Claus in his village, and discover thrilling adventures in Lapland’s snowy landscapes.
Search for Narwah whales, as they poke their tusks from freezing waters and observe polar bears, as they plod across snowy fields in the Northeast Greenland National Park.
Spend some time relaxing in the geothermal waters of Ice Land’s Blue Lagoon, set against the surreal backdrop of lava fields.
Sail amidst powder blue icebergs of various shapes and sizes, in the ever-changing landscape of the Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon, in Iceland.
Tips
Plan your visit any time between September and April, to witness the fascinating spectacle of the Northern Lights.
Visit the islands for an up-close look at Viking heritage and Sweden’s royal grandeur.
Go on a ferry trip to Norway’s Geirangerfjord to see impressive waterfalls and abandoned farms.
You can try Norwegian delicacies such as ‘bacalao’ (spiced cod stew) and roasted reindeer or elk.
If you’re in the mood to go hiking or canoeing, then head to Finland’s Hossa and Oulanka National Parks.
Shop for international fashion brands, Dala wooden toys, hand knitted sweaters and Sami handicrafts in Stockholm.
For a bit of adventure, hike through Iceland’s popular Laugavegurrin trail that covers volcanic terrain, icy rivers and snowfields.
Sip on Brennivin, Iceland’s signature schnapps drink, that pairs well with pork and seafood.
