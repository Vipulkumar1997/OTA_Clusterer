Highlights
Sit quietly in amazement with majestic mountain gorillas in the verdant mountainside of Parc National des Volcans.
Pay your respects at the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre, a well-conceived museum in honor of genocide victims.
Follow in the footsteps of Dian Fossey as you hike up to her grave site or go on a trek in search of playful Golden Monkeys.
Savor an African safari inside the Akagera National Park as you spot elephants, hippos, zebra and buffaloes in their natural habitat.
Go trekking in the Nyungwe Forest National Park against the striking background of fern fringed waterfalls and epic mountain scenery.
Explore the magnificent play of light in the volcanically formed caves at Musange.
Spend some memorable and relaxing moments on the white sandy beaches of Lake Kivu.
Discover old colonial charm on the streets of Huye (Butare) as you make your way to the National Museum.
Tips
Wear long trousers and sleeved shirts to counter mosquitoes. Use bed nets and mosquito coils to keep them at bay while you sleep.
When visiting Lake Kivu, only swim in the designated areas as other regions could be dangerous. The lake sits on pockets of Carbon Dioxide and Methane gas.
Carry a strong non-plastic bag while shopping as plastic bags are banned in Rwanda.
Some of the handicrafts to shop for include wood carvings, raffia work baskets, traditional masks, paintings, scarves and beadings.
You have to be 18 years or older to go gorilla trekking and 16 years or older to go chimp trekking.
It is considered insensitive to ask someone about their ethnic origin in Rwanda.
Stay with your tour group, remain vigilant and avoid getting involved in political demonstrations.
Some of the local delicacies to be sampled include ‘brochette’ or a skewer of goat meat, and ‘tilapia’- a delicious white fish found in Lake Kivu.
