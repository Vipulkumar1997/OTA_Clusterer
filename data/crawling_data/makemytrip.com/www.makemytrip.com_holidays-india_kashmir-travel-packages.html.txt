ABOUT PACKAGE
Ladakh is the land of mountain passes, soaring peaks, frozen rivers, turquoise lakes, peaceful shrines and historical sites. If you want to see all such places in one go, then pick this tour package by MakeMyTrip! During your vacation, you would go on a sightseeing tour of Leh, visiting historically significant places like the Hall of Fame and Sham valley. Capture a marvellous sunset in your camera from Shanti Stupa. A key highlight of this tour is a visit to the Aryan Village in Kargil.
The Aryans of Ladakh stand out as tall, (going up to 6'-6"), sharp-featured with big eyes and a fair complexion. They are very protective about themselves and are, understandably, reluctant to open up so easily to "outsiders"
This community is believed to be the last race of Aryans, confined to the valley. With their pure Aryan features, these people seemed to have preserved their racial purity down the centuries.
A visit to Lamayuru and Gurdwara Pathar Sahib will acquaint you with the region's religious harmony, whereas Magnetic Hill and Indus-Zanskar confluence will take you closer to nature. Yet another highlight of this Ladakh package is a drive over Khardung La and Chang La, two of the highest motorable roads on earth. You will also get a chance to stay at Nubra valley overnight & will go on a Full Day excursion to the famous Pangong Tso Lake !

Kashmir Travel Packages - Sightseeing/Activities/Places Of Interest
The moment you step in Kashmir, you feel like you have entered a Van Gogh painting where you see one beautiful vista after another. The snow-clad Himalayas, pristine valleys, floating markets on the shimmering Dal Lake and everything that Kashmir boasts of have been reasons for three 20th century wars. Binding three different worlds into one state, Jammu & Kashmir is a favourite among tourists looking for a spiritual, adventurous or a romantic holiday. Jammu, the state with the dominant Hindu population, is an important hub for domestic pilgrims. Kashmir with its majority of Muslim population is called India’s Switzerland. Ladakh on the other hand, has predominantly Buddhist population.
