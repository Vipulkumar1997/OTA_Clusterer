Air Asia Baggage Rules

Air Asia has some liberal policies regarding baggage allowance. Domestic baggage allowance is focused in different categories, such as 15kg/ 20kg/ 25kg/ 30kg/ 40kg. Checked baggage weight can be shared with passengers in the same booking number.
Every item needs to weigh less than 32kg, and is subject to stringent health and safety requirements. Guests checking in baggage, which exceeds pre-booked allowance, are charged on a per kg basis as per the airline’s fee schedule.
Alternatively, guests may purchase 15kg excess baggage for both domestic and international sectors. In fact, the airline also allows passengers to check in small musical items, such as cello, guitar, viola or violin, which exceed baggage dimensions but remain within 75kg category.
Airports served for Air Asia India

With more people travelling by low-cost carriers, foreign airlines were keen on being a part of the Indian aviation sector. Keeping true to its motto ‘Now everyone can fly’, Air Asia decided to establish its operations in India in June 2014. A joint venture between Air Asia Berhad, Tata Sons and Telstra, it also marks Tata’s return to the aviation industry after six decades. Headquartered in Chennai, Air Asia has become the first foreign airline to set up a subsidiary in India. It started operations in the country with rock-bottom airfares at Re. 1 (base fare). The company’s first aircraft was an Airbus A320, and since then, Air Asia India has managed to expand its fleet to multiple aircrafts to meet the rapidly growing needs of domestic air traffic.
