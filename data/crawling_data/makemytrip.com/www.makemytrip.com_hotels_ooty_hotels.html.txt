Amazing place to relax and get away from the hustling city. Very clean and great service by the staff. Good food and good options for veg and non-veg. Room service was good and catered to our needs very well. Good security while we were out for a walk in the night. They provide cycles to use inside the property which is very good.

A good place to stay in Ooty with awesome views of the valley. The location of the hotel should not be a problem as long as you can manage with your own transportation. Their multi bed rooms are more like apartments perfect for family stay. If they can fix a few minor issues with general cleanliness related, that will be all.
