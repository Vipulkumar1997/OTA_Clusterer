ABOUT PACKAGE
Ever fancied how it feels to walk on ice? Well, you could experience it by signing up for a Chaddar Trek expedition. Starting from Tilad Do, the trek cuts and runs through the gigantic snow-covered mountains eloped in clouds, ice-clogged lake, mountain caves, snow bound villages and high canyon walls that barely lets sunlight pass in. Thrilling and extremely fascinating, the trek will introduce you to the offbeat places of Ladakh where there's nothing around but vast stretches of ice sheet. Further adding to the intrigue is the -30 degrees temperature that one has to survive while walking on slippery rocks. This winter, if its adventure that’s on your mind, then look no further and book this package to Chadar Trek.

Ladakh
Still untouched by modernity, Ladakh is where you’ll see life come to a standstill and (really) witness a true communion with nature. The stillness of this place can make anyone go nostalgic.
Places to visit
Leh Palace -
Built in mid-16th century, the palace was the world’s highest building at that time. Make your way around its dark corridors and hidden passageways, gaze upon the murals depicting the Buddha’s life and find peace in the palace’s prayer room.
Shanti Stupa
-The white-domed structure perched on a hilltop was built by Japanese monks to promote world peace. Not only is it of religious significance, but it also offers one of the best views of Leh.
Stok Palace & Museum -
The palace is home to the exiled royal family. It houses a museum where royal artefacts, jewellery, and costumes are displayed. Some of the thangkas (paintings on silk) are said to date back to the 16th century.
​Spituk Gompa -
This late 14th century monastery is perched on a hillock near Spituk village. It houses a golden-roofed shrine, Skodong Lakhang, as well as ancient masks and arms. There is also a massive statue of Mahakal that is unveiled during the Spitok festival.
Pangong Tso -
Situated at a height of 4,250 metres, Pangong Tso is the highest lake in the world. With its crystal clear water, the surrounding mountains and the tranquil surroundings, it’s not hard to imagine why Pangong Tso means “the enchanted lake” in Tibetan.
Where to Eat in Ladakh
Popular restaurants include Tenzin Dickey Tibetan and Tibetan Kitchen for local delicacies, Chopsticks and Lamayuru for Chinese and Pan-Asian and the garden restaurant La Pizzeria for excellent pizzas and soups. Also try Pumpernickel German Bakery for homemade cakes, tarts and a hearty breakfast menu.
Top Adventure Sports people are enjoying in Ladakh
Biking at Khardung La Pass -
Welcome to Khardungla Pass, the highest motorable road in the world. A road widening exercise is going on in the whole of Ladakh, which means loads of cement, gravel stones and dirt along the path. So pray that rain stays at bay; or you'll end driving to the top through knee-deep slush of mud and stone.
White Water Rafting at Zanskar -
The best time to go rafting in Ladakh is in the months of May-June. Ladakh offers many scenic and swift flowing rivers and streams. In recent years, Sangam - the confluence of Zanskar and Indus - has become one of the top destinations for lovers of white water rafting.
Camping at Pangong Tso -
The lake is bewitchingly beautiful. It has been airbrushed in God’s own Photoshop. Every colour and hue comes alive with a greater intensity and seems different at different times of the day. The sight is at its most magical at dusk, when the setting sun sets ablaze the brown hills, reflected as a golden shimmer in the blue water of the lake.
Paragliding from the Khardung La -
An awesome experience to fly with the clear blue skies above you and the dull hills below taking in the fresh air of the mountains. Paragliding opens up new vistas of Ladakh’s beauty which would otherwise go unnoticed.
