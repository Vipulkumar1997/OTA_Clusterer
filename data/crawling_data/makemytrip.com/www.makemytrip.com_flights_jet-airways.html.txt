Jet Airways History


Jet Airways
is based in Mumbai, operating domestic (India) and international flight services. The second-largest private airline of India, Jet Airways operates more than 400 daily flights to 65 destinations across the world. Incorporated as an 'Air Taxi' on April 1st, 1992, Jet Airways offers relatively low costs by international standards and often provides economical and discounted airfares, especially on booking through the Internet. It has been able to lower its costs by 'sweating its assets' i.e. getting maximum utilization out of its fleet by minimizing turnaround time between flights. With frequent flights, at all possible timings to each sector of India, this (Jet Airways) airline provides convenience and services within a league of its own.
Jet Airways Airlines
also operates two low-cost airlines, namely JetLite and Jet Konnect.
