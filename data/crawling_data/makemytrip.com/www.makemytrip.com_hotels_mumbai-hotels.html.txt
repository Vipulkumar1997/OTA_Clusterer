The hotel is good for stay situated near airport but has no lift facility. Its a budget hotel. Rooms are not that spacious as expected. The metro facility is near and you have a couple of restruants for good food

Altogether it was a good experience.
Very near to the Railway Station
They did not have a restaurant of their own and hence had to arrange food from outside. Even though the Breakfast was complimentary, there was no choice as the hotel did not have a restaurant.

We had booked our stay with Vivanta President to celebrate our 1st wedding anniversary and my husband had planned a surprise cake and bouquet for me which was confirmed by the hotel staff, unfortunately never received the bouquet and my hubby really had to follow up for cake which spoiled the surprise of course.
Stay wise it was decent, the room was perfect, food was good (though the staff wasn't well informed about food vouchers etc.
Overall decent stay but not for imp days. :)

We booked this hotel as we were transiting from Singapore to Raipur via Mumbai. Very conveniently located close to airport. Only half an hour away from the Mumbai international airport. The rooms were clean and cozy. Location is the plus point. We had 12 hours for our next flight and we wanted a safe family place to crash on. Did not disappoint

Peaceful location with good services and facilities. Staff are helpful to provide customized services as per requirement.
Have booked twin bed as only single bed rooms were available while booking on MMT. Hotel staff are cooperative to make it single bed and also served breakfast in room as per request. Nice location except beach is not clean. You can enjoy beach view from poolside view rooms. Rooms are small and overall hotel required some maintenance work considering it is a five star property.

One of the best service I have ever experienced was from this hotel.
Bottomline - the service there is first class! The room is good - the view from the room was AMAZING, the pool was AMAZING, the beach in front of the hotel was AMAZING.
