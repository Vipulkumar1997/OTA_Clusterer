3. A home to Calangute and Baga beach

The town of Calungute is located on the shores of the Arabian Sea and is a perfect amalgamation of long sandy beaches topped with restaurants, bars (Calangute beach) and popular water sports (Baga beach). The Calangute weekly market is spotted with leather goods, colorful textiles and Tibetan handicrafts. This one of the best spots to begin with on your Goa tour plan.

4. A colonial era artefact

To the south of Calangute, the town of Candolim rests standing on the shores of the Arabian Sea. This town faces the walls of ‘fort Aguda’ on the South, a Portuguese rule artefact surrounding a 19th century lighthouse. These historical sites with scenic water views are blessed with modest beaches and adjacent eateries. This place gives you a combination of music, food, entertainment and shopping.

5. A peaceful walk and dolphin watching

The ‘Arambol beach’ is a less commercialised beach as compared to other Goan beaches in the North. The best way to approach this beach is by renting a bike and going on paragliding adventures, all of which will take you less than a day. Expect a peaceful environment and a quiet beach in Arambol. You can go watch dolphins too; wont that be something special!

What to eat
The list of Goan delicacies goes on and on.  Whether it is seafood in ‘Portuguese-style’ variants or modified versions of popular snack foods, it is a table of delights worth exploring.
1. The Portuguese cutlets recipe

The inclusion of this food item will complete your Goan tour package. ‘Prawn rissois’ are typically the same as cutlets, except that they are Portuguese in origin and have prawns inside. The prawns are cooked in a delicious mix of white-cheesy sauce, stuffed inside flour pockets, rolled in breadcrumbs and deep fried. Enjoy this delight with a generous helping of mayonnaise or cream.



2. Goan bakery delights
Here is a series of Goan sweets that has coconut in all but are different in their preparation, ingredients and taste. The ‘boll’ (large, hard, sweet, cookie-like), ‘dodol’ (soft, pudding-like, flour-jaggery based dessert), ‘dosh’ (melt-in-mouth dessert like ‘barfi’), and ‘bebinka’ (layered cake) are some of the recommended ones. The ‘bebinka’ is a Goan bakery delight baked in a traditional stone oven. Sounds authentic!

3. A health food titan goes hand in hand with ‘samosa’
Everyone loves ‘samosa’, an all-time favourite Indian snack food. The traditional samosa varieties, with fillings of potato, green peas and vegetables are mouth-watering. But you haven’t tried it all until you have had these ‘Goan beetroot samosa’. Food lovers will have a good time enjoying this relishing recipe.

4. Don’t afford to miss out on this delicacy on your Goa trip
Yes, it’s special and delicious at the same time. The ‘rava fried fish’ is a seafood delight in which the fish is cut open, cleaned and stuffed with a paste of garlic, ginger and red chillies. The result is a mouth-watering, crunchy delight that will give you sublime memories about Goan food.

5. The Goan bread cutlet
The Goan bread has a line of happy customers all over the state for more than 20+ years. Combine it your choicest chicken, pork, or beef cutlet, along with a whole lot of salad, spicy and tangy sauce - it becomes the whole deal. This ‘Goan cutlet pav’ is the Goan happy snack for a perfect evening. While roaming on your Goa tour, grab a bite of this Goan burger from one of the stalls and munch on.

6. Dedicated to the non-veg lovers
Goa boasts of a variety of bakery and fried food items bustling on their road-side stalls, all of them beyond exceptionally good in taste. Goa’s unique and age-old bakeries have different versions of beef croquettes, beef chops, egg chops, fish chops and prawn chops. The ‘beef croquettes’, a clear favourite here, is highly recommended. Indeed, this is a compulsory food item on your Goa trip plan.
7. A gentle touch of chicken and happy tears
‘Chicken cafreal’ is yet another Portuguese style of cooking Goan chicken. This one has rum and vinegar as special ingredients to make the chicken meat real tender and soft. Served on a long platter with a blanket of spicy gravy, this street food will make you cry happy tears.


8. Crispy outside and soft inside
We are referring to the ‘rice pooris’ here. The Goans have devised a way to make the best version of every best-selling Indian snack food. This is an easy to make rice flour poori that locals and tourists both love to have. And indeed, this one tastes better than the casual poori. Don’t believe it? Make a note to drop in on any one of the street vendors and try it for yourself on your Goa trip plan.
​
Going beyond the beaches in Goa
All great things come in small packages and so does the fun in vacationing. Try to find pleasure in the smaller events happening all around. Goa is indeed a beautiful place, full of surprises and exciting explorations. Plan wisely and make your Goa tour count as one of the best vacations of your life.

1. Go subtle and do a crowd watching
Take it easy on your Goa vacation. If you see a crowd dancing to the beats of the drums, or a DJ playing his best tracks, instead of just diving into what you know will be an expected outcome, stay around a little longer. Watch the crowd move and sway to the melody of the waves and beats. Go into a conscious mode of observing the different variety of crowd that has gathered to make the scene look better - their body expressions, dressing sense and the untold language of human nature. But, just don’t freak anyone out with a constant stare!

2. Roam around the local markets at night
Though Goa is full of beaches, it has an equal number of street and flea markets surrounding these scenic locations. You will taste a different feel as the evening approaches. A shroud of mystery lurks in the corners and every gathering looks like a small beach party about to start. Though much alive during the day, the local street and flea markets with their endless collection of souvenirs, handicrafts and colourful stone jewellery, take a new shape. Explore these markets starting eve, if you want to experience an entirely different outlook of Goa. ‘Arpora Saturday night market’ is one good option. Surely your Goa tour package will have one or two of these locations.

3. Spend a day out in one of the wildlife sanctuaries
As part of your family Goa tour plan, take your family out to a wild-life experience in any one of the several wildlife settlements located there. Wherever you are, you can never be that far from any of these parks. The Mollem national park (eastern border), Cotigao wildlife sanctuary (Cancona, south Goa) and Bondla wildlife sanctuary (north-eastern Goa) are few of the recommendable ones for their varied wildlife, species of local and migratory birds, and their local flora and fauna, unique to the ecosystem.

4. Finding age-old treasures
Explore the medieval relics with your friends on your upcoming honeymoon Goa tour. Rent a bike from one of the many bike vendors and go on to explore, with only the GPS as your guide. Go on a church search, or be on the lookout for any historical and architectural marvels.
You should be able to easily find the following: The Bom Jesus Basilica, The Se Cathedral, The church of St. Francis of Assisi, and The church of ‘our lady of the immaculate conception’ with its beautiful statue of ‘Mother Mary’.
Leave an endless trail of adventures behind with happy memories from your Goan holiday.

Pre Tour Feedback By
SAMI PATEL
I recently availed of your monsoon package to Goa along with my parents.
This was o
ur first interaction with your company and I?m writing this letter to convey our full satisfaction with the services provided, pee-tour as well as on-tour.
Throughout my interaction with your staff, Mr. Prafull Pitale and Ms. Ketki Chiplunkar, both were extremely warm, courteous and receptive to all our needs. I was particularly apprehensive concerning my parents, since both are 70 years old. However, your staff provided us with the confidence of going ahead with the booking and left no stone unturned to make the process smooth.
Having worked with global MNC?s such as McDonald?s, Emirates, etc., I do recognize and appreciate good customer service. I can say with my experience of over a dozen years that Mr. Pitale and Ms. Chiplunlar exemplify the true ideals of fabulous customer service that all customers look for. They are fantastic brand ambassadors for your company and therefore, assets to your esteemed organization. With their honest hard-work and dedication, I am sure they will speedily move up the corporate ladder.
Concerning our stay in Goa, we simply loved the location of the Taj property at Fort Aguada, the lavish buffets served, as well as the etiquette of the staff. We have provided them our feedback too.
Best Regards,
Sami Patel
