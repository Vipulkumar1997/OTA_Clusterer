package for a melting pot of Indian and colonial traditions. It is the stronghold of varied traditions, religion, arts, cuisine and dance forms. It not only enjoys the lushness of its ethos, but also makes efforts to preserve the antiquity of the region.
Explore this rich culture through Kooditayattam, a traditional Sanskrit theatre, which has been announced as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. A Kerala tour package must also include an experience of its traditional festivals such as Onam or Vishu, which are celebrated with great pomp and show.

Things to do in Kerala

Take a walk through the tea gardens of Munnar
- The hilly areas of Munnar are adorned with lush tea gardens. The pleasing environment, sights of women picking tea leaves, witnessing tea processing and tea-tasting experiences, make it a great tourist attraction. Savouring a quiet cup of tea is an essential experience for any traveller in Kerala.

Watch snake boat racing
- The Snake Boat race at Alappuzha is an experience you don’t want to miss in your Kerala tour package. Held from July to September during the Onam festival, these races are a sight of sheer enthusiasm and vigour. You can even rent a boat to have a closer look. Your Kerala tour package cannot end without witnessing this amazing race.

Explore rustic village life
- Experience the authentic village life at the backwater villages of Kerala. Your Kerala visit will become more exciting with activities such as fishing, crab farming and riding a bullock cart.

Make Houseboats your home

What makes this even more tempting is the traditional Kerala food available on these boats. Enjoy the plush greenery and tranquil scene, which will make your holiday even more soothing.

Indulge in native, exotic dishes
- A wide range of dishes made out of bananas are extensively available. Bananas in Kerala are found in varied sizes, shapes and colours. This makes culinary variations of banana like fried chips, puzhungiyathu (steamed) and pazhampori (fried in batter) must haves.

What to eat
From famous international restaurant chains to local eateries, Kerala has everything a foodie could ask for, prepared with that special Kerala taste to it. There’s no better way to delve deep into a Kerala tour package than to try its indigenous dishes. Discover natural ingredients, in world-class restaurants and uniquely Keralite locations. Let the famous spices of the state take you on a delightful journey!


Alleppey fish curry
- The flavours of cocoum and coconut milk lend this dish a delectable taste, making it different from any other type of fish curry. The fleshy, white fish is smeared with onion, tomatoes, garlic, green chillies and coconut paste and then steamed, tempered, making it ready to be savoured.

Appam with stew
- A champion of indigenous Keralite culinary culture, the soft appam can be served either with vegetable or meat stew. It is essentially fermented flat bread made out of rice and coconut.

Puttu and kadala curry
- Puttu is prepared by slowly adding water to ground rice until the correct texture is achieved. It is then spiced, formed into a cylindrical shape and steamed with layers of grated coconut, and served hot for breakfast. It is usually served with kadala curry (black chickpeas). The quintessential Keralite breakfast dish is a must try on your Kerala package!

Dosa with Kerala style sambhar
- Made from fermented rice and lentils, dosa is cooked in pure ghee and roasted till it gets as crisp as it can. It is a staple dish in Kerala and neighbouring states. It is rich in carbohydrates and protein and contains no sugar – making it perfect for the health conscious people availing Kerala packages.

Malabar Biryani
