Kodaikanal Honeymoon Packages

Nestled in the heart of the Palani Hills in south Tamil Nadu, Kodaikanal, a charming little hill station is a picture perfect postcard with its spectacular greenery, waterfalls, cliffs and blossoms. Long for a cool break this summer? Kodaikanal is where you need to be!
The main street-
Annasalai
is the beating pulse of the hills.
Bhajji
(fritters) stalls brimming with mouth-watering delights, evening joggers, couples walking hand in hand - no environment could be as laidback and relaxing. Buy a glass of sweet, Masala Chai (tea) and enjoy the scene. Virtually everything revolves around the feeling of goodness and getting in touch with your inner side. Cycle around the magnificent Kodai Lake early in the morning and lose yourself in the chill, misty state of calm.
Kodaikanal is the only hill station that was set up by American missionaries back in the 20th century. Trekkers will love a visit to Pillar Rocks, three massive stone faces that provide a stunning, panoramic view of the valley. Those who want to rest their feet will love sitting in the shade and enjoying a small picnic and snacks.
Dolphin's Nose (a cliff), the Bear Shola Falls, Bryant Park and the Pambar Falls
are great alternative options too.
Retire into a puffy leather couch in the well-stocked library of the
Kodai Club
. The old English aura of the bar is truly remarkable and evokes old memories with its all yesteryear English decor. Kodaikanal revels in the simple pleasures of life. No matter what kind of a break you are seeking, it makes sure you feel at home; the soft winds, the scented fragrance of eucalyptus trees and tea, the sprawling plum orchards and the delightful aroma of homemade chocolates will seduce you completely. It is difficult to say goodbye.

Draped over a hill, surrounded by tea plantations and backed by a splendid stretch of the Western Ghats, Munnar is a choice retreat in summer. Honeymooners frequent this hill station during all seasons for a taste of its cool and salubrious weather. The three rivers
Madupetti, Nallathanni and Periavaru
give Munnar its name, which means 'three rivers'. The Duke of Wellington's visit to Munnar in the 19th century put it on the map. Soon it acquired the status as a popular hill resort in south India and was nicknamed as Kerala's Scottish Highlands.
After enjoying the views from
Echo Point
or Top Station, take a short walk through tea plantations or go for a ride in a disco rickshaw. Lined with stalls selling tea, fruits and vegetables, the streets are crowded with people, cows and goats. Though most of the people are Tamilians, both Tamil and Malayalam are spoken.
The tribal colonies, where ancient customs are still practiced, are worth a visit. Attukal Pongala in February is their biggest event. Fort Munnar, a resort, hosts performances by tribals donning feathery headgear. Payippad Jalotsavam is when the excitement runs sky-high. It is the annual boat race held on Onam.
Picnicking at Anayirangal, looking out for the blue beauty, Neelakurinji (a flower that blooms every 12 years), watching pink dragonflies dancing around flowers, and practicing yoga at Chinnakanal Ayur Resort or Kaivalyam Retreat,
fishing at Devikulam
or High Range Club, or camping out at Hornbill or Anayirangal, there's lots to do in Munnar. And more, like trekking, cycling, kayaking, rafting, paragliding or a helicopter ride.
Wildlife enthusiasts can immerse themselves in lush greenery, sandalwood trees, sounds of animals, hidden streams, calls of birds and the myriad colours of flora. Oblivious to the world outside, the Eravikulam National Park, Thattekad (Salim Ali) Bird Sanctuary, Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary and shola forests (Butterfly forests) are dense with animals like Mountain Goats, Bisons and Tigers.
With stunning greenery, rolling mists all around, and a nip in the air, it is easy to lose track of time.

The green is what strikes you wherever you go in Kerala. It is arguably one of the most beautiful destinations of the planet with verdant tropical jungles and palm fringed beaches, mighty rivers and rolling hills redolent with aromas of coffee and cardamom. Catch a frenzied Kathakali performance, sample the fiery sea food, drift down the backwaters in a house boat and get a rejuvenating Ayurvedic massage and you will agree that Kerala's claim of being 'God's Own Country' really is true.

While the Great Indian Thar Desert offers thrilling safari opportunities on the back of 'desert's ship' - camel, the wildlife sanctuaries like Ranthambore and Sariska provide shelter to a variety of floral, faunal as well as avian species. Besides these, the hill station of Mount Abu offers a welcome respite from the scorching heat and busy life of the cities. A holiday in Rajasthan also provides a wonderful opportunity to meet its warm-hearted people and experience the centuries old Royal hospitality.
Main Languages: Regional dialects, Hindi and English

'Queen of Hill Stations'
is no hyperbole for Shimla. Not just weather, it is the atmosphere of the glory days gone by, a hint of which continues to cling. During the British Raj, Shamla was declared the summer capital and it thus became Shimla. Then love, politics and grand balls were talked about for long.
The summer capital is now a
holidayer's paradise
with romantic air for honeymooners, frolicking avenues for friends and
scenic mountains
and
verdant forests
of pines, oaks & deodars for just about everyone. No wonder movies like Black, Gadar, Jab We Met and 3 Idiots were shot here.
The town brings more. The single gauge
toy train running between forests
and towns from Kalka to Shimla, the soft shawls, antique books, colourful hats and wooden handicrafts present themselves with a chance to bargain! The temples with folklores and the
grandiose churches
offering views of valleys, the treks, solitary
hiking sessions
and Victorian buildings are what Shimla is. Let's take you to a quick ride through the hill town...

It is said that Kerala's best kept secrets lie in the heart of Thekkady. A lush green oasis that sprawls across the
Periyar Wildlife Reserve
, this is where man and beast live as one. Snarling Tigers, screeching Crickets and naughty Langurs, the mysterious calm of the jungle is enough to tempt anyone who yearns to explore the wild.
Thekkady
is a naturalist's dream. With tea and spice plantations, it has lent much to Kerala's commerce as much as it has to its beauty. The incredible wildlife preserved in Periyar Tiger Wildlife Sanctuary today attracts naturalists and wildlife enthusiasts from around the world. Declared a tiger reserve in 1978, the Periyar Wildlife Reserve is one of the few reserves where one can catch sight of the endangered
Royal Bengal Tiger
that is fast dwindling in population. Shed your inhibitions and take a day off to enjoy a bamboo raft ride across the Periyar river, explore the forest at night, never knowing what is to come, and succumb to the temptation of traditional Kerala
Fish Curry
and Rice in every restaurant you visit.
Ride through the jungle on elephant back or make your way through the village on a bullock cart. Wild and raw, the countryside embraces you with warmth that is almost forgotten. On a longer day, visit the
Mangala Devi Temple
, a short distance from Thekkady town, or to its bustling cousin Kumily, known for its spice plantations. Peermade is another plantation town that lures people on that extended weekend in Thekkady. Cascading waterfalls, misty hilltops and plunging valleys of emerald green, let loose your wild side.
Visit the Tribal Heritage museum inside the Mannan settlement and explore artefacts from a lost generation. Finally, give in to the mellow breeze and soothe your mind as you enjoy an Ayurvedic massage, and let time stop at its tracks. Virgin and raw, Thekkady is for those who yearn to leave the world behind and retrace a journey back in time.

No holiday in India is complete without a trip to Manali. Tucked away in the shade of dense pinewoods and snowy mountains, there is something about Kulu Valley's premier hill station, that will make you recall childhood fairytales. The earth almost meets the sky all around, the meandering
Beas River
winds its way through the valley mysteriously, and between the imposing peaks of the Pir Panjal and Dhauladhar ranges, hundreds flock to experience how it must be to live in Paradise.
Known famously for its lush green valleys, this beautiful hill station in the lower Himalayas is closely connected to Indian mythology as the legendary King Manu is said to have lived here. It is believed that the ark of Manu was found here after the great flood. Today, the name Manali is almost forgotten for what it truly stands forthe Abode of Manu or the Abode of the Gods. And needless to say, this is precisely why everyone heads to the hills every year: to ski down the icy slopes of the Himalayas, where the gods once lived.

A small town in Himalayan foothills, Darjeeling has evolved from pensioner's paradise to a beautiful destination envied for its beauty, culture and location.
While Darjeeling has largely been sought after for treats of trekking, camping and bird watching, there is a sudden surge of travelers seeking old world charm of tea, atrophy and beauty. And much more.
White water rafting
and rapids of furious Teesta and Rangeet rivers is a relatively newfound craze for tourists. Besides, the freshness of water, the air and the fragrance of deodars is enough to intoxicate you with nature.
Even if mountaineering is not your calling, there are plenty of countryside trails you'll love
trekking
along. Climb up the tiger hills or the alpine forests of rhododendron, magnolias, spruce and orchid, and quietly watch wildlife living unperturbed by civilization or a
view of the Mount Everest
. To experience spirituality in hilltops, stop & meditate at the ages-old Ghoom monastery with promises of future. A ride in the cute
toy train
, watching hills while crossing them slowly is another great way to relax and rejuvenate.

Gangtok, an unassuming Himalayan town comes with the quaint charms very much like most hillside towns. And yet its culture and its influences stop it from being clubbed with the rest.
Flung away from the heart of India and in proximity with Tibet, it is most certainly not the quintessential Indian town.
Buddhism
is prevalent. So are entrancing views of mountains and foliage.
Monks cruising down the street in bikes is a common sight. You cannot miss the numerous monasteries in the city. The mystical
Do-Drul Chorten, Enchey Gompa Monastery, Rumtek Monastery, Tashiling Monastery
and Phensong Monastery are quite beautiful. The Namgyal Institute of Tibetology offers an intimate rendezvous with its culture. Even better are the masked dances and processions during festivals.
Gangtok offers some incredible views of the mighty
Kanchenjunga
from Tashi Point and its quaint temple, Ganesh Tok. Hanuman Tok is another Hindu temple in this city.
Shoppers and foodies will be delighted. From yummy tea to Tibetan handicrafts and fur jackets, Gangtok's MG Road and Lal Bazaar are only too happy to please. The food is diverse and restaurants serve you traditional Sikkimese dishes, steamed and fried Momos, the wicked Chang and succulent meat that will have you asking for more.
Changu Lake
, Saramsa Garden and Banjhakri Falls are all a short drive from the city and are neat getaways whether you want to ride a Yak, sip on hot tea meditatively or have a scrumptious picnic. For a few lessons in history, just drive up to the Nathu La Pass.
Orchids, Snow Leopards,
Red Pandas
and bamboos have their own sanctuaries in Gangtok that takes the conservation of its greenscape and wildlife seriously.
Not a tourist trap, with little to do and much to discover, experience the art of doing nothing and being everything in Gangtok.

Cochin will make you come alive at the very first sight. It offers a wealth of history, art and culture to travellers. Shuffled in the hands of Maharajas, and colonial powers like the Portuguese, Dutch and British, the present Cochin is chequered with impressive colonial landmarks as well as contemporary ones.
The essence of Cochin lies in its pristine beauty and the beaches dotted with palm trees. Its culture, nature and hospitality will surly lure you in. Cochin offers you more than beautiful beaches with architectural gems like Bolghatty Palace and
Fort Kochi
. Uncovering Cochin through Onam, the banquet of Sadya, the Malayattoor Perunnal Festival, yoga, Ayurveda and Kerala spices at the Spice Market is a fascinating journey of discovery.
Cochin is the only place where
Chinese fishing nets
are used outside China. You'll see local fishermen braving the waves on coracles. More than the ways of the fishermen, the palaces and ruins left behind like the Hill Palace offer a glimpse of the splendour of Kochi. Visit the Dutch Palace and the nearby Jewish Synagogue which is famed for its Belgium chandeliers and Chinese tiles.
Deep in ancient history, the city will make you snap back to the present in a jiffy with dazzling shopping complexes and places, such as Veega Land, a water theme park, the largest in South India.
Cochin tempts you with a boat cruise in the backwaters against the idyllic backdrop of the Arabian Sea and the Western Ghats. You can hire a ferryboat and row to Vypin Island from
Mattancherry town
to catch sight of dolphins making merry.
Cochin's diverse charms, and the relatively quiet, clean and rather conservative atmosphere set it apart from other cities. Don't be surprised if you take back more than a few unforgettable moments.

The picturesque Srinagar,
the Summer Capital of Jammu and Kashmir
, is a city of lakes and gardens. It possesses the quiet calm of someone who has seen too much of life. Since its history began - some date it back to the 3rd century BC-it has witnessed opulence and horror.
Shaken to destruction by an earthquake and washed away by floods in recent times, the city picked up the pieces. Its mystique was not missed by the powerful and the wise. Many rulers left a trace of their rule in Srinagar:
Asoka, Vikramaditya, the Moghuls and the Dogra
. The echo of the Sufi saints's wisdom still reverberates in Srinagar if you are willing to listen.
Urs at Sufi shrines revisit the saints' teachings on their death anniversary.
Rozabal Shrine
brings people to its door out of curiosity. It is said to be the tomb of Jesus Christ, a controversial claim. A Shiva temple on the
Shankaracharya Hill
is where Adi Shankaracharya meditated.
It is easy to forget the harsh reality in the enchanting gardens. The
Mughal Gardens
are like paradise recreated:
Shalimar Bagh, Nishat Bagh and Chashma Shahi Gardens
. They are all designed to give you a magnificent view of

The glamorous shining star of the middle-eastern desert, Dubai speaks of the good life. But recently, it's been in the news more for building glitzy towers - like the
Burj
, and islands - like the
Palm Jumeirah
and the World (under construction) than the things it was previously known for - oil and Dubai shopping festival, better known as the DSF.
For being a nation that used to earn a major part of its revenue selling crude oil to becoming a nation that made use of its capabilities and resources to bring the world together to its doors with full wallets and topped up credit cards only to make it spend in a hurry, Dubai has come a long way.
'Dream of something and we'll make it come true' is the attitude that the leader of this glamorous metropolis, Sheikh Muhammad lives by but beneath the garb of all the glitter & glam, there's a Dubai which takes pride in its traditional values while respecting traditions which foreign visitor bring along. They sing, dance, fast in the month of Ramadan and urge everyone to maintain the sanctity of the Emirate. The nation lives as a closely knit group and urges visitors to do the same. Welcome to Dubai!

Fondly called KL by most regular visitors, Kuala Lumpur proudly flaunts its
East Meets West lifestyle
with a little arrogance and oodles of attitude. This shining concrete paradise was once a humble tin-mining centre in the 1850s ravaged after the Selangor Civil War, and two World Wars. Yet, with the steady inflow of Indian Chettiars (money-lenders), Muslim traders, Chinese merchants and the slow but constant development process, KL rose to prominence as the capital of the Federated Malay States.
Although Kuala Lumpur means
muddy confluence
(as it was at the muddy confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers), there is hardly a trace of any mud in the city. High-tech modern buildings, skyscrapers and glitzy hotels so much so meet and greet you with a 'welcome to the future' vibe than anything else. Temples, mosques and little pieces of history, however, are carefully hidden behind this facade for those who want to take a stroll down time.
The gleaming lights of
Petronas Twin Towers
with its museums, shops and eateries; the drowning vigour of
Chinatown
; sprawling
Lake Gardens
(Taman Tasik Perdana); the
Central Market
with its brimming handicraft stalls, artistry and colours; the National Museum, a perfect place to brush up on your history; and the beautiful depths of Batu Caves - Kuala Lumpur asks you to live and let live without pushing you to the limits.
Get wild at a ritzy lounge or shop all day at one of the city's magnificent malls. There is no end to things you can do here. To get a feel of the city, climb the giddying heights of the
Menara Kuala Lumpur Observation Deck
, after snacking on some tasty Curry in
Petaling Street
. Here, heaven-high and foreboding, you can see the city lie before you as a sparkling treasure chest. The view encapsulates the feel of one of the greatest cities in Asia, and there is no denying it.

Once nothing more than a small hamlet on the banks of the
Chao Phraya River
, Bangkok is today more than just the capital of Thailand; it is the confluence of Asia's richest cultures. With stumbling religious architecture, myths, futuristic business towers, pulsating streets and after-dark pleasures, this cosmopolitan city is a delight to the senses.
Enjoy a cruise along the historical Chao Phraya River that was once used for trade, through the heart of Bangkok. Drift past the
Taling Chan Floating Market
and stop awhile at a floating restaurant. Bask in the warmth of Bangkok's bustling Chinatown, as you wander into a maze of excited chatter, vivacious crowds and burgeoning street vendors. Rejuvenate your senses with a

Revel in ancient marvels. Unwind soon after at the rooftop of the State Tower taking in the sweeping view of the city. Ruffle your wild side at night as the city lures you into a notorious world of pleasure and fantasy at Bangkok's after-dark districts like Patpong district and Nana Plaza.

The Republic of Maldives is a gorgeous patch of nearly 1200 coral islands that makes the
Laccadive Sea
a heavenly place to be.
Coral reef, lagoons and fabulously white beaches
make it look like a piece of heaven on earth.
In Maldives, it seems like the galloping waves and the warm of water of the sea come together to perform a duet that oozes with ecstatic melody. So crystal clear is the water that one can see the fishes scrambling along in the water at a distance of almost 50 meters! You can give free reign to the amateur diver in you as almost all the resorts and safari boats provide basic to advanced training using well-monitored diving facilities of a high standard.
Maldives is a country of not only natural exotica but also of daily luxuries. Gorgeous resorts with water bungalows and villas, underwater restaurants, and state of the art diving excursions all make it a luxurious holiday. While Maldives is one of the best beach and diving destinations in the world, it is necessary to point out that alcohol is illegal in Maldives. But do not fret; you can have it in the resort where you would be staying.
Shopping is one of the major activities that you would want to indulge in during your stay in Maldives. Maldives has some lovely products that you can take back home;
hand-woven mats, pretty boxes with lacquer work, and dhoni models
(traditional boat). You can flex your muscles and hone your skills at marine sports like
surfing, scuba diving, snorkelling, night fishing, windsurfing and water skiing

Florence (Firenze), the city that was the centre of the Italian Renaissance, is a place of beauty and splendour. Every street is a masterpiece of statues, cobblestones, and imposing edifices, all of which further cement the legendary Florentine love of display. There are rich galleries, even richer churches, impressive domes, corresponding to different periods of history, from early medieval, to neoclassical. It is hard to measure Florence's cultural and historical impact, and even the most conservative estimate concedes it a world-changing status. A visitor can be overwhelmed by this, and needs constantly to be reminded that the reason for such elegant opulence is that Florence was the hub of most activity during the rebirth of art, philosophy, and science in Europe, largely spurred on by the Medici family.

Mauritius bowls you over with its beaches of white sand and sapphire water, tropical forests and myriad flowers, the ghost of the extinct Dodo still alive in souvenirs, and a history that has resulted in the synthesis of many cultures. The Dutch, French, English and even pirates traversed this African island on the Indian Ocean. This is good news for gourmands who can get their fill of African, Chinese, French and Indian cuisine.
If a vision of crystal clear water, white beaches and palms spring to mind when you hear about this island, you are right. There are many beautiful beaches and the islands,
Ile Aux Cerfs and Rodrigues
, are also quite close.
But Mauritius is more than that. The duty-free shopping scene is splendid with t-shirts, Vanilla Tea and ship models being great find. The food is delightful. The cultures of all those who came by the island makes up the cuisine. There's Dhol Puri, Bacon and Eggs, Rougaille and Biryani. Sugarcane Rum is the drink of choice and some of the local brands of beers are pretty good.
Snorkelling, scuba diving around the coral reef, quad biking, trekking volcanoes, zip lining, sky diving are but a few sports on offer. Walk underwater and walk with the lions, both unique experiences to be had in Mauritius.
Temples, churches and mosques engage you with their architecture and history, while a sega performance will have you grooving to its measured rhythms. Clap along with the musicians as the local women sway to it in fabulous flowing skirts.

Step 2: Once decided on the theme you would like to go with, list down 5 destinations which you think are aligned to your theme. There will be some crossing off, going back and forth (a lot of this), but at least it’ll give you some direction
Step 3: Read up about the destinations, and narrow down to the two most fitting ones. You’re already pretty close to picking a honeymoon destination, and more often than not the right hotel, holiday package, distance and budget can help you choose your destination.
Book Your Holiday
1. Set a budget – Once you have a budget in mind, it’ll be much easier to narrow down the holiday, hotel and destination you want to go to. It also gives you an idea as to how much you’d be spending on this holiday, so you can plan and save for it. This will avoid any unpleasant surprises.
2. Book a holiday package – Its almost always going to be cheaper to book a holiday, with flights, hotels and some sightseeing tours included in a package, rather than booking them all separately.
3. Let them know about your honeymoon – If you’re booking online, check out the special honeymoon packages, that are designed specially for newly wed couples, understanding their holiday needs and expectations from this special holiday.
Choose the Right Hotel
1. Do your research – While impromptu holidays are great, a honeymoon is perhaps not the best time to experiment. Before you set out for this special holiday, do go through all your accommodation options, and pick one which suits you best. Read customer reviews and travel blogs about hotels in the area, speak to people who might have visited the place and go through the hotel ratings on reliable websites.
2. Book in advance – A little bit of advance planning can save you a lot of scrambling later. Get the room and rates of your choice by booking well in advance.
3. Inform the hotel about the Honeymoon – Letting the hotel know about the honeymoon will most likely result in good service and some special treatment. Most hotels also offer a honeymoon package, which allows many complimentary services, like a complementary dinner, a room with a good view.
