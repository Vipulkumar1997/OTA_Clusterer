It was the worst experience I have ever had. Will never suggest to anyone. They giving all wrong information on website. They lie to you about bookings and charges. They are not trustworthy. You feel unsafe because you are in the middle of forest.

No connectivity.

The hotel is in Mid of town. 6 floors and rooms are good and comfy. They also have a swimming pool on top. Food provided was a complimentary breakfast. I felt choices were less compared to other good profile hotels. Sprouts and fruit choices are limited. But I liked the concept of pure Veg hotel. I also took dinner Buffy I found it to be decent. The desserts were really good.
