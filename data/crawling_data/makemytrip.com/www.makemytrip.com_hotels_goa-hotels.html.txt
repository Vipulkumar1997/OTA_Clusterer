If you are visiting Goa, it is the best place .. Centrally located and not far from Panaji. Rooms are excellent and so is the service. Restaurant is economical and has variety of food. Complimentary breakfast is good and the resort tries to do justice to the amount it earns. Poolside gallery is awesome in location and ambience .. Overall a good bet to stay.

1) Cleanliness- Good standards of cleanliness are maintained by the staff.
2) Cost - Pretty competitive pricing as location is good though a bit in the interior. Preferable to hire own transport.
3) Hospitality- Staff is very polite and welcoming.
4) Amenities- Swimming pool is well maintained, rooms are decent, WiFi is good. There is a bar at the pool side. Only negative would be if you get a room at the ground floor.
5) Food- Food is good. Though I had more of outside food.
Overall pleasant stay and would recommend highly.
