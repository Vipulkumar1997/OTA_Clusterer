About Thailand
The first thing you’ll notice when you visit Thailand and come across the people, is that they are the friendliest bunch of people with ready smiles. This is their show of hospitality that comes naturally to them. With your best interests at hearts and those disarming smiles, they put you at ease the moment you set your foot on this foreign land on your
Thailand tour
.
Thailand tour packages on MakeMyTrip are offered in various combinations available as per the suitability of your holiday plans and budget-limits. With world top-city destinations like Bangkok, Pattaya, Phuket and Chiang Mai in Thailand, tourists are booking all sorts of Thailand tour packages on a regular trend.
Thailand’s popularity as a tourist destination is established by the fact that Thailand’s own Suvarnabhumi Airport (Bangkok International Airport) and Siam Paragon shopping mall ranked 11th in the list of most photographed places in the world, published by Instagram in 2016. So, ready your lights and camera for the most excellent shots for your Instagram feed on your Thailand tour.
Tourists can choose from an exciting range of Thailand packages that offer combinations of different locations and duration. Locations covered in the Thailand packages include all-time favourites such as Krabi, Phuket, Bangkok, Koh Samui, Pattaya; you could even opt got a ‘cruise get-away’ Thailand tour package from one destination to the next. In addition, there are also many Thailand honeymoon packages on offer, marked by romantic inclusions as well as exciting discounts.

Best time to visit
You can plan and book your Thailand tour package anytime of the year. The best time to visit is considered to be between November and early April, though, when the weather is cool and dry. If diving and snorkelling is the main reason for your visit, then the winter months would be best for you. The eastern coast is good for most of the year. Thailand is indeed a traveller’s delight and you can enjoy a decent vacation here with your partner, family or friends. Explore Thailand packages that fit the purpose of your travel on MakeMyTrip.

How to reach
Thailand is well connected by air to the rest of the world by two airports – the Suvarnabhumi Airport (25 kilometres east of Bangkok) and the Don Mueang Airport (24 kilometres to the north). Most of the international and domestic airlines that operate at the Bangkok International Airport are well-linked to the city by buses, taxis and the Bangkok metro. If you are a tourist that requires air travel to approach Thailand, then Thailand tour packages with airfare included are highly recommended.
Also, you can navigate to other regions of Thailand including Bangkok, Krabi, Phang Na and Surat Thani from the BKS bus terminal in Phuket town. Bookings for both AC and non-AC buses are available at different prices. Thailand is well connected to neighbouring countries like Malaysia, Cambodia and Laos by rail services too.

Places to see
Thailand is a treasure chest waiting to be opened and once you choose to open it, a blissful holiday is guaranteed. The numerous serene beaches or the high-flying night-life of the city of Bangkok and Phuket will give you a taste of life on the full spectrum.

A slice of paradise in Raily beach
: One of the most famous beaches in Thailand, Raily beach is marked by clear teal-blue water, white sand and stunning topography. Particularly known for its beach and karst (dissolved limestone) cliffs, it is home to both tourists and mountain climbers. Make this spot a part of your Thailand honeymoon package especially for its romantic setting and scenic beauty.

The Phi Phi islands
: Get out on a day trip to the ‘monkey beach’ to come face-to-face with monkeys, or watch the sunset on the ‘long beach’ with your partner and walk back to your resort. Those in a mood for adventure can go snorkelling or diving on the ‘Maya bay’.

Bangkok’s Grand Palace
: Of historical significance as well as sheer craftsmanship, the Grand Palace is a staggering proof. It isn’t a surprises then that this is the number one sight-seeing attraction in the city. A majority of the Thailand packages (including Thailand honeymoon packages) include Bangkok as the main stop. So, be sure to venture into the Grand Palace.

A mecca for hippies and backpackers
: On the western side of the southern part of the island, lie the rugged terrains full of jungles and natural landscapes. Enjoy the country’s mountainous jungle scenery with the much-famed Thai hospitality and cooking in ‘Pai’.
These captivating locations explain why Thailand tour packages are so popular. It is a collage of animated scenes comprising of modern cities, Buddhist temples and lush landscapes.
What to eat
The question of ‘what to eat’ doesn’t arise in Thailand. Almost everything on the menu is worth trying out. You will find an all-star menu offered by any one of the roadside vendors or street restaurants. But if you are in a mood for something classy, there is no dearth of that either. Grab your seats in any one of the Thailand tour packages and treat your taste buds to some delectable Thai delicacies.

Shrimp soup that screams ‘Thailand’
: This hot and sour delight has lemongrass and succulent shrimps as the main ingredient. If you are a seafood fan, then your Thailand trip is going to be rewarding.

Chicken and cashews go along well in Thailand
: If you are looking out for something exotic, then this rare combination of cashews and chicken will be just right for you. The Kai Med Ma Muang is a Thai dish that you will surely go crazy over.

Hall of fame for salads
: Experience the fresh, fiery thrill of spicy beef salad (Yam Nua) or the sweet sour taste of spicy green papaya salad (Som Tum/Tom) while holidaying Thailand. These dishes surely deserve a place of pride in the hall of fame for salads, if there ever was one.

The famous Thai fried rice
: Kao Phad or Khao Phad is famous amongst tourists for being Thailand’s trademark fried rice. Fried food lovers can enjoy this delicious mix of meat (chicken, shrimp, crab or beef), along with egg, garlic, onions and seasonings at any of the many street-side eateries.

The default international fried dish
: You can choose from both thin and thick noodles for the Thai stir-fry noodles dish. Pad Thai comes with seafood, chicken or veggies and contrary to spicy Thai food, this one is sweet and sour.

Slurp your lunch on the go
: Noodles with soup with add-ons like shrimp, chicken, fish balls, bean sprouts and mixed green vegetables, make for a wonderful soupy delight. What’s more is that you can choose the kind of noodles you want in your soup. Vegetarians can also ask for the same without meat or fish. Finally, crank it up with a splash of soy sauce, lime juice and a drizzle of peanuts and slurp away!

Besides the delicacies mentioned above, you can also indulge in Thai street food at Chiang Mai’s ‘Sunday night walking street’. Once you gorge on pad Thai, chicken satay, samosas, crab cakes, fried bananas, sweet rotees and fresh fruit shakes, leisure around to collect souvenirs like all-natural soaps, handicrafts and arts from the market.
The Insomniac’s Guide to Thailand
Attention party animals, explorers, adventurers, and honeymooners! While you choose from the best Thailand tour packages as well as Thailand honeymoon packages from MakeMyTrip, make sure you refer to the guide below for an unforgettable list of experiences you have to accomplish during your holiday:

There’s a party every quarter moon
: The island of Koh Phangan is known for its infamous moon parties - the full moon, quarter moon, half-moon and black moon parties. Enjoy the fire shows at the beach lined with alcohol vendors. The background for these parties is a delightful cacophony of loud music and fireworks, making it an evening to remember.

Drown out those party blues with snorkeling and scuba diving
: While you’re still at Koh Phangan, visit Koh Tao, just 45km north of Koh Pangan, to explore the marine wildlife in clear blue teal waters. This is a great way to wash away hangovers. Head over to the nearest diving centre to go scuba diving or snorkeling in these magical waters.

A spot for all adrenaline junkies
: You must ensure this spot is included in your Thailand tour package if adventure is something you crave. Daredevils go to the extremes to get the real fun out of an adventure. The island of Railay is a treasure for those who love rock climbing, trekking, hiking and diving from steep cliffs. And when you are done with your dose of adventure, sit it out and admire the beautiful beach known for its white sand and turquoise water.

Chill out on one of the lesser-known, but breathtaking beaches
: Just some 50km from Railay, there’s the island of Koh Lanta. The island paints a picturesque setting with a lighthouse, clear blue skies and a breathtaking beach looking out into the pristine sea. Completely opposite to the loud and vibrant nightlife of ‘Koh Phangan’, this island is peaceful and tranquil.

Partake in numerous festivals
: Your partner and you can have a really good time together after you’ve picked the best Thailand honeymoon package. Depending upon your tour period, you can witness some of Thailand’s characteristic festivals starting from Thai New Year which is celebrated in the month of April. You can also participate in the Indian holi-like festival called Songkran in which Thai people throw water and flowers at each other. Other festivals worth experiencing include the candle festival, the international swan boat race and the underwater marriage festival.

Shop till you drop
: Head over to one-stop-high-indulgence malls such as CentralWorld or MBK at Siam, or EmQuartier at Phrom Phong. Spend your weekend on a shopping spree at the ‘weekend walking street’ in Chiang Mai, where you can shop for practically everything, from genuine to near-genuine duplicates, on Saturday and Sunday nights.

But, for a taste of the golden times of the ‘
Venice of the East
’, travel through the klongs or canals of the floating market on long tail boats and shop away. Take your partner out for shopping here on your Thailand honeymoon trip and pick souvenirs to cherish your holiday.

Visit Phuket to boost your adrenaline
: The party capital of Thailand has a lot in its menu of offerings than just nightlife. Party people can enjoy non-stop from 9 at night right up to the wee hours of the morning. If a nightclub isn’t what you are looking for, then go watch a match or two of Muay Thai, the exhilarating Thai style boxing to witness some intense fights.

Ride on an elephant, safari style
: Again, Phuket takes you on yet another adventure, but this time on a jumbo elephant! The safari ride here in Phuket perhaps tops the list of things to do for Indians and foreign tourists alike. Visit the Thai elephant conservation centre in the Northern Province of Lampang and learn the basics of how to become an elephant mahout (elephant rider).

Explore secret waterfalls and discover the temple of beer bottles
: Neatly hidden in the Erawan national park in Tha Kradan, the Erawan waterfalls, not just one, but 7, provide a sight of water tumbling and gushing over limestone terraces. Si Kaeo has another surprise for tourists eager to explore territories - unique temple complex formed by over 1.5 million discarded brown and green bottles. Wat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew (temple of a million beers) has beer bottles lining the temple, water towers, sleeping quarters and even the toilets.

How about some Thai spa?
: Thailand, in terms of wellness and health, translates to Thai massages and spas. The experiences you culminate here will recharge and boost your mental, physical and spiritual energy, thus restoring your health.
As the beaches and delectable cuisine beckons, take your pick from the various Thailand packages on offer on MakeMyTrip and head to Thailand!
