Great location for a great hotel, rooms are getting a little outdated for a boutique hotel, otherwise they have done a great job in maintenance and cleanliness, however some updates are really must and great service as well, with good deal on MMT it's completely worth it.

Overall location and service are the best. Rooms are very small, OK if you are travelling alone and do not have to stay in the room for long. Staff was very helpful and understanding, had asked for a 1 Hr delay in check out and the person at the reception graciously accepted without any issues. Overall happy with the exeperience.

Hotel Staff is courteous and very Helpful. Service delivery is very time consuming and delayed. Food is just average quality and overpriced. The Hotel is attached/is part of EDM mall. Location is at Delhi/UP border, so cabs and autos charge very high rates. Overall the experience was value for money.

Rooms are cozy and buffet breakfast is nice and also the in room dining is of good quality and portion size. A bit pricey but worth every penny.

The hotel is value for money with good cleanliness and courteous staff. Service is a bit slow but overall its comfortable. Food is good and all other facilities are easy to get. Location of the hotel is fine as it is 2km from Noida City Centre metro station. Getting a public transport can be difficult but Ola and uber is always there. Only the service is slow and you will have to remind them of your order atleast once. Overall, the stay was comfortable with all basic amenities.
