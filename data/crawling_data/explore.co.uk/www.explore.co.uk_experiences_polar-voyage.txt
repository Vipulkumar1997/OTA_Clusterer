Polar Voyages



Polar Voyages

Set sail to the far ends of the Earth to see the last true wilderness areas in existence. Travelling on a small expedition vessel crewed by a team of polar experts and using Zodiac inflatable boats for shore excursions, you will witness the splendour of areas virtually untouched by the hand of man.

These icy extremes are a haven for wildlife, much of it endemic to the polar regions. Just imagine waking up surrounded by glaciers and mountains as far as the eye can see, standing encircled amid hundreds of penguins or that heart-stopping moment when you see your first polar bear.

Our Service




Explore’s range of polar voyages are designed to give you authentic polar experiences. These are the most awe-inspiring and rewarding journeys you will ever make. If you enjoy wildlife and wilderness, and if you want to have an experience which is second to none, the polar regions should not be missed. Choose from the Arctic – home to polar bears and walrus – or Antarctica for towering icebergs and busy penguin rookeries.

While polar explorers of yesteryear endured the harshest conditions imaginable, you will be travelling in comfort. With so many itineraries and ships to choose from, the toughest part of your adventure will be choosing which one to go for!



Explore has been pioneering adventure holidays for more than 30 years. Our knowledge, experience and professionalism make us the preferred choice for thousands of travellers heading to remote regions every year. For many people, travelling to the polar regions is a once-in-a- lifetime experience. We understand how important it is that you receive the right information and advice before making that all-important decision about which voyage to go on. Our team of dedicated polar travel consultants are on hand to give you expert advice from the moment you first contact us.

One of the great strengths of Explore’s polar voyages is that we are no affiliated to any particular ship or ship operator. We have been able to assess every polar expedition vessel and select the very best expedition ships sailing to the Arctic and Antarctica on a range of exciting routes. Our team is on hand to talk you through the available options and will talk to you person to person (not from a script!) to give you all the information you need.
