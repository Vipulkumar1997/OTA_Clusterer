Holidays to Central America


Holidays to Belize



Holidays to Belize

Belize was created when Itzamná the creator god of the Maya took the best bits of Central America and put them all in within easy reach of each other in the place where the Maya people began. The country is only 200 km long and 100 km wide and it’s easy to get anywhere within a day. A week to 10 days is enough for you to sample a few of Belize’s highlights: to catch a whiff of rainforest air, dip your toes into the Caribbean and get some rest and relaxation on the country’s best beach.

After flying into Belize City take the Western highway to Cayo District and explore the dense tropical forest of the Macal River Valley. Visit the Mayan City of Xunantunich and climb its pyramids for sweeping views of forest stretching into Guatemala. Then head for the islands of San Pedro or Caye Caulker to dive and snorkel over the barrier reef and take a day trip to the inky deep Blue Hole in the Lighthouse Reef atoll.

Additional information








With more time, you could see Belize’s most celebrated sights as well as getting well off the beaten track into the heart of the biggest stretch of tropical forest north of the Amazon. Stay in the wilderness of Mountain Pine Ridge or the Macal River Valley. Visit the rainforest clad Maya metropolises of Caracol or Guatemala’s Tikal, just over the border. Travel along the Hummingbird Highway, and explore Cockscombe Basin Wildlife Sanctuary. Visit the howler monkeys at Bermudian Landing ‘Community Baboon Sanctuary’ and the bird-filled lagoons of Crooked Tree, or travel by boat to the remote Maya site of Lamanai. Finish with total immersion in the Caribbean Sea on one of the cayes or atolls, diving, sea kayaking and soaking up the sun on a powdery fine beach.
