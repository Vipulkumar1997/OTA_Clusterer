Exotic wildlife, jungle rivers, tropical forests and lost civilisations are all part of this trip to Belize. We visit lesser-known Maya sites such as Xunantunich and explore the impressive temples of Tikal (Guatemala). There are opportunities to see howler monkeys, toucans, parrots, crocodiles and much more in their natural environment. We end the trip on the island of Caye Caulker, unwinding and snorkelling in the warm waters of the Caribbean Sea.

Itinerary

Itineraries on some departure dates may differ, please select the itinerary that you wish to explore.


bl 2017
bl 2018



Day 1
- Join trip in Belize City
We arrive in Belize City, where we will check-in to our conveniently located hotel for our first night. Belize City was the capital of Belize until 1970 and is a typical Caribbean town. Parts of the town are still largely built of wood and galvanised iron, with many of the original colonial style houses in an elegant state of disrepair. There is also a canal system through the old part of town. Creole English is widely spoken. 
 Please note that Flight Inclusive travellers on the 5th and 26th November, 13th and 20th December departures will be flying via Miami and overnighting there tonight. You will join the tour on day 2, and will be picked up at the airport in the morning en route to the Mayan ruins of Altun Ha.
Accommodation: Ramada Princess Hotel
(or similar)
Standard Hotel
Swimming pool available
Single room available
Meals Provided: None
Day 2
- To Crooked Tree Wildlife Reserve via Altun Ha
This morning we leave the city and head towards the Mayan ruins of Altun Ha. On route, we will visit the Community Baboon Sanctuary project, which has the aim of protecting the habitat for the endangered Black Howler Monkey and is a fascinating insight into some of the threats that the Belize ecosystem is currently facing. After our visit, we continue to Altun Ha where we explore this ancient site. Later, we arrive at Crooked Tree Wildlife Sanctuary, where we settle down for two nights enjoying the hospitality of our local hosts on the shores of the Crooked Tree Lagoon.
 If you are travelling on a flight booked by Explore, on our 5th and 26th November, 13th and 20th December  departures, you will be picked up from the airport on route to Altun Ha and start the tour immediately.
Accommodation: Birds Eye View Lodge
(or similar)
Standard Hotel
Single room available
Meals Provided: Breakfast
Day 3
- Boat trip to the jungle ruins of Lamanai birdwatching en route
Rising early this morning or tomorrow morning, we explore the lagoon by boat. In this birdwatchers paradise we may spot wood stork, boat-bill heron, vulture, kingfisher, grebe, hawk, snail kite, jacana and, perhaps most notable of all, the rare jabiru - the largest flying bird in the hemisphere with a wingspan of up to 4 metres. We return to the lodge for breakfast and then set off by vehicle to the New River for the boat ride upstream to the 2000 year old jungle ruins of Lamanai. Water birds are abundant in the ancient rainforest cover and crocodiles may be spotted lurking along the river bank. Lamanai, the original name of these Maya ruins, means Submerged Crocodile, which helps to explain the numerous carved crocodile representations at the site. The ruins are located some distance off the beaten track and are still not reconstructed or cleared. We approach on foot following rough trails. The surrounding rainforest with its thick canopy of huge trees, and humid atmosphere adds an aura of mystery to the scattered and overgrown relics. A cache of children's bones has been unearthed from beneath one of the stelae, suggesting that the Maya practiced human sacrifice here.
Accommodation: Birds Eye View Lodge
(or similar)
Standard Hotel
Single room available
Meals Provided: Breakfast, Lunch & Dinner
Day 4
- Dawn bird watching, drive to Placencia
An optional early bird walk and sunrise along the Crooked Tree Lagoon can be an unforgettable experience in this important wetland sanctuary. After breakfast, we visit the Community Baboon Sanctuary in search of howler monkeys. Here we have a chance to watch troops of black howler monkeys swinging from the trees in their natural habitat, before we begin our journey south along the scenic Hummingbird Highway, where orange and grapefruit groves are surrounded by a backdrop of lush jungle clad limestone hills - The Maya Mountains. We will visit a local organic farm and tree planting project along the way in this beautiful setting. Our day ends in the beach resort of Placencia, a town located at the end of a narrow peninsula between mangrove lagoons and the Maya Mountains and the Caribbean Sea.
Accommodation: Sea Spray Hotel
(or similar)
Standard Hotel
Single room available
Meals Provided: Breakfast
Day 5
- In Placencia; free to explore, snorkel or relax on beach
Surely one of Belize's best beach spots, the Placencia peninsula is still beautiful, despite the damage caused by Hurricane Iris in October 2001. Today is left free for you to relax on the beach or to take an optional day trip. Both Silke Caye and Laughing Bird Caye are ideal places to swim and snorkel. The other option is to explore the Monkey River by motor launch, accompanied by a local guide. Although there is still some evidence of the hurricane, the community is working hard to re-build itself and you\ re sure to find the relaxed atmosphere agreeable. We are happy to return to Placencia and see it as a positive contribution to the re-building work.
Accommodation: Sea Spray Hotel

Day 6
- Visit Cockscomb Basin Jaguar Preserve; head to San Ignacio
This morning we visit the Sanctuary at Cockscomb Basin. This is the world's first and only jaguar reserve; the magnificent cats are a protected species here in their natural habitat and are no longer hunted as big game: however we would have to be extremely fortunate and quiet to spot one. They can grow up to six feet in length and weigh some 159 kilograms. The reserve has a variety of other wildlife including jaguarundis, peccary, brocket deer and iguanas. Toucan, king vulture and scarlet macaw are among the resident bird species. We allow some time here to walk the trails and experience the forest. Driving on towards San Ignacio on the hummingbird highway, we can stop at the \ other\  Blue Hole - a collapsed limestone cavern - for a welcome swim in fresh water.
Accommodation: Windy Hill Resort
(or similar)
Standard Hotel
Swimming pool available
Single room available
Meals Provided: Breakfast
Day 7
- Explore the Xunantunich archaeological site
San Ignacio, a traditional Belizean town, is an ideal place to base ourselves for the next couple of days. Straddling the Macal River  which was once a critical transportation artery for the Maya and later the European settlers it is now a centre for many adventurous activities. Today we make a visit to the great classical Maya site of Xunantunich, Mayan for 'Rock Stone Maiden', perhaps for phallic or fertility reasons. We go by bus and then cross the Macal by traditional hand-winched ferry to arrive at the site. Occupied until about AD 850, the main plaza is dominated by an awesome structure called El Castillo - a massive pyramid which rises to 40 metres. On the top is a partially restored stucco frieze representing the Sun God and astronomical signs of the Moon and Venus. The superb view from the summit looks out over the forest with the Maya mountains to the south and the lowlands of Guatemala to the west. The afternoon is free for personal exploration or perhaps to go canoeing in Barton Creek, a cave-canoe trip on a slow moving stream, allowing you to appreciate the impressive cave formations.
Accommodation: Windy Hill Resort
(or similar)
Standard Hotel
Swimming pool available
Single room available
Meals Provided: Breakfast
Day 8
- Free day, choices include canoeing on the Macal River
Today is free to relax in town or take any one of the many optional day trips available. One possibility is to hire a canoe, either with or without a guide, and paddle along the Macal river from the Belize Botanical Gardens down to San Ignacio town. The river is slow-moving and rich in birdlife, butterflies and iguanas, and you will share your canoe with one or two other people.
Accommodation: Windy Hill Resort

Day 9
- Explore the great Mayan metropolis of Tikal (Guatemala)
Leaving Belize today we drive to Tikal, just over the border in Guatemala. Arriving at Tikal we spend the day exploring this great Mayan metropolis, which can justly be compared with Egyptian and Greek masterpieces. Initially settled about 600 BC, Tikal was abandoned by its rulers around AD 890 and totally deserted a hundred years later. The city covered an area of 16 square kilometres. Re-discovered in 1848, only a few of its great temples and pyramids have yet been excavated. Accessible by foot are a number of outlying and little known temples still covered by a tangle of undergrowth, and for those with a head for heights, the views from the temple tops out over the jungle and the hidden city below are mesmerising.
Accommodation: Tikal Inn
(or similar)
Standard Lodge
Swimming pool available
Single room available
Meals Provided: Breakfast
Day 10
- Optional re-entry to Tikal
Today we rise to the sounds of the surrounding jungle coming to life. Unaccompanied, we have a chance to return to the site for a further exploration of the jungle encroached ruins. It is possible to go into the site to watch the sunrise from atop of Temple 4, the highest structure in the site at more than 200ft above the forest floor. Clear sunrises are uncommon however owing to the humidity the rainforest generates. Witness instead the roof combs of the surrounding temples reveal themselves as a forest wakes and the sounds of toucans, parrots, spider and howler monkeys fill the air. Alternatively you can enjoy the day relaxing, excellent bird watching and wildlife can be seen around the hotel pool! There are also two small museums located close to the hotel.
Accommodation: Tikal Inn

Day 11
- Boat journey to the idyllic island of Caye Caulker
This morning we drive to Belize City and take a water taxi to Caye Caulker. Once a pirate lair, this tiny but enchanting tropical island lies 34km northeast of Belize City and about 1.6km inside the greatest barrier reef in the Western Hemisphere. The water taxi transfer takes about an hour and is a highlight in itself, speeding through the turquoise waters. The island remains uncrowded, and unluxurious, with relatively modest prices in restaurants and bars, owned and run by the friendliest of local people. The local fishermen produce lobster, conch, fish and crab to supply the domestic and foreign markets. Fresh seafood is readily available and lobster is the best buy when in season from Jun to Feb. There's time to relax - our hotel has a beach, which is rare on the island - as well as to enjoy a number of optional trips. You may take a snorkelling trip out to the nearby Hol Chan Marine Reserve & Shark and Ray alley, or take a full day trip out to Goff's Caye to observe the Manatees in their natural mangrove habitat. Scuba diving is also available.
Accommodation: Anchorage Resort
(or similar)
