Polar Regions Holidays & Tours



Polar Regions Holidays & Tours

Set sail to the far ends of the Earth to see the last true wilderness areas in existence. Travelling on a small expedition vessel crewed by a team of polar experts and using Zodiac inflatable boats for shore excursions, you will witness the splendour of areas virtually untouched by the hand of man. These icy extremes are a haven for wildlife, much of it endemic to the polar regions. Just imagine waking up surrounded by glaciers and mountains as far as the eye can see, standing encircled amid hundreds of penguins or that heart-stopping moment when you see your first polar bear.

Explore’s range of polar voyages are designed to give you authentic polar experiences. These are the most awe-inspiring and rewarding journeys you will ever make. If you enjoy wildlife and wilderness, and if you want to have an experience which is second to none, the polar regions should not be missed. Choose from the Arctic – home to polar bears and walrus – or Antarctica for towering icebergs and busy penguin rookeries.

While polar explorers of yesteryear endured the harshest conditions imaginable, you will be travelling in comfort. With so many itineraries and ships to choose from, the toughest part of your adventure will be choosing which one to go for!
