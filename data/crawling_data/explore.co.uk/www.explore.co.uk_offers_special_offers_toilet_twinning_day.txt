Give a little, give a loo this World Toilet Day



Give a little, give a loo this World Toilet Day

To mark world toilet day on 19th November, Explore is donating £60 per person to Toilet Twinning.

Explore works closely with Toilet Twinning and this year, to mark World Toilet Day, will donate £60 per person booking a trip to Nepal, Tanzania or Uganda, where Toilet Twinning operates. Book a small group adventure to one of these destinations or a Tailormade holiday to Tanzania before 4th December and Explore will sponsor an impoverished area’s latrine on your behalf – you will receive a certificate from Toilet Twinning to thank you for your contribution.
Donations contribute towards the important work being done to deliver clean water, proper toilets and hygiene education to these areas - a vital combination that prevents the spread of disease, reduces the number of deaths among children, and brings hope for the future.

Why £60? On average it costs around £60 for Toilet Twinning to build, educate and provide a safe environment for the local people. This money not only builds the latrine but provides the materials needed to construct it, the workshops and education for the villagers and the provision of a clean and sanitised water solution. A change that to most villagers comes as a revelation, an understanding of personal hygiene and how to further help their neighbours to build their very own loo. This money isn't just for a toilet, it is for the beginning of a positive toilet-chain reaction.

2.3 billion people worldwide do not have somewhere safe to go to the toilet

Every day nearly 1,000 children die from preventable diseases linked to dirty water and unsafe toilets

Every year, women and girls spend 97 billion hours looking for a safe place to use the toilet

Quote ‘LOO’ to book your trip to Nepal, Tanzania or Uganda, between 19 November – 4 December 2017 and give the gift of safe, hygienic facilities this World Toilet Day.
