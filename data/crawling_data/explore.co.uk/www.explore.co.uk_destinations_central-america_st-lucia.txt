Holidays to St.Lucia



Holidays to St.Lucia

The Caribbean island of St Lucia is a real world paradise, a mountainous landscape covered with thick rainforest and fringed by golden and silver sandy beaches. At the south end of the island is one of the Caribbean’s most incredible sights – the volcanic cones of Petit Piton and Gros Piton rising out of the azure ocean.

The island is incredibly romantic, with secluded nooks and eco lodges tucked away in coves and bays. But the big question is whether to explore the north or south of the island first. The north is the busier and more developed with a big choice of bars and restaurants. The southern end of St Lucia is more tranquil, with spectacular scenery and dark volcanic sand on the beaches. Although it is easy to cross between the two by either road or boat, it might be a good idea to explore accommodation options in both during your stay.

You also need to think about when to visit. The Caribbean might be blessed with all year round good weather, but depending on your preference, you may need to think about which season is best for you as it can get busy in high season.

Although there are some resorts on the island, including Rodney Bay Village, it remains more unspoiled than many other of the Caribbean islands. Those that are there have been done tastefully and in keeping with the character of the island.

In the south, visit Soufriere at the heart of the old plantations. It’s blessed with hidden beaches and views out over the natural wonder that is the Pitons.

One of the best ways to get around the island is on foot. Large enough to find places to discover every day but small enough to cover the ground and get a good taste for all it has to offer, trekking holidays are popular in St Lucia.

Discover all the sights, sounds and tastes of the Caribbean, as well as the laid back lifestyle that is so famous in the region. St Lucia’s well earned reputation as a tropical paradise does not disappoint, and what better way to enjoy it than after an exhilarating day on the trail?

Join Explore on a St Lucia trekking and hiking adventure for an unforgettable Caribbean holiday experience.
