Vision And Values




Vision And Values


Explore have grown and changed a lot, having been operating for over 36 years but our passion for travel has never wavered. Many of our original visions and values have remained the same, putting adventure and experience at the heart of our award-winning formula.

We have increased our number of trips to take people around the world, with activities and itineraries created for every type of customer, including tailormade trips which allow people to design their own adventure. Our ambition to take travellers off the beaten track is one of the many things which makes Explore unique and we pride ourselves on providing a responsible and sustainable way to see the world that also benefits the locals that we work with.

From our expert tour guides to the families and hosts who run our chosen accommodation and transport, we aim to provide an authentic travel experience which allows our customers to truly get to know the countries we visit.

Our values are what makes Explore such a great company to travel with, and for our staff, a great company to work for. We are pioneering when it comes to adventure and responsible in everything we do. We are trusted due to our many years of experience that brings customers back year after year and are passionate about providing a fun and exciting travel experience.

Explore are;

Trusted

With over 36 years' experience planning adventure travel trips around the world, nobody knows our locations better than Explore. And, as a member of all the leading tour operator organisations - such as AITO, ATOL and IATA - you can trust us to get your holiday just right.

Adventurous


Adventure is relative but our range of holiday activities is so vast that we can guarantee each customer will get their fix of adventure on an Explore trip. You can travel on foot or two wheels on our walking and cycling holidays, or board an expedition vessel to explore the Galapagos or the polar regions.

Fun

What could be more fun than sending people off on holiday to the world's most incredible spots? Whether you are off on a weekend away or a month-long discovery trip, we work hard to pack in as much and excitement as possible - you're on holiday after all.

Responsible

We are committed to ensuring our trips leave as light a footprint on the world as possible because we know our planet is a finite resource. We are always striving to be more responsible; from working with a number of environmental charities, to stopping elephant rides on our trips, to installing rooftop solar panels at our Hampshire HQ to offset CO2 emissions, it's our mission to do everything we can for our planet.

Passionate

We live, breathe, eat and sleep adventure travel - it's not our jobs, it's our way of life. When we're not personally test-driving our trips to make sure they're the best they can be, we're heading off on adventures of our own. But as well as adventure travel, we also have a passion for excellent customer service: we insist on the best from our staff and suppliers to elevate your trip to the extraordinary.
