Wildlife Tours

From wildlife safaris in Africa to
tiger tracking
in India and visits to the chattering penguins of
Antarctica
, Explore offers a diverse range of wildlife adventures for everyone, whatever your passion. With more than 100 wildlife holidays on offer in all seven continents, for small groups or on a private, tailor-made basis, we have the widest selection of wildlife tours in some of the world’s most exciting countries.

Join us in
Spitsbergen
in search of Polar bears or in
Madagascar
to see indigenous lemurs; experience face-to-face encounters with endangered mountain gorillas in
Uganda
or track elusive jaguars in
Guyana
. Search for the Big Five – lion, leopard, rhinoceros, buffalo and elephant – in Africa’s world-famous game parks; or for the ultimate African wildlife safari experience join a walking safari holiday, where the thrill of being on foot among the wildlife is second to none. Closer to home you could observe the rare European brown bear in
Finland
, the whales and dolphins of the
Azores
or the prolific birdlife of the Scottish islands.

By exploring in small, inconspicuous groups you can not only get into the heart of the animal kingdom for exciting wildlife encounters, but also enjoy longer periods of relaxed observation with excellent opportunities for photography and video.
