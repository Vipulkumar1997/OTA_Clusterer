Family Adventure Holidays



Family Adventure Holidays

Explore seeks to break the mould of a traditional family all-inclusive holiday, with our exciting family adventure holidays to over 50 destinations.

Through our well-considered itineraries and our enthusiastic expert local leaders, our extensive range of family adventure holidays are designed to give a perfect balance of activity and down time. At Explore we strive to create family experiences and memories that truly stand the test of time, with the widest choice of family adventure holidays taking you to all four corners of the globe.

Our formula is simple. We blend each destinations' must see sights such as the majestic Taj Mahal in
Northern India
, with fun experiences and activities for the whole family; whether it's sharing an evening hearing native American folklore stories with a Navajo guide in
Monument Valley
or kayaking over an ancient sunken Roman settlement off the
Turkish Mediterranean coast
.

Our family trips are designed around school holiday dates, so whether its a one week family winter activity holiday over
February half term
, a ten day journey to Morocco over
October half term
or a action packed summer adventure in Italy over the
summer holidays
, we have a holiday to suit the whole family.

Just because school’s out doesn't mean that your children should stop learning. Our tours are packed full of new experiences that can enrich, educate and inspire young people. Who knows, your holiday may just spark your children's interest and inspire them to find their vocation in life.


Why travel on a group holiday?

Our travellers regularly list the group dynamics as one of the main reasons they choose an Explore family tour. Travelling with other families means that kids will have a ready made network of companions to travel with and these often lead to life-long friendships. Thanks to the security of travelling with a group, alongside an experienced and passionate Explore leader; mums and dads can truly relax. With all the logistics taken care of, this leaves more time for travellers to take in the sights and make the most of precious family time together.

Travel a different way

Not your usual hotel

Expect the unexpected




You won't find any 40-seater tourist coaches on an Explore family holiday. We will give you the most fun-filled, memorable adventure holiday possible. To ensure you get the most out of your trip we keep our group sizes small. This allows us to experience different forms of transport, unique accommodation and adventurous activities, whilst getting off the beaten track to seek out the unexpected. With over 35 years of experience behind us, we know our destinations inside out and can't wait to share our passion for adventure travel including the rich benefits it can bring young people.

Don't just take our word for it. Just before Christmas we brought together a number of our younger customers who shared their travel experience on our Explore family holidays.




Here at Explore HQ we have searched far and wide to bring you unique accommodation from around the world. From stilt houses in the jungles of Northern Thailand to camping on deserted islands, our family accommodation is all part of the experience. Here is a run down of our top three picks.

1. Stay in a Beehive hut on our
Kruger, Kwazulu and Coast
trip in Mlilwane, Swaziland
2. Experience staying in an Ice Hotel on our
Romanian Winter Adventure
.
3. The ultimate room with a view, spend two nights on a houseboat on the Okavango, Botswana on our
Okavango Adventure
tour.

Pool time

We recognize that swimming pools are a big draw for kids, so where we can, we aim to select hotels and guesthouses that include a pool. In some rural locations this isn't always possible however we will always try our best to make time for a dip at a secluded beach or a freshwater lake along the way.



We've all been there. The time has finally arrived for the family holiday and we've been looking forward to getting away for months. Somehow, despite all the preparation, the car journey took twice as long as we anticipated, the kids are complaining there isn't enough to do in the resort and there is only so much time you can spend sunbathing on a beach. If only there was a magic formula to keep everyone happy?

Our Explore family holidays cater for everyone's taste whether you're young or old, an extended family or travelling as a
single parent
and even if you're embarking on that
last big family holiday
together, we have the answer for you.

With over 50 family adventure holidays to choose from, covering the savannah plains of the
Serengeti
and sand dunes in the
deserts of Oman
, to a
winter wonderland in Finland
, there has never been a better time to reconnect with the adventurous spirit within you and embark on the family holiday of a lifetime. Come and join us!
