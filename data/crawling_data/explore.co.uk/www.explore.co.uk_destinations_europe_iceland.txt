Iceland Holidays & Tours

Iceland Adventure Holidays and Northern Lights Tours

Located south of Greenland's wintery coast and surrounded by the cold expanse of the Atlantic Ocean, the volcanic island of Iceland is an otherworldly destination for which Explore offer a number of adventure tours.

Here, mossy lava plains meet bare orange mountains, geysers and Europe's largest desert in a unique world where the local word for 'cloud' is
ský
, rotten shark meat is considered a delicacy and Ketill, meaning ‘kettle’, is a popular boys’ name.

Iceland's location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge has generated a landscape where nature is forever active with volcanoes, earthquakes and hot springs as well as offering the opportunity of a lifetime to see the
Northern Lights with an Expert Astronomer
during the dark winter months.


Discover Iceland's Unique History and Culture

Noted for its well documented history and culture, Iceland remains deeply influenced by Viking explorers and its first settler Ingólfur Arnarson who came to the country around AD 874-7.

Icelandic food, architecture, music and art nods frequently to the country's ancient ties to Norway and Denmark and visitors can revel in the retellings of the Icelandic sagas which, to this day, are still considered to be a cornerstone of the Icelandic culture.

The capital city of Reykjavik contrasts the traditional setting as a colourful cosmopolitan centre famed for its nightlife and eclectic style, making it a must-see destination on your holiday to Iceland. Our tours with Explore aren't just designed to take travellers to see the sights of Iceland, but to get to know the local people and join in with their customs for a fully immersive experience.

Taste authentic Icelandic dishes Harðfiskur (dried fish) and Graflax, get a photo opportunity at the most powerful waterfall in Europe, Dettifoss, or enjoy the breathtaking views of sunrise over the fjords or the floating icebergs broken from the Breidamerkurjokull Glacier.

Explore adventure tours to Iceland are an interesting and exciting way to discover Europe's most northern island post. With Explore, you can truly get to grips with the Icelandic way of life and see first-hand the unusual geography which makes this destination truly unique.

Explore Tours to Iceland

Many of the most popular sites to visit in Iceland are within close proximity due to the small size of the country, which is good news for those hoping to fit a number of activities into their Iceland holiday.

You can pack in visits to Iceland's main towns and cities as well as witness Iceland's natural wonders and snow dusted plains within a short time or embark on any of our
ten day group tours
to delve deep into Iceland's unusual ecology and heritage.

There's even opportunity to go beyond Iceland and explore the neighboring
Arctic Fjords of Greenland and Norway
for a captivating glimpse at some of the most isolated and untouched corners of the world.


Explore trips in Iceland

Many of Explore's Iceland tours begin in Reykjavik which, as Iceland's capital, has a reputation as one of the cleanest and greenest cities on earth. Iceland relies on geothermal energy to power everything from electricity to hot water making the country a self-sufficient haven on the edge of Europe.

For those heading out into the stretches of Iceland's glacial countryside, Explore provide comprehensive tours of The Golden Circle which is home to many of Iceland's natural wonders and old rural towns. Visitors can experience the nuances of Iceland's medieval Viking history and Nordic mythology or walk through the World War II Museum to learn more of this country's fascinating role in history .

If something more active is to your taste, our adventure filled tours to Iceland can be enjoyed at a moderate pace, whether you relaxing in volcanic thermal hot springs or riding into the mountains on a snow jeep to see Iceland's expansive landscape and wildlife from the peak of Kaldbakur Mountain.





Experience how the Icelandic population live in this eternal winter world by exploring the busy capital of Reykjavik with several of our inspiring Icelandic trips. The blend of old and new makes Reykjavik a unique and surreal destination that sees Viking folkore and mythology meet cool, cosmopolitan culture.

Despite being shrouded in almost 24 hour darkness during the winter months to becoming a city that barely sleeps during the summer, our Explore tours of Reykjavik allow you to see everything from historic sites and museums to modern galleries and exhibitions. You can also engage with the young, vibrant population who have creatively re-imagined the country's past through art, fashion and music.

Visitors travelling on a day trip to Reykjavik or spending a
Long Weekend in Iceland
can try out the famous local delicacies such as Hangikjöt, Skyr and Kjötsúpa in any of the city's popular delis and markets or enjoy fish freshly caught in one of Reykjavik's Old Harbour restaurants. Here you can also whale-watch or catch a glimpse of the iconic Snæfellsjökull Glacier which inspired the setting for Jules Verne's 'Journey To The Centre Of The Earth'.

Surrounded by an expanse of lava fields, mountains, fjords and glaciers, Reykjavik is easy to explore on foot with panoramic views of the black snow-capped mountains visible from almost any corner of the city.



Beyond the colourful corrugated iron houses and contemporary glass buildings of Reykjavik you'll find The Golden Circle where you can view Iceland's mountainous and glacial scenery for which the country is best known including the famed Golden Waterfall, Gullfoss.

Icelandic Winter Adventure
adventure tour will take you from the capital of Reykjavik straight into Iceland's diverse landscape to explore historical and geological heritage sites including Thingvellir National Park, the 3800 year old frozen Lake Myvatn and the geothermal heated natural pools which are sure to relax your muscles after a cold hike through the Arctic tundra.

Whilst travelling through the Golden Circle route you will see geology in action as tectonic plates tear apart from each other right below your feet or you can gaze up with wonder at the shifting colours of the magical Northern Lights.

On Explore's
Family Adventure Holiday
you can fly over the Reykjafoss Waterfall on an exciting zip-wire ride as well as learning how to cook a traditional Viking meal.


Best time to see Northern Lights in Iceland

The best time to see the Northern Lights is typically from October to late-March where the nights are darkest. Our Explore Northern Lights trips uses select accommodation to ensure you have the best view possible and when surrounded by freshly fallen snow, the setting feels like a real life winter wonderland.

Much of Iceland's most fascinating sites aren't just around the island but below. The Kerid crater which erupted 3000 years ago is one of Iceland's many volcanic features with lava plains, rock formations and rising spouts of steam providing a reminder of the islands sometimes volatile nature.

Iceland also has a tranquil, soothing side, providing a diverse habitat for a vast range of wildlife including horses, Arctic foxes, seals and whales.

Be captivated by the legendary 'Waterfall of the Gods' - Godafoss, which is particularly spectacular in winter thanks to its clear blue waters which partially freeze at this time of year or marvel at Vatnajokull, the largest ice cap in Europe.

Experience the thrill of watching the spouting springs of Geysir, or just lie back and relax in the world-famous Blue Lagoon, a steaming pool of opaque turquoise water that leaches health-giving minerals from the lava bed.
