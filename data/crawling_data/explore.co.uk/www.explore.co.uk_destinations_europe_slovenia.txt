Slovenia Trips



Slovenia Trips

The Republic of Slovenia has a tiny population of 2 million and only covers an area of around 20,000 square kilometres (roughly the size of Wales), but it has myriad cultural and geographical differences within its borders. With Austria to its north, Italy to its west, Croatia to the south and southeast, and Hungary to the northeast, the territory which Slovenia now occupies has been ruled by forces as diverse as the Roman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

After occupations in WWII, it became a founding member of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, until June 1991, after nearly half a century, when Slovenia became independent. The vast majority of the population are ethnic Slovenes, with small Italian and Hungarian ethnic communities.

Additional information





Over half the country is forested and roughly one third is national parks – making Slovenia fantastic for outdoor activities and opportunities are tremendous due to the different terrains and temperatures across the country. There are six areas of interest, starting with Central Slovenia, dominated by the capital, Ljubljana, with its beautiful historic centre, and towns such as picturesque Kamnik with views to the Kamniske Alps and Skofja Loka, the most splendidly preserved medieval town in Slovenia.

To the northwest of Central Slovenia is the Julian Alps region, including the country’s only island – bewitching Bled – and the town of Tolmin, gateway to the Triglav National Park, around which are some of Slovenia’s winter ski resorts. Also here is Lake Bohinj, Slovenia’s largest glacial lake, and below this area the coast and Karst region, where the town of Piran surprises with its amazing setting and Venetian-inspired architecture. Inland, in the Karst region, one of the oldest settled areas is Postojna, a modern town that gives visitors easy access to Postojna Cave and Predjama Castle. Also in this region are the phenomenal UNESCO-listed Skocjan Caves.
