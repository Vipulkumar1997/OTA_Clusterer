About Us


Meet the Team




Meet the Team


At Explore we're passionate about travel; we really do live and breathe adventure.  When we're not in the office talking about travel, the majority of us can be found out and about exploring the world.  Whether we venture out on business, researching new destinations for Explore tours or travelling in our spare time - we can't help but feed our desire to see more of the world.

We believe that our team of adventure travel experts are the best in the business. We want to share some of our passion for adventure travel with you to let you know the destinations that we have fallen in love with, and where you are likely to see us next.

If you have any questions about the places you're thinking of visiting, then don't hesitate to contact us.  If we've been there and seen it for ourselves we'll be more than happy to share our experiences and recommendations with you.  After all, if we're not actually travelling, talking about it is our next favourite thing.
