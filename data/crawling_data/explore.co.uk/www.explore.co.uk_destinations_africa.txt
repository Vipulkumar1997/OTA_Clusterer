Destinations


Africa & Madagascar Trips



Africa & Madagascar Trips

Our second-largest continent is home to some of the world's most breathtaking landscapes, extraordinary wildlife and diverse tribal cultures. The only continent that spans not just the Equator but also the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer, Africa boasts a remarkable range of climates, landscapes and wildlife habitats. From the Mediterranean north to South Africa's Cape Province in the south, the continent encompasses vast rainforests, wide savannahs, snow-capped mountain ranges and the world's hottest desert, the Sahara.

Travellers to Africa often fall in love with the continent and return again and again. For us at Explore the combination of world-class wildlife, astounding landscapes and vibrant, living cultures make it one of our favourite destinations. If your passion is wildlife you will find more to enjoy in Africa than perhaps anywhere else in the world; historians will relish exploring the ancient Egyptian and Roman monuments of the north and the early Christian sites of Ethiopia; cyclists will find exhilarating rides in Morocco and South Africa; walkers and trekkers are spoilt for choice, with the Atlas Mountains, Mount Kilimanjaro and South Africa's Drakensburg to choose from. For tropical sunshine and relaxation you could unwind on the spice island of Zanzibar or on the white sands of the Swahili Coast. There really is something to inspire everyone in Africa.

Wildlife

Cultures




Africa is probably best known for its wildlife. It is home to the Big Five (lion, leopard, elephant, buffalo and rhinoceros) as well as a host of other wildlife. Some of the world's greatest wildlife reserves, including the Serengeti, Ngorongoro, the Maasai Mara, Moremi, Chobe, the Kalahari and the Kruger, can be found in eastern and southern Africa. As if mainland Africa wasn't enough for wildlife-lovers, off the south-eastern coast lies the remarkable island of Madagascar, home to some of the planet's most unusual species. A wildlife safari in Africa is an experience second to none, whether you're observing the wildlife on foot, by four-wheel-drive or from a boat.



A rich tapestry of cultures and tribes has evolved throughout the continent: there are dozens of ethnic groups each with their own customs, traditions and language. No visit to Africa is complete without meeting its people and witnessing first-hand the extraordinary wealth of the culture, from the Berbers and Tuareg of the north to the Maasai in the east and the Zulus and San Bushmen in the south. Africa's diversity of music, dance, art, architecture, clothing, religions, traditions and beliefs is truly amazing.
