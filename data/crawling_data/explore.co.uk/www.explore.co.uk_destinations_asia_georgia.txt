Georgia Holidays & Tours

Perhaps Europe’s final bastion situated at the juncture of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, steeped in mystery and romance, myths and legends, where Jason found the Golden Fleece, Prometheus was chained to Mt Kazbegi after he stole fire from the Gods, and the fearless Amazon women tribe lived beside the Tergi (Terek) River – this is certainly a remote land you will want to delve into and explore.

From the ancient and cosmopolitan capital Tbilisi which houses a synagogue, a mosque, a Georgian basilica, an Armenian church and a Zoroastrian Fire-Worshipper’s temple all within a fifteen minute walk of each other and the relaxing sulphur bath for which it’s famous, we travel to the spiritual heart and visit what is considered the most sacred place in Georgia, the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral.
