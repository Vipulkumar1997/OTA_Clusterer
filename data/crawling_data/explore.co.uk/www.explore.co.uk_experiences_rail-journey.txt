Rail Journeys

Experience the world by rail, where the journey itself is so often as enjoyable as the destination. There’s no better way to travel than a train holiday; soaking up ever-changing landscapes as they roll past your window, sharing time with the local people, waking up each day with a new place to explore…

A rail holiday often has a romantic appeal, but in many countries it’s also surprisingly comfortable, efficient and affordable. Best of all it gives you the chance to meet and mingle with your fellow passengers, immersing yourself in local life. We generally avoid tourist trains, choosing instead the more authentic experience of travelling on the everyday trains used by local people.

Additional information





You could travel the length of India by rail, take the narrow gauge route along Spain’s rugged north coast, or experience the world’s highest railway in Tibet. For cutting age railway technology, why not ride on the Shinkansen, Japan’s ‘bullet train’, which will take you to 320 kilometres per hour? Or for a complete contrast jump aboard a narrow gauge ‘Toy Train’ in India, which hauls you up to a traditional hill station at little more than walking pace.

In Norway you can experience the phenomenal engineering of the Flam Line, the steepest standard gauge railway in Europe, and in Russia you can travel on the historic Moscow to Saint Petersburg Railway, one of the oldest and most famous routes in the world.
