Multi Activity Holidays

If your idea of a perfect holiday is one jam-packed with activity, adventure and exhilaration, with different experiences to challenge mind and body each day, then our Activity Holidays may be just right for you. Depending on the location you can enjoy thrilling activities as diverse as canoeing, kayaking, whitewater rafting, canyoning, rock climbing, hydrospeed  diving, snorkelling, surfing, windsurfing, mountain biking, horse riding, hiking and much more.

On our Activity Holidays we provide all the equipment and training for each activity, along with fully qualified guides and an experienced Explore leader to oversee the tour as a whole. You don’t need previous experience to try any of the activities, just a sense of adventure and a liking for adrenaline!
Many of our Multi Active Holidays are centre-based, where the group stays at the same accommodation throughout the trip and uses it as a base from which go out and experience all the activities the region has to offer. Others are tours which travel through a destination, enjoying the best of the activities along the way.
