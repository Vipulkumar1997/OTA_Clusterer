Botswana Holidays & Tours

Beautiful Botswana is Africa’s triumph. Not only does it deliver in terms of wildlife – spotting the ‘big five’ is pretty much assured on any safari – the country has the one of the highest rates of economic growth in the world and it’s transparent, democratic government is the envy of many Africans. It has transformed from one of the most underdeveloped nations in Africa to its most successful and stable and the main reason for this can be found underground. Botswana’s rich diamond reserves are 50% owned by the government, and the trickle down affect is palatable. Consequently, and unlike other African countries, Botswana hasn’t had the urgent need to develop tourism for the sake of revenue, meaning that low-impact, eco-tourism is high on the agenda.

History

Tailormade




Landlocked Botswana, whose landmass is roughly the same size as France, is dominated by the Kalahari Desert, a vast semi-arid expanse inhabited by the legendary Kalahari Bushmen. It is characterised by vast open savannahs and abundant wildlife - affording a once in a lifetime ‘Out of Africa’ experience. In the north, the Okavango River gushes in from neighbouring Namibia to form the Okavango Delta, the largest inland delta in the world and an unsurpassable destination for game viewing, birding watching or just taking its majestic, varied scenery.
