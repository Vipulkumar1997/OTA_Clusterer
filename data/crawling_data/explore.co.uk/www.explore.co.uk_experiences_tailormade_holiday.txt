Why travel tailor-made?




Our Explore Tailormade regional specialists have travelled extensively and are here to help to create your perfect holiday, find out more about them:

Sarah Slocomb, Regional Specialist for Latin America the Middle East
- "I have had the opportunity to travel to some fantastic places, my adventures in the Middle East and Americas being some of my favourites. A few of my most memorable experiences would be floating in the Dead Sea in Jordan, sailing at the foot of the Perito Moreno glacier in Argentina and taking the world renowned Andean Explorer train across the Andes in Peru."

Sarah Phelps, Regional Specialist for Africa
- "Nothing surpasses Africa for me. Seeing such majestic animals in their natural surroundings topped all my travel experiences. Tanzania’s world famous Serengeti has stunning scenery of endless plains and acacia trees, it has one of the largest concentrations of game on the African continent and the Big 5. However, Botswana for me offers the ultimate safari experience - exclusive, luxurious, low volume tourism. The Okavango Delta, with its numerous waterways is magnificent, I loved gliding through this beautiful region by mokoro".

Claire McCrum, Regional Specialist for Latin America
- "I have been lucky enough to travel to some incredible places in Africa, south-east Asia, Yemen, Egypt and Peru to name a few. One of my most memorable experiences was arriving in Cairo, where I met my husband, several years later we spent a five week honeymoon in Peru which included the Amazon jungle and trekking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. Nothing beats arriving at the Sun Gate at sunrise to see the Lost City for the first time. The sheer magnitude of what the Inca’s had gone through to create such an incredible place was overwhelming and reduced me to tears, something that I will never forget".

Hannah Cuss, Tailormade Product Executive
- "My first 'exotic' holiday was to Cuba, followed closely by a seven-month backpacking stint in south-east Asia. I loved Asia so much that after a short return home, I set off again for India. Since joining Explore I've been lucky enough to travel to China, Colombia, Panama, Peru, Jordan and Egypt, as well as personal holidays to Malawi, Zambia, Greece and Morocco. My favourite memory was watching green and leatherback turtles nesting on the beaches in Costa Rica – unforgettable.”

We often get asked "why should I travel on a tailor-made holiday, rather than a group trip?". The answer - for flexibility. A tailor-made itinerary is designed around you and your travelling companions as well as dates instead of being restricted to a group itinerary and set departure dates.

Here are some more frequently asked questions about our tailor-made trips:

What makes Explore Tailormade different from other bespoke holiday companies?
When Explore was founded, the ethos was to provide holidays that travelled in a responsible manner and got beneath the surface of the destination, proving that holidays could be thought provoking and good fun. The aim to deliver authentic, enriching journeys remains at the heart of every tailor-made holiday we sell.

How impartial is the advice given by your specialists?
Explore Tailormade do not own any hotels or overseas ground suppliers. So the advice you’ll receive when designing an itinerary is 100% impartial. Any properties or services that we suggest are being recommended purely on merit.

Will I be travelling on my own?
Depending on your style of tailor-made trip, you will either be accompanied by a local guide and/or driver for all or part of your journey, or have all relevant support for a self-drive itinerary – the choice is yours. Either way you'll be fully supported by our 24-hour operations team and local suppliers.

What style of accommodation can I expect?
We aim to take you beyond the normal tourist trail and know that, for many, the actual destination is more important than the accommodation itself. However, we also appreciate that in some places you may prefer comfortable, stylish or luxurious accommodation. When putting together a tailored itinerary, we will ensure that we listen to your requirements for accommodation and mix and match until we’ve got the right hotels, lodges or camps at the right price just for you.

How will I travel around?
We will always tell you which are the most appropriate modes of transport for that area and also give you the chance to travel in a variety of ways. Whether you choose to travel by road, train, boat, aeroplane or even on foot or bike, our aim is to ensure that you get the most from your travel experience, after all, getting there is part of the fun!

What is the booking process?
Simple. Take a look at our suggested itineraries online, contact us on
01252 883 184
or the
enquiry form
, we'll then contact you to discuss options. After the holiday has been tweaked to match your requirements, we'll ask for a deposit to confirm the arrangements.
