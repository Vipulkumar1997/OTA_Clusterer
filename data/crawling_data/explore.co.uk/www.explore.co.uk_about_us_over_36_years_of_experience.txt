About Us


Over 36 Years of Experience




Over 36 Years of Experience


Since launching in 1981 with only six tours in a four-page brochure, Explore have grown to establish over 600 trips in more than 130 countries; offering an array of exciting experiences and activities for the adventure of a lifetime. Our experience, knowledge and connections with local guides and hosts in all of our countries of operation means that all we're one of the most trusted travel operators in the UK; which is why many of our customers choose to travel with us time and time again.

Our adventure trips are completely unique and our passion for travel lies at the heart of every tour we operate. Explore's founding directors were inspired by their own trips through Asia, Africa and the Americas during the 1960s and '70s and were always determined to make the spirit of adventure a key aspect of the Explore ethos. Today, that passion still shines through our entire team; indeed our Managing Director, Ashley Toft was a Tour Leader with Explore for many years and still travels regularly on our trips with his family.

The variety on offer when it comes to destinations and activities is second to none with Explore as we provide the opportunity to see a country in a whole new light. We cover every interest at every corner of the globe; from walking and trekking holidays to family adventures, cycling tours, tailormade trips, polar adventures and wildlife holidays.

We are most proud of the fact that our Explore customers choose to travel with us again and again. Over 60% of all of our customers each year have travelled with us previously and 98% of them say they would travel with us again.
