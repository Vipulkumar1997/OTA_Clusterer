Self guided walking and cycling holidays in Europe with Explore

A self-guided holiday with Explore gives you flexibility and freedom to enjoy Europe at your own pace. At Explore we have carefully chosen itineraries to show case the best of the region. In Italy alone there is so much to be explored, with options from a leisurely
cycle through Puglia
and the 'heel' of Italy or enjoy good food, the sun and sea on a
walking holiday along the Amalfi Coast.


An Explore self-guided trip is really a holiday on your own terms. Whether you are travelling as a couple, alone or with friends
our range of self-guided trips
ensures maximum flexibility for your holiday. You can depart on any day of the week, get up when you want, cycle or walk at your own pace and take a break whenever and wherever you like. Immerse yourself in local life, meet local people, stop for refreshments, enjoy regional hospitality and learn about local history. Explore will take care of all of the logistics, transport your luggage and provide route notes and maps.

Explore's travel itineraries are designed with flexibility and comfort in mind. In many places we stay for two nights, giving you the option to cycle, walk or take a break and relax instead. If you have more energy it is often possible to extend the journey or take a longer, more challenging route with one of our Explore
self-guided cycling holidays
. If youâ€™d like to enjoy some more relaxing time, you can choose to add a day or two on to the beginning or end of your self-guided holiday.

Going Self-Guided

For those travelling on one of our self-guided tours, we suggest the most suitable airports or train stations to use for each trip and provide recommended latest arrival and departure times to fit with public transport options. We offer detailed information to help you reach your start hotel and leave your end hotel by public transport. Alternatively we can provide private transfers.


Finding your way

Our self-guided tours provide exactly what they promise; the opportunity to guide yourself around the destination with plenty of freedom to exlore at your leisure. We'll support you with detailed, accurate and easy-to-follow route notes and maps. They often contain choices which allow you to extend a ride or walk or go via a more challenging route if you wish. To ensure you get the most out of your stops as well, we'll provide you with useful travel tips. Our insider tips may include 'must sees' or where to find the best cappuccinos!

Accommodation

Your main luggage will be taken between hotels for you. All you need to carry is a day pack with your essentials in it like water, camera, sunscreen etc. You'll be reunited with the rest of your belongings when you reach your next accommodation.



Hotels for self-guided trips are hand-selected for their character, comfort and warm welcome. We use a wide range of accommodation from simple mountain huts to four star hotels with en-suite facilities. If you want a higher standard of hotel look out for our trips with Premium grade accommodation. In many places we stay for two nights, giving you the option to cycle or walk or take a break to go sightseeing or chill out.



Our self-guided cycling tours are a great way to see your destination. A good-quality bike suited to the route and terrain is included in our cycle holiday price. More details are provided on each trip page but generally these are hybrid touring bikes. All cycles come with a lock, puncture repair kit and a pump and many are fitted with a pannier bag to carry the items you'll need during the ride. Local support is on hand in the rare event of a problem with your bike, although you will need to be able to fix your own punctures. Electronic bikes or E-Bikes are available on some self-guided holidays, look for the E-bike available symbol.
