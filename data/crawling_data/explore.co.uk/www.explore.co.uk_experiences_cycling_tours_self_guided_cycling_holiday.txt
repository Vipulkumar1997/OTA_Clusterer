Self-Guided Cycling Holidays



Self-Guided Cycling Holidays

An alternative to group cycling tours

Self-guided cycling holidays for all levels of ability and interest
Expertly researched routes and itineraries to ensure you get the most from your visit
Included quality bike hire
Detailed route notes and destination manuals
Hotel to Hotel routes while your bags are transferred
Hand-picked, welcoming hotels with character

Whether you are a travelling as a couple, alone, or with friends our range of self-guided cycling holidays ensures maximum flexibility for your holiday. You can depart on any day of the week (which may also help you to find cheaper flights!), get up when you want, cycle or walk at your own pace making as many stops along the way as you like to immerse yourself in local life, meet local people, stop for refreshments, enjoy local hospitality and learn about local history. Our cycling itineraries are designed with flexibility and comfort in mind. In many places we stay for two nights, giving you the option to cycle, walk or take a break and relax instead. If you have more energy it is often possible to extend the journey or take a longer, more challenging route. If you’d like to enjoy some more relaxing time, you can choose to add a day or two on to the beginning or end of your cycling holiday.

Key Information




Included Bike Hire

A good quality bike suited to the route and terrain is included in the price of your cycling holiday. More details are provided for each tour on the website but generally these are hybrid or touring bikes. Each hotel has bike storage and gives a welcome to cyclists. All bikes come with a lock, puncture repair kit and a pump. Most bikes are fitted with a pannier bag to carry the items you’ll need during the ride. Local support is on hand in the rare event of a problem with your bike, although you will need to be able to fix your own punctures.

Cycle Grades and Fitness

Many of our self-guided cycle holidays are gentle and perfectly suited to first-timers or occasional cyclists. We also offer moderate grade tours with longer distance and hillier terrain if that is what you want. You can find detailed route and terrain information along with daily distance on the tour notes. For a definition of our
cycle grades please click here.

Electric Bikes

To help take the strain, we offer the option of electric bikes on certain self-guided holidays. Electric bikes (or e-bikes) assist you when it gets tough; especially on uphill sections or longer rides. This allows you to conserve your energy, and makes your experience much more enjoyable if you don’t like uphill. You can then throw yourself into the easier ascents, flat parts and descents, and the bike will recharge when you’re using your own pedal power. If you’re interested in using an electric bike, just enquire at the time of booking.



Finding your way and not getting lost

There’s no need to spend hours planning ahead of your self-guided cycling holiday with Explore. We’ll supply you with detailed, accurate and easy to follow route notes and maps, taking the worry of route finding or getting lost away from you. You will then be able to maximise your holiday enjoyment, stress free. To ensure you get the most out of your stops as well as the rides, we will provide you with useful practical information as well as ideas on the best things to do. You’ll be able to enhance your stay with our insider tips which include everything from visiting sites to where the best cappuccinos are sold.



How do I get there?

We recommend the most suitable airports or train stations for each tour and recommended latest arrival/departure times (to fit with the public transport options). We can provide private transfers and detailed information to assist you in reaching your destination by public transport; so you can decide the best travel option for your holiday according to budget and timings. Your tour notes will clearly explain how to get from the most suitable airports/train stations to the joining point and from end point to hotel. We also offer a flexible range of flying or train options.


Accommodation

Our hotels are hand-selected for their character, comfort and warm welcome. We use a wide range of 2 to 4 star accommodation types including family-run, locally owned, hotels, farmhouses, charming chateaux and guesthouses. All have ensuite facilities. If you want a higher standard of hotel and comfort we offer Premium holidays staying in 3 to 4 star accommodation.


Your luggage

We want to ensure that you get the most out of your holiday and we know there’s nothing worse than being weighed down with luggage, especially when you’re cycling. For this reason, your main luggage will be transferred from hotel to hotel while you relax and enjoy the cycling. Each day, you will just need to carry your essentials in a light bag on your bike, and you’ll be reunited with all your belongings at the end of the ride.
