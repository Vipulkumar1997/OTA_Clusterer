Travelling solo is worlds away from travelling alone
We’re offering a free single room upgrade on 22 selected trips when you book by 20 December 2017. Choose your preferred trip from a choice of exciting destinations including Jordan, Belarus, Sri Lanka and Colombia and you’ll receive a free single room upgrade.


Enter our competition to win a free single room upgrade for life! Sign up here for your chance to win.

Travelling solo is one of the best ways to immerse yourself in new cultures – but it doesn’t mean you’re travelling alone. More than half of Explore travellers start their holidays solo, but no one finishes without making new friends along the way. Join like-minded travellers on pioneering journeys around the world and share experiences together. The great thing about our trips is that there are no single supplements - everyone pays the same price. The accommodation we use is generally on a shared basis (in twin rooms), but you can choose to pay extra for a single room upgrade on almost all of our holidays.

Travel with us and you’ll get:
The security of travelling with an Explore Leader and small group of like-minded travellers
No compulsory single supplements
The chance to meet new people and make friends
Discovery, Walking, Cycling and Wildlife holidays
