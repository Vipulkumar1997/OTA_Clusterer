Our Trips


We’ve been running small group adventure holidays throughout the world since 1981. Our experience, knowledge and well established close personal contacts in all the countries in which we operate, make us one of the most trusted adventure tour operators in the UK.

We are passionate about what we do – and love to travel. The founder directors ran overland trips through Asia, Africa and the Americas in the 1960s and 70s prior to setting up the company, and were always determined that the spirit of adventure that was such an important part of those early pioneering days, should continue to play key role as part of the driving ethos of Explore.

We travel in small groups of around 14-16 people, not only does this minimise our impact on the environment but also makes for a better experience for you. All of our tours are led by an Explore Tour Leader who knows the country they are leading in like the back of their hand. They’ll be able to show you the best parts and get right off-the-beaten-track, allowing you to really get under the skin of the country you’re visiting.

In the 30 plus years that we’ve been operating, we’ve always stuck to the same key principles. These are what make our tours so unique, and what keeps our customers coming back time and time again:


The Tour Itineraries
We only offer unusual and pioneering itineraries that are meticulously planned, and allow us to get below the skin of the country or area in which we are travelling. They will always have the special ‘Explore Twist’.


It's all about travel
The travel experience must come first. We still believe that the most important element of any Explore tour is where we visit and what we see and do. Accommodation must be clean, comfortable and well located, and transport suitable for the terrain; however we are not a luxury operator and hotel facilities will not drive where we go or stay. We will probably use a 4WD rather than a luxurious air-conditioned bus.


Service
We ensure the ‘Customer Experience’ continues to drive everything we do. We are passionate about providing the very best service in the industry prior to travel and on tour.


Safety
We ensure the safety and wellbeing of our customers, staff and suppliers at all times. Safety is the over-riding factor when making any operational decision.


Responsible Travel
We travel in only a responsible and sustainable way. We ensure the local people we meet and work with along the way are well looked after and that the environment is cared for and not damaged – this includes offsetting all staff and customer flight emissions.


Tour Leaders
We continue to provide the very best Tour Leaders in the industry. A good, well trained Tour Leader can turn a good adventure holiday into a fantastic and unforgettable one.
