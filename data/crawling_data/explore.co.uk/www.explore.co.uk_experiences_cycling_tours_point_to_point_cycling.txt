Point to Point Cycling



Point to Point Cycling

These cycling holidays are specially designed so that there’s no need for other modes of transport (well, maybe a taxi to and from the airport!), giving you the freedom to get up close to your surroundings and a sense of satisfaction from having cycled the whole journey. It is also surprisingly relaxing and liberating to avoid mechanised transport for a few days.

There are a range of trips to suit all abilities. From very flat ‘Easy’ graded rides to ‘Challenging’ rides over longer distances and hillier terrain, take a look at our exciting range of trips, included self-guided and group adventures.
