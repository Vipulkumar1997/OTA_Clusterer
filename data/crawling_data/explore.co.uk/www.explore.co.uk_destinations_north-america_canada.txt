Walking and adventure holidays through Canada with Explore

An Explore holiday in Canada is an adventure into nature in its wildest state. Canada's sensational natural beauty, mountainous terrain and hundreds of miles of coastline and lakes, make this one of the best destinations in the world for outdoor pursuits such as hiking, sea kayaking, whale watching and winter sports. Explore's tours to Canada give you a wide range of options to enjoy, from active adventures in the Rocky Mountains to city exploration in Montreal and Vancouver.

Canada's main cities, Vancouver, Quebec and Toronto, are are some of the best that the country has to offer, with eclectic food scenes and relaxed locals.
Pacific Rim National Park
on Vancouver Island offers great whale watching and sea kayaking opportunities, and the ice skating, dog sledding and other winter sports activities make
family holidays in Canada
an awesome experience.

For mountain lovers, the
magnificent Rockies
are awe-inspiring peaks that protect wildlife such as bears, elk and moose, as well as being home to stunning blue lakes and huge national parks. You're guaranteed to witness spectacular scenery and breathtaking views, whether it's by taking the aerial tram to the top of Sulphur Mountain in Banff, or driving along the scenic highway of the Icefields Parkway, to Jasper National Park. Tom Wilson was the first white Canadian to see Lake Louise, in 1882, and was inspired to write, "I never, in all my explorations of these five chains of mountains throughout western Canada, saw such a matchless scene... I felt puny in body, but glorified in spirit and soul'.

If you are in search of even more solitude during your trip to Canada, the
Yukon
is a one-of-a-kind place that represents thousands of miles of sheer wilderness. The gold rush blew a short-lived trail through the area at the end of the 1800s, and left a series of eerie ghost towns that still exist as old wooden facades, covered over by trees and forest. Old clapperboard buildings are common in Whitehorse and Dawson, and the vintage railway journey across the White Pass to Skagway is one of the highlights of the Yukon region.

Hiking in Canada




Canada is the perfect place for a walking holiday - but the beauty of it is that Explore have tours that allow you to do as much or as little as you like.
Explore's walking trips in Canada
concentrate directly on the mountains and hiking, with each day involving around 8 to 17km of walking. These are the perfect tours for people who are active, and who want to properly explore the Rocky Mountains on two feet. You can trek on the Edith Cavell range and around Lake Louise, as well as passing through forests of Douglas fir and passes of over 2000m of altitude. There are still options to do some more relaxing activities, including a scenic helicopter flight over the Kananaskis Valley, or soaking in natural hot springs near Mount Sinclair.

There are many sights to see in Canada for every type of traveler.
Explore's cultural tours in Canada
are also focussed on the outdoors, with plenty of time spent among the mountains but with options to do as much or little walking as the group can manage. On a cultural tour of Canada the walks are a bit more flexible and our Explore Leaders will judge based on the group size and interests, choosing walks that fit everyone's ability.
