Holidays to Europe & Turkey



Holidays to Europe & Turkey

Many of our planet’s richest cultures and most striking landscapes are much closer to home than we realise, spread among the 50 or so independent states that make up the world’s second smallest continent: Europe.

From the windswept Atlantic coast in the west to the vast taiga forests of Russia in the east, and from the Polar tundra of the north to the Mediterranean’s sun-kissed shores, Europe’s landscapes are as varied as they are dramatic. To experience untamed nature you could explore the pristine wilderness of Iceland or the fjord-indented coastline of Norway; to enjoy gentler landscapes you could walk through the rolling hills of Tuscany or among the picturesque villages and terraced hillsides of the Amalfi Coast. Perhaps Europe’s most famous landscapes are in her highest mountain range, the Alps, where the iconic silhouettes of the Matterhorn, the Eiger and Mont Blanc are known all over the world.

Culture

Activities




Europe’s cultural heritage is second to none: the whole of western civilisation has its roots in the ancient civilisations of Greece and Rome. Throughout the continent and especially around the shores of the Mediterranean you can explore the legacy of the Greek and Roman empires, at spectacular sites such as the Acropolis in Athens or Pompeii and Herculaneum in Italy. Every era and every civilisation since then has left its mark, from the medieval cathedrals of northern Europe to the Renaissance art and architecture of Italy and Baroque cities of central Europe. You don’t need to be an expert to enjoy this wealth of culture and heritage: it makes up the fabric of most of Europe’s greatest town and city centres.



If you like to be active on holiday, Europe has it all. You can hike in the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Tatras, the Picos de Europa and a host of other mountain ranges, or you can opt for gentler walking in the hills of Andalucia, among the olive groves and vineyards of Italy, or along beautiful Mediterranean coastlines. For cyclists of every level Europe is full of opportunities: well developed networks of rural back-roads and dedicated cycle paths make it easy to cycle away from busy roads throughout the continent. Spain, Italy and France are favourites with Explore cyclists, but so also are the less well known cycle trails of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the Baltic Republics. Being rich in rivers and mountains, Europe is also ideal for multi-activity holidays, with rafting, kayaking, canyoning, climbing and many other activities widely available.
