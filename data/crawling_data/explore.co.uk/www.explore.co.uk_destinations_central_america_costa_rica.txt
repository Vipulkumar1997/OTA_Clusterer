Holidays to Costa Rica



Holidays to Costa Rica

For tropical paradise, beach life and a sense of adventure Costa Rica is hard to beat. This country may be tiny but it packs an all-natural punch. A loose line of volcanoes running the country’s length erupt and simmer, rainforests are perennially drenched, and nature loves it – singing back a triumphant chorus of celebration. A couple of Pacific peninsulas are quite similar in shape but one is dowsed in annual rains, while the other suffers periodic droughts.

In the Central Highlands, orderly lines of coffee bushes rustle in the gentle breeze while on the Caribbean a thin strip of nature reserves and newly opened beaches attract visitors with their wild beauty. From chilled-out beaches to high-adrenalin adventure activities, and all stops in between, your biggest challenge is simply choosing what to do.

Most people arrive in San José, the capital, where you can spend a couple of days sightseeing. It’s really the only place in the country with any significant cultural attractions, so if you like museums, art galleries and cerebral fodder you should stop for a day. North of San José, Arenal Volcano leaves onlookers trance-like when the glowing lava crashes down the mountainside. Nearby the world-famous cloudforests around Monteverde provide a brief insight into the magnificent diversity of the highlands.



Guanacaste to the northeast draws visitors to the volcanic landscape and bubbling mudpots of Rincon de la Vieja, the birder’s wetland paradise of Palo Verde and the Tempisque river basin, the dry forests of Santa Rosa and the cultural landscape of the sabanero – Costa Rica’s very own cowboy.

Beach lovers and surfers can pick almost any spot from the Nicoya Peninsula down to the Central Pacific coastline to find a personally tailored version of paradise with lively resorts and quiet hideaways covering all budgets and tastes.

The Caribbean divides neatly in two halves. North of Puerto Limón, the canals of Tortuguero provide a quiet moment of awe struck contemplation encountering the wildlife and vegetation of this aquatic inland waterworld, while on the coast turtles nest on the beaches as they have for millions of years.



Discover the 'pura vida' in Costa Rica, from the cloudforests of Monteverde to watching tutrles nesting on the beach. Speak to our Tailormade team and they can create your perfect
Costa Rica holiday
