Exhibition at Forum Schwyz










«Alois Carigiet. Kunst, Art, graphic & Schellen-Ursli»

The exhibition is devoted to this creative man from the Grisons and illuminates the many facets of his work in a way that will captivate adults and children alike; 04.11.2017 - 11.03.2018

Starting point is the Canton Grisons, Carigiet’s beloved mountain homeland.
Visitors delve into the rich culture of Romansh-speaking Switzerland. It is a world of children’s books, graphic art and painting, in other words, the world of Alois Carigiet. Kids and youngsters get the chance to solve riddles, stroke animal furs, and – like the original Schellen-Ursli – find out how much a cowbell really weighs. In one of the galleries we are screening the movie Schellen-Ursli of 2015 by the Swiss director and academy award winner Xavier Koller.
After its success at the National Museum Zurich the exhibition is travelling on to the Forum of Swiss History Schwyz.
