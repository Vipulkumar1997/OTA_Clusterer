Exquisite fish cuisine

The fellowship « zum Goldenen Fisch » promotes and supports the art of cooking fish in the hospitality business throughout the country. It honours restaurants and taverns with outstanding fish cookery and awards the blue panel with the golden fish signet. This award is not a decoration for life; it needs to be confirmed every year anew. 
Here you can find an overview of the honoured restaurants of Schwyz.
