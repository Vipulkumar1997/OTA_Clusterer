Tell-Pass Winter










Your ticket for enjoyment

By purchasing just one ticket, you get unrestricted travel on trains, buses, boats and aerial cableways throughout the Lake Lucerne Region – the essence of Switzerland. Choose between 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 days of unrestricted travel.

Imposing peaks, deep-blue lakes, pristine snow fields and views as far as the eye can see!
Make the most of placid, wintry Lake Lucerne and combine your day trip with a ride up Mt. Rigi on Europe's first-ever rack railway, Mt. Titlis aboard the spectacular revolving Rotair cable car or Mt. Pilatus aboard the Dragon Ride cable car.
The Tell-Pass is your passport to the length and breadth of the Lake Lucerne region!
