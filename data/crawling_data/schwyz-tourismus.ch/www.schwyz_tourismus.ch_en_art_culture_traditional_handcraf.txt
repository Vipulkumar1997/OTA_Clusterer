Traditional handcrafts









Embroidered cowbell straps



Embroidered straps for cowbells



It is worth taking note of the straps for the cowbells the next time you see a procession in Schwyz, for they are carefully handcrafted. Bells with straps involving such ornate needlework are also coveted prizes.
