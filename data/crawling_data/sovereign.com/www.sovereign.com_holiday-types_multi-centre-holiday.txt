Multi-centre holidays










When it comes to holidays, one size definitely doesn’t fit all. That’s why we’re completely flexible with ours, so you can refine and customise until you’ve got the holiday you’re dreaming of. If you don’t fancy spending the entire holiday in one place, you don’t have to. Spend a few days in the countryside before heading to a beach resort, add a week’s stay to the end of a cruise, hop between islands – the combinations are almost endless.

We’ll organise all the logistics for you, from mapping out the route, to booking planes, trains and automobiles (as well as ferries, ships and yachts), leaving you free to enjoy the build up to your holiday. To get you started, we’ve put some suggested itineraries below, but there are plenty more possibilities – just give our Trusted Advisers a call for a personalised trip.

Lewis Parker

I always recommend visiting Dubai on the way back from the Maldives rather than the way out – it’s such a haven for shopping, and Emirates offers a generous baggage allowance of 30kg in economy (which you can split into as many bags as you want). This is especially important if you are taking a seaplane transfer in the Maldives, as they have a smaller baggage allowance so you won’t be able to bring much with you. Do your shopping on the way back!

Multi-centre holidays are a great way to experience the different sides of a country. Thinking of visiting Thailand? Try combining the city of Bangkok with a relaxing beach break in Phuket – we can help you work out all the details.
