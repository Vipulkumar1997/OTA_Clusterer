Luxury Hotels in The Maldives











Home



Sovereign Holidays



Maldives











For unparalleled luxury and the full paradise island experience, our hotels in the Maldives are spot on. On the postcard-perfect island of Halaveli, Constance Halaveli Maldives provides spacious and sophisticated villas complete with private plunge pools and family-friendly mod cons. The complimentary kids' club keeps them busy with sports and arts and crafts, as well as a dedicated pool, playground and babysitting service. If you're after the perfect honeymoon hideaway, try Baros Maldives. The deluxe water villas sit right out over the ocean, and come with all the paradise island trimmings. You can dolphin-watch, island-hop, take a night dive or a sunset cruise - the choice if yours. Kurumba Maldives is a brisk speedboat ride away from the airport, so you arrive in style - and things continue that way. The hotel offers pool villas and beachfront bungalows among its tropical gardens, with a fabulous spa and ocean-facing yoga pavilion.
