Chimneys at Gaudi's Casa Mila, Barcelona








Staying in Barcelona is a must as to really get a sense of the city, you have to stay the night in it. It is one of Europe's top city break destinations and we have a fantastic range of
hotels in Barcelona
for you to choose from, with so much to see and do close by. Discover medieval romance in the Gothic quarter, awe-inspiring art nouveau architecture of Gaudi in
Sagrada Familia
and over 3,000 works of art in the
Picasso Museum
. If you only have time to do a few things in Barcelona, make sure it's these!
However, if you have more time, then make the most of your short break in Barcelona by pre-booking a sightseeing tour with us along with one of our many
Barcelona hotel and flight packages
. Stroll through the streets of Barcelona and you'll soon fall in love with this vibrant and colourful city. There is so much to see and do in Barcelona, we even put together a
Barcelona Travel Guide
to help you divide up your time in this fascinating city.

Walk down
La Rambla
in the Mediterranean sunshine, enjoy the Gothic architecture, savour the lively nightlife, relax on the golden beaches and stay in one of our many great Barcelona hotels.

Close to many of our hotels in Barcelona is shopping heaven, with a three mile shopping line from Las Ramblas, through Placa de Catalunya along Passeig de Gracia and up Avenue Diagonal.

Las Ramblas
is a whole attraction in itself, with street entertainers, artists and small independent shops. You can refuel along the way at one of the traditional pavement cafes and bistros, allowing you to enjoy some local specialities before heading off to the comfort of one of our Barcelona hotels.
A must for families visiting Barcelona, the
PortAventura
theme park is one of Europe's best - with huge roller coasters and an excellent water park, you can add tickets to your hotel booking. For any football fan, to come to Barcelona and not visit the
Nou Camp
would be sacrilege. The home of Barcelona's Tiki-Taka football, is an architectural marvel in itself, but if you are lucky enough to get tickets you can experience the passion and atmosphere first hand.
Barcelona is the perfect for a cultural getaway with a little excitement. Our hotels in Barcelona are located throughout the city and have wide range of facilities, with Hotels ranging from budget 2* accommodation to 5* luxury.
