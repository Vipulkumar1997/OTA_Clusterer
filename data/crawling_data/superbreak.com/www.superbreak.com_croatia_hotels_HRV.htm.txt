Dubrovnik Marina, Croatia











Map Key:

Zoom in further to view map keys.









Croatia is situated in Central Europe and is renowned for its diverse landscape, beautiful National Parks and mixed Continental and Mediterranean climates. Visit the capital Zagreb for ancient architecture, museums and art collections or head to Split to experience the Croatian cuisine and vibrant cultural scene.
There are several major airports in Croatia such as Dubrovnik, Zagreb and Split. All have good transport links or you can choose to add an airport transfer to your booking. There are lots of towns and cities and also coastal destinations to explore in this up-and-coming European destination.
Dubrovnik
is a coastal town in the south of Croatia. With a Mediterranean climate and historic city walls, it is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Croatia. Famous as a location in Game of Thrones, the medieval walls and narrow maze of streets make this an interesting and exciting destination.

Zagreb
by contrast has a more central European feel to it, like Prague or Budapest. Boasting several museums and galleries, churches, palaces and city squares. Football fans should pay a visit to Maksimir stadium, take a trip on the Zagreb funicular railway or even take in a show at the Croatian National Theatre.

Split
is the second largest city after Zagreb but it's location on the Adriatic gives it a more Mediterranean climate. The historic town centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and features several notable museums, galleries and theatres. The old town is based around Diocletian's Palace, a massive fortress built by the Roman emperor as a luxurious villa and military encampment.
Croatia has always been a popular tourist destination, even during the days of Communism but it still remains somewhat off the beaten track. There is plenty to do and many amazing sights to take in in this diverse and fascinating country.
