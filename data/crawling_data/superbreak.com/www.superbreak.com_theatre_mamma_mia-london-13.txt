Mamma Mia! London Theatre Show Information

Mamma Mia! is a toe-tapping tale of love set to the classic hit songs of ABBA.

About Mamma Mia!

A feel-good theatre classic, Mamma Mia! the Musical includes a host of Swedish super group, ABBA’s greatest hits, including Dancing Queen, The Winner Takes It All, SOS plus many more. The musical romantic comedy has been a West End sensation, luring in audiences for over 17 years, and as well as having received four Olivier Award nominations, the show has been seen by over 60 million people worldwide.

The Story

Sophie and her mum Donna live on the beautiful Greek island of Calicos, but with her upcoming wedding Sophie longs for the father she has never known to walk her down the aisle. The night before her wedding Sophie confesses to her friends that she has invited the three men, who she thinks could be her father, to the big day. As they all arrive to the island they last visited 20 years ago, she struggles to keep them hidden from her mother whilst trying to find clues to the identity of her real father.

History of Mamma Mia!

The show opened in the West End at the Prince Edward Theatre in 1999 and transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre in 2004 before moving to the Novello Theatre where it plays today. The show played on Broadway in 2001 and has been seen by over 60 million people worldwide. In 2008, the musical sensation was made into a film with a star-studded cast including Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Meryl Streep and Julie Walters.
