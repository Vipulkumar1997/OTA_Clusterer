Cadbury World Breaks

Cadbury World is the perfect treat for chocolate lovers of all ages, and it is full of history, interactive games, rides and of course, chocolate.

About Cadbury World

Cadbury World is located in the historic Bourneville Village on the site of the original Cadbury factory established in 1879, and it is one of Birmingham’s largest attractions. Cadbury World is a chocolate haven divided into 14 unique zones, where you can learn about the history of this iconic chocolate and watch Cadbury chocolatiers work their magic. Discover the origins of the cocoa bean in the Aztec Jungle; climb aboard your Bean Mobile for the Cadabra ride; see chocolate-making demonstrations and take a walk through time in the life sized Chocolate Street. Cadbury World has hidden chocolate surprises around every corner.

Cadbury World Highlights


Join Freddo on a 4D chocolate cinema experience where you can dive into a bowl of melted Cadbury Dairy Milk

Watch Cadbury chocolatiers demonstrate their chocolate-making skills

Stock up on all your favourite chocolatey treats at the world’s largest Cadbury shop

You can take a nostalgic walk through a life-sized Chocolate Street

Includes an exciting African Adventure Play Area for children




What Makes it Super

There is something new to see at Cadbury World throughout the seasons, and it’s a very special place at Easter and Christmas.

Snow caused many problems today 10th December but Cadbury World closed to public with ONLY a few shop staff in attendance to turn away customers with bookings.

The snow problem was widely forecast prior to Sunday.  We managed a 2 hour drive to get there - difficult but achieved - only to find Cadbury World closed with no senior staff in attendance. We had tried to telephone in advance but Cadbury's telephone system only provided electronic pre-recorded standard messages. There was nothing on their website

A total disaster for us and a dreadful inditement of management at Cadbury World. 
Forecast snow was a known problem, other unknown reasons could also force closure but there is no provision to let people know.

SHAME ON YOU MR CEO

Mid week experience lots of school parties, but we were able to circumvent most of them thanks to staff advising us to go to the 4d cinema experience first! Overall avoid experience for children ,but not particularly advisable for severely sight impaired as most attractions were visual. Still , I enjoyed it even having to describe everything to my blind husband who has enjoyed eating all the chocolate on offer!!

A little disappointed in this.  There was a large portion of the experience closed so we felt as if we had missed out.  We took two teenage children and they were distinctly underwhelmed. There are picnic areas which I would strongly recommend the use of as we had a meal in the restaurant which again was a disappointment   

We had lovely memories of a previous experience here, unfortunately this time the experience was no where near a good
