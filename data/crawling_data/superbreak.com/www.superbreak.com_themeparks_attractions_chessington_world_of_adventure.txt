We went to the festive day today, had a great time visiting Father Christmas and decorating Gruffalo biscuits although it absolutely tipped it down all day we still had a great time.

There were a few rides open which was just enough to keep the kids engaged - although in keeping with the British weather they had planned most of the activities outside, outside in December lol! 

At least we get the rainy day guarantee so can return in better weather.

we visited for the santa sleepover and access to the park was part of the hotel deal.

We visited with our two year old daughter for what should have been a festive family treat.  How wrong could I be!!

Santa and his elves were good but there were many things lacking.  Many families with little ones waiting around in the rain despite being given a time slot to meet the big man.  I know the weather can't be helped but come on Chessington an undercover waiting area wouldn't go a miss.

Poor signing, very few rides open, eateries closed, and the member of staff on the access gate from hotel who was incredibly rude.

Zoo animals were mostly in hiding. 

In fact there was so little to do we took ourselves off out of the park.

Overall I am gutted that I wasted my precious time with this place.  We will never visit again.

Booked through the website and couldnt wait for a day of festive fun. On arrival it wasnt too busy which suited us but we noticed that it wasnt particulary Chrimassy at all. A few wreaths around but other than that it seemed a normal winters day at a theme park minus hardly any rides to go on and poor sinage throughout. 
On booking we expected an Festive experience and all in all was very diappointed. Not even one Christmas song playing or the smell of mulled wine in the air. 
The kids enjoyed themselves and managed to see a few animals but not sure if this is something i would book again for a Christmas treat.

Went here with my son who wasn’t able to go on half the rides as he was like 2 cm too
Short. Very frustrating to leave him and go on rides. Rides are good and the lines are long so it’s annoying but a fast track ticket easily resolves that. Food was expensive. Went to the zoo after the rides and half the animals weren’t there. And it’s not as big as I had thought it would be. Very disappointed. Wouldn’t be going again anytime soon.
