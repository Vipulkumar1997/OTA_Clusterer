My third visit, but this time with my husband and 4 year old daughter. Previously visited as adults trip 5 years ago and ? 12 years ago. 
Generally, really great experience. Busier than I remember, getting quite stressful at times with the crowds and young children. 
Everything very well set out and put together. Rides were all a hit, more than I expected to be able to go on with a young child. 
Staff all friendly and helpful, couldn’t do enough for you. Some of the cast were hilarious, loved member at Phantom Manor. The character meets were really good, my daughter adored them all. Parade was fantastic and illuminations were phenomenal! Really breath taking. 
Crowds were an issue at times, did feel vulnerable with my daughter, struggled trying to safely stand to watch things or walk through. 
The parks were generally very clean, always people walking around cleaning and rubbish picking. The toilets were never particularly clean though. 
Lights and decorations were amazing, beautiful and you had to stop and take it all in. 
One huge issue for me is people smoking. We are a non-smoking household. I feel it’s everyone’s individual choice. However, if people choose to smoke, I do not want me or my family forced to breath in poisonous, carcinogenic fumes. There were allocated smoking areas within the park, but no one seemed to care about this. There were signs and announcements telling people, no one seemed to listen. People smoking literally everywhere. The rules are not enforced, which I find surprising. Especially considering this is a family oriented attraction. Something really does need to be done about it. 
Generally, an amazing holiday. I would like to go back, maybe when my daughter is a bit older and crowds won’t be such a problem.

What has happened to Disney???
I’ve been 18 times and this is the worst time ever. Staff are rude, look like they do not want to be there. Unhelpful and snappy. Not acting like they used to with the kids. The first time I went Disney was 10 years ago and have been nearly twice a year since. Not going to bother next year, gone completely down hill. Met another family and they were saying they had nearly just had their bag pinched and another family that said it’s awful! Hotel Cheyenne is absolutely freezing including the water! Slept with our coats over blankets. Despite no sleep the staff just don’t care. Breakfast we had to get from Disney village and my god it was awful

The Christmas Parade and Illuminations were both excellent as was Mickey & Santa lighting the Christmas Tree.
The whole Christmas and 25 year themes are great and Disney does it well.
I can’t fault the entertainment in the Park and where, but Disney, can you get a Mariachi Band playing ‘Bibbity Bobbity Boo’ outside a Mexican Cantina !!
The Big Band Show in Videopolis and the Frozen Show in Frontierland were both first class. The rides are the rides but there are changes to Pirates and Star Tours which have refreshed them for Disney regulars.
We found some staff to be a little surly and at times disinterested. One even refused to speak English and just said he didn’t understand in French, which for a menu item at a fast food Kiosk in Frontierland, is madness. Never had that before and certainly not with such attitude.
Customer Service is the bye word at Disney in the US, I really feel that France needs to step up her game as she has fallen behind, and badly.

Before starting my review I have to admit that some months ago, we visited Orlando....

I guess that makes a big difference as we always compared in our minds Paris and Orlando.

We were there on a public holiday and already from the entrance, the queues and waiting times were unimaginable long. Only 1 cashier open per queue...!!!!!!!!!!!! 

The same or even worst inside... 90' or more waiting time......!!!!!! 
We did very few rides due to extremely long waiting queues.... The problem with this park is that apart from few attractions the rest in my opinion do not worth the waiting times of 90 or more minutes....

The attractions seemed a bit out-dated and easy going...for children is perfect... For adults, it depends... If you are the kind of person who like easy going, sited back attractions, this is the place. 
If you prefer more adventurous and intense experiences probably you won't get it here... 
 
We belong to the 2nd category and we enjoyed the new attractions:
We enjoyed a lot the Star Wars Hyperspace mountain!!!! We did it with the fast pass. Which was the only one we got the whole day there... As the crowd was so much you couldn't have the chance to get even a 2nd fast pass the whole day...!!!!

We also enjoyed the Star Tours: l'aventure continue...both of them gave intense feelings. 

 Indiana Jones et le Temple du Peril was very intense as well... I have to admit that I expected something less satisfying but it was very good!

I would suggest that you close your adventure with 'it' s a small world'... Too simple... To childish... But still too magical with a song that will stay in your head for quite a long time....

The atmosphere in general is nice... A bit childish but still... It transfers you to a magical world were you can escape a bit from reality. You should also make time so you can stay in the evening-night... And watch the the fireworks...in addition, everything seems nicer with night lights and colors..... 

Everything super expensive of course... But this is the price you have to pay for these kind of attractions.......
