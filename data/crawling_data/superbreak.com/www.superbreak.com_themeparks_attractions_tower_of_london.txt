Tower of London Breaks

The Tower of London is a must-do on a cultural London break. With our Tower of London packages you can book your attraction ticket and hotel in one.

About Tower of London

Home to the Crown Jewels, the infamous Ravens and the iconic Beefeaters, the Tower of London is a must see on your short break in London. Dating back to the days of William the Conqueror, the Tower of London is brimming with a rich history. From the Royal Armouries collection, with an array of armours and weapons, to the Tower Green where Anne Boleyn was executed there is plenty to discover.

Tower of London Highlights


Find out about the most famous captives, including Guy Fawkes and Sir Thomas Moore

Discover all about the animals that used to reside at the Royal Menagerie

Learn the tale of the lost princes in the Bloody Tower

Marvel at the remarkable Crown Jewels, including crowns, orbs, swords and robes

Great choice for a family break

Booking includes hotel stay



What Makes it Super

The Beefeaters’ tour is the best way to see the Tower of London. Starting every 30 minutes from the main entrance of the Tower, the Beefeater tours are a characterful exploration into the history of the Tower, telling tales of pain, passion, treachery and torture.

We get to London with some regularity and about every 5 years we go back to the Tower.  We went last week and it excellent.  Our "Beefeater" was full of facts and every bit a perfect ambassador for the tower.  While you can see the tower without the guides, they add greatly to the experience. 

One is in awe when looking at the crown jewels.  The White building is full of history and exit thru the modern, seemingly mandatory, torture chamber now know as the gift shop. 

If you have not been to London, put this on the must see list. If you have seen before, return to see it again as it is a glimpse into both the good and the bad parts of history

It must be 40 years since I have been to the tower and was looking forward to going back.  It was a damp December day but we spent a very enjoyable three hours and could have stayed longer.  There is plenty to see and it is a large site but be warned to make the most of it there are plenty of stairs some very steep.  The Crown Jewel exhibition has been transformed since I was last there.  No longer a small crowded room but spread over several rooms and plenty of space.  Overall a great visit but I would guess some interest in history helps

I really enjoyed this visit! The Crown Jewels were so pretty! I just wish photos were allowed  pretty expensive for a family of 4 and can’t have any photos  we visited on the Veterans Day where they have a bell ringing ceremony, the 11th month, on the 11th day, at the 11 o’clock hour a two minute moment of silence was so awesome to experience! The mint was very fun for our kids and the history there is amazing!

This was my first trip to London, so the Tower of London was a must visit. I quite enjoyed myself. The Crown Jewels were quite fascinating. And as an Indian, I wanted to see the Kohinoor. Oh and don't miss the massive Star of Africa!

To be honest, I was not very impressed with the architecture of the castle. Just as I was looking around to go on a Beefeater tour, suddenly a "play" started out in the open! The history of the Tower of London was then acted out by actors dressed in medieval costumes. Tourists were divided into 4 groups, and we walked around the castle, following our "leader" and then stopping to listen to what the other "leaders" had to say. This was an amazingly fun experience! It is something that I will remember and cherish for a long time. 

If you haven't been to the Tower before, you should visit it once.
