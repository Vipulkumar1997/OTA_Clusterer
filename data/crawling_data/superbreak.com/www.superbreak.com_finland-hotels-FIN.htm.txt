Map Key:

Zoom in further to view map keys.









Finland has a refreshing combination of enchanting landscapes, sparkling lakes, majestic forests and elegant cities. Ideal for outdoor enthusiasts, Finland offers skiing in winter, hiking and leisurely cruises in summer as well as the architectural delights of the cities and design classics.
If you're flying into Finland, the main gateway is the Helsinki-Vantaa international airport. The northernmost airport is in Ivalo in Lapland, approximately 250 kilometres above the Arctic Circle. There are regular trains from Helsinki airport into the city centre with journeys taking around 30 minutes. Although Finland is a large and sparsely populated country, transport links are excellent with comprehensive and reliable rail, road, air and sea networks. You can
book a city break in historic and vibrant Helsinki
, an exciting break to
see the Northern Lights in Harriniva
or
a short break in Lapland.
With incredible scenery, outdoor activities and historic cities, there's something to suit everyone's tastes in Finland.
Short breaks in Lapland
are a great way to explore the scenic wildernesses of the northern areas of Finland. Including hearty Lappish food, husky driving, skiing and snowmobiling, there is also plenty of time to relax, enjoy a sauna and take in the incredible scenery. Remember to wrap up warm though as you are well inside the Arctic Circle!

Northern Lights
weekend breaks give you the opportunity to see the incredible natural wonder of the Aurora Borealis in remote northern Finland. Breaks include traditional Lappish fare, a trip by snowmobile into the pine forests to see the Northern Lights and a husky safari. You can even add an overnight stay in an Igloo!

Helsinki
is the capital city of Finland and is regularly voted one of the world's most liveable cities! The "Daughter of the Baltic" is located on several islands with the main city centre on the Vironniemi peninsula. A relatively young city by European standards, Helsinki nevertheless features striking neoclassical and art nouveau buildings as well as modern architecture and skyscrapers. You can explore Finnish history and culture at the National Museum of Finland, the Helsinki City Museum or the Finnish National Gallery. The 1952 Olympics really put Helsinki on the map and you can still take in sports events such as football, ice hockey or track and field meetings. There's plenty to fill up your time during your short break in the Finnish capital.
