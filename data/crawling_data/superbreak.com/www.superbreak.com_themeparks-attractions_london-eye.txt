The Coca-Cola London Eye Breaks

Now an iconic part of the London landscape, The Coca-Cola London Eye offers breathtaking views over the capital from a height of 135m.

About The Coca-Cola London Eye

Standard Ticket:
The captivating Coca-Cola London Eye has been London’s number one visitor experience for over a decade and offers stunning 360-degree views over the whole city. The Coca-Cola London Eye is located on the beautiful Southbank and elegantly rotates over the River Thames; when you enter your capsule, you’ll be whisked up to 135m above the capital on the world’s tallest cantilevered observation wheel, and you'll enjoy a 30-minute rotation of incredible views. Offering a unique perspective of London’s landmarks – including the Houses of Parliament, Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, St. Paul’s Cathedral and the Tower of London – The Coca-Cola London Eye is a must-see and fantastic fun for people of all ages, and on a clear day, you’ll be able to see up to 40km out of the city to Windsor Castle. Each of the capsules also feature Samsung interactive capsule guides, and you’ll also enjoy entry into the 4D cinema experience. Whether you just want to take in the vibrant buzz of the city from a height, enjoy a beautiful sunset or experience the city’s twinkling lights by night, it’s a wonderful attraction for the whole family to enjoy on a short break in London. With the
Fast Track Ticket
you can enjoy all of the above but enjoy bypassing the queues.

Champagne Experience:
For an extra-special trip on The Coca-Cola London Eye, you can opt for the Champagne Experience Ticket which includes priority boarding through the Fast Track entrance and a chilled glass of Pommery Brut Royal Champagne served by your personal London Eye host. Also included is a 30-minute rotation, complimentary 360° Mini Guide, entry to the 4D Cinema Experience and Samsung interactive in-capsule guides.

The Coca-Cola London Eye Highlights


Travel 135m into the air

Enjoy a 30-minute rotation with spectacular views

Sights include Big Ben, Westminster & the Tower of London

One of the capital's most iconic features

Booking includes hotel stay in London




What Makes it Super


The London Eye was initially planned to stay in the city for just 5 years, however the London attraction was so popular that it has now been standing for 16 years. The unique view over the city from the London Eye offers a whole new outlook on the capital. We even offer a Champagne Experience Flight to make your day extra special!

Takes hours to get in the capsules.
It might be faster with web booking?
View is spectacular in a open and sunny day.
Capsules are large and safe.

Ride in the london eye is  highly overpriced and unduly highly publized. Its a very ordinary dull ride with no commentary. Not recommended. River thames is also muddy and untidy.

I was a bit scared initially as I don't like heights too much, but then is quite amazing to see London from a different perspective. Recommended on a nice sunny day. The only downfall it is a bit expensive, I've got to go with a free tickets, but to be honest I would not spend all that money on it. Of course this attraction need a lot of maintenance and must be quite expensive to run... but still ..
