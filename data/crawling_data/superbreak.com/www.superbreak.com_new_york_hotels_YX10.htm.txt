Statue of Liberty, New York








New York, New York! The City that never sleeps has something for everyone. With world-famous attractions such as the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building and Central Park alongside some of the finest boutique shopping in the world. Evenings can be spent savouring ethnic cuisine at neighbourhood eateries or enjoying a Broadway show. Discover what sets New York apart from the rest.
New York's airspace is the busiest in the United States and the city is served by two international airports: John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty. There are daily flights from the UK's larger airports such as Dublin, Manchester, Edinburgh and Heathrow meaning
flying to the Big Apple is easy.
Both airports have good public transport links via the Subway and rail networks or you could take an iconic yellow cab into the city. Alternatively, add a shuttle or taxi transfer to your SuperBreak booking.
The Statue of Liberty
is the icon of New York City and a world famous monument and tourist attraction. Standing on Liberty Island in New York Bay, tourists can reach the statue by ferry from Battery Park in Manhattan. Ferries also stop at Ellis Island which, as the gateway for over 12 million immigrants to the United States now houses the National Museum of Immigration.

Broadway
is the home of musical theatre in New York and famous all over the world for its glitz and glamour. With over 40 large theatres and all kinds of plays and musicals there is something to suit all tastes. From long-running classics like Phantom of the Opera, Lion King and Chicago to newer productions like Book of Mormon, Aladdin and Kinky Boots, Broadway has it all

New York cuisine
is legendary and something you simply have to try! For breakfast, start the day with Eggs Benedict and a cup of coffee. For lunch, a slice of New York-style pizza, a hot dog or a pastrami sandwich would go down a treat. In the evening try traditional Italian American dishes like spaghetti and meatballs or pasta primavera. Alternatively, there are hundreds of restaurants specializing in national cuisines like Chinese, Mexican, Polish, Jewish, Russian, Japanese and Latin-American.
Whatever your tastes you are sure to find plenty to see and do (and eat!) in the "city that doesn't sleep". New York, New York, it's a helluva town!
