Strictly Ballroom Theatre Show Information

Coming to the West End in March 2018, a new feel-good musical based on the award-winning film!

About Strictly Ballroom

Acclaimed director Baz Luhrmann brings his smash-hit film to London's West End for the first time in March 2018. Directed and choreographed by Olivier Award winner Drew McOnie, Strictly Ballroom features all the hit songs from the film including Love Is In The Air, Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps and Time After Time alongside brand new songs created specially for the show.

The Story

Strictly Ballroom tells the inspiring story of Scott Hastings, a championship ballroom dancer who defies all the rules and follows his heart, not only to find his true calling but also his true love.

History of Strictly Ballroom

Strictly Ballroom started life as a short play staged by Luhrmann and fellow students while studying at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts in Sydney. Inspired by his own life experiences, the play was a critical success and Luhrmann was offered the chance to direct a film version in 1990. Despite it's small budget and lack of big-name stars, the film was a hit, taking over $80 million dollars at the box office making it one of the most successful Australian films of all time. The film was first adapted into a musical in 2014 with it's premiere in Sydney before moving on to Melbourne and Brisbane the following year. It made it's debut on the UK stage in Leeds in 2016 and will make it's much-anticipated West End bow in March 2018.
