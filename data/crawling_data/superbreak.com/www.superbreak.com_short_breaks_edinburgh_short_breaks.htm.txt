Short Breaks in Edinburgh

Scotland's capital is a popular destination for a short break. With its mixture of old and new the vibrant city is a hotspot for soaking up culture and history. The Scottish city holds many festivals year-round, including the popular Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August. The city's wide array of restaurants, bars and shops are another reason Edinburgh makes a great choice for a weekend or short break, and of course you can't leave Edinburgh without exploring the history of Scotland at the famous landmarks, including the iconic Edinburgh castle. What's more, Edinburgh is our UK Destination of the Month for November, so there's never been a better time to visit!

Edinburgh Short Break Top Tip

Edinburgh is a great choice for a short break year-round, but it is even more of a must-do during winter when the famous Christmas markets take place. The festive season includes interesting stalls, delicious food and a bustling atmosphere, and sets the city abuzz throughout the winter period. Whether you choose to buy tickets to see a theatre show, or deciding to walk around the city and soak up the sights, you're bound to find something happening in every corner of Edinburgh during the festive season.
