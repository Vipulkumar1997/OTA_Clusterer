Be very aware of your personnel possessions as staff will steal if you lose them. Took my 10yr old daughter to slime fest for her birthday with her new i phone and we lost both our phones on the big dipper. E mailed bpb with location  of both using trackers. Was advised only staff could access the area where they were. A few days later both phones were fully charged and in use yet they apparently haven't found them? An absolute disgrace and I am getting no response from bpb. DISGUSTED to say the least.

Valhalla is the best water ride I’ve been on, would never go pleasure beach and not go on it. 
Definitely recommend for a whole day of family fun go here.

Disgusting! May as well have a no disabled people allowed sign! 
After previously attending with my boyfriend who is in a wheelchair we booked to return for his birthday knowing full well he can get on rides (like every other theme park in the UK) as he has been on them before. Drove all the way there for the weekend, stayed in hotel, went to kiosk to buy the tickets from the lady who didn't say anything, queued at the disabled entrance to the first ride to find out he can not go on a single ride! 
Why have disabled parking, disabled entrances and disabled ride entrances if you are that ignorant - yeah ok then lets have them but so they can watch everyone else have fun! 
This is also someone who can get himself in and out of his chair unaided but because you are too selfish to have a simple evac chair he is now not allowed to enjoy himself!
Lovely bit of discrimination there Blackpool Pleasure Beach :)

Fantastic day with the children, managing to get on lots of rides, children were overwhelmed with it all also very excited, the only thing to watch out for is when buying your wristbands online you don't need to purchase park entrance tickets as well as we did, an extra £30 which I asked to see the manager about for a refund and although she appeared helpful and told me I would be refunded, I've never heard anything since now 6 months on, I personally think the site (web page) should be better explaining that when purchasing wristbands you don't need to purchase entry tickets as well, anyway something I've learnt and won't be making the same mistake.
