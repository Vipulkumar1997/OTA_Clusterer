Gibraltar








Gibraltar is situated at the southernmost tip of the Iberian peninsula where Europe meets Africa. There are magnificent panoramic views from the summit of the Rock of Gibraltar which dominates the territory as well as being home to the famous apes. Visitors are assured of breathtaking scenery, wildlife and architecture.
With
flights departing from several UK airports
and short journey times, Gibraltar is very simple to get to. The airport is located right next to the town so shuttle transfers take only a few minutes from airport to hotel.

The Rock of Gibraltar
is the territory's most famous landmark and tourist attraction. With spectacular views across the Mediterranean (you can even see Africa on a clear day) and into Spain, a visit to the Rock is an absolute must. The Rock?s nature reserve houses over 300 Barbary macaques as well as an impressive array of flowers and plants. The tunnels beneath the Rock are also well worth a visit, some date back to the 18th century and were expanded during the Second World War to form a total length of over 300 metres.

Day Trips
to Spain and Morocco are popular with visitors to Gibraltar. Take a ferry across the Strait of Gibraltar to Tangier. Take in the sights on a panoramic walking tour of the city. You will visit the Medina, a picturesque Souk and the Bazaars and Markets. For the adventurer in you why not choose the optional camel ride too? Popular trips into Spain include a Jerez Excursion, Estepona and Casares and even a coach trip to Marbella.

Grand Casemates Square
is the largest town square and the historic centre of Gibraltar. Dating back to the 12th century, the square has been continuously expanded in various distinct styles and now houses many bars, pubs and restaurants.
Check out our
Gibraltar travel guide
for some tips on how to make the most of your break in Gibraltar.
