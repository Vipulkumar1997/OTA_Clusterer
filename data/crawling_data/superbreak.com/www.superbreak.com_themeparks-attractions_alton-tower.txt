We were here for Santa's Sleepover on December 3rd, only areas open were CBeebies Land and some of Mutiny Bay. 

The park was beautifully decorated and all staff were lovely and friendly. We walked straight on to most rides. My daughter (18 months) loved the Charlie and Lola play area and the In the Night Garden boat ride. 

This visit included a visit to Santa which was done brilliantly. I was so tired (we'd returned from a week at Center Parcs the day before) and poor old Sparkey the elf tried hard to engage me but I was just too tired by that point, sorry Sparkey, maybe next year!

Went to the Sea Life Centre in Mutiny Bay and was surprised at how much there was, almost as much as a standalone SLC. Even had the ocean tunnel. 

Can't fault any of it and we had a lovely day, will definitely return.

We went on 1 ride in a matter of 3 hours, we was queuing up for smiler and it broke down, we was basically past half way in the que and the women on the intercon said it was a temporary delay, 30 minutes later still saying the same thing so we just left. If the women had said to leave the ride earlier as it was gone over an hour when they re opened it.  We pad £63 for one ride. I won’t be coming back in hurry.

Had a couple of really good rides but there didn't seem to be a lot of variety in the thrill rides, it was rollercoaster or nothing, I'm from Australia where we have The giant drop,The claw and Wipeout(Dreamworld)which are thrill rides but not just rollercoaster type rides.
Nemesis,oblivion and the smiler were good but thought a major theme park would have had more major thrill rides.
The park and overnight accommodation were nice and clean but seemed pretty expensive for what you got.
Also the park closing at 4 o clock seemed very early.

Had a fantastic day with my eldest, couldn't believe the park was really quiet on this particular day allowing us to get on many rides several times, the park is well maintained, clean and tidy with a lot to offer with regards to food and drinks, the staff were very friendly and helpful, this was an awesome day on a 2 for 1 offer, which we've done many times and because the parks so good we will continue visiting year in year out, and our next visit will be a few nights in the onsite hotel, which the children are all excited about
