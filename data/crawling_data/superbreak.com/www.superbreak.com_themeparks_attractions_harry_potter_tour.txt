About Warner Bros. Studio Tour London

The Warner Bros. Studio Tour London - The Making of Harry Potter is one of London’s most popular attractions, and is a must-see attraction for fans of the magical books and films. The tour is designed to take you on a magical, behind-the-scenes journey into the world of Harry Potter, letting you into some of the closely-guarded secrets that made Harry Potter the most successful film series of all time. The three-hour tour will transport you through original sets, including the Hogwarts Great Hall, Hagrid’s Hut, the Potions Classroom, the Gryffindor Common Room, Diagon Alley, and new Forbidden Forest exhibition.

What Makes a Harry Potter Tour Break Super

It’s a great day out for kids and big kids alike, and it’s any Harry Potter fan’s dream come true. With special exhibitions which change all year round, the Studio Tour is a great place for all ages to experience the wizarding world. You’ll also get the chance to find out how the creatures of Harry Potter were brought to life with green-screen technology and animatronics. The closely guarded secrets that made it the most successful film series of all time make this a fantastic day out for every Harry Potter fan. There’s also a large Studio Shop where you can stock up on all of your favourite magical sweets, books and other Harry Potter merchandise.

NEW FOR 2017: Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter just got even more exciting with its new Forbidden Forest expansion.

Can’t say enough about how amazing this place is, I had been waiting over 6 months since booking tickets and wasn’t disappointed.  From the moment you enter the lobby to the minute you leave it’s just magical, the whole tour is great.  Plenty of photo opportunities, interactive stuff and all the movie sets, costumes and models are just fab. The whole great hall was decked out for Xmas and it was lovely.  Spent loads on photos and merchandise but worth every penny. Even my Husband (not a massive Harry Potter fan) thought it was a great tour and loads of fun so I would recommend this to everyone.

Booked the Harry Potter studios tour months ago for my son's birthday (went a few years ago and loved it, so wanted a second visit). We could not get there because of terrible driving conditions in heavy snow. 
Extremely impressed to find that Warner Bros will give me an open ticket to rebook free of charge.

If you're looking for a magical experience I don't think you'll find it here. The displays of some of the sets are interesting but not exciting. This is definitely more of a museum sight, and if anything it diminishes the enthralling feel you will have got from the movies. It's an expensive activity for a family, having spent a good deal of money on the ticket, you'll have to pay silly prices on top for butterbeers, broomstick video etc. The shop is mostly overpriced tat. Save your money and go to the states where they do these things so well. The enchanted forest left me speechless for all the wrong reasons. So disappointing and half hearted. There were a couple of nice photo opportunities, Buckbeak for instance, but for the price? Sorry to say, this is rip off Britain. My  grown up daughter and I visited, being huge fans of the books and movies but we're both very disappointed. I didn't see many children hugely engaged either. A missed opportunity and a real pity.

Excellent time had by all including one non HP fan. Cannot fail to be wowed. 

Public transport from Euston made experience smooth & flexibility on timing access was helpful.   

Spent the average 3 hours but could have been longer if kids wanted to look at more. 

Take plenty of ££ for the gift shop!

You can easily spend 3-4 hours learning about the magical movie making of all the Harry Potter movies. Definitely take advantage of the free audio guide. Tix may be difficult to get, and if you don't find any availability on their website, I suggest checking with Evan Evans.  I was able to get tix through them that included comfortable coach transportation to/from the studio. It cost bit more than the studio tix itself, but it's definitely a viable option.
